   Journal = {Medicina nei Secoli},
   Volume = {2},

   Pages = {139-213},
   Abstract = {In recent years biotechnology has introduced into medicine new possibilities for the manipulation of forms of life, including in vitro fertilization, production of transgenic animals and use of human fetal tissues for therapeutic procedures. This has given rise to a debate on final finality of the beginning human life, which has involved scientific, philosophical, religious as well as legal issues. A report by an English governmental Commission (Warnock Committee, 1984) stated a practical term, e.g. 14 days, during which the so-called preembryo may be useful for research or therapeutics. The time has been chosen on embryological bases (i.e. appearance of nerve-type cells in the primitive streak), whereas a law is claimed to avoid discussions about the time of appearance of sensitivity of embryos. On the other side is the opinion of the Court for Blount County of Tennessee expressed in the rule Davis vs. Davis (1989). While the term preembryo is considered a false distinction between stages of differentiation of human embryos, human life is considered beginning at conception and human embryos not as property. A comparative analysis of medical and philosophical thought before the influence of Christianity shows that, for Hippocrates as well as for Aristotle, final finality of the early embryo leads to consider the human being as a person just when life is blooding. This phase occurs after the milk one or vegetative stage, which is characterized by the property of doubling life when cells are separated, the same stage considered in the rule Davis vs. Davis.},

The name "Cesarian section" was first used to designate this operation during the Renaissance period, when it was first carried out in live women. However, until the middle of XIX th century, a Cesarian remained a last chance option which was cautioned against by most obstetricians. It was only after the advent of the "surgical golden tripod" that the Cesarian was gradually rehabilitated through the work of Poro, Kherer and Sanger and the German School. In the XIXth century, segmental incision became the norm and fetal indications for a Cesarian emerged.},

Concentrating on the special roles of mothers and children, it also advances recent efforts to write a comparative Jewish-Christian social history.
Elisheva Baumgarten draws on a rich trove of primary sources to give a full portrait of medieval Jewish family life during the period of childhood from birth to the beginning of formal education at age seven. Illustrating the importance of understanding Jewish practice in the context of Christian society and recognizing the shared foundations in both societies, Baumgarten's examination of Jewish and Christian practices and attitudes is explicitly comparative. Her analysis is also wideranging, covering nearly every aspect of home life and childrearing, including pregnancy, midwifery, birth and initiation rituals, nursing, sterility, infanticide, remarriage, attitudes toward mothers and fathers, gender hierarchies, divorce, widowhood, early education, and the place of children in the home, synagogue, and community.

A richly detailed and deeply researched contribution to our understanding of the relationship between Jews and their non-Jewish neighbors, Mothers and Children provides a key analysis of the history of Jewish families in medieval Ashkenaz."},

   Abstract = {According to an obscure medieval legend, the Countess Margaret of Henneberg, a notable Dutch noblewoman, gave birth to 365 children in the year 1276. The haughty Countess had insulted a poor beggar woman carrying twins, since she believed that a pair of twins must have different fathers, and that their mother must be an adultress. She was punished by God, and gave birth to 365 minute children on Good Friday, 1276. The Countess died shortly after, together with her offspring, in the village of Loosduinen near The Hague. The Countess and her numerous brood were frequently described in historical and obstetrical works. To this day, a memorial tablet and two basins, representing those in which the 365 children were baptized, are to be seen in the church of Loosduinen.},

Delivery which was considered to be a part of magic, superstition and tradition in the past has made a progress in time and reached the modern standard. In this article, I would like to remind my young colleagues, working with all the supports of modern facilities, the pioneers of our proffession who, in spite of deprivation, earnestly tried to help and soothe pregnants suffering from labor pains. By the way, I tried to comment on the surgical interventions practiced throughout the history in the light of modern operation techniques. I also dealt with the question of which position is ideal for delivery, i.e. vertical delivery position preferred in rural areas and in the primitive societies; or horizontal delivery position preferred in the modern societies.},

   Abstract = {Weaning age of the children of the early medieval population at Wenigumstadt (Ldkr. Aschaffenburg, southern Germany, 500-700 AD) was estimated by stable nitrogen isotope analysis of bone collagen. The onset of weaning was by one year of age, when solid vegetal food subsequently replaced breast milk. In total, the change from mother's milk to solid adult food took about three years, the infants being fully weaned at this age. While the growing infant was sufficiently supported in utero and during the first months of life, the weanling's diet was insufficient for further growth and development. Starting with about 18 months of age, more and more symptoms of malnutrition are detectable on the skeletal remains, and the peak of both morbidity and mortality is reached at four years of age. Especially unspecific stress markers like Harris' lines and enamel hypoplasia clearly indicate the infants' risk of falling ill or die between three and four years of age. Malnutrition weakens the immune response, therefore the majority of inflammations detectable on the skeleton are found among the inadequately nourished children. The assumption that weaning is responsible for pathological skeletal lesions and early death in history is thus supported by archaeometry.},

   Abstract = {Ailing women languishing in their sickrooms are common subjects in seventeenth-century Dutch genre painting. Because the women in these paintings are usually young, pretty, affluent, and apparently in good health but for their listless poses and the concern shown by the physicians and maids who attend them, scholars have traditionally interpreted the scenes as moralizing sermons against illegitimate pregnancy or as satires against "quack" doctors. However, the medical context of the time suggest that these paintings actually reflect early gynecological theories, which assumed a uterine origin for all diseases of women. The details within the paintings point to the symptoms of, and attempted cures for hysteria, or furor uterinus, a female illness commonly diagnosed in the seventeenth century, but with a history as old as medicine itself.},

   Abstract = {The development of obstetrics in Croatia and the formation of unique discipline of obstetrics and gynecology in Croatia in first ten years of 20th century are presented. The midwifery is mentioned in Croatia for the first time in Dubrovnik in 14th century. The "protomedicus" from Varazdin Johan Baptist Lalangue in 1777 has published the booklet "Brevis institutio de re obstetritia". First public school of midwifery was founded in Zadar on 1820 and the second one in Zagreb in 1877. In Zadar, Ante Kuzmanic, "magister obstetritiae et chirurgiae" published a short textbook "Sixty lessons from midwifery for midwifes", thereafter in 1908 Nikola Lalich "Book for midwifes". In Zagreb, Antun Lobmayer published in 1877 "The midwifery". Gynecology was developing in the second half of 19th century as a part of surgery. On break-time from 19th to 20th century rose the unique medical profession obstetrics and gynecology. In Croatia the unique discipline established Dr Franjo Durst, since he was in 1905 installed for the first head of Royal Country Maternity Hospital in Ilica street and thereafter in 1921 for the first head and university professor of Royal University Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics in Petrova street. The evolution of gynecology and obstetrics, respective of perinatology, during last 30 years, in the Zagreb in departments of clinical hospitals "Clinical Hospital Center", "Sestre Milosrdnice", "Merkur" and "Sv. Duh" is presented.},

   Pages = {457-472},
   Abstract = {Since earliest history the person with leprosy has been shut out from society. Laws have prohibited marriage and allowed divorce of those with leprosy. Segregation of the sufferer from the rest of society has been followed by separation of the sexes, and of leprous parents from their children. With the advent of antileprotic drugs, first dapsone then multidrug therapy (MDT), infection can be treated, individuals made non-infectious, and the pool of infection in the community reduced. The clinical signs of leprosy are due not to the degree of infection but to the immunological status of the host. Hormonal changes at puberty and in pregnancy can cause variation of the host's immune status. Pregnancy in women with leprosy is a hazardous undertaking. First appearance of leprosy, reactivation of the disease and relapse in 'cured' patients is likely to occur particularly in the third trimester of pregnancy. Leprosy reactions caused by variation in cell mediated and humoral immunity are triggered off by pregnancy: type 1 reaction (reversal reaction, RR) occurs post partum, while type 2 reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) peaks in late pregnancy. Both types of reaction continue long into lactation. Neuritis with loss of both sensory and motor function is associated with relapse and reaction. Relapse, reaction and nerve damage, especially 'silent neuritis', with subsequent deformity and disability, occur not only in women on apparently effective treatment but also in those who have received MDT and have been released from treatment (RFT). To prevent disability, research is urgently needed into the mechanisms of early and late reaction and neuritis. Pregnancy is not only a trigger factor for reaction but an ideal in vivo model for research. Up to 20% of children born to mothers with leprosy may develop leprosy by puberty. While early leprosy in young children is self-healing, when marriage and childbearing take place at an early age the daughters of mothers with leprosy are likely to run the risk of experiencing the adverse effects of pregnancy on leprosy. Increased awareness and health education, as well as long term surveillance of 'cured' leprosy patients, are essential to break a potentially vicious cycle of leprosy and pregnancy. Women with cured leprosy could play an important role in screening for and detection of both early leprosy in children and late, post-MDT RFT, nerve damage in their mothers.},

She protects the patients from every side effect and complication. Saint Marina is represented in hagiography as a victor, defeating the dragon satan, holding a hammer or a cross and wearing a belt around her back in the area of kidneys. According to writers, artists and sculptors the belt is the perceivable means of Saint Marina for the miraculous recovery from and healing of kidney diseases. Therefore, kidney sufferers and pregnant women put belts upon her relics for blessing and then wore them. From the Middle Ages and Renaissance and up to the contemporary period Saint Marina (Margarita) was considered the patron saint of kidney sufferers. Justifiably she is recognized by the modern medical world as the protectress of nephrology.},

   Abstract = {In-depth historical research is made on Arabic contributions to surgery of the abdominal cavity highlighting their specific achievements in laparotomy and caesarian section. Albucasis (936-1013) in his book "Al Tasrif" produced the first authentic description ever contained in the literature on surgery of the abdomen. He described methods of bowel reduction and abdominal wall closure. Albucasis used Arabian ant- nippers for intestinal anastomosis; he was the first to sew the intestine with fine suture extracted from animal's gut. The manuscript of Shahnama or "Book of Kings" written by Ferdowsi (1560-1580) (possessed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), described the earliest caesarian section performed on Persian Rustam many centuries B.C. Edinburgh University Library has the manuscript entitled "Al-Athar Al-Baqiya An Alqurun Al-Khaliyah" by Al-Biruni (1307-1308); it revealed that section had probably been performed on living wives of Muslim Kings. Plates No. 65, 73, 81 and 82 illustrating Muslim Surgeons performing section were gathered from last two books by Brandenburg in 1982.},

   Abstract = {A short survey of the history of ergot, of the original and, for a long time, only source of ergot alkaloids, is given. Once a dreaded poison, ergot has changed its role over the centuries to become a rich treasure house of valuable pharmaceuticals. In the Middle Ages it was the cause of epidemics of ergotism, which cost tens of thousands of people their lives. Ergot was first mentioned by the German physician Lonitzer in 1582 as a remedy used by midwives for quickening childbirth. The isolation of pharmacologically useful alkaloids started in 1906 with the discovery of ergotoxine and its adrenolytic activity by Barger, Carr and Dale. In 1918, Stoll isolated ergotamine, the first chemically pure ergot alkaloid, which found widespread therapeutic use in obstetrics and internal medicine. In 1935 the specific oxytocic principle of ergot, ergonovine, was discovered simultaneously in four separate laboratories. Since then, worldwide investigations on ergot alkaloids resulted in the elucidation of their structures and total syntheses and preparation of valuable therapeutics such as Methergine, Hydergine, Dihydergot, and others.},

   Volume = {16},
   Number = {8},
   Pages = {536-540},
   Abstract = {Medieval headache treatment is largely unknown. Medieval incantations against headache enumerate bodily organs to be protected. One 8th- century Latin hymn from Lake Constance using this device is addressed to St. Aid "mechprech", who has been identified as Aed Mac Bricc, Bishop of Killare, 6th century. This Irish Saint inspired unusual legends by some rather unorthodox activities: He abducted a young girl as hostage while his inheritance was withheld, but at the same time was seen surrounded by angels. He prayed for a nun who was pregnant and made the pregnancy vanish by a miracle, and he replaced the severed heads of maids, men and horses, creating a new spring as a by-product of this operation. Already at his birth his head had hit a stone, leaving a hole in the stone which collected rainwater that cured all ailments. In our own time, such "bullaun stones" are still believed to cure headache in Ireland. According to the legends collected by Plummer and Colgan, St. Aed Mac Bricc was well known for his power to cure headaches. He relieved St. Brigid's headache when she was suffering many miles away, but his most impressive cure was in convincing a headache sufferer that the patient's headache could actually be transferred own head. The headache hymn or incantation is intended to repeat Aed's unique miracle.},

They may also touch the woman in non-physical ways, with special words, as they help a woman to give birth. Some hope also for a divine touch, as Jewish tradition teaches that God is a partner in the birth process. This paper takes a historical look at the different forms of touch used by birth attendants to ease the safe arrival of a healthy infant. We hope that this short retrospective will encourage today's birth helpers, especially doctors and midwives, to notice how they themselves touch birthing women. We hope to promote awareness of the verbal and non-verbal language of touch and to encourage the use of the art of touch among medical staff who are now more skilled than ever before in applying scientific touch to patients.},

   Abstract = {This article highlights the concept, history and development of fetal medicine. The first attempts of fetal medicine date from the stone age and have continued throughout the medieval and modern ages. Attempts to influence fetal health and pregnancy outcome at first were purely theoretical and passive, limited by ignorance, fear, and religion. With the development of the medical sciences, the role of the obstetrician became more active. Today, not only obstetricians, but many other experts in the field of antenatal care as well, deal with the great number of medical and technological advances. The limitations arising today are mainly ethical. The main question that still has not been answered is to what extent the physician is allowed to interfere with the process of fetal development and pathology, based upon real fetal and maternal benefit. In order to answer this question and to coordinate many activities by different experts in this field, an international society antitled The Fetus as a Patient was formed in 1985. Croatian experts have played a leading role in this concept.},

   Abstract = {From Feminae: "In this paper I will explore the degree to which elements of late-medieval childbirth are both revealed and concealed by the evidence available for the study of important event. The sources which have come down to us  pictorial, literary, medical  offer a privileged, but limited, access to this aspect of women's lives. On one level they suggest that the space of childbearing was solely the preserve of women; on another, they problematise the very idea of a women's space. In particular I will focus on depictions of nativities in manuscripts, on birth wares and in panel paintings. How might the context of the image and the purpose behind its production affect or influence images of childbirth and women's space? A confinement scene set in a comfortable interior where women attend the new mother, food is plentiful and the child healthy, may have served several purposes  social, dynastic, religious  for both men and women. The extent to which we are able to apply twentieth-first-century notions of 'gender' and 'viewing' to medieval representations might also depend on how secular childbearing, as well as biblical incarnations, were seen and interpreted by the medieval creators and consumers of these images.

   Number = {4},
   Pages = {357-365},
   Abstract = {Malaya, an ancient crossroads of trade, was the recipient of Chinese and Ayurvedic humoral ideas and, later, those of medieval Islam. These ideas were readily accepted by Malays, since they are highly congruent with pre-existing notions among aboriginal peoples of Malaya involving a hot-cold opposition in the material and spiritual universe and its effects upon human health. Islamic Malays have adapted these aboriginal beliefs to correspond to the Greek-Arabic humoral model in matters concerning foods, diseases, and medicines. Although Malay theories of disease causation include such concepts as soul loss and spirit attack, along with 'naturalistic' ideas such as dietary imbalance and systemic reactions to foods, all of these theories can either be reinterpreted in humoral terms, or, at least, are congruent with the basic tenets of Islamic humoral pathology. Behaviors and beliefs regarding human reproduction, however, while essentially following a humoral pattern, diverge from Islamic, as well as traditional Chinese and Indian Ayurvedic, humoral theories. Unlike any other major humoral doctrine, Malay reproductive theory (like that of non-Islamic aboriginal peoples of Malaya) equates coldness with health and fertility and heat with disease and sterility. These ideas, in turn, are related to beliefs regarding the nature of the spirit world: the destructiveness of spiritual heat and the efficacy of cooling prayer.},

STUDY DESIGN: The original Greek language Byzantine histories, chronicles and hagiographical sources were investigated. Comparisons were then made of the knowledge of obstetrics among contemporary and ancient physicians. RESULTS: The case of Eudoxia's delivery is described in various literary sources with details regarding the fatal clinical picture of the parturient after the embryo's death. The study of early and contemporary medical texts proves that in similar cases conservative treatment was preferred but embryotomy was followed in the event of failure. CONCLUSIONS: Eudoxia's labour represents a characteristic paradigm of the difficulties involved in the confrontation of complicated deliveries in mediaeval times, often resulting in the death of both the mother and embryo. The treatments follow the ancient Hippocratic, Hellenistic and Roman traditions and influence medieval European medicine, thus constituting significant roots of obstetrics.},

   Abstract = {The study reconstructs the sex ratio of 121 stillborn and neonate individuals from the early modern burial site Aegerten, Switzerland. The immature individuals, who were not baptised before death, were buried along the walls of the church. To perform a molecular sex identification, bone samples from the infants were collected from different skeletal elements. Ancient DNA (aDNA) was isolated by a combination of automated phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with silica powder. A combination of manuell Chelex extraction and purification kit was also used to perform an extraction. Finally, the aDNA extracts were amplified with a primer system that amplifies a part of the amelogenin gene located on the human sex chromosomes. The morphometrical sex determination of the children suggests a large disproportion of female individuals (about 60%). This finding was compared to PCR-based amplification results. In contrast, the results of the molecular sex identification were a high proportion of male individuals. Looking at these results, it should be noted that the high mortality of male individuals during the last months of pregnancy and during the first month after birth is in accordance with the natural sequence of death also found in recent populations.},

It concludes that even though men rarely entered the birthing chamber, their dynastic interests and social politics routinely penetrated its walls, blurring the boundary between private and public spheres, female and male space.},

   Abstract = {Review of medical and archaeological papers reveals that osteoarthritis has been common in humans and hominids since Paleolithic times. In the British Isles, there was a particularly high prevalence in remains from Romano-British and Saxon burials suggesting that, whatever genetic factors there may have been, there was an extremely high level of physical activity. The prevalence of the condition was lower in late Medieval times; and, in at least one study of subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, lower than in the current population. In early times, there was a reduction in bone density when there was a change from hunter gathering to agriculture which may have resulted from a change physical activity. Severe cases of osteoporosis have been identified from individual skeletons dated to the Bronze Age. In the Early Medieval period of Nubia there was progressive bone loss in women. Multiple pregnancy, prolonged lactation and dietary deficiency may have been factors. Though women from the 18th and 19th centuries experienced post-menopausal bone loss, this was not as severe as in the present day.},

   Abstract = {From the publisher: "The concept of maternal imagination, whereby the disordered thoughts and impressions of pregnant women are used to explain the prevalence of monstrous births, was at its height during the early modern period, albeit it with many prior and subsequent manifestations. Against a more familiar, and enduring, medieval and Renaissance context of supernatural agency at work, the device of MI was seen as a 'naturalistic' model more in keeping with the advent of Englightenment scientism. Nonetheless, the debate around it was ferocious and indicative more of a masculinist anxiety about female desire and generative power than of a concern for impartial explanation. In problematizing a simply descriptive approach to archival material, my purpose is to explore what is at stake in the competing discourses that seem alternately, and even simultaneously, to empower and degrade the place of the mother. What is the unspoken of an historical debate that prefigures our contemporary interest in feminine excess?"},

   Abstract = {From the publisher: "For early modern men and women and their medical practitioners, the experience and understanding of pregnancy was primarily uncertain. This uncertainty extended to the whole process of pregnancy-from the moment of conception to delivery, the detection and bearing of a 'true fruit` was doubtful. This 'uncertainty` was heightened by the fact that both body and language could conceal the truth. The woman herself was frequently uncertain and could be mistaken in her interpretation of the condition of her belly. This ambiguity is expressed in the vague and faltering language used to describe such experiences. Women's bodies were believed to conceal the truth more readily than their male counterparts. Equally a woman's physical narrative was more likely to be distrusted. Tensions surrounding the appropriate nature of women's 'knowledge` of such hidden 'secrets` also affected the ways in which women and their practitioners described the 'truths` of the belly. This article traces the ambiguities faced by women and their midwives/accoucheurs through three areas of pregnancy: quickening, false conceptions, and the threat of miscarriage. The much-neglected source of medical texts and observations is drawn upon, alongside letters and diaries and judicial material."},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand or explain the surprising adherence of prominent physicians throughout the centuries to terms suggesting that the womb could move and cause suffocation, choking or difficulty in swallowing. DATA SOURCES: Hippocratic writings on hysterical symptoms and the views of subsequent authors and contexts surrounding such views. DATA SYNTHESIS: Physicians who followed Hippocrates repeatedly related difficulties in breathing or choking and difficulties in swallowing to the uterus, although most recognized that the womb did not rise out of the pelvis, except partially, when enlarged by pregnancy. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were often associated with anxiety. The effects may have been attributed to the womb, because it was recognized that the womb, when enlarged, can cause difficulty in breathing. Anxiety was also reported more often in women and may have been attributed to the womb for that reason. CONCLUSION: The suffocation of the mother can be understood as anxiety with dyspnea, and globus hystericus reflects anxiety with a choking sensation or difficulty in swallowing.},

Egidio, the chapel of the great Florentine hospital of S. Maria Nuova. This article explores the presence of an unrecognized theme in the triptych, Mary's miraculous and painless delivery of Jesus, and the ways in which this would have acted as a metaphor of healing and salvation for hospital patients. Moreover, this theme can be linked to the particular circumstances of the donor family, the Portinari [Reproduced by permission of the College Art Association.]"},

She is thus able to help in Christ's work of redemption. Yet images and texts from the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries attest to another profound meaning of the Swoon. As Mary collapses, she is in labor. Images of the Swoon can be related to an antique iconography of childbirth and to birthing practice in contemporary society. As mother of the Savior and of all mankind in salvation, Mary on Calvary becomes mankind's loving protector and intercessor. [Reproduced by permission of the College Art Association.]"},

All four reported turning to pharmacologically induced abortion because their access to health care was limited by lack of insurance and resources. These cases serve as a reminder that self-induced abortion remains a significant health problem for women, a problem that emergency physicians as toxicologists should be aware of.},

After the treatment of the teratological theories in greek medicine and aristotelian natural philosophy the question of the origin of human malformation is examined in Pliny's "Historia naturalis" and Augustine's "De civitate dei". A comparison between the theories presented shows that the moral interpretation of human malformation is an inevitable consequence of the augustinian theological thinking.},

   Journal = {Vesalius: Acta Internationales Historiae Medicinae},
   Volume = {2},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {19-25},
   Abstract = {The legislation and the texts of the most important medical writers of Byzantine times have been studied with reference to abortions, the ethical aspect of this social and medico-legal problem, the theological and the scientific approach. The theoretical basis of the permanent and absolute condemnation of all kinds of abortions except those permitted for medical reasons, is greatly influenced by the spirit of Christianity. In fact, religion supported the view that the reception of the seed in the uterus and the conception of the embryo means the beginning of life and accepted that the foetus is already a living creature. All legislation of Byzantium from the earliest times also condemned abortions. Consequently, foeticide was considered equal to murder and infanticide and the result was severe punishments for all persons who participated in an abortive technique reliant on drugs or other methods. The punishments could extend to exile, confiscation of property and death. The physicians followed the tradition of Ancient Greece, incorporated in the Hippocratic Oath, representative of the ideas of previous philosophers. According to this famous document, it is forbidden them to give a woman "an abortive suppository". The Orthodox faith reinforced this attitute, protective of every human life. On the other hand, the Church and the State accepted selective abortion based on medical data, such as prevention of dangerous conditions in pregnancy or anatomical difficulties involved. In conclusion, science, church and legislation had a common attitude to matters concerning abortion and this fact reveals an effort to apply a fair policy for the rights of the embryo and the protection of human life in Byzantine society.},

Rayer's landmark contribution (1839-1841) provided evidence for renal involvement with the observation of protein in the urine of pregnant, edematous women. Lever (1843) reported finding proteinuria in eclampsia and concluded that disappearance of proteinuria after delivery of the child was evidence that eclampsia was different from Bright's disease.},

The composition of the omnibus manuscript is critically delineated in its historical context. The illustration, being isolated without any obstetrical teaching text, is judged as part of the ancient tradition of teaching by images which has no parallel north of the Alps. The different image traditions are reflected in the historical use and illustration of the midwifery chair, which can be traced back only to the beginning of the 16th century in Central Europe and on the British Isles. The importance of the magic prescription is shown by comparison within the same and other collections used in the Middle Ages and classified in the context of further traditions of magic in midwifery.},

   Abstract = {The development of medical means of inducing abortion requires a detailed knowledge of the abortion legislation. It is vital that these compounds are developed and used within the legal constraints of the country involved. In the United Kingdom, despite the Act of Union (1707), England and Scotland have not united under one legal system. In England the common law on abortion was superseded by the Offences Against the Persons Act (1861) which declared abortion illegal. This Act does not apply to Scotland where, up until 1967, common law applied. The Abortion Act of 1967 is an exemption act allowing abortion, under certain restrictions, to be legally performed. Whilst post-coital contraception is not covered by any of the abortion legislation, it is clear that contragestion and medical abortion is restricted by the current abortion legislation, hence medication will need to be taken in hospital.},

In the Talmud, the term "jose dofen" (delivered by way of the flank, or delivered through the lateral abdominal wall) is mentioned several times, referring specifically to the performance of Caesarean section. The 7th century Babylonian Talmud however has the tracts Bechoroth (Firstlings) and Chullin (About profane slaughter). The biblical background can be found in Exodus 13,2, where The Lord speaks to Moses: "Declare the first-born of man and beast to be holy to God". This Commandment is discussed at length in the Talmud, where two references to unnatural delivery are to be found. The first, how to evaluate a live, or dead, foetus that is found during the ritual slaughter of a healthy animal, or on the emergency slaughter of a fatally injured animal, that has to be cut out by incisions through the abdominal wall and the uterus (cf. Digest. XI, 8, 2 of Justinian). The second, how to evaluate a foetus that has to be delivered by embryotomy as a consequence of dystocia. It is believed that, contrary to previous opinions in the History of Veterinary Medicine, there is no evidence of the performance of Caesarean section on living animals in the Talmud.},

   Abstract = {It was not Julius Caesar who was born by Caesarean section, as generally assumed, but Scipio Cornelius Africanus, who subdued Spain 100 years before Caesar's time. In chambers with walls of porphyrite, the Byzantine empresses used to give birth to the heirs to the throne. In England, the infertility of Queen Anne, who suffered from porphyria, led to the succession of the Protestant House of Hannover following the Catholic Stuarts. Christina of Sweden, called 'queen of baroque, rebel and scholar', was born in the 'caul'. At the age of 39 years, Johanna of Pfirt, married to Albrecht the Lame, secured the continuation of the Habsburg dynasty by giving birth to Rudolf the Founder. Maria Theresia, who had 16 children, was called 'mother-in-law of Europe'. She was delivered of her first child at the age of 19. The death of her sister Maria-Anna in childbed was one of the reasons why Gerard van Swieten was called to Vienna. Elisabeth of Wurttemberg, first wife of Franz I of Austria, died, not as a consequence of. but after a forceps operation carried out by Johann Lukas Boer. In England, Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV, and her baby son died at the delivery; Sir Richard Croft, who had not used the forceps, committed suicide after this tragic incident. Being the next in succession, Victoria ascended the throne. The term 'narcose au chloroforme' (first used by James Young Simpson) was changed to 'narcose a la reine' after this method had been used at the birth of Victoria's eighth child by John Snow. It was Queen Victoria, who passed on haemophilia in European dynasties. When Marie Louise of Habsburg had her first child, Napoleon's son, the later Duke of Reichstadt, Antoine Dubois had to perform a turning of the transverse presentation and use the forceps on the head following after. The birth of Napoleon himself was a case of precipitate labour. Johann Klein, the successor of Boer, applied the forceps when Archduchess Sophie was delivered of her first child, the later Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, the first of the four 'salt princes'. The later Emperor Wilhelm II of Prussia was delivered by Eduard Arnold Martin the Elder, the obstetrician of Princess Victoria, the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria; the breech presentation became even more complicated by the raised arms of the child. Both latter monarchs had been 'asphyctic' after their birth. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was also among those who were apparently dead after their birth.},

St. Anne's and St. Joachim's assignation and kiss at the Golden Portal is a symbolic moment of St. Mary's conception. Jesus' conception has been represented in the theme of the Annunciation. The physical perception of pregnancy is experienced by St. Mary in the Visitation to Elizabeth. Several paintings, wall paintings and mosaics created in the area of today's Croatia in the period from the 6th to the 17th centuries were chosen for explicit illustration of the themes.},

The name "embryotomy" is already mentioned in the hippocratic literature. The indication and technique of this "two-tempi" operation (embryotomy or reduction of the fetus and embryulcia or extraction of the reduced foetus) were thoroughly mentioned, described and coded for the first time by Soranos of Ephesos. Soranos was also the first to mention clearly by their names the instruments used. Only the Arabic physicians, especially Albucasim, transmitted to us the first image of their collection of instruments. The author elucidates the many-- medical and ethical--aspects relating to embryotomy, which has been practised till after W.W.II.},

In the narratives, the use of birth control is mostly confined to premarital relations, although contraception by married women appears at the end of the period in a few French examples.},

Certain anatomical characteristics are suggested to explain why genital prolapse is relatively common in the White, Indian and Coloured populations in the RSA, yet so uncommon in the Black population.},

   Abstract = {Epidemics of ergotism occurred frequently in the Middle Ages. They were a source of inspiration for artists and were popularly known as 'St. Anthony's Fire', resulting in gangrene, neurological diseases and death. It was caused by eating rye bread contaminated with the fungus claviceps purpurea. In 1582 it was described that a delivery could be hastened by administering a few spurs of the secale cornutum. The dosage was, however, very inaccurate resulting in frequent uterine ruptures. The nickname of the preparation of 'pulvis ad partum' was changed to 'pulvis ad mortem'. Therefore, after 1828 the ergot alkaloids were no longer used during delivery but only as a measure to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. From 1875 onwards many derivatives of ergot alkaloids were found. Dudley and Moir isolated ergometrine in 1932. It proved to have a very specific uterotonic action. However, because of severe and unpredictable side effects and the instability of the drug, ergometrine is not the drug of choice for either the prevention or the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.},
