  abstract       = {The semantics of \emph{name-passing} calculi is often defined employing coalgebraic models over presheaf categories. This elegant theory lacks
finiteness properties, hence it is not apt to implementation. Coalgebras
over named sets, called \emph{history-dependent automata}, are better
suited for the purpose due to locality of names. A theory of behavioural
functors for named sets is still lacking: the semantics of each language
has been given in an \emph{ad-hoc} way, and algorithms were implemented
only for the $\pi$-calculus. Existence of the final coalgebra for
the $\pi$-calculus was never proved. We introduce a language of \emph{accessible} functors to specify history-dependent automata in a modular way,
leading to a clean formulation and a generalisation of previous results,
and to the proof of existence of a final coalgebra in a wide range
of cases.}

  abstract       = {The problem of defining fully abstract operational
                  models of name passing calculi has been given some
                  elegant solutions, such as coalgebras over presheaf
                  categories or over nominal sets. These formalisms
                  fail to model garbage collection of unused names,
                  hence they do not have nice properties with respects
                  to finite state algorithms. The category of named
                  sets, on the other hand, was designed for the
                  purpose of supporting efficient algorithms to handle
                  the semantics of name passing calculi. However the
                  theory was developed in a rather \emph{ad-hoc}
                  fashion (e.g. the existence of a final coalgebra was
                  only proved in the finite case). In this work we
                  introduce a name abstraction functor for named sets
                  and show that it provides a simple and effective
                  notion of garbage collection of unused names. Along
                  the way, we survey a number of needed results on the
                  category of permutation algebras, an
                  algebra-theoretic definition of nominal sets. In
                  particular we give a formalization of the adjunction
                  between abstraction and concretion, an example
                  illustrating a \emph{nominal syntax alike }handling
                  of De Bruijn indexes, and an explicit functor to
                  model the early semantics of the $\pi$-calculus in
                  nominal sets.}

                  relies on explicit modeling of the communication
                  structure of the network (communication flows), and
                  on handling sessions, even multi-party. The calculus
                  is strongly motivated by the practical needs of
                  Service-Oriented Computing, and there exists a Java
                  implementation, called JSCL, with a graphical
                  modeling framework.  To the aim of adding to SC (and
                  JSCL) a verification environment, in this work we
                  introduce the abstract semantics of SC, based on
                  bisimulation.  We show an example exploiting

                  field on its own.  Besides their practical
                  relevance, they offered an intriguing challenge,
                  since the standard operational, denotational and
                  logical methods often proved inadequate to reason
                  about these formalisms. A domain which has been
                  successfully employed for languages with asymmetric
                  communication, like the $\pi$-calculus, are presheaf
                  categories based on (injective) relabelings, such as
                  $Set^I$. Calculi with \emph{symmetric} binding, in
                  the spirit of the \emph{fusion calculus}, pose new

                  \emph{calculus of explicit fusions}, and propose to
                  model its syntax and semantics using the presheaf
                  category $Set^E$, where $E$ is the category of
