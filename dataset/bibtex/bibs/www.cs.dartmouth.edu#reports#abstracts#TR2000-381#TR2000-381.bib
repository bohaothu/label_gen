ABSTRACT:: 
Context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm in which
applications can discover and take advantage of contextual information
(such as user location, time of day, nearby people and devices, and
user activity). Since it was proposed about a decade ago, many
researchers have studied this topic and built several context-aware
applications to demonstrate the usefulness of this new
technology. Context-aware applications (or the system infrastructure
to support them), however, have never been widely available to
everyday users. In this survey of research on context-aware systems
and applications, we looked in depth at the types of context used and
models of context information, at systems that support collecting and
disseminating context, and at applications that adapt to the changing
context. Through this survey, it is clear that context-aware research
is an old but rich area for research. The difficulties and possible
solutions we outline serve as guidance for researchers hoping to make
context-aware computing a reality.
