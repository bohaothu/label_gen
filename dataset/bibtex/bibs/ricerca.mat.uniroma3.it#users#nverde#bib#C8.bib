ABSTRACT={One of the most relevant issues pertaining UWSN is to guarantee a certain
level of information survivability, even in presence of a powerful
attacker. In this paper, we provide a preliminary assessment of
epidemic-domain inspired approaches to model the information survivability
in UWSN. In particular, we show that epidemic models can be used to set up
the parameters that allow the information to survive, once estimated the
maximal compromising power of the attacker. Further, we point out that the
mere application of these models is not always the right choice. Indeed, it
comes out that these deterministic models are not enough accurate, and
{"}unlikely{"} events can cause the loss of the datum. Finally, we provide
some final comments, as well as promising research directions.}
