  abstract	= {The semantic web represents meta-data as a triple relation
		  using the RDF data model. We have developed a system to
		  process queries to RDF views of entire relational
		  databases. Optimization of queries to such views is
		  challenging because i) RDF views of entire relational
		  databases become large unions, and ii) queries to the views
		  are more general than relational database queries, making
		  no clear distinction between data and schema. As queries
		  need not be expressed in terms of a schema, it becomes
		  critical to optimize not only data access time but also the
		  time to perform the query optimization itself. We have
		  developed novel query optimization techniques for scalable
		  queries to RDF views of relational databases. Our
		  optimization techniques are based on partial evaluation, a
		  method for compile time evaluation of subexpressions. We
		  show dramatic improvements in query optimization time when
		  scaling the query size while still producing high quality
		  execution plans. Our query optimization techniques enable
		  execution of real-world queries to RDF views of relational
		  databases.}
