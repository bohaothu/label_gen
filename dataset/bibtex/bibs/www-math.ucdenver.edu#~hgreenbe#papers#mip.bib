            of certain constraints: (i) some cities must be outer nodes, and
            (ii) some pairs of cities must have a direct connection.  (The
            constraints in (ii) could require the communication network to have
            a cycle, so there is a tacit assumption that this is not the case.)
            The cost between a pair of cities ($i,j$) is the product of the 
            communication requirement, $r_{ij}$, and the length of the path 
            connecting them.  
            Sensitivity analysis is performed on one communication requirement. 
            There is a finite set of ``critical values,'' 
            $0 < r^1_{ij} < \dots < r^p_{ij}$, which are the breakpoints of the
            optimal value function.
            Starting at $r_{ij}=0$, a labeling algorithm based on the earlier work 
            of Gomory and Hu is used to generate the sequence $\{r^k_{ij}\}$,

            The first few chapters review such properties of mathematical programs
            in general, and the extensions to allow integer variables begin with
            Chapter 5, which considers proximity of integer solutions to non-integer
            ones.  Following the authors' notation, let $M$ denote a convex subset
            of $\LR^n$, and $M_s\defeq \{x\in M\st x_1,\dots,x_s \mbox{ integer}\}$.
            Then, $M_s$ is defined to be {\it uniformly distributed} if 
            $\sup_{x\in M}\{d(x,M_s)\} < \infty$, 
            and they prove this is equivalent to: $M_s$ contains an affine basis of $M$.
            They also prove $M_s$ is uniformly distributed if
            $$
              M_s = \{x\in\LR^n\st x = v + y \mbox{ for some }v\in V,\, ||y|| < \varepsilon\},
            $$
            where $V$ is a convex cone and $\varepsilon > 0$.
\vspace{.15in}\\
            Chapter 6 first considers a quadratic objective function, where only the 
            linear part is perturbed.  In particular, they prove $f^*$ is continuous for
            $$
             f^*(p) = \inf\{x^tQx + px\st Ax \ge b,\, x_1,\dots,x_s \mbox{integer}\},
            $$
            where $Q$ need not be positive semi-definite.  The second half of the 
            chapter is about convex polynomials, and again only the linear term is 
            perturbed.  The authors prove (among other things) that the optimal value is 
            a lower semi-continuous function of the objective coefficients ($p$).
\vspace{.15in}\\
            Chapter 7 considers existence of optimal solutions with concave minimands,
            and Chapter 8 is about Lipschitz stability.
            Chapter 10, entitled ``On Relations between Parametric Optimization, 
            Solution Concepts and Subadditive Duality for Integer Optimization,''
            uses a penalty function approach, bridging some of the perturbation
            theory that was developed before the mid-1970's.  The more recent advent 
            of the subadditive dual enters the development in the form of response 
            function theory.

            (which the authors point out is equivalent to the maximum weighted 
            independent set problem), and the second is a dominating set problem.
            In each case the graph is presumed to be a tree, and the weights are

            optimal value function is piece-wise linear with a finite number of
            breakpoints.  Since the number of solutions (e.g., the number of
            vertex covers) is finite, each interval has an optimal vertex cover,
            and there is a value of $\theta$, denoted $t_\infty$, where the
            same solution is optimal for all $\theta \ge t_\infty$.  This is
            called the ``steady state solution,'' denoted $x^\infty$.

            literature.  The author first develops postoptimal sensitivity 
            results for an extension of matroid optimization, which interleaves 
            two ordered sets.  
            Let $M$ be a matroid with element set $E$ partitioned into two sets,
            $R$ and $W$ (think of ``red'' and ``white'' elements). Given an ordering
            that preserves the orderings in $R$ and $W$, let $B_q(R,W)$ denote a minimum
            weight base containing $q$ elements of $R$.  The {\it Matroid Selection 
            Problem} is to find $B_q(R,W)$ for all feasible $q$.  Using GLM, 
            a multiplier ($\lambda$) is added to the weights of $R$.  As $\lambda$ is
            varied, the imputed value of the number of elements of $R$ solves the
            matroid selection problem for the associated $q$.  (Note that adding the
            same $\lambda$ to all weights of $R$ preserves the order.)
         \\
            The author then focuses on algorithms for the one-parameter objective case:
            $$
              z^*(\theta) = \inf\{(c + \theta\delta c)x\st x\in X\},
            $$
            where $X$ is generally considered a finite set 
            (for combinatorial optimization).  The parametric program is to find
            the breakpoints of $z^*$ for some range of $\theta$.  The subsequent 
            chapter deals with bounding the number of breakpoints.  Stemming from
            the approach in~\cite{Megiddo:Combinatorial}, this presents another method.
            For the min spanning tree problem with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, the author 
            proves that the number of breakpoints is not greater than
            $2m\min\left\{\sqrt{n},\sqrt{m-n}\right\}$.  
            He then returns to the matroid selection problem, showing that this
            main theorem yields the upper bound: 
            $m\min\left\{\sqrt{\r(M)},\sqrt{\r(M_d)}\right\}$, where $\r(M)$ is the 
            rank of the matroid and $\r(M_d)$ is the rank of its dual.  
            This chapter contains some additional results plus examples, including some 
            analysis of the shortest path problem, where the author brings GLM to the 
            forefront.
            The last chapter is about multi-terminal network flow synthesis, for a 
            weighted undirected graph, $R$, with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.  
            The author states his main results:
            \vspace{.1in} \\
               ``We give simple algorithms which run in time $\max\{m,n\log n\}$, and
               which construct from $R$ the network $G^*$ with the following desirable
               properties:
               \begin{enumerate}
                  \item $G^*$ is uniformly optimal for $R$.
                  \item $G^*$ is planar.
                  \item No node in $G^*$ has degree greater than four.
                  \item $G^*$ has as few edges as any uniformly optimal network produced by
                        the Gomory-Hu method.
                  \item The structure of $G^*$ is easily expressed in terms of $R$.
                  \item Routing decisions in $G^*$ can be made locally at each node. This
                        is a very desirable property for communications and computer network
                        applications and hierarchical database applications.
               \end{enumerate}
               Further, the algorithm shows that the use of the maximum spanning tree,
               and the revising of the original requirements by the Gomory-Hu method is
               unnecessary and undesirable.''

            Using the image processing technique introduced in 
           ~\cite{Jones:Sensitivity}, this designs experiments with carefully 
            chosen algorithms and problems.  
            The algorithms chosen to obtain optimal solutions are a 
            branch-and-bound code and a cutting plane method, plus more than 30 
            heuristics were included in the study.  
            In some cases, the code used was by the author; in other cases they 
            were published by others.
            For the statistical inference, the author generated hundreds of problems,
            for 10, 20 and 50 cities, using a uniform distribution on coordinate
            locations.
            In addition, the author executed the algorithms and heuristics on the 
            classical 49 city problem (48 contiguous U.S. state capitals plus 
            Washington, D.C.), and on a 6-city problem to demonstrate that the
            regions can have holes.
            Statistical tests were used to draw the following conclusions:
            \begin{enumerate}
              \item In most cases, the optimal solution was more stable than
                    the heuristics.  One exception is a variant of the
                    nearest neighbor; and, the space-filling heuristic was more 
                    stable for only two of the four measures of stability.
              \item Changing a heuristic, such as adding 2-Opt or 3-Opt
                    post-processing, can sometimes yield more stable solutions.
              \item The image processing technique used can study other
                    problem domains that can be mapped into the plane.  For
                    example, a knapsack problem has two data elements for
                    each item: size (a) and benefit (b).  Then, one could
                    map (a,~b) into the plane and ask about the stability
                    with respect to these parameters.

            {\it piece} is a maximal connected subregion.  Regions can be
            disconnected, and they are unions of their pieces.  The author
            defines four measures of stability:
        \begin{description}
           \item [Number of Regions]:  The more regions for a given area, 
               the greater the chance the tour will change as a city is moved.
           \item [Number of Pieces]:  A connected stability region is more 
               stable than one composed of disconnected pieces.
           \item [Number of ``Sharp Corners'']: Measured by polygonal 
               approximation to each piece.  A square or circle is more stable 
               than an odd-shaped polygon.
           \item [Degree of Gerrymandering]: This is measured by 
               $G=\Bigfrac{^{P_R^2}}{_{4\pi A_r}}$, where $P_R$ is the perimeter 
               of the region, and $A_R$ is the area of the piece.  The minimum value
               of $G$ is 1, which is for a circle.

          \begin{description}

           \item [Speeding up machines in  a two machine flow shop.] 
              This studies the minimum makespan on two machines as a function 
              of speedup factors. The value function is piece-wise linear,
              but not convex. The author gives bounds on the number of
              breakpoints and on their location.

           \item [Sensitivity analysis of the economic lot-sizing problem.] 
              This pertains to the classical MILP model, with binary variables 
              used to determine whether a setup occurs in each period.  The 
              solution is obtained with DP, and sensitivity analysis is concerned 
              with changing production, holding and setup costs.  The author 
              uses the optimality of the partial path up to where the costs change,
              similar to what was done in~\cite{Greenberg:Branching}.

           \item [Sensitivity analysis of list scheduling heuristics.] 
              This is concerned with how the quality of a heuristic solution is
              affected by changes in data. The particular (NP-hard) problem is 
              the minimization of makespan on parallel identical machines.  The 
              heuristics are the {\it Shortest Processing Time} (SPT) and 
              {\it Longest Processing Time} (LPT) rules.  The solution depends 
              upon an ordering of the processing times, and the author considers
              changing this for one job.  This defines a response function that
              equals the heuristic makespan value as a function of one job's 
              processing time.  The heuristic response functions are shown to be
              piece-wise linear. It is further shown that the slopes and breakpoint 
              values of SPT can be computed in polynomial time, but there can be an 
              exponential number of breakpoints for the LPT rule.

            $\theta\delta b$ has no integer coordinate.  This set can be reduced,
            however, since the l.c.m. condition is necessary, but not sufficient.

            has no integer coordinate, and $\frac{1}{100}$ is the least positive
            value of $\theta$ for which $\theta\delta b$ has an integer coordinate.
            (The l.c.m. condition is sharp; for example, if 
            $\delta b$ = {\scriptsize${\left(\begin{array}{c}
                     \!\! 100\\ \!\! 25\end{array}\!\!\right)

                 $\Delta c\,x^* = 0$, $x^*$ remains optimal.

             \item If a new activity is introduced with objective coefficient
                 $c_{n+1}$ and matrix column $A_{n+1}$, $(x^*,0)$ is primal feasible, 
                 and it is optimal if $F^*(A_{n+1}) \le c_{n+1}$.
