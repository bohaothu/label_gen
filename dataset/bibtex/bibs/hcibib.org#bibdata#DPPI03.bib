%X Office chair designers have traditionally focused their design efforts on
optimizing the so-called 'ergonomic fit.' Although the effort to design chairs
that support physical comfort is commendable, the focus on ergonomics neglects
the possible impact of emotional responses on the general experience of
comfort. The general experience of comfort experienced when using a chair is
not only influenced by the ergonomic fit but also by the 'emotional fit,' i.e.
an emotional response that is desired by the user. In this paper, a study is
reported that was designed to measure emotional responses evoked by office
chair appearance. The study was part of a bigger project concerning attractive
and comfortable office chairs. The emotional responses evoked by 15 chairs were
measured with the Emocard method, a non-verbal self-report instrument. Some
differences were found in the results obtained with the Emocards and those
obtained with a standard verbal evaluation method. Although discriminative to
some extent, the non-verbal method was found to be less discriminative than the
verbal method. In the discussion section, some recommendations for the
development of the Emocard method are reported. It is discussed that, given
these feasible recommendations, the Emocard method can be a useful tool for
office chair designers that want to 'design for an emotional fit'.

%X In this paper, we propose a framework for understanding how product shapes
evoke affective responses. For a set of representative product shapes, we first
conduct a survey to evaluate the affective characteristics of each product
shape. We then compute a spatial configuration that summarizes the affective
responses toward the set of shapes, by applying perceptual mapping techniques
to the survey data. A series of new product shapes that smoothly interpolate
among product shapes are then generated by using image morphing techniques.
With data from a followup survey, we inserted the new shapes into the spatial
configuration. The trajectory or distribution of the interpolated shapes
provides visualization of how affective characteristics change in response to
varying shapes. We found the relationship between the shapes and the affective
characteristic to be nonlinear and non-uniform.

%X Nonadherence with medical regimens is a life-threatening problem. This paper
discusses how designing positive user experiences can lead to increased patient
adherence to medical regimens.
   The importance of positive affect in relationship to medical adherence is
well documented within the discipline of Health Psychology. Therefore, when
designers are called on to positively shape a user's experience with
technology-based medical devices, principles from this body of knowledge can
provide a framework for designing products that increase the user's adherence
to medical recommendations. From the Health Psychology discipline, Howard
Leventhal's Dual Process Model provides a framework for understanding a
patient's cognitive and emotional responses to medical advice. From the Design
discipline Patrick Jordan's definition of product pleasure contains practical
and emotional components. Parallels of these two approaches are discussed as
examples of links between the Health Psychology and Design disciplines.
Considering these commonalities in approach can help product designers create
medical tools that lead to greater adherence.

%X In this paper an approach to emotion-driven design is introduced and
demonstrated with a children's wheelchair design case. First, emotional
responses towards existing wheelchairs have been assessed with a non-verbal
self-report instrument. The results of this assessment were transformed to
starting points for a new design with the use of a theoretical model of product
emotions. With these starting points a new design was created and detailed into
a working prototype. In a second study, the emotional impact of the new design
was evaluated. It was found that, with respect to the emotional impact, this
new design differentiates in a positive way from existing models. In the light
of these findings, it is discussed how theoretical and empirical knowledge can
assist designers in their attempts to manipulate the emotional impact of their
designs.

commercial culture. Although culturally complex, its current ubiquity and
'ordinariness' make it particularly significant to be used as a model for
inquiry into affective qualities in relation to the design of products in
general. At the time of writing the project is at the planning stage, but first

designers articulating and interpreting user needs as part of the product
creation process. This paper explores approaches to enable users to adapt,
modify, specify or create products to match their needs directly. Using the
potential of new technologies, active consumers can now become product
creators, paralleling developments in graphics, music and digital media
production. Empowered users, self-builders, recreational manufacturers,
web-connected silver surfers (retired individuals using the web) and punk
manufacturers [1] all exemplify this new relationship between users and
products, and the evolving role of designers [2].

creative inspiration. This research borrows the view of C. G. Jung in
analytical psychology, and Northrop Frye in literary criticism to classify the
concept of archetype and practices in design. Besides building up the
collection of archetypal designs, it initially divides them into three groups-
'reconstructive archetypes', 'borrowing archetypes' and 'breaking archetypes'.
The learning was then applied to education in order to guide student projects,
and their outcomes certainly achieved joyful effects and entertained users in

specific antecedent variables-computer experience and capability-which are
hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of users' emotional response to IT
products usage. Adding four more variables-such as attitude, belief, end user
satisfaction and impact-test the parsimony of the model further. The research
data were derived from a questionnaire survey circulated to 618 people in the

rhetorical purpose. (e.g. persuading them to make a positive change in a

been popular examples of products that use emotive aesthetics to promote
positive social change. However, there's a problem today with the lack of time
graphic designers have to devote their skills to the continued development of
polemical products. A solution lies in broadening the scope of graphic design
into a research discipline by demystifying the graphic design process with a
methodological view of its components.

natural interaction between the home and its inhabitants through speech. An
embodied home character is necessary to ensure a natural dialogue by
continuously providing intuitive feedback in the form of conversational and
emotional body language. This study experimentally investigates the influence
of the character's embodiment (screen character and robotic character) and its
emotional expressiveness on the enjoyability of the interaction. The presence
of emotional expressions significantly increased the enjoyability of the
interaction with the robotic character. The embodiment had no significant
influence on the enjoyability. However, in the robotic character condition a
social facilitation effect and a high forgiveness for speech recognition errors
was observed.

%X When Hans Christian Andersen wrote 'The Little Match Girl' [1] he was not
writing a product endorsement. Far from it. But we have been left with a
glowing example of a product that was affective. The experience may have been
fleeting, but the euphoric pleasure experienced by the girl was real. As we
explore the notion of pleasure in the designed object we must not forget how
much pleasure is context-driven. As designers, we must understand that context
is not always in our control; that our designs, like our children, will live
their own lives. Pleasure is found when the moment is right, when events align.
   This happens despite our planning and skill, or our analysis and rigour. The
message of this paper, wrapped in the style of an Andersen story, looks at the
relationship between two objects. One is desired, enjoyed, treasured, and the
other an ordinary matchbox. Unwrap at your pleasure.

greater understanding of their interrelationships on the part of designers and

research models and design methods. Shortcomings in the way that products are
time-proofed are identified and it is proposed that 'pleasure-over-time' should
be extended to parallel and assist in extending the life of products, which
should result in more affective design. The primary purpose being to reduce the
environmentally destructive effect brought about by the short
pleasure/dissatisfaction cycles associated with contemporary, unsustainable
patterns of consumption.

to take centre stage as firms try to gain competitive advantage through the
establishment of strong product demand. While the result of this is very
visible, it is important to realise that the application of pleasurable
products actually contributes more significantly to a firm's competitive
advantage when introduced to the work environment. This is due to improved
performance which in turn leads to the development of intellectual products of
higher quality, hence sustaining the established competitive advantage.

the customer experience to stakeholders and helped them empathize with
customers; and 3) relied on the personas and narratives to develop design

products and what kind of role they have in the social interaction. The
starting point for the method development is scenario building. Design
scenarios make the context understandable and they can be used as a
communication tool during the product development process.

emotional experience. Some success has been achieved by using the Kansei
engineering approach but this has not been explicitly applied to packaging
design.
   This paper reports on the first stages of an Affective Packaging Design
research programme and presents the result of experiments that explore the
relationships between consumer selection and packaging shape using a
combination of questionnaires, focus groups and the semantic differential
technique. The stimuli for the experiment were examples of confectionery
packaging.
   Results will be presented which indicate relationships between confectionery
packaging shape and recipient demographic profile. It is concluded that to
inform the design process the study it is important to consider the whole
purchase experience, for example, product purchaser, product user and purchase
reasons.

%X This poster discusses the advent of emotional/affective interfaces and key
areas of late modernity, and it proposes that there could be said to exist some
parallels between the development of computer interface design and the
development of society as a whole. The poster suggests that research into
social and cultural aspects of design may be conducive to understanding the
user in a contemporary societal setting. Consequently, the poster explores why
and how theories of modernity matter in understanding the practice of designing
affective interfaces.

%X The employment of the design methods of characters and scenarios in the
conceptual design of a gearshift system for future automobiles is presented.
The main objective for the project was to provide design suggestions for a
gearshift system that people will appreciate in future cars in view of market
trends, technology developments and environmental demands. The methods were
tested for concept evaluation at a Swedish car component manufacturer. The
methods gave rough, but important, indications of possible appreciation and
acceptance of design proposals, and assisted consideration of user diversity.
This low-cost approach is sufficient for evaluation purposes at early design
stages, but may be complemented with more thorough studies if time and money
permits.

%X There is a general growing emphasis on aesthetics in the human-computer
interaction field (HCI). I suggest Antonio Damasio's Somatic Marker Hypothesis
to be taken as a starting point when we consider how pleasant interfaces do get
users to use a service. Damasio describes an automated mechanism where previous
experiences leave marks about choices we have made, and how these marks affect
our decision-making. I also suggest applying Richard Shusterman's concept of
Somaesthetics in the discussions about aesthetic experiences. I suggest that
these two disciplines could be included in the further work on aesthetics in
the human-computer interactions area.

%X This paper reports a study on the relation between the informational content
of an artificially built environment and the emotional response to this
environment. It presents the hypothesis that human response to a visual scene
is influenced by the information of the scene and there is a uniform
relationship between informational load of an architectural scene and the
affective response. The paper defines an estimation function for entropy in a
visual scene, then describes an experiment in which observers were asked to
indicate their affective response to a computer generated renderings of an
architectural interior, manipulated to have varying information on content by
addition of textures and furnishing. The computer measured informational load
was compared with the subjective evaluations of the respondents, for important
interior characteristics like comfort, relaxation and attractiveness. The paper
presents proofs that the measurement of the informational load of the scene is
a unique characteristic of the given architectural interior.

%X This poster is the first part of a research project about the lack of
usability in products with a strong aesthetic appeal. The hypothesis of this
research is that products -- Icons, influenced by marketing and admired by
consumers for aesthetic priority, have a disabled usability because of the
absence of ergonomics approach during the design phase. Here, a short history
about the arise of industrial aesthetic is presented, together with a study
about product's pleasurability. This research begins with a case study about
the lemon squeezer JUICY SALIF, a design icon considered product. Usability
tests were applied and analyzed, as questionnaires and comments suggested by
admirers through an internet forum.

%X Research is being carried out at the University of Leeds in collaboration
with the Faraday Packaging Partnership that aims to enhance consumers'
enjoyment of products by carefully designing the surfaces and textures of the
packaging. The aim of the research reported in the poster is to develop a
service for the members of the Faraday Packaging Partnership that could inform
them of the physical characteristics of the surfaces of their packaging that
would enhance the consumers' emotional engagement with their product. The
methodology is to characterize the surface textures of the packaging of
personal care products and to correlate properties of the surfaces to the
emotions evoked from consumers recorded through the use of focus groups and the
semantic differential technique. Initial results give us confidence that the
semiotic techniques give consistent and valid results for the tactile domain.

%X In this paper, the influence of the aesthetic properties of products on
inducing the feeling of product pleasure on consumers is investigated. In the
context of this study, aesthetic properties are considered as a synonym for
visual aspects of the products. It is essential to solicit the perspective of a
consumer, as different perspectives lead to different perceptions of the same
product. The perception about a product is the determining factor for the
emotions evoked in the consumer, which will evidently affect the extent of the
pleasure. Semantic Differential (SD) method is used in order to examine the
evaluation of table-clock samples with dissimilar aesthetic properties. In the
SD questionnaire, 14 image-word pairs are employed for the evaluation of 8
table-clock designs, which are presented to 40 subjects. The results indicate
that the property 'form' is utterly effective in consumers' perception. The
effects of the other aesthetic properties are discussed as well as the
classification of the products with respect to the adjectives.
