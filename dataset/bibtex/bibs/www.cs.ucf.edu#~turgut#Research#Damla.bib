irrelevant, not trusted, or needs special treatment as a belief, opinion or
preference. 

This paper presents an approach for partial merging of semi-structured
knowledgebases. The merging scheme is based on the partitioning of the
knowledgebases through the use of swimlines and the application of
specific primitive merging algorithms in the partitions thus created. This
approach allows the participants of the merging operation to specify their
intentions in the merging process in an efficient and intuitive way.

    In this paper, we propose a novel, cluster-based energy balancing scheme. We
assume the existence of a fraction of ``strong'' nodes in terms of abundant
storage, computing and communication abilities as well as energy. With the
transformation of the flat network infrastructure into a hierarchical one, we
obtained significant improvements in energy balancing leading to a longer
connected time of the network. The improvement is quantified by mathematical
analysis and extensive numerical simulations.

most of the existing simulator frameworks are not well suited for experimental
development. The YAES simulation framework was specifically developed such that
it allows the fast prototyping of networking protocols, and support real-time
experimentation and refactoring. By providing a large set of abstractions and
generic implementations, a number of frequently used techniques such as genetic
algorithms or neural networks can be created in matter of minutes. Our
experience shows that by requiring only Java programming skills which computer
science and engineering students commonly possess, YAES can be a useful tool for
classroom use, as well.

This paper presents the considerations behind the YAES architecture and provides
a description of the system. As a case study, we present the steps necessary for
running experiments on the energy efficiency behavior of the Weighted Clustering
Algorithm (WCA).

     The global internet is rich in commodity resources but scarce in
     specialized resources. We argue that a grid framework can achieve better
     performance if it separates management of commodity tasks from the
     management of the tasks requiring specialized resources. Assuming a
     relative homogeneity of the commodity resource providers, the determining
     factor of grid performance becomes the latency of 
     entering into execution. This effectively transforms the resource
     allocation problem into a routing problem. 

     We present an approach in which commodity tasks are distributed to the
     commodity service providers by request forwarding on the n-Cycle overlay
     network. We provide algorithms for task allocation and for the
     maintenance of the overlay network. By ensuring that the
     algorithms use only narrow local information, the approach is easily
     scalable to millions of nodes. 

     For task allocation algorithms in a commercial setting, fairness is of
     paramount importance. We investigate the properties of the proposed
     algorithms from the fairness point of view and show how adding several
     hops of random pre-walk to the algorithm can improve its fairness.  

     Extensive simulations prove that the approach provides efficient
     task allocation on networks loaded up to 95\% of their capacity.

   We consider a model where commodity service providers are offering
commodity computational services to a set of customers. We provide a solution
for the efficient distribution of tasks by forwarding the service requests on an
overlay network comprised on random cycles. We introduce algorithms for the
creation, maintenance and repair of the overlay network. We discuss two
algorithms, Random Wandering and Weighted Stochastic Forwarding for the
allocation of the tasks to providers. Both approaches are highly scalable
because the algorithms use only limited local information. 

As we are designing our approach for use in a commercial setting, there is a
requirement that the tasks, being source of profits, to be allocated fairly to
the providers. We investigate the fairness of the algorithms and show that
adding a random pre-walk can improve the fairness.

Through a simulation study we show that the approach provides efficient task
allocation on networks loaded up to 95\% of their capacity.
