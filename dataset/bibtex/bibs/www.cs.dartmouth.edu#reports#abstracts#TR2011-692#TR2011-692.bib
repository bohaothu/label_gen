ABSTRACT:: 
This project focused on developing a more challenging artificial intelligence for the real-time strategy game Auralux. I designed and implemented an AI framework named FlexibleAI that could be configured with various parameters controlling different aspects of the overall algorithm. In this way, the AI could be tuned to be more successful. I then created a testing framework called AuraSim that simplified Auralux into an easily-simulated turn-based format.
 After testing various configurations and tuning the FlexibleAI's parameters to be more successful, the AI eventually achieved a victory rate several times better than its average opponent. This provides the basis for a more challenging Auralux AI that will likely prove more satisfying to play against.
