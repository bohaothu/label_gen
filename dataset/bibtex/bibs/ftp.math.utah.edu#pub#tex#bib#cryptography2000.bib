                 distributed file system that does not assume mutual

                 security, availability, and reliability by distributing
                 multiple encrypted replicas of each file among the
                 client machines. To assess the feasibility of deploying
                 this system on an existing desktop infrastructure, we
                 measure and analyze a large set of client machines in a
                 commercial environment. In particular, we measure and
                 report results on disk usage and content; file
                 activity; and machine uptimes, lifetimes, and loads. We
                 conclude that the measured desktop infrastructure would
                 passably support our proposed system, providing

  abstract =     "The Security Process Algebra (SPA) is a CCS-like
                 specification language where actions belong to two
                 different levels of confidentiality. It has been used
                 to define several noninterference-like security
                 properties whose verification has been automated by the
                 tool CoSeC. In recent years, a method for analyzing
                 security protocols using SPA and CoSeC has been
                 developed. Even if it has been useful in analyzing
                 small security protocols, this method has shown to be
                 error-prone, as it requires the protocol description
                 and its environment to be written by hand. This problem
                 has been solved by defining a protocol specification
                 language more abstract than SPA, called VSP, and a
                 compiler CVS that automatically generates the SPA
                 specification for a given protocol described in VSP.
                 The VSP/CVS technology is very powerful, and its
                 usefulness is shown with some case studies: the Woo-Lam
                 one-way authentication protocol, for which a new attack
                 to authentication is found, and the Wide Mouthed Frog
                 protocol, where different kinds of attack are detected

                 submitted as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption
                 Standard, and is one of five finalists. It has 128-bit
                 blocks and supports keys of 128, 192 and 256 bits, and
                 is an iterated 20-round block cipher. Here it is shown
                 that versions of RC6 with 128-bit blocks can be
                 distinguished from a random permutation with up to 15
                 rounds; for some weak keys up to 17 rounds. Moreover,
                 with an increased effort key-recovery attacks can be
                 mounted on RC6 with up to 15 rounds faster than an
                 exhaustive search for the key.",

                 transformations that yield tamper-resistant software,
                 no reliable software-only methods are known. This paper
                 studies the hardware implementation of a form of
                 execute-only memory (XOM) that allows instructions
                 stored in memory to be executed there but not otherwise
                 manipulated. To support XOM code we use a machine that
                 supports internal compartments --- a process in one
                 compartment cannot read data from another compartment.
                 All data that leaves the machine is encrypted, since we
                 assume external memory is not secure. The design of
                 this machine poses some interesting tradeoffs between
                 security, efficient, and flexibility. We explore some
                 of the potential security issues as one pushes the
                 machine to become more efficient and flexible. Although
                 security carries a performance penalty, our analysis
                 indicates that it is possible to create a normal
                 multi-tasking machine where nearly all applications can
                 be run in XOM mode. While a virtual XOM machine is
                 possible, the underlying hardware needs to support a
                 unique private key, private memory, and traps on cache
                 misses. For efficient operation, hardware assist to
                 provide fast symmetric ciphers is also required.",

  abstract =     "Richard Feynman's observation that certain quantum
                 mechanical effects cannot be simulated efficiently on a
                 computer led to speculation that computation in general
                 could be done more efficiently if it used these quantum
                 effects. This speculation proved justified when Peter
                 Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for
                 factoring integers. \par

                 In quantum systems, the computational space increases
                 exponentially with the size of the system, which
                 enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could
                 lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than
                 possible classically. The catch is that accessing the
                 results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and
                 requires new nontraditional programming techniques.
                 \par

                 The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists
                 through the barriers that separate quantum computing
                 from conventional computing. We introduce basic
                 principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the
                 power of quantum computers comes from and why it is
                 difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography,
                 teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to
                 exploiting the power of quantum parallelism are
                 explained. We conclude with a discussion of quantum
                 error correction.",

                 cryptology have become important not only as technical
                 problems but as public policy issues. More to the
                 point, we practitioners and researchers in computer
                 security and cryptology often now find ourselves sought
                 out not only for technical expertise but also by
                 policymakers, lobbyists, and the media. Unfortunately,
                 we're often surprised at just how ill-prepared we are
                 for the public policy culture, and we risk finding
                 ourselves misused, misunderstood or misquoted. It
                 doesn't have to be that way. This talk will present a
                 personal view of the relationship between science and
                 public policy, focusing on the different value systems,
                 protocols, and expectations found in the two worlds. It
                 really is possible to maintain one's integrity while

                 The conclusion is that although a lot of good work has
                 been done, a more concerted effort is needed to build a
                 coherent set of machine-readable formal models of the
                 whole of Java and its implementation. This is a
                 formidable task but we believe it is essential to build
                 trust in Java safety, and thence to achieve ITSEC level
                 6 or Common Criteria level 7 certification for Java

                 for the investigation of the increasingly pervasive
                 codes used to identify everything from credit cards to
                 books to supermarket goods. An important part of such
                 codes is the check digit, which can point out when an
                 error has been made, either accidentally in
                 transmission, or deliberately in an attempt at fraud.
                 Mathematics plays a crucial role in designing and
                 verifying such check digit schemes. Beginning
                 undergraduates and pre-university students should find
                 this book both accessible and fun. In the process of
                 describing the identification number schemes, the
                 author introduces many fundamental areas of discrete
                 mathematics, including modular arithmetic and group
                 theory, with emphasis on their applications. A unique
                 point of the book is the way it offers students the
                 possibility of writing papers summarizing a given topic
                 to improve their understanding. It also contains
                 pointers into the literature for further reading.",

                 to a quantum key distribution protocol proposed by
                 Bennett and Brassard [1984]. The proof considers a
                 practical variation on the protocol in which the
                 channel is noisy and photos may be lost during the
                 transmission. Each individual signal sent into the
                 channel must contain a single photon or any
                 two-dimensional system in the exact state described in
                 the protocol. No restriction is imposed on the detector
                 used at the receiving side of the channel, except that
                 whether or not the received system is detected must be
                 independent of the basis used to measure this system.",

                 Last year my survey of over 8,000 SSL servers found
                 that about 25\% of them used only weak ``export''-level
                 keys and cipher suites. With the wider deployment of
                 TLS, more high-speed cryptographic hardware, and
                 another year since the U.S. liberalized crypto export
                 regulations, more sites have deployed strong crypto.
                 This talk will discuss the results of this year's
                 survey, the changes in crypto deployment that have
                 occurred in the last year, and the possible causes of

  abstract =     "Smartcards are the most secure portable computing
                 device today. They have been used successfully in
                 applications involving money, and proprietary and
                 personal data (such as banking, healthcare, insurance,
                 etc.). As smartcards get more powerful (with 32-bit CPU
                 and more than 1 MB of stable memory in the next
                 versions) and become multi-application, the need for
                 database management arises. However, smartcards have
                 severe hardware limitations (very slow write, very
                 little RAM, constrained stable memory, no autonomy,
                 etc.) which make traditional database technology
                 irrelevant. The major problem is scaling down database
                 techniques so they perform well under these
                 limitations. In this paper, we give an in-depth
                 analysis of this problem and propose a PicoDBMS
                 solution based on highly compact data structures, query
                 execution without RAM, and specific techniques for
                 atomicity and durability. We show the effectiveness of
                 our techniques through performance evaluation.",

                 outputs of such generators may be used in many
                 cryptographic applications, such as the generation of
                 key material. Generators suitable for use in
                 cryptographic applications may need to meet stronger
                 requirements than for other applications. In
                 particular, their outputs must be unpredictable in the
                 absence of knowledge of the inputs. Some criteria for
                 characterizing and selecting appropriate generators are
                 discussed in this document. The subject of statistical
                 testing and its relation to cryptanalysis is also
                 discussed, and some recommended statistical tests are
                 provided. These tests may be useful as a first step in
                 determining whether or not a generator is suitable for
                 a particular cryptographic application. However, no set
                 of statistical tests can absolutely certify a generator
                 as appropriate for usage in a particular application,
                 i.e., statistical testing cannot serve as a substitute
                 for cryptanalysis. The design and cryptanalysis of
                 generators is outside the scope of this paper.",

  abstract =     "This dissertation examines errors above the link layer
                 in data communications networks. Specifically we study
                 the network and transport layers of the Internet
                 protocol suite. The focus of our study is
                 error-detecting codes (EDCs), such as checksums and
                 cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs); how often those EDCs
                 are called upon to detect errors, and how well they
                 perform that task. As a framework for the empirical
                 work in the thesis, we develop a formal description of
                 how to compare and rank different EDCs. We show that
                 currently deployed EDCs (the 16-bit TCP checksum, and
                 the alternate Fletcher checksum) should come close to
                 the ideal of 1 in $2^{16}$ undetected errors. We
                 present herein a set of simulation studies for existing
                 EDCs which show that in practice these EDCs do not
                 approach the expected ideal results. Our analysis shows
                 that the cause is self-correlation of the input data.
                 In this case, relocating the checksum value to the end
                 of the packet gives a significant improvement. Errors
                 captured from live networks are also examined. We
                 present a new method for capturing both damaged packets
                 from real-life networks and subsequent retransmissions
                 of the damaged packets. This method meets privacy and
                 confidentiality constraints on interception of
                 real-life user data. A significant body of errors was
                 captured at four representative sites. This data is
                 described, summarized, and analyzed. Comparison of the
                 damaged packets and the undamaged retransmissions
                 yields information on the kinds and causes of errors
                 which occur above the link layer. Our data provides
                 strong evidence that errors above the link-layer are
                 due to a variety of causes, which include bad memory in
                 intermediate routers, and bugs in end-host hardware or
                 software which are outside the protection of link-level
                 error checks. For the real-life captured errors, we
                 find CRCs are little or no better than additive
                 checksums of the same size. Our data shows that the
                 datapath between packet buffers and on-NIC CRC hardware
                 is a significant source of errors. We conclude that
                 reliable data communication should use end-to-end error
                 checks. Strongly reliable communication should use an
                 application-level end-to-end check that also covers the
                 packet-buffer-to-NIC datapath.",

                 research is, of course, to obtain an unconditional
                 deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for primality
                 testing. Despite the impressive progress made in
                 primality testing so far, this goal has remained
                 elusive. In this paper, we achieve this. We give a
                 deterministic, $\tilde{O}((log n)^12)$ time algorithm
                 for testing if a number is prime. Heuristically, our
                 algorithm does much better: under a widely believed
                 conjecture on the density of Sophie Germain primes
                 (primes $p$ such that $2p + 1$ is also prime), the
                 algorithm takes only $\tilde{O}((log n)^6)$ steps.''",

  abstract =     "Cryptography sounds just wonderful. With a few simple
                 algorithms, it is possible to separate the security of
                 messages from the security of the media over which they
                 are carried; public-key techniques even make it
                 possible to have secure communication over completely
                 public channels without advance arrangements. Now that
                 crypto export restrictions have been relaxed, vendors
                 are actually implementing it--the world has finally
                 gotten serious about security, it seems.\par

                 And yet Internet attacks have become a far greater
                 problem than they were in the bad old days before
                 widely deployed cryptography. This talk will try to
                 figure out who is to blame for this situation.",

  abstract =     "Several recently proposed ciphers are built with
                 layers of small S-boxes, interconnected by linear
                 key-dependent layers. Their security relies on the
                 fact, that the classical methods of cryptanalysis (e.g.
                 linear or differential attacks) are based on
                 probabilistic characteristics, which makes their
                 security grow exponentially with the number of rounds
                 Nr.\par

                 In this paper we study the security of such ciphers
                 under an additional hypothesis: the S-box can be
                 described by an overdefined system of algebraic
                 equations (true with probability 1). We show that this
                 hypothesis is true for both Serpent (due to a small
                 size of S-boxes) and Rijndael (due to unexpected
                 algebraic properties).\par

                 We study general methods known for solving overdefined
                 systems of equations, such as XL from Eurocrypt'00, and
                 show their inefficiency. Then we introduce a new method
                 called XSL that uses the sparsity of the equations and
                 their specific structure.\par

                 The XSL attack is very powerful, but heuristic and it
                 is very difficult to evaluate its complexity. The XSL
                 attack has a parameter P, and in theory we show that P
                 should be a constant. The XSL attack would then be
                 polynomial in Nr, with a huge constant that is
                 double-exponential in the size of the S-box.\par

                 We demonstrated by computer simulations that the XSL
                 attack works well enough on a toy cipher. It seems
                 however that P will rather increase very slowly with
                 Nr. More simulations are needed for bigger
                 ciphers.\par

                 Our optimistic evaluation shows that the XSL attack
                 might be able to break Rijndael 256 bits and Serpent
                 for key lengths 192 and 256 bits. However if only $P$
                 is increased by 2 (respectively 4) the XSL attack on
                 Rijndael (respectively Serpent) would become slower
                 than the exhaustive search. At any rate, it seems that
                 the security of these ciphers does NOT grow
                 exponentially with the number of rounds.",

  abstract =     "Electronic watermarking can be traced back as far as
                 1954. The last 10 years has seen considerable interest
                 in digital watermarking, due, in large part, to
                 concerns about illegal piracy of copyrighted content.
                 In this paper, we consider the following questions: is
                 the interest warranted? What are the commercial
                 applications of the technology? What scientific
                 progress has been made in the last 10 years? What are
                 the most exciting areas for research? And where might
                 the next 10 years take us? In our opinion, the interest
                 in watermarking is appropriate. However, we expect that
                 copyright applications will be overshadowed by
                 applications such as broadcast monitoring,
                 authentication, and tracking content distributed within
                 corporations. We further see a variety of applications
                 emerging that add value to media, such as annotation
                 and linking content to the Web. These latter
                 applications may turn out to be the most compelling.
                 Considerable progress has been made toward enabling
                 these applications-perceptual modelling, security
                 threats and countermeasures, and the development of a
                 bag of tricks for efficient implementations. Further
                 progress is needed in methods for handling geometric
                 and temporal distortions. We expect other exciting
                 developments to arise from research in informed
                 watermarking.",

                 testing of symmetric ciphers and hash functions which
                 allowed us to detect biases in both of these systems
                 where previously known tests failed. We first give a
                 complete characterization of the Algebraic Normal Form
                 (ANF) of random Boolean functions by means of the
                 M{\"o}bius transform. Then we built a new testing based
                 on the comparison between the structure of the
                 different Boolean functions Algebraic Normal Forms
                 characterizing symmetric ciphers and hash functions and
                 those of purely random Boolean functions. Detailed
                 testing results on several cryptosystems are presented.
                 As a main result we show that AES, DES Snow and
                 Lili-128 fail all or part of the tests and thus present
                 strong biases.",

                 the AES block cipher. It is demonstrated that the
                 outputs of the 8*8 Rijndael s-box (based on inversion
                 in a finite field) are all equivalent under affine
                 transformation. The method used to discover these
                 affine relations is novel and exploits a new
                 fundamental result on the invariance properties of
                 local connection structure of affine equivalence
                 classes. As well as increasing existing concerns about
                 the security of the AES, these results may also have
                 serious consequences for many other ciphers recently

  abstract =     "Cryptosystems like AES and triple-DES are designed to
                 encrypt a sequence of input bytes (the plaintext) into
                 a sequence of output bytes (the ciphertext) in such a
                 way that the output carries no information about that
                 plaintext except its length. In recent years, concerns
                 have been raised about `side-channel' attacks on
                 various cryptosystems-attacks that make use of some
                 kind of leaked information about the cryptographic
                 operations (e.g., power consumption or timing) to
                 defeat them. In this paper, we describe a somewhat
                 different kind of side-channel provided by data
                 compression algorithms, yielding information about
                 their inputs by the size of their outputs. The
                 existence of some information about a compressor's
                 input in the size of its output is obvious; here, we
                 discuss ways to use this apparently very small leak of
                 information in surprisingly powerful ways.",

                 cryptographic security has been key length.
                 Unfortunately, real adversaries lack the propriety to
                 limit themselves to tidy attacks such as brute force,
                 factoring, and differential cryptanalysis. Worse,
                 Moore's Law is driving vendors to build systems of
                 exponentially increasing complexity without making
                 security experts exponentially smarter to compensate.
                 The resulting products have a minuscule chance of being
                 extremely secure, and a large chance of being
                 critically flawed. This talk will review basic
                 engineering approaches that can improve assurance and
                 will show how evaluators and attackers break overly
                 complex, poorly tested designs.",

                 congruential generators --- even those based on a prime
                 modulus --- fail at least one of the tests, as do many
                 simple generators, such as shift register and lagged
                 Fibonacci. On the other hand, generators that pass the
                 three tests seem to pass all the tests in the Diehard
                 Battery of Tests.\par

                 Note that these tests concern the randomness of a
                 generator's output as a sequence of independent,
                 uniform 32-bit integers. For uses where the output is
                 converted to uniform variates in $[0,1)$, potential
                 flaws of the output as integers will seldom cause
                 problems after the conversion. Most generators seem to
                 be adequate for producing a set of uniform reals in
                 $[0,1)$, but several important applications. notably in
                 cryptography and number theory --- for example,
                 establishing probable primes, complexity of factoring
                 algorithms, random partitions of large integers --- may
                 require satisfactory performance on the kinds of tests

                 a brief overview of the history and the foundations of
                 classical cryptography, and then move on to modern
                 public-key cryptography. Particular attention is paid
                 to cryptographic protocols and the problem of
                 constructing key components of protocols such as
                 one-way functions. A function is one-way if it is easy
                 to compute, but hard to invert. We discuss the notion
                 of one-way functions both in a cryptographic and in a
                 complexity-theoretic setting. We also consider
                 interactive proof systems and present some interesting
                 zero-knowledge protocols. In a zero-knowledge protocol,
                 one party can convince the other party of knowing some
                 secret information without disclosing any bit of this
                 information. Motivated by these protocols, we survey
                 some complexity-theoretic results on interactive proof
                 systems and related complexity classes.",

                 ensures that some bit positions of some of the
                 attributes of some of the tuples contain specific
                 values. The specific bit locations and values are
                 algorithmically determined under the control of a
                 secret key known only to the owner of the data. This
                 bit pattern constitutes the watermark. Only if one has
                 access to the secret key can the watermark be detected
                 with high probability. Detecting the watermark requires
                 access neither to the original data nor the watermark,
                 and the watermark can be easily and efficiently
                 maintained in the presence of insertions, updates, and
                 deletions. Our analysis shows that the proposed
                 technique is robust against various forms of malicious
                 attacks as well as benign updates to the data. Using an
                 implementation running on DB2, we also show that the
                 algorithms perform well enough to be used in real-world
                 applications.",

                 writes about the National Bureau of Standards Western
                 Automatic Computer (SWAC) (1950--1967): ``One of the
                 exciting problems in mathematics on which the SWAC
                 worked was the study of Mersenne numbers, that is,
                 numbers of the form $2^p - 1$, where $p$ is a prime.
                 These numbers, when prime, are related to the `perfect
                 numbers' of the Greeks, numbers that are the sum of all
                 their integral divisors, excluding themselves. The list
                 of values of $p$ that yielded prime numbers up to that
                 time was $p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89$, and
                 $107$. Everyone was greatly excited when SWAC added
                 $521$ to the list, and there was a real celebration
                 when $607$ was added about an hour later. In all, by
                 June 1953, five values [$521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281$]
                 had been added to the list with the use of the SWAC as
                 a result of systematic testing of all primes up to
                 $2297$.'' Raphael M. Robinson's work appears in
                 `Mersenne and Fermat Numbers', Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.,
                 v. 5, 1954, pp. 842--846
                 (http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1954-005-05/S0002-9939-1954-0064787-4/S0002-9939-1954-0064787-4.pdf).
                 He reports ``At that time, the total memory of the SWAC
                 consisted of 256 words of 36 binary digits each,
                 exclusive of the sign. For the Mersenne test, half of
                 this memory was reserved for commands. Since successive
                 squarings of numbers less than the modulus ^2^n - 1$
                 are required, this modulus was restricted to 64 words,
                 so that the condition $w < 64*36 = 2304$ was imposed.
                 The estimated running time for the program was $0.25n^3
                 + 125n^2$ microseconds, and the actual time was in fair
                 agreement with this. Thus, roughly speaking, the
                 testing time was a minute for the first and an hour for
                 the last of the five new primes. Each minute of machine
                 time is equivalent to more than a year's work for a
                 person using a desk calculator.''",

                 These three problems and brief descriptions of them
                 follow. (1) The selective decommitment problem. An
                 adversary is given commitments to a collection of
                 messages, and the adversary can ask for some subset of
                 the commitments to be opened. The question is whether
                 seeing the decommitments to these open plaintexts
                 allows the adversary to learn something unexpected
                 about the plaintexts that are unopened. (2) The power
                 of 3-round weak zero-knowledge arguments. The question
                 is what can be proved in (a possibly weakened form of)
                 zero-knowledge in a 3-round argument. In particular, is
                 there a language outside of BPP that has a 3-round
                 public-coin weak zero-knowledge argument? (3) The
                 Fiat--Shamir methodology. This is a method for
                 converting a 3-round public-coin argument (viewed as an
                 identification scheme) to a 1-round signature scheme.
                 The method requires what we call a ``magic function''
                 that the signer applies to the first-round message of
                 the argument to obtain a second-round message (queries
                 from the verifier). An open question here is whether
                 every 3-round public-coin argument for a language
                 outside of BPP has a magic function.\par

                 It follows easily from definitions that if a 3-round
                 public-coin argument system is zero-knowledge in the
                 standard (fairly strong) sense, then it has no magic
                 function. We define a weakening of zero-knowledge such
                 that zero-knowledge ? no-magic-function still holds.
                 For this weakened form of zero-knowledge, we give a
                 partial converse: informally, if a 3-round public-coin
                 argument system is not weakly zero-knowledge, then some
                 form of magic is possible for this argument system. We
                 obtain our definition of weak zero-knowledge by a
                 sequence of weakenings of the standard definition,
                 forming a hierarchy. Intermediate forms of
                 zero-knowledge in this hierarchy are reasonable ones,
                 and they may be useful in applications. Finally, we
                 relate the selective decommitment problem to
                 public-coin proof systems and arguments at an
                 intermediate level of the hierarchy, and obtain several
                 positive security results for selective decommitment.",

                 World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how
                 American and British codebreakers were the decisive
                 factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine
                 to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25
                 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like
                 Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial
                 information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent
                 means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain,
                 at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North
                 Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet
                 Union from almost certain defeat.

                 In an accessible account based on years of research,
                 interviews and exclusive access to previously
                 top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how
                 cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere
                 in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount
                 the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler
                 shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the
                 frontlines of the `secret war' could tell it.

  abstract =     "AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, is one of the
                 most important algorithms in modern cryptography.
                 Certain randomness properties of AES are of vital
                 importance for its security. At the same time, these
                 properties make AES an interesting candidate for a fast
                 nonlinear random number generator for stochastic
                 simulation. In this article, we address both of these
                 two aspects of AES. We study the performance of AES in
                 a series of statistical tests that are related to
                 cryptographic notions like confusion and diffusion. At
                 the same time, these tests provide empirical evidence
                 for the suitability of AES in stochastic simulation. A
                 substantial part of this article is devoted to the
                 strategy behind our tests and to their relation to
                 other important test statistics like Maurer's Universal
                 Test.",

  annote =       "Best period is $2^{128} \approx 10^{38}$. From the
                 article: ``It appears that our test results are the
                 first detailed statistical results for AES in the
                 published literature. \ldots{}\par

                 AES has been evaluated using the NIST package (see NIST
                 [2001a]). In principle, we consider this type of
                 testing necessary and valuable. However, up to now, AES
                 has only been tested using relatively small sample
                 sizes. Furthermore, the exact test procedure and the
                 parameters that were used have not been published.
                 There are no refereed publications on this topic.
                 \ldots{} \par

                 4. FINDINGS\par

                 AES performed very well. The empirical results support
                 the hypothesis that AES is not only an excellent
                 cryptographic algorithm, but also a very interesting
                 nonlinear random number generator for stochastic
                 simulation.\par

                 We were unable to find any statistical weaknesses. Most
                 of the $p$-values were completely uncritical, no
                 systematic trends popped up in the tests.\par

                 \ldots{} \par

                 The results indicate that AES pseudorandom numbers are
                 indistinguishable from real random numbers with respect
                 to bit-vectors up to length 16 and with respect to the
                 distribution of 0's and 1's in bit-vectors up to length
                 256.\par

                 From the results for DIFF we conclude that AES is able
                 to compensate for an extreme lack of 1's in the
                 plaintext, and hence provides excellent diffusion in
                 this case. The results for KCOUNT provide some
                 confidence that the key schedule used for generating
                 the internal keys for the encryption rounds in AES does
                 a good job. Similar keys do not yield correlated output
                 sequences.''",

                 number field sieve without solving a very large linear
                 system for each logarithm. We show that, with these
                 improvements, the number field sieve outperforms the
                 gaussian integer method in the hundred digit range. We
                 also illustrate our results by successfully computing
                 discrete logarithms with GNFS in a large prime field.",

  abstract =     "Group communication can benefit from IP multicast to
                 achieve scalable exchange of messages. However, there
                 is a challenge of effectively controlling access to the
                 transmitted data. IP multicast by itself does not
                 provide any mechanisms for preventing nongroup members
                 to have access to the group communication. Although
                 encryption can be used to protect messages exchanged
                 among group members, distributing the cryptographic
                 keys becomes an issue. Researchers have proposed
                 several different approaches to group key management.
                 These approaches can be divided into three main
                 classes: centralized group key management protocols,
                 decentralized architectures and distributed key
                 management protocols. The three classes are described
                 here and an insight given to their features and goals.
                 The area of group key management is then surveyed and
                 proposed solutions are classified according to those
                 characteristics.",

  abstract =     "Random numbers with high cryptographic quality are
                 needed to enhance the security of cryptography
                 applications. Software heuristics for generating
                 empirically strong random number sequences rely on
                 entropy gathering by measuring unpredictable external
                 events. These generators only deliver a few bits per
                 event. This limits them to being used as seeds for
                 pseudorandom generators. General-purpose processors
                 feature a large number of hardware mechanisms that aim
                 to improve performance: caches, branch predictors,
                 \ldots{}. The state of these components is not
                 architectural (i.e., the result of an ordinary
                 application does not depend on it). It is also volatile
                 and cannot be directly monitored by the user. On the
                 other hand, every operating system interrupt modifies
                 thousands of these binary volatile states. In this
                 article, we present and analyze HAVEGE (HArdware
                 Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion), a new
                 user-level software heuristic to generate practically
                 strong random numbers on general-purpose computers. The
                 hardware clock cycle counter of the processor can be
                 used to gather part of the entropy\slash uncertainty
                 introduced by operating system interrupts in the
                 internal states of the processor. Then, we show how
                 this entropy gathering technique can be combined with
                 pseudorandom number generation in HAVEGE. Since the
                 internal state of HAVEGE includes thousands of internal
                 volatile hardware states, it seems impossible even for
                 the user itself to reproduce the generated sequences.",

  annote =       "From the article: ``On current PCs and workstations,
                 the HAVEG algorithms collects several tens of thousands
                 of empirically strong random bits, on average, per
                 every operating system interrupt, that is, HAVEG is
                 three to four orders of magnitude more efficient than
                 previous software entropy gathering
                 techniques.\par

                 \ldots{}\par

                 \ldots{} on all the target platforms of HAVEGE in 2002
                 [Seznec and Sendrier 2002], the HAVEG algorithm
                 illustrated in Figure 1 allows to gather at least
                 8K--64K random bits in average per operating system
                 interrupt (from 8K on Itanium/Linux to 64K on
                 Solaris/UltraSparc II). That is, at least three to four
                 orders of magnitude more than the `entropy' gathered by
                 previously available entropy-gathering
                 techniques.\par

                 \ldots{}\par

                 In average on Pentium III, 920 million $\pm5\%$ cycles
                 were needed to collect 32 Mbytes of random numbers,
                 while on the UltraSparc II, 500 million $\pm5\%$ cycles
                 were sufficient. This throughput is in the same range
                 as the throughput of standard pseudorandom number
                 generators.''\par

                 Thus, it seems that this algorithm deserves careful
                 consideration for use in {\tt /dev/random} and {\tt
                 /dev/urandom} pseudodevices in Unix systems, since the
                 former in particular on several platforms can be
                 rapidly drained of data, causing very long input waits
                 (e.g., two days to read 10MB of data.)",

  abstract =     "Distributed computer architectures labeled
                 'peer-to-peer' are designed for the sharing of computer
                 resources (content, storage, CPU cycles) by direct
                 exchange, rather than requiring the intermediation or
                 support of a centralized server or authority.
                 Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their
                 ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient
                 populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable
                 connectivity and performance. Content distribution is
                 an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet
                 that has received considerable research attention.
                 Content distribution applications typically allow
                 personal computers to function in a coordinated manner
                 as a distributed storage medium by contributing,
                 searching, and obtaining digital content. In this
                 survey, we propose a framework for analyzing
                 peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our
                 approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such
                 as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and
                 resource management potential, and examines the way in
                 which these characteristics are reflected in---and
                 affected by---the architectural design decisions
                 adopted by current peer-to-peer systems. We study
                 current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure
                 technologies in terms of their distributed object
                 location and routing mechanisms, their approach to
                 content replication, caching and migration, their
                 support for encryption, access control, authentication
                 and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability
                 and reputation, and their use of resource trading and
                 management schemes.",

  abstract =     "IBM has designed special cryptographic processors for
                 its servers for more than 25 years. These began as very
                 simple devices, but over time the requirements have
                 become increasingly complex, and there has been a
                 never-ending demand for increased speed. This paper
                 describes the PCIXCC, the new coprocessor introduced in
                 the IBM z990 server. In many ways, PCIXCC is a
                 watershed design. For the first time, a single product
                 satisfies all requirements across all IBM server
                 platforms. It offers the performance demanded by
                 today's Web servers, it supports the complex and
                 specialized cryptographic functions needed in the
                 banking and finance industry, and it uses packaging
                 technology that leads the world in resistance to
                 physical or electrical attacks against its secure
                 processes and the secret data it holds. Furthermore, it
                 is programmable and highly flexible, so that its
                 function can be easily modified to meet new
                 requirements as they appear. These features are
                 possible because of innovative design in both the
                 hardware and embedded software for the card. This paper
                 provides an overview of that design.",

                 electrical noise from a semiconductor junction. Each of
                 the two random-number sources provides random bits at a
                 rate of 128 Kb/s.''\par

                 Linux operating system and device drivers: \ldots{} By
                 adopting Linux as the card O/S, the PCIXCC development
                 team could focus more of its energy on the unique
                 PCIXCC components. \ldots{} In the end, we decided to
                 provide all device driver modules under the same

                 success of the British ``Ultra'' program in cracking
                 the Germans' Enigma code early in World War II, but few
                 know what really happened in 1942, when the Germans
                 added a fourth rotor to the machine that created the
                 already challenging naval code and plunged Allied
                 intelligence into darkness.

                 Enter one Joe Desch, an unassuming but brilliant
                 engineer at the National Cash Register Company in
                 Dayton, Ohio, who was given the task of creating a
                 machine to break the new Enigma settings. It was an
                 enterprise that rivaled the Manhattan Project for
                 secrecy and complexity---and nearly drove Desch to a
                 breakdown. Under enormous pressure, he succeeded in
                 creating a 5,000-pound electromechanical monster known
                 as the Desch Bombe, which helped turn the tide in the
                 Battle of the Atlantic---but not before a disgruntled
                 co-worker attempted to leak information about the
                 machine to the Nazis.

                 After toiling anonymously---it even took his daughter
                 years to learn of his accomplishments---Desch was
                 awarded the National Medal of Merit, the country's
                 highest civilian honor. In The Secret in Building 26,
                 the entire thrilling story of the final triumph over
                 Enigma is finally told. ''",

                 (RIPEMD-128) in Clause 8 provides hash-codes of lengths
                 up to 128 bits; \item the third hash-function (SHA-1)
                 in Clause 9 provides hash-codes of lengths up to 160
                 bits; \item the fourth hash-function (SHA-256) in
                 Clause 10 provides hash-codes of lengths up to 256
                 bits; \item the fifth hash-function (SHA-512) in Clause
                 11 provides hash-codes of lengths up to 512 bits; \item
                 the sixth hash-function (SHA-384) in Clause 12 provides
                 hash-codes of a fixed length, 384 bits; and \item the

                 partial key exposure vulnerability in the RC4 stream
                 cipher discovered by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir. This

                 our implementation of the attack, and optimizations
                 that can be used to reduce the number of packets
                 required for the attack. We conclude that the 802.11b

                 elliptic curve (ECC) and HECC. We were able to reduce
                 the complexity of the group operation for small genus
                 hyperelliptic curves. Our theoretical comparison
                 between ECC and HECC, as well as our software and
                 hardware implementations show that the performance of
                 both cryptographic primitives is in the same range. The
                 implementations we investigated range from a general
                 purpose processor to a variety of different embedded
                 processors, and also include the prototype
                 implementation of a HEC coprocessor on FPGAs.",

                 elliptic curves and despite the adoption of elliptic
                 curves by many users, many vendors and academics view
                 the intellectual property environment surrounding
                 elliptic curves as a major roadblock to their
                 implementation and use. Various aspects of elliptic
                 curve cryptography have been patented by a variety of
                 people and companies around the world. Notably the
                 Canadian company, Certicom Inc. holds over 130 patents
                 related to elliptic curves and public key cryptography
                 in general.\par

                 As a way of clearing the way for the implementation of
                 elliptic curves to protect US and allied government
                 information, the National Security Agency purchased
                 from Certicom a license that covers all of their
                 intellectual property in a restricted field of use. The
                 license would be limited to implementations that were
                 for national security uses and certified under FIPS
                 140-2 or were approved by NSA. Further, the license
                 would be limited to only prime field curves where the
                 prime was greater than 2255. On the NIST list of curves
                 3 out of the 15 fit this field of use: the prime field
                 curves with primes of 256 bits, 384 bits and 521 bits.
                 Certicom identified 26 patents that covered this field
                 of use. NSA's license includes a right to sublicense
                 these 26 patents to vendors building products within
                 the restricted field of use. Certicom also retained a
                 right to license vendors both within the field of use
                 and under other terms that they may negotiate with
                 vendors.''",

                 (signature) generation and verification for the
                 protection of messages and data using the Elliptic
                 Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA is the
                 elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature
                 Algorithm (ANS X9.30). The ECDSA shall be used in
                 conjunction with an approved hash function, as
                 specified in X9 Registry Item 00003, Secure Hash
                 Standard (SHS). The hash functions approved at the time
                 of publication of this document are SHA-1 (see note),
                 SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. This ECDSA
                 Standard provides methods and criteria for the
                 generation of public and private keys that are required
                 by the ECDSA and the procedural controls required for
                 the secure use of the algorithm with these keys. This
                 ECDSA Standard also provides methods and criteria for
                 the generation of elliptic curve domain parameters that
                 are required by the ECDSA and the procedural controls
                 required for the secure use of the algorithm with these
                 domain parameters.",

                 this paper is the fundamental theorem of a Modular
                 Number System, which provides a bound for the
                 coefficients of the polynomials used to represent the
                 set $\mathbb{Z}_p$. However, we also propose a complete
                 set of algorithms to perform the arithmetic operations
                 over a PMNS, which make this system of practical

                 the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, developed by Wheeler and
                 the late Roger Needham (a former Wheeler research
                 student, later head of the Laboratory and the first
                 managing director of Microsoft Research Ltd). The
                 algorithm was designed in part to `inject some sanity'
                 into the imposition of export controls on encryption
                 software by the US Government in the late 1980s.
                 Wheeler's solution was to devise an encryption
                 algorithm so short, simple and general that it could be
                 memorized and encoded in any language. It proved
                 impossible to put an embargo on what ended up as just
                 eight lines of code---another masterpiece in
                 miniature.'' See \cite{Wheeler:1995:TTE} for the
                 algorithm.\par

                 ``In an email collaboration, Wheeler and Burrows
                 devised a data compression technique based on BWT,
                 which was published as a research report in 1994. The
                 idea was picked up by Dr Dobb's Journal and soon
                 diffused into the commons of computing. Not long after,
                 Burrows received a call from Donald Knuth---asking if
                 he was working with {\em the\/} David Wheeler! Today
                 the technique is the basis of the widely used open
                 source bzip and bzip2 file formats.''",

  abstract =     "Several cryptosystems rely on fast calculations of
                 linear combinations in groups. One way to achieve this
                 is to use joint signed binary digit expansions of small
                 ``weight.'' We study two algorithms, one based on
                 nonadjacent forms of the coefficients of the linear
                 combination, the other based on a certain joint sparse
                 form specifically adapted to this problem. Both methods
                 are sped up using the sliding windows approach combined
                 with precomputed lookup tables. We give explicit and
                 asymptotic results for the number of group operations
                 needed, assuming uniform distribution of the
                 coefficients. Expected values, variances and a central
                 limit theorem are proved using generating functions.
                 Furthermore, we provide a new algorithm that calculates
                 the digits of an optimal expansion of pairs of integers
                 from left to right. This avoids storing the whole
                 expansion, which is needed with the previously known
                 right-to-left methods, and allows an online
                 computation.",

  abstract =     "Trust management is a form of distributed access
                 control that allows one principal to delegate some
                 access decisions to other principals. While the use of
                 delegation greatly enhances flexibility and
                 scalability, it may also reduce the control that a
                 principal has over the resources it owns. Security
                 analysis asks whether safety, availability, and other
                 properties can be maintained while delegating to
                 partially trusted principals. We show that in contrast
                 to the undecidability of classical
                 Harrison--Ruzzo--Ullman safety properties, our primary
                 security properties are decidable. In particular, most
                 security properties we study are decidable in
                 polynomial time. The computational complexity of
                 containment analysis, the most complicated security
                 property we study, varies according to the expressive
                 power of the trust management language.",

  abstract =     "Motivated by the security of the nonlinear filter
                 generator, the concept of correlation was previously
                 extended to the conditional correlation, that studied
                 the linear correlation of the inputs conditioned on a
                 given (short) output pattern of some specific nonlinear
                 function. Based on the conditional correlations,
                 conditional correlation attacks were shown to be
                 successful and efficient against the nonlinear filter
                 generator. In this paper, we further generalize the
                 concept of conditional correlations by assigning it
                 with a different meaning, i.e. the correlation of the
                 output of an arbitrary function conditioned on the
                 unknown (partial) input which is uniformly distributed.
                 Based on this generalized conditional correlation, a
                 general statistical model is studied for dedicated
                 key-recovery distinguishers. It is shown that the
                 generalized conditional correlation is no smaller than
                 the unconditional correlation. Consequently, our
                 distinguisher improves on the traditional one (in the
                 worst case it degrades into the traditional one). In
                 particular, the distinguisher may be successful even if
                 no ordinary correlation exists. As an application, a
                 conditional correlation attack is developed and
                 optimized against Bluetooth two-level E0. The attack is
                 based on a recently detected flaw in the
                 resynchronization of E0, as well as the investigation
                 of conditional correlations in the Finite State Machine
                 (FSM) governing the keystream output of E0. Our best
                 attack finds the original encryption key for two-level
                 E0 using the first 24 bits of $2^{23.8}$ frames and
                 with $2^{38}$ computations. This is clearly the fastest
                 and only practical known-plaintext attack on Bluetooth
                 encryption compared with all existing attacks. Current
                 experiments confirm our analysis.",

                 primitive. They are used to obtain a fixed-size
                 fingerprint, or hash value, of an arbitrary long
                 message. We focus particularly on the class of
                 dedicated hash functions, whose general construction is
                 presented; the peculiar arrangement of sequential and
                 combinational units makes the application of pipelining
                 techniques to these constructions not trivial. We
                 formalize here an optimization technique called
                 quasipipelining, whose goal is to optimize the critical
                 path and thus to increase the clock frequency in
                 dedicated hardware implementations. The SHA-2 algorithm
                 has been previously examined by Dadda et al., with
                 specific versions of quasipipelining; here, a full
                 generalization of the technique is presented, along
                 with application to the SHA-1 algorithm.
                 Quasi-pipelining could be as well applied to future
                 hashing algorithms, provided they are designed along
                 the same lines as those of the SHA family.",

                 lookup structures applicable to simplified evaluation
                 of the modular operations ``multiplicative inverse'',
                 ``discrete log'', and ``exponential residue'' in the
                 particular modulus $2^k$. Regarding applications, we
                 describe an integer representation system of Benschop
                 for transforming integer multiplications into additions
                 which benefits from our table lookup function
                 evaluation procedures.\par We focus herein on the
                 multiplicative inverse modulo $2^k$ to exhibit
                 simplifications in hardware implementations realized
                 from the inheritance property. A table lookup structure
                 given by a bit string that can be interpreted with
                 reference to a binary tree is described and analyzed.
                 Using observed symmetries, the lookup structure size is
                 reduced allowing a novel direct lookup process for
                 multiplicative inverses for all 16-bit odd integers to
                 be obtained from a table of size less than two KBytes.
                 The 16-bit multiplicative inverse operation is also
                 applicable for providing a seed inverse for obtaining
                 32/64-bit multiplicative inverses by one/two iterations
                 of a known quadratic refinement algorithm.",

                 algorithm (LLL or $L^3$) is a very popular tool in
                 public-key cryptanalysis and in many other fields.
                 Given an integer $d$-dimensional lattice basis with
                 vectors of norm less than $B$ in an $n$-dimensional
                 space, $L^3$ outputs a so-called $L^3$-reduced basis in
                 polynomial time $O(d^5 n \log^3 B)$, using arithmetic
                 operations on integers of bit-length $O(d log B)$. This
                 worst-case complexity is problematic for lattices
                 arising in cryptanalysis where $d$ or/and $\log B$ are
                 often large. As a result, the original $L^3$ is almost
                 never used in practice. Instead, one applies
                 floating-point variants of $L^3$, where the
                 long-integer arithmetic required by Gram--Schmidt
                 orthogonalisation (central in $L^3$) is replaced by
                 floating-point arithmetic. Unfortunately, this is known
                 to be unstable in the worst-case: the usual
                 floating-point $L^3$ is not even guaranteed to
                 terminate, and the output basis may not be
                 $L^3$-reduced at all. In this article, we introduce the
                 $L^2$ algorithm, a new and natural floating-point
                 variant of $L^3$ which provably outputs $L^3$-reduced
                 bases in polynomial time $O(d^4 n (d + \log B) \log
                 B)$. This is the first $L^3$ algorithm whose running
                 time (without fast integer arithmetic) provably grows
                 only quadratically with respect to $\log B$, like the
                 well-known Euclidean and Gaussian algorithms, which it
                 generalizes.",

                 patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of
                 cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent
                 table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged
                 process to attack other processes running in parallel
                 on the same processor, despite partitioning methods
                 such as memory protection, sandboxing and
                 virtualization. Some of our methods require only the
                 ability to trigger services that perform encryption or
                 MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk
                 partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we
                 demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which
                 requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts
                 nor ciphertexts, and works by merely monitoring the
                 effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We
                 discuss in detail several such attacks on AES, and
                 experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real
                 systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux's {\tt dm-crypt}
                 encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key
                 can be recovered after just 800 writes to the
                 partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we

  abstract =     "This paper is about how to keep data for a finite
                 time, and then make it unrecoverable after that. It is
                 difficult to ensure that data is completely destroyed.
                 To be available before expiration it is desirable to
                 create backup copies. Then absolute deletion becomes
                 difficult, because even after explicitly deleting it,
                 copies might remain on backup media, or in swap space,
                 or be forensically recoverable. The obvious solution is
                 to store the data encrypted, and then delete the key
                 after expiration. The key is somewhat easier to manage,
                 because it is smaller, but there is still the issue of
                 needing to make the key reliably available for some
                 time, and then reliably destroyed. It is difficult
                 enough for a user to manage one key, much less
                 different keys for different data expiration times. The
                 user could keep each key on a tamper-proof smart card
                 with no copies, but then the data will be lost
                 prematurely if the user loses the smart card. And smart
                 cards are expensive. So the idea in this paper is to
                 concentrate all the key management expense and
                 expertise in one place, a server we call an
                 ``ephemerizer''. The ephemerizer creates keys, makes
                 them available for encryption, aids in decryption, and
                 destroys the keys at the appropriate time. The design
                 in this paper ensure that even if a client's machine
                 gets compromised, and everything in stable storage
                 (including long term user keys) is stolen, any data
                 that has expired before the compromise remains
                 unrecoverable.\par

                 The paper starts with a description of an existing
                 commercial scheme, and presents improvements to that
                 scheme to eliminate the necessity for per-message
                 state. Then it presents a new approach, based on public
                 keys, and presents an initial design, and then a more
                 efficient version using a new concept closely related
                 to blind signatures, that we call ``blind
                 decryption''.",

                 cryptographic systems. Most well known modular
                 reduction methods including Barrett's and Montgomery's
                 algorithms leverage some-pre computations to avoid
                 divisions so that the main complexity of these methods
                 lies in a sequence of two long multiplications. For
                 large wordlengths a multiplication which is tantamount
                 to a linear convolution is performed via the Fast
                 Fourier Transform (FFT) or other transform-based
                 techniques as in the Schonhage-Strassen multiplication
                 algorithm.\par

                 We show a fundamental property (the separation
                 principle): in a modular reduction based on long
                 multiplications, the linear convolution required by one
                 of the two long multiplications can be replaced by a
                 cyclic convolution, and the halves can be separated
                 using other information available due to the intrinsic
                 redundancy of the operations. This reduces the number
                 of operations by about 25\%. We demonstrate that both
                 Barrett's and Montgomery's methods can be sped up by
                 using the aforementioned fundamental principle. It is
                 shown that a direct application of this algorithm to
                 modular exponentiation (either using Barrett's or
                 Montgomery's methods) can be expected to yield about
                 17\% speedup.",

                 as a starting point for those familiar with basic
                 concepts of computers and computations and who would
                 like to extend their knowledge into the realm of
                 computer and network security. Its comprehensive
                 treatment of all the major areas of computer security
                 aims to give readers a complete foundation in the field
                 of Computer Security. Exercises are given throughout
                 the book and are intended to strengthening the reader?s
                 knowledge - answers are also provided.\par

                 Written in a clear, easy to understand style, aimed
                 towards advanced undergraduates and non-experts who
                 want to know about the security problems confronting
                 them everyday. The technical level of the book is low
                 and requires no mathematics, and only a basic concept
                 of computers and computations. Foundations of Computer
                 Security will be an invaluable tool for students and
                 professionals alike.",

                 insufficiently shielded from external monitoring. Here
                 several standard multipliers are investigated in more
                 detail in order to provide the foundation for
                 understanding potential weaknesses and enabling the
                 subsequent successful repair of those systems. A model
                 is built which accurately predicts power use as a
                 function of the Hamming weights of inputs without the
                 combinatorial explosion of exhaustive simulation. This
                 confirms that power use is indeed data dependent at
                 least for those multipliers. Laboratory experiments
                 confirm that EMR also corresponds closely to these
                 power predictions over a wide range of frequencies.",

                 of SHA1 can be found with complexity less than $2^{69}$

  abstract =     "After many Internet-scale worm incidents in recent
                 years, it is clear that a simple self-propagating worm
                 can quickly spread across the Internet and cause severe
                 damage to our society. Facing this great security
                 threat, we need to build an early detection system that
                 can detect the presence of a worm in the Internet as
                 quickly as possible in order to give people accurate
                 early warning information and possible reaction time
                 for counteractions. This paper first presents an
                 Internet worm monitoring system. Then, based on the
                 idea of ``detecting the trend, not the burst'' of
                 monitored illegitimate traffic, we present a ``trend
                 detection'' methodology to detect a worm at its early
                 propagation stage by using Kalman filter estimation,
                 which is robust to background noise in the monitored
                 data. In addition, for uniform-scan worms such as Code
                 Red, we can effectively predict the overall vulnerable
                 population size, and estimate accurately how many
                 computers are really infected in the global Internet
                 based on the biased monitored data. For monitoring a
                 nonuniform scan worm, especially a sequential-scan worm
                 such as Blaster, we show that it is crucial for the
                 address space covered by the worm monitoring system to
                 be as distributed as possible.",

  abstract =     "Very recently, a new software side-channel attack,
                 called Branch Prediction Analysis (BPA) attack, has
                 been discovered and also demonstrated to be practically
                 feasible on popular commodity PC platforms. While the
                 above recent attack still had the flavor of a classical
                 timing attack against RSA, where one uses many
                 execution-time measurements under the same key in order
                 to statistically amplify some small but key-dependent
                 timing differences, we dramatically improve upon the
                 former result. We prove that a carefully written
                 spy-process running simultaneously with an RSA-process,
                 is able to collect during one \emph{single} RSA signing
                 execution almost all of the secret key bits. We call
                 such an attack, analyzing the CPU's Branch Predictor
                 states through spying on a single quasi-parallel
                 computation process, a \emph{Simple Branch Prediction
                 Analysis (SBPA)} attack --- sharply differentiating it
                 from those one relying on statistical methods and
                 requiring many computation measurements under the same
                 key. The successful extraction of almost all secret key
                 bits by our SBPA attack against an openSSL RSA
                 implementation proves that the often recommended
                 blinding or so called randomization techniques to
                 protect RSA against side-channel attacks are, in the
                 context of SBPA attacks, totally useless. Additional to
                 that very crucial security implication, targeted at
                 such implementations which are assumed to be at least
                 statistically secure, our successful SBPA attack also
                 bears another equally critical security implication.
                 Namely, in the context of simple side-channel attacks,
                 it is widely believed that equally balancing the
                 operations after branches is a secure countermeasure
                 against such simple attacks. Unfortunately, this is not
                 true, as even such ``balanced branch'' implementations
                 can be completely broken by our SBPA attacks. Moreover,
                 despite sophisticated hardware-assisted partitioning
                 methods such as memory protection, sandboxing or even
                 virtualization, SBPA attacks empower an unprivileged
                 process to successfully attack other processes running
                 in parallel on the same processor. Thus, we conclude
                 that SBPA attacks are much more dangerous than
                 previously anticipated, as they obviously do not belong
                 to the same category as pure timing attacks.",

                 privacy preserving access rights that permit access to
                 a large collection of digital goods. {\em
                 Privacy-preserving\/} access control means that the
                 service provider can neither learn what access rights a
                 customer has nor link a request to access an item to a
                 particular customer, thus maintaining privacy of both
                 customer activity and customer access rights. {\em
                 Flexible\/} access rights allow a customer to choose a
                 subset of items or groups of items from the repository,
                 obtain access to and be charged only for the items
                 selected. And {\em portability\/} of access rights
                 means that the rights themselves can be stored on small
                 devices of limited storage space and computational
                 capabilities such as smartcards or sensors, and
                 therefore the rights must be enforced using the limited
                 resources available. In this paper, we present and
                 compare two schemes that address the problem of such
                 access rights. We show that much can be achieved if one
                 allows for even a negligible amount of false positives
                 &\#x2013; items that were not requested by the
                 customer, but inadvertently were included in the
                 customer access right representation due to constrained
                 space resources. But minimizing false positives is one
                 of many other desiderata that include protection
                 against sharing of false positives information by
                 unscrupulous users, providing the users with
                 transaction untraceability and unlinkability, and
                 forward compatibility of the scheme. Our first scheme
                 does not place any constraints on the amount of space
                 available on the limited-capacity storage device, and
                 searches for the best representation that meets the
                 requirements. The second scheme, on the other hand, has
                 (modest) requirements on the storage space available,
                 but guarantees a low rate of false positives: with
                 $O(mc)$ storage space available on the smartcard (where
                 $m$ is the number of items or groups of items included
                 in the subscription and $c$ is a selectable parameter),
                 it achieves a rate of false positives of $m^{-c}$.",

                 security that cast students successively in the roles
                 of computer user, programmer, and system administrator.
                 Unlike experiments described in several previous
                 papers, these experiments avoid placing students in the
                 role of attacker. Each experiment starts with an
                 in-class demonstration of an attack by the instructor.
                 Students then learn how to use open-source defense
                 tools appropriate for the role they are playing and the
                 attack at hand. Threats covered include eavesdropping,
                 dictionary, man-in-the-middle, port scanning, and
                 fingerprinting attacks. Defense skills gained by
                 students include how to forward ports with OpenSSH, how
                 to prevent weak passwords with CrackLib, how to salt
                 passwords, how to set up a simple certifying authority,
                 issue and verify certificates, and guarantee
                 communication confidentiality and integrity using
                 OpenSSL, and how to set up firewalls and IPsec-based
                 virtual private networks. At two separate offerings,
                 tests taken before and after each experiment showed
                 that each has a statistically significant and large
                 effect on students' learning. Moreover, surveys show
                 that students finish the sequence of experiments with
                 high interest in further studies and work in the area
                 of security. These results suggest that the experiments
                 are well-suited for introductory security or networking

  abstract =     "Visual cryptography schemes allow the encoding of a
                 secret image, consisting of black or white pixels, into
                 n shares which are distributed to the participants. The
                 shares are such that only qualified subsets of
                 participants can `visually' recover the secret image.
                 The secret pixels are shared with techniques that
                 subdivide each secret pixel into a certain number $m$,
                 $m \geq 2$ of subpixels. Such a parameter $m$ is called
                 pixel expansion. Recently Yang introduced a
                 probabilistic model. In such a model the pixel
                 expansion $m$ is $1$, that is, there is no pixel
                 expansion. The reconstruction of the image however is
                 probabilistic, meaning that a secret pixel will be
                 correctly reconstructed only with a certain
                 probability. In this paper we propose a generalization
                 of the model proposed by Yang. In our model we fix the
                 pixel expansion $m \geq 1$ that can be tolerated and we
                 consider probabilistic schemes attaining such a pixel
                 expansion. For $m = 1$ our model reduces to the one of
                 Yang. For big enough values of $m$, for which a
                 deterministic scheme exists, our model reduces to the
                 classical deterministic model. We show that between
                 these two extremes one can trade the probability factor
                 of the scheme with the pixel expansion. Moreover, we
                 prove that there is a one-to-one mapping between
                 deterministic schemes and probabilistic schemes with no
                 pixel expansion, where contrast is traded for the
                 probability factor.",

                 potential for implementing ciphers within GPUs, and
                 describes the relevance of GPU-based encryption to the
                 security of applications involving remote displays. As
                 the processing power of GPUs increases, research
                 involving the use of GPUs for general purpose computing
                 has arisen. This work extends such research by
                 considering the use of a GPU as a parallel processor
                 for encrypting data. The authors evaluate the
                 operations found in symmetric and asymmetric key
                 ciphers to determine if encryption can be programmed in
                 existing GPUs. A detailed description for a GPU based
                 implementation of AES is provided. The feasibility of
                 GPU-based encryption allows the authors to explore the
                 use of a GPU as a trusted system component. Unencrypted
                 display data can be confined to the GPU to avoid
                 exposing it to any malware running on the operating
                 system.''",

  abstract =     "This paper proposes a stack of three
                 Byzantine-resistant protocols aimed to be used in
                 practical distributed systems: multi-valued consensus,
                 vector consensus and atomic broadcast. These protocols
                 are designed as successive transformations from one to
                 another. The first protocol, multi-valued consensus, is
                 implemented on top of a randomized binary consensus and
                 a reliable broadcast protocol. The protocols share a
                 set of important structural properties. First, they do
                 not use digital signatures constructed with public-key
                 cryptography, a well-known performance bottleneck in
                 this kind of protocols. Second, they are time-free,
                 i.e. they make no synchrony assumptions, since these
                 assumptions are often vulnerable to subtle but
                 effective attacks. Third, they are completely
                 decentralized, thus avoiding the cost of detecting
                 corrupt leaders. Fourth, they have optimal resilience,
                 i.e. they tolerate the failure of $f =
                 \lfloor(n-1)/3\rfloor$ out of a total of $n$ processes.
                 In terms of time complexity, the multi-valued consensus
                 protocol terminates in a constant expected number of
                 rounds, while the vector consensus and atomic broadcast
                 protocols have $O(f)$ complexity. The paper also proves
                 the equivalence between multi-valued consensus and
                 atomic broadcast in the Byzantine failure model without
                 signatures. A similar proof is given for the
                 equivalence between multi-valued consensus and vector
                 consensus. These two results have theoretical relevance
                 since they show once more that consensus is a
                 fundamental problem in distributed systems.",

                 curve cryptosystem implemented on UC Berkley's TinyOS
                 operating system for wireless sensor networks. The
                 attack exploits the short period of the pseudorandom
                 number generator (PRNG) used by the cryptosystem to
                 generate private keys. The attack assumes a laptop is
                 listening promiscuously to network traffic for key
                 messages and requires only the sensor node's public key
                 and network address to discover the private key.
                 Experimental results show that roughly 50\% of the
                 address space leads to a private key compromise in 25
                 minutes on average. Furthermore, approximately 32\% of
                 the address space leads to a compromise in 17 minutes
                 on average, 11\% in 6 minutes, and the remaining 7\% in
                 2 minutes or less. Two alternatives to the PRNG are
                 examined that mitigate the brute-force attack. The
                 alternatives are implemented on the Mica2 mote and
                 examined to determine CPU cycles for execution and
                 memory requirements. The recommended PRNG requires 73
                 CPU cycles in the worst case and uses 66 bytes of
                 memory. The period of the PRNG is uniform for all mote
                 addresses and theoretically requires 6.6 years on
                 average for a key compromise for the attack used in
                 this thesis.",

                 password-based authenticated key exchange protocols, in
                 the common reference string model. Our protocol is
                 actually an abstraction of the key exchange protocol of
                 Katz et al. and is based on the recently introduced
                 notion of smooth projective hashing by Cramer and
                 Shoup. We gain a number of benefits from this
                 abstraction. First, we obtain a modular protocol that
                 can be described using just three high-level
                 cryptographic tools. This allows a simple and intuitive
                 understanding of its security. Second, our proof of
                 security is significantly simpler and more modular.
                 Third, we are able to derive analogs to the Katz et al.
                 protocol under additional cryptographic assumptions.
                 Specifically, in addition to the DDH assumption used by
                 Katz et al., we obtain protocols under both the
                 quadratic and N-residuosity assumptions. In order to
                 achieve this, we construct new smooth projective hash

  abstract =     "We study the problem of multicast key distribution for
                 group security. Secure group communication systems
                 typically rely on a group key, which is a secret shared
                 among the members of the group. This key is used to
                 provide privacy by encrypting all group communications.
                 Because groups can be large and highly dynamic, it
                 becomes necessary to change the group key in a scalable
                 and secure fashion when members join and leave the
                 group. We present a series of algorithms for solving
                 this problem based on key trees. The algorithms attempt
                 to minimize the worst-case communication cost of
                 updates by maintaining balanced key tree structures. We
                 focus on the trade-off between the communication cost
                 because of the structure of the tree and that due to
                 the overhead of restructuring the tree to maintain its
                 balanced structure. The algorithms are analyzed for
                 worst-case tree structure bounds and evaluated
                 empirically via simulations.",

  abstract =     "Cryptographic transformations are a fundamental
                 building block in many security applications and
                 protocols. To improve performance, several vendors
                 market hardware accelerator cards. However, until now
                 no operating system provided a mechanism that allowed
                 both uniform and efficient use of this new type of
                 resource. We present the OpenBSD Cryptographic
                 Framework (OCF), a service virtualization layer
                 implemented inside the operating system kernel, that
                 provides uniform access to accelerator functionality by
                 hiding card-specific details behind a carefully
                 designed API. We evaluate the impact of the OCF in a
                 variety of benchmarks, measuring overall system
                 performance, application throughput and latency, and
                 aggregate throughput when multiple applications make
                 use of it. We conclude that the OCF is extremely
                 efficient in utilizing cryptographic accelerator
                 functionality, attaining 95\% of the theoretical peak
                 device performance and over 800 Mbps aggregate
                 throughput using 3DES. We believe that this validates
                 our decision to opt for ease of use by applications and
                 kernel components through a uniform API and for
                 seamless support for new accelerators. Furthermore, our
                 evaluation points to several bottlenecks in system and
                 operating system design: data copying between user and
                 kernel modes, PCI bus signaling inefficiency, protocols
                 that use small data units, and single-threaded
                 applications. We identify some of these limitations
                 through a set of measurements focusing on
                 application-layer cryptographic protocols such as SSL.
                 We offer several suggestions for improvements and
                 directions for future work. We provide experimental
                 evidence of the effectiveness of a new approach which
                 we call operating system shortcutting. Shortcutting can
                 improve the performance of application-layer
                 cryptographic protocols by 27\% with very small changes
                 to the kernel.",

                 number systems and asks the following question: given a
                 nonnegative decimal number, what is the value of the
                 digit at position in the corresponding base number?
                 Thus, we do not require the knowledge of other digits
                 except the one we are interested in. Accordingly, we
                 present a conversion function that relates each digit
                 in a base system to the decimal value that is equal to
                 the base number in question. We also show some
                 applications of this new algorithm in the areas of
                 parallel computing and cryptography.",

  abstract =     "We present a novel way to implement the
                 secret-sharing-based family of revocation schemes of
                 Naor and Pinkas [2003]. The basic scheme of [Naor and
                 Pinkas 2000] uses Shamir's polynomial secret-sharing to
                 revoke up to r users, where r is the degree of the
                 secret-sharing polynomial, and it is information
                 theoretically secure against coalitions of up to r
                 collaborators. The nonrevoked users use Lagrange
                 interpolation in order to compute the new key. Our
                 basic scheme uses a novel modification of Shamir's
                 polynomial secret-sharing: The secret equals the
                 leading coefficient of the polynomial (as opposed to
                 the free coefficient as in the original scheme) and the
                 polynomial is reconstructed by Newton interpolation
                 (rather than Lagrange interpolation). Comparing our
                 scheme to one variant of the Naor--Pinkas scheme, we
                 offer revocation messages that are shorter by a factor
                 of almost 2, while the computation cost at the user end
                 is smaller by a constant factor of approximately 13/2.
                 Comparing to a second variant of the Naor--Pinkas
                 scheme, our scheme offers a reduction of O ( r ) in the
                 computation cost at the user end, without affecting any
                 of the other performance parameters. We then extend our
                 basic scheme to perform multiround revocation for
                 stateless and stateful receivers, along the lines
                 offered by Naor and Pinkas [2000] and Kogan et al.
                 [2003]. We show that using Newton rather than Lagrange
                 interpolants enables a significantly more efficient
                 transmission of the new revocation message and shorter
                 response time for each round. Pay TV systems that
                 implement broadcast encryption techniques can benefit
                 significantly from the improved efficiency offered by
                 our revocation schemes.",

  abstract =     "We show the first power analysis attack on passive
                 RFID tags. Compared to standard power analysis attacks,
                 this attack is unique in that it requires no physical
                 contact with the device under attack. While the
                 specific attack described here requires the attacker to
                 actually transmit data to the tag under attack, the
                 power analysis part itself requires only a receive
                 antenna. This means that a variant of this attack can
                 be devised such that the attacker is completely passive
                 while it is acquiring the data, making the attack very
                 hard to detect.\par

                 As a proof of concept, we describe a password
                 extraction attack on Class 1 Generation 1 EPC tags
                 operating in the UHF frequency range. The attack
                 presented below lets an adversary discover the kill
                 password of such a tag and, then, disable it. The
                 attack can be readily adapted to finding the access and
                 kill passwords of Gen 2 tags.\par

                 The main significance of our attack is in its
                 implications --- any cryptographic functionality built
                 into tags needs to be designed to be resistant to power
                 analysis, and achieving this resistance is an
                 undertaking which has an effect both on the price and
                 on the read range of tags.",

                 cryptology: on the one hand, elliptic and hyperelliptic
                 curve cryptosystems are increasingly employed as
                 public-key cryptosystems. On the other hand,
                 cryptanalytical alorithms for attacking cryptosystems
                 utilize algebraic curves. Examples include the elliptic

                 propose different hardware architectures for
                 cryptanalytical algorithms, resulting in a security
                 evaluation of particular symmetric and asymmetric
                 cryptosystems against attacks with special-purpose
                 hardware. Our implementations in software as well as in
                 hardware form the basis for such an analysis und stress
                 the paramount importance of an efficient implementation
                 or arithmetic primitives regarding the overall
                 performance of cryptologic algorithms. In addition, we
                 present the concept and realization of a cost-optimized
                 and reprogrammable code-breaker which is based on
                 contemporary low-cost FPGAs.",

  publishersnote = "Zero-knowledge proofs are fascinating and extremely
                 useful constructs. They have a seemingly contradictory
                 definition: zero-knowledge proofs are both convincing
                 and yet yield nothing beyond the validity of the
                 assertion being proved. Their applicability in the
                 domain of cryptography is considerable.

                 A fundamental question regarding zero-knowledge
                 protocols refers to the preservation of security when
                 many instances of the protocol are executed
                 concurrently, and in particular under a purely
                 asynchronous model. The practical importance of this
                 question, in the days of extensive Internet
                 communication, seems clear. This question is also very
                 interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, and it serves
                 as a benchmark for the study of the security of
                 concurrent executions of protocols and has led to the
                 development of techniques for coping with problems that
                 arise in that setting.

                 Protocols that remain zero-knowledge when many
                 instances are executed concurrently are called
                 concurrent zero-knowledge, and this book is devoted to
                 their study. It presents constructions of concurrent
                 zero-knowledge protocols, along with proofs of security
                 for these protocols. It also shows why ``traditional''
                 proof techniques (i.e., black-box simulations) are not
                 suitable for establishing the concurrent zero-knowledge
                 property of ``round-efficient'' protocols.",

  abstract =     "Side channel cryptanalysis attempts to exploit
                 physical leakages of cipher implementations in order to
                 extract secret key information. The dissertation at
                 hand provides a detailed insight into new and refined
                 side channel attacks and corresponding countermeasures.
                 The attacks proposed in this thesis embrace internal
                 collision attacks against the Data Encryption Standard
                 (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the
                 block ciphers Serpent and Kasumi. Moreover, an attack
                 which combines the multivariate classification of side
                 channel signals and classic Differential Power Analysis
                 (DPA) is presented.\par

                 The blinding of intermediate, key-dependent variables
                 in a cipher with randomized masks is the most common
                 countermeasure against side channel attacks. In this
                 thesis various variants of the masking countermeasure
                 are investigated and performance figures are given.
                 Furthermore, security aspects are examined. For
                 example, it is shown that masked hardware
                 implementations may not prevent side channel attacks
                 due to glitching activities in masked circuits.",

  abstract =     "The large size and high complexity of
                 security-sensitive applications and systems software is
                 a primary cause for their poor testability and high
                 vulnerability. One approach to alleviate this problem
                 is to extract the security-sensitive parts of
                 application and systems software, thereby reducing the
                 size and complexity of software that needs to be
                 trusted. At the system software level, we use the Nizza
                 architecture which relies on a kernelized trusted
                 computing base (TCB) and on the reuse of legacy code
                 using trusted wrappers to minimize the size of the TCB.
                 At the application level, we extract the
                 security-sensitive portions of an already existing
                 application into an AppCore. The AppCore is executed as
                 a trusted process in the Nizza architecture while the
                 rest of the application executes on a virtualized,
                 untrusted legacy operating system. In three case
                 studies of real-world applications (e-commerce
                 transaction client, VPN gateway and digital signatures
                 in an e-mail client), we achieved a considerable
                 reduction in code size and complexity. In contrast to
                 the few hundred thousand lines of current application
                 software code running on millions of lines of systems
                 software code, we have AppCores with tens of thousands
                 of lines of code running on a hundred thousand lines of
                 systems software code. We also show the performance
                 penalty of AppCores to be modest (a few percent)
                 compared to current software.",

  abstract =     "Sketching is a software synthesis approach where the
                 programmer develops a partial implementation --- a
                 sketch --- and a separate specification of the desired
                 functionality. The synthesizer then completes the
                 sketch to behave like the specification. The
                 correctness of the synthesized implementation is
                 guaranteed by the compiler, which allows, among other
                 benefits, rapid development of highly tuned
                 implementations without the fear of introducing bugs.
                 We develop SKETCH, a language for finite programs with
                 linguistic support for sketching. Finite programs
                 include many high-performance kernels, including
                 cryptocodes. In contrast to prior synthesizers, which
                 had to be equipped with domain-specific rules, SKETCH
                 completes sketches by means of a combinatorial search
                 based on generalized boolean satisfiability.
                 Consequently, our combinatorial synthesizer is complete
                 for the class of finite programs: it is guaranteed to
                 complete any sketch in theory, and in practice has
                 scaled to realistic programming problems. Freed from
                 domain rules, we can now write sketches as
                 simple-to-understand partial programs, which are
                 regular programs in which difficult code fragments are
                 replaced with holes to be filled by the synthesizer.
                 Holes may stand for index expressions, lookup tables,
                 or bitmasks, but the programmer can easily define new
                 kinds of holes using a single versatile synthesis
                 operator. We have used SKETCH to synthesize an
                 efficient implementation of the AES cipher standard.
                 The synthesizer produces the most complex part of the
                 implementation and runs in about an hour.",

                 the Java virtual machine of a Java Card. The system is
                 designed for flash-based implementations of Java Card,
                 a variant of the Java platform for smart cards. In the
                 Java Card platform, objects are persistent by default.
                 The platform supports transactions: a sequence of
                 accesses to objects can be explicitly declared to
                 constitute a transaction. TinyStore supports explicit

                 are equivalent to those existing today for wire-based
                 networks. This volume is an authoritative,
                 clearly-presented guide to key foundation topics and
                 technology frameworks for designing and maintaining
                 secure, reliable operations. From basic concepts to
                 designing principles to deployment, all critical
                 concepts and phases are explained in detail. The book
                 also includes coverage of wireless security testing
                 techniques and intrusion prevention
                 techniques.\par

                 Through extensive hands-on examples, Guide to Wireless

                 search stands out as the most successful (albeit the

                 algorithmic implementations of exhaustive key search
                 are not equally effective, and cryptosystems can be
                 devised which make some implementations of exhaustive
                 key search unsuccessful (in the sense that the problem
                 these algorithms try to solve turns out to be
                 incomputable). We observe that there are
                 implementations of exhaustive key search that are
                 always successful (i.e. they terminate and generate a
                 correct result irrespective of the cryptosystem they
                 are used against). As to those implementations of
                 exhaustive key search that are not always successful,
                 we describe them and those cryptosystems that can make
                 them unsuccessful.",

                 participants A and B, communicating over a public
                 network and each holding an authentication means to
                 exchange a shared secret value. Methods designed to
                 deal with this cryptographic problem ensure A (resp. B

                 has actually computed this value. A natural extension
                 to this cryptographic method is to consider a pool of
                 participants exchanging a shared secret value and to
                 provide a formal treatment for it. Starting from the
                 famous two-party Diffie--Hellman (DH) key-exchange

                 experts have extended it to the multiparty setting for

                 formal analysis in the framework of modern
                 cryptography. The present paper synthesizes this body

  abstract =     "The challenges hidden in the implementation of
                 high-level process calculi into low-level environments
                 are well understood [3]. This paper develops a secure
                 implementation of a typed pi calculus, in which
                 capability types are employed to realize the policies
                 for the access to communication channels. Our
                 implementation compiles high-level processes of the
                 pi-calculus into low-level principals of a
                 cryptographic process calculus based on the applied-pi
                 calculus [1]. In this translation, the high-level type
                 capabilities are implemented as term capabilities
                 protected by encryption keys only known to the intended
                 receivers. As such, the implementation is effective
                 even when the compiled, low-level principals are
                 deployed in open contexts for which no assumption on
                 trust and behavior may be made. Our technique and
                 results draw on, and extend, previous work on secure
                 implementation of channel abstractions in a dialect of
                 the join calculus [2]. In particular, our translation
                 preserves the forward secrecy of communications in a
                 calculus that includes matching and supports the
                 dynamic exchange of write and read access-rights among
                 processes. We establish the adequacy and full
                 abstraction of the implementation by contrasting the
                 untyped equivalences of the low-level cryptographic
                 calculus, with the typed equivalences of the high-level
                 source calculus.",

  abstract =     "Self-modifying code (SMC), in this paper, broadly
                 refers to any program that loads, generates, or mutates
                 code at runtime. It is widely used in many of the
                 world's critical software systems to support runtime
                 code generation and optimization, dynamic loading and
                 linking, OS boot loader, just-in-time compilation,
                 binary translation,or dynamic code encryption and
                 obfuscation. Unfortunately, SMC is also extremely
                 difficult to reason about: existing formal verification
                 techniques-including Hoare logic and type
                 system-consistently assume that program code stored in
                 memory is fixed and immutable; this severely limits
                 their applicability and power.\par

                 This paper presents a simple but novel Hoare-logic-like
                 framework that supports modular verification of general
                 von-Neumann machine code with runtime code
                 manipulation. By dropping the assumption that code
                 memory is fixed and immutable, we are forced to apply
                 local reasoning and separation logic at the very
                 beginning, and treat program code uniformly as regular
                 data structure. We address the interaction between
                 separation and code memory and show how to establish
                 the frame rules for local reasoning even in the
                 presence of SMC. Our framework is realistic, but
                 designed to be highly generic, so that it can support
                 assembly code under all modern CPUs (including both x86
                 and MIPS). Our system is expressive and fully
                 mechanized. We prove its soundness in the Coq proof
                 assistant and demonstrate its power by certifying a
                 series of realistic examples and applications-all of
                 which can directly run on the SPIM simulator or any
                 stock x86 hardware.",

  abstract =     "Fingerprinting embeds a secret message into a cover
                 message. In media fingerprinting, the secret is usually
                 a copyright notice and the cover a digital image.
                 Fingerprinting an object discourages intellectual
                 property theft, or when such theft has occurred, allows
                 us to prove ownership.\par

                 The Software Fingerprinting problem can be described as
                 follows. Embed a structure W into a program P such
                 that: W can be reliably located and extracted from P
                 even after P has been subjected to code transformations
                 such as translation, optimization and obfuscation; W is
                 stealthy; W has a high data rate; embedding W into P
                 does not adversely affect the performance of P; and W
                 has a mathematical property that allows us to argue
                 that its presence in P is the result of deliberate
                 actions.\par

                 In this article, we describe a software fingerprinting
                 technique in which a dynamic graph fingerprint is
                 stored in the execution state of a program. Because of
                 the hardness of pointer alias analysis such
                 fingerprints are difficult to attack automatically.",

  abstract =     "One of the major recent trends in computing has been
                 towards so-called smart devices, such as PDAs, cell
                 phones and sensors. Such devices tend to have a feature
                 in common: limited computational capabilities and
                 equally limited power, as most operate on batteries.
                 This makes them ill-suited for public key signatures.
                 This article explores practical and conceptual
                 implications of using Server-Aided Signatures (SAS) for
                 these devices. SAS is a signature method that relies on
                 partially-trusted servers for generating (normally
                 expensive) public key signatures for regular users.
                 Although the primary goal is to aid small,
                 resource-limited devices in signature generation, SAS
                 also offers fast certificate revocation, signature
                 causality and reliable timestamping. It also has some
                 interesting features such as built-in attack detection
                 for users and DoS resistance for servers. Our
                 experimental results also validate the feasibility of
                 deploying SAS on smart devices.",

  abstract =     "The pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used by the
                 Windows operating system is the most commonly used
                 PRNG. The pseudo-randomness of the output of this
                 generator is crucial for the security of almost any
                 application running in Windows. Nevertheless, its exact
                 algorithm was never published.\par

                 We examined the binary code of a distribution of
                 Windows 2000, which is still the second most popular
                 operating system after Windows XP. (This investigation
                 was done without any help from Microsoft.) We
                 reconstructed, for the first time, the algorithm used
                 by the pseudo-random number generator (namely, the
                 function CryptGenRandom). We analyzed the security of
                 the algorithm and found a non-trivial attack: given the
                 internal state of the generator, the previous state can
                 be computed in $O(2^{23})$ work (this is an attack on
                 the forward-security of the generator, an $O(1)$ attack
                 on backward security is trivial). The attack on
                 forward-security demonstrates that the design of the
                 generator is flawed, since it is well known how to
                 prevent such attacks.\par

                 We also analyzed the way in which the generator is run
                 by the operating system, and found that it amplifies
                 the effect of the attacks: The generator is run in user
                 mode rather than in kernel mode, and therefore it is
                 easy to access its state even without administrator
                 privileges. The initial values of part of the state of
                 the generator are not set explicitly, but rather are
                 defined by whatever values are present on the stack
                 when the generator is called.Furthermore, each process
                 runs a different copy of the generator, and the state
                 of the generator is refreshed with system generated
                 entropy only after generating 128 KBytes of output for
                 the process running it. The result of combining this
                 observation with our attack is that learning a single
                 state may reveal 128 Kbytes of the past and future
                 output of the generator.\par

                 The implication of these findings is that a buffer
                 overflow attack or a similar attack can be used to
                 learn a single state of the generator, which can then
                 be used to predict all random values, such as SSL keys,
                 used by a process in all its past and future operation.
                 This attack is more severe and more efficient than
                 known attacks, in which an attacker can only learn SSL
                 keys if it is controlling the attacked machine at the
                 time the keys are used.",

                 applications. Although extracting secrets out of
                 smartcards requires resources beyond the means of many
                 would-be thieves, the manner in which they are used can
                 be exploited for fraud. Cardholders authorize financial
                 transactions by presenting the card and disclosing a
                 PIN to a terminal without any assurance as to the
                 amount being charged or who is to be paid, and have no
                 means of discerning whether the terminal is authentic
                 or not. Even the most advanced smartcards cannot
                 protect customers from being defrauded by the simple
                 relaying of data from one location to another. We
                 describe the development of such an attack, and show
                 results from live experiments on the UK's EMV
                 implementation, Chip \& PIN. We discuss previously
                 proposed defences, and show that these cannot provide
                 the required security assurances. A new defence based
                 on a distance bounding protocol is described and
                 implemented, which requires only modest alterations to
                 current hardware and software. As far as we are aware,
                 this is the first complete design and implementation of
                 a secure distance bounding protocol. Future smartcard
                 generations could use this design to provide
                 cost-effective resistance to relay attacks, which are a
                 genuine threat to deployed applications. We also
                 discuss the security-economics impact to customers of
                 enhanced authentication mechanisms.",

                 architectural extension for providing improved access
                 to frequently occurring instructions. An optimizing
                 compiler can exploit an IRF by packing an application's
                 instructions, resulting in decreased code size, reduced
                 energy consumption and improved execution time
                 primarily due to a smaller footprint in the instruction
                 cache. The nature of the IRF also allows the execution
                 of packed instructions to overlap with instruction
                 fetch, thus providing a means for tolerating increased
                 fetch latencies, like those experienced by encrypted
                 ICs as well as the presence of low-power L0 caches.
                 Although previous research has focused on the direct
                 benefits of instruction packing, this paper explores
                 the use of increased fetch bandwidth provided by packed
                 instructions. Small L0 caches improve energy efficiency
                 but can increase execution time due to frequent cache
                 misses. We show that this penalty can be significantly
                 reduced by overlapping the execution of packed
                 instructions with miss stalls. The IRF can also be used
                 to supply additional instructions to a more aggressive
                 execution engine, effectively reducing dependence on
                 instruction cache bandwidth. This can improve energy
                 efficiency, in addition to providing additional
                 flexibility for evaluating various design tradeoffs in
                 a pipeline with asymmetric instruction bandwidth. Thus,
                 we show that the IRF is a complementary technique,
                 operating as a buffer tolerating fetch bottlenecks, as
                 well as providing additional fetch bandwidth for an
                 aggressive pipeline backend.",

                 based on the existence of two types of attack: a
                 meet-in-the-middle attack due to Odlyzko, and a
                 conservative extrapolation of the running times of the
                 best (known) lattice reduction schemes to recover the
                 private key. We show that there is in fact a continuum
                 of more efficient attacks between these two attacks. We
                 show that by combining lattice reduction and a
                 meet-in-the-middle strategy one can reduce the number
                 of loops in attacking the NTRUEncrypt private key from
                 $2^{84.2}$ to $2^{60.3}$, for the $k = 80$ parameter

                 there are certain space\slash time tradeoffs that can
                 be applied. Asymptotically our attack remains
                 exponential in the security parameter k, but it
                 dictates that NTRUEncrypt parameters must be chosen so
                 that the meet-in-the-middle attack has complexity $2^k$

                 proof for an NP relation $R(x,w)$ which only makes a
                 black-box use of a secure protocol for a related
                 multi-party functionality $f$. The latter protocol is
                 only required to be secure against a small number of
                 `honest but curious' players. As an application, we can
                 translate previous results on the efficiency of secure
                 multiparty computation to the domain of zero-knowledge,
                 improving over previous constructions of efficient
                 zero-knowledge proofs. In particular, if verifying $R$
                 on a witness of length $m$ can be done by a circuit $C$
                 of size $s$, and assuming one-way functions exist, we
                 get the following types of zero-knowledge proof
                 protocols.\par

                 \begin{description} \item[Approaching the witness
                 length.] If $C$ has constant depth over $\land$,
                 $\lor$, $\oplus$, $\lnot$ gates of unbounded fan-in, we
                 get a zero-knowledge protocol with communication
                 complexity $m $\cdot$ \poly(k) $\cdot$ \polylog(s)$,
                 where $k$ is a security parameter. Such a protocol can
                 be implemented in either the standard interactive model
                 or, following a trusted setup, in a non-interactive
                 model.\par

                 \item[`Constant-rate' zero-knowledge.] For an arbitrary
                 circuit $C$ of size $s$ and a bounded fan-in, we get a
                 zero-knowledge protocol with communication complexity
                 $O(s) + \poly(k)$. Thus, for large circuits, the ratio
                 between the communication complexity and the circuit
                 size approaches a constant. This improves over the
                 $O(ks)$ complexity of the best previous
                 protocols.\par

                 predictable i.e. that the source UDP port and DNS
                 transaction ID can be effectively predicted. A
                 predictability algorithm is described that, in optimal
                 conditions, provides very few guesses for the next
                 query (10 in the basic attack, and 1 in the advanced
                 attack), thereby overcoming whatever protection offered
                 by the transaction ID mechanism. This enables a much
                 more effective DNS cache poisoning than the currently
                 known attacks against BIND 9. The net effect is that
                 pharming attacks are feasible against BIND 9 caching
                 DNS servers, without the need to directly attack
                 neither DNS servers nor clients (PCs). The results are
                 applicable to all BIND 9 releases [1], when BIND (the

  abstract =     "Recent personal computers have high-spec CPUs and
                 plenty of memory. The motivation of this study is to
                 take these advantages in designing a tough and fast
                 key-stream generator. Natural controversies on using a
                 large state space for a generator are (1) effectiveness
                 is unclear, (2) slower generation speed, (3) expensive
                 initialization, and (4) costs in a hardware
                 implementation.\par

                 Our proposal is to combine a linear feedback shift
                 register (LFSR) and a uniform quasigroup filter with
                 memory of wordsize. We prove theorems which assure the
                 period and the distribution property of such
                 generators, answering to (1). As for (2), the
                 generation speed of a LFSR is independent of the state
                 size. In addition, we propose a filter based on integer
                 multiplication, which is rather fast in modern CPUs. We
                 analyze the algebraic degree of such filters. We answer
                 to (3) by a simple trick to use another small generator
                 to initialize LFSR while outputting. We have no answer
                 to (4), but comment that recent hardwares tend to have
                 larger memory and sophisticated instructions.\par

                 As a concrete example, we propose CryptMT stream
                 generator with period (no less than) $2^{19937} - 1$,
                 1241-dimensional equidistribution property, which is
                 sometimes faster than SNOW2.0 in modern CPUs.",

  abstract =     "Passive network measurement and packet header trace
                 collection are vital tools for network operation and
                 research. To protect a user's privacy, it is necessary
                 to anonymize header fields, particularly IP addresses.
                 To preserve the correlation between IP addresses,
                 prefix-preserving anonymization has been proposed. The
                 limitations of this approach for a high-performance
                 measurement system are the need for complex
                 cryptographic computations and potentially large
                 amounts of memory. We propose a new prefix-preserving
                 anonymization algorithm, top-hash subtree-replicated
                 anonymization (TSA), that features three novel
                 improvements: precomputation, replicated subtrees, and
                 top hashing. TSA makes anonymization practical to be
                 implemented on network processors or dedicated logic at
                 Gigabit rates. The performance of TSA is compared with
                 a conventional cryptography based prefix-preserving
                 anonymization scheme which utilizes caching. TSA
                 performs better as it requires no online cryptographic
                 computation and a small number of memory lookups per
                 packet. Our analytic comparison of the susceptibility
                 to attacks between conventional anonymization and our
                 approach shows that TSA performs better for small scale
                 attacks and comparably for medium scale attacks. The
                 processing cost for TSA is reduced by two orders of
                 magnitude and the memory requirements are a few
                 Megabytes. The ability to tune the memory requirements
                 and security level makes TSA ideal for a broad range of
                 network systems with different capabilities.",

                 works focusing on the protection of digital images,
                 audio, video, 3D virtual scenes, and software data from
                 unauthorized use and distribution. With the emerging
                 technology of the MPEG-4 standard, MPEG-4 scenes that
                 may include images, video, audio, and 3D objects can
                 easily be built using the text-based MPEG-4 XMT
                 standard. XMT allows content authors to exchange their
                 content with other authors, tools, or service providers
                 and facilitates interoperability with MPEG-4, X3D, and

                 needs to be applied into the MPEG-4 XMT structure and

  abstract =     "Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors
                 (ASIPs) are becoming increasingly popular in the world
                 of customized, application-driven System-on-Chip (SoC)
                 designs. Efficient ASIP design requires an iterative
                 architecture exploration loop---gradual refinement of
                 the processor architecture starting from an initial
                 template. To accomplish this task, design automation
                 tools are used to detect bottlenecks in embedded
                 applications, to implement application-specific
                 processor instructions, and to automatically generate
                 the required software tools (such as instruction-set
                 simulator, C-compiler, assembler, and profiler), as
                 well as to synthesize the hardware. This paper
                 describes an architecture exploration loop for an ASIP
                 coprocessor that implements common encryption
                 functionality used in symmetric block cipher algorithms
                 for internet protocol security (IPSec). The coprocessor
                 is accessed via shared memory and, as a consequence,
                 our approach is easily adaptable to arbitrary main
                 processor architectures. This paper presents the
                 extended version of our case study that has been
                 already published on the SCOPES conference in 2004. In
                 both papers, a MIPS architecture is used as the main
                 processor and Blowfish as encryption algorithm.",

  abstract =     "SSH is designed to provide a secure channel between
                 two hosts. Despite the encryption and authentication
                 mechanisms it uses, SSH has two weakness: First, the
                 transmitted packets are padded only to an eight-byte
                 boundary (if a block cipher is in use), which reveals
                 the approximate size of the original data. Second, in
                 interactive mode, every individual keystroke that a
                 user types is sent to the remote machine in a separate
                 IP packet immediately after the key is pressed, which
                 leaks the interkeystroke timing information of users
                 typing. In this paper, we show how these seemingly
                 minor weaknesses result in serious security
                 risks.\par

                 First we show that even very simple statistical
                 techniques suffice to reveal sensitive information such
                 as the length of users passwords or even root
                 passwords. More importantly, we further show that by
                 using more advanced statistical techniques on timing
                 information collected from the network, the
                 eavesdropper can learn significant information about
                 what users type in SSH sessions. In particular, we
                 perform a statistical study of users typing patterns
                 and show that these patterns reveal information about
                 the keys typed. By developing a Hidden Markov Model and
                 our key sequence prediction algorithm, we can predict
                 key sequences from the interkeystroke timings. We
                 further develop an attacker system, Herbivore , which
                 tries to learn users passwords by monitoring SSH
                 sessions. By collecting timing information on the
                 network, Herbivore can speed up exhaustive search for
                 passwords by a factor of 50. We also propose some
                 countermeasures.\par

                 In general our results apply not only to SSH, but also
                 to a general class of protocols for encrypting
                 interactive traffic. We show that timing leaks open a
                 new set of security risks, and hence caution must be
                 taken when designing this type of protocol.",

                 $ME \bmod N$, computation in cryptographic algorithms
                 employ Montgomery multiplication, $(ABR - 1) \bmod N$,
                 instead of modular multiplication, $AB \bmod N$, even
                 the former requires some transformational overheads.
                 This is so because a state-of-the-art Montgomery
                 multiplication implementation has a performance
                 advantage over direct modular multiplication based on
                 the Barrett algorithm that more than compensates for
                 the overhead. In this paper, we present a direct
                 modular multiplication method that is comparable in
                 speed to Montgomery multiplication. One consequence is
                 that when the exponent in small, direct computation
                 (which does not incur the transformational overhead)
                 using the modular multiplication algorithm presented
                 here results in practical performance gain. For the
                 exponent 17, for instance, which requires five modular
                 multiplication, a saving of up to 40\% can be

                 serious new class of threats for computers. Unlike
                 physical side channel attacks that mostly target
                 embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side
                 channel attacks can also undermine general purpose
                 systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on
                 most platforms, and do not require special instruments
                 or excessive computation power. In recently
                 demonstrated attacks on software implementations of
                 ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered
                 by an unprivileged user program performing simple
                 timing measurements based on cache misses.\par

                 We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache
                 interference as the root cause of these attacks. We
                 identify two basic mitigation approaches: the
                 partition-based approach eliminates cache interference
                 whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes
                 cache interference so that zero information can be
                 inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs,
                 the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random
                 Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their
                 security, and evaluate their performance. Our results
                 show that our new cache designs with built-in security
                 can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in
                 general-rather than only specific attacks on a given
                 cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance
                 degradation and hardware cost.",

                 ignore security requirements posed by sensitive
                 applications and are, consequently, unable to perform
                 properly in embedded systems with security constraints,
                 in this paper, we present an approach to scheduling
                 periodic tasks in embedded systems subject to security
                 and timing constraints. We design a necessary and
                 sufficient feasibility check for a set of periodic
                 tasks with security requirements. With the feasibility
                 test in place, we propose a scheduling algorithm, or
                 SASES (security-aware scheduling for embedded systems),
                 which accounts for both security and timing
                 requirements. SASES judiciously distributes slack times
                 among a variety of security services for a set of
                 periodic tasks, thereby optimizing security for
                 embedded systems without sacrificing schedulability. To
                 demonstrate the effectiveness of SASES, we apply the
                 proposed SASES to real-world embedded systems such as
                 an automated flight control system. We show, through
                 extensive simulations, that SASES is able to maximize
                 security for embedded systems while guaranteeing
                 timeliness. In particular, SASES significantly improves
                 security over three baseline algorithms by up to
                 107\%.",

                 invariant image watermarking algorithms. One is to
                 rectify the RST transformed image before conducting
                 watermark detection. Another is to embed and detect
                 watermark in an RST invariant or semi-invariant domain.

                 the fundamental theories and techniques used in the
                 existing RST invariant image watermarking algorithms.

                 deceiving the base station or depleting the resources

                 mechanisms cannot prevent this attack if the adversary

                 implementation of a data compression algorithm designed
                 specifically for fingerprints, referred to as GBP
                 compression. The algorithm is herein discussed. Data
                 Compression algorithms can be designed for general
                 applications, meaning the input data is unknown. This
                 is more commonly referred to as generic data. [LI01]
                 Or, data compression algorithms can be designed for
                 specific applications. E.g. AFIS [Automated Fingerprint
                 Identification Systems] 'When the input is known,
                 higher compression ratios can be achieved with the
                 knowledge of the input data stream.' To-date, the
                 highest compression ratio for an unknown input data
                 stream, for all data compression algorithms, is JPEG
                 with an average compression ratio range of 1:17 ---
                 1:23. [PEN03] The algorithm herein discussed, has a
                 compression ratio range of 1:68 --- 1:92. There is a
                 value, time and place for each design method ---
                 generic or specific --- depending upon a variety of
                 factors. Due to the nature of the use of AFIS for law
                 enforcement and incrimination as well as criminal
                 conviction, there are social issues that make data
                 integrity of paramount concern. This factor influences
                 algorithm selection and design. A lossless algorithm is
                 a must! Also, the nature of AFIS is such that it
                 operates across borders and between states,
                 municipalities and jurisdictions. In addition to the
                 usual issues and resistance to accepting new

  abstract =     "Trusted platforms have been proposed as a promising
                 approach to enhance the security of general-purpose
                 computing systems. However, for many
                 resource-constrained embedded systems, the size and
                 cost overheads of a separate Trusted Platform Module
                 (TPM) chip are not acceptable. One alternative is to
                 use a software-based TPM, which implements TPM
                 functions using software that executes in a protected
                 execution domain on the embedded processor itself.
                 However, since many embedded systems have limited
                 processing capabilities and are battery-powered, it is
                 also important to ensure that the computational and
                 energy requirements for SW-TPMs are acceptable.\par

                 In this article, we perform an evaluation of the energy
                 and execution time overheads for a SW-TPM
                 implementation on a handheld appliance (Sharp Zaurus
                 PDA). We characterize the execution time and energy
                 required by each TPM command through actual
                 measurements on the target platform. We observe that
                 for most commands, overheads are primarily due to the
                 use of 2,048-bit RSA operations that are performed
                 within the SW-TPM. In order to alleviate SW-TPM
                 overheads, we evaluate the use of Elliptic Curve
                 Cryptography (ECC) as a replacement for the RSA
                 algorithm specified in the Trusted Computing Group
                 (TCG) standards. In addition, we also evaluate the
                 overheads of using the SW-TPM in the context of various
                 end applications, including trusted boot of the Linux
                 operating system (OS), a secure VoIP client, and a
                 secure Web browser. Furthermore, we analyze the
                 computational workload involved in running SW-TPM
                 commands using ECC. We then present a suite of hardware
                 and software enhancements to accelerate these commands
                 --- generic custom instructions and exploitation of
                 parallel processing capabilities in multiprocessor
                 systems-on-chip (SoCs). We report results of evaluating
                 the proposed architectures on a commercial embedded
                 processor (Xtensa from Tensilica). Through uniprocessor
                 and multiprocessor optimizations, we could achieve
                 speed-ups of up to 5.71X for individual TPM commands.",

                 employ encryption for implementing security policies on
                 published data, avoiding data duplication. In this
                 article, we study one such scheme, due to Miklau and
                 Suciu [2003]. That scheme was introduced with some
                 intuitive explanations and goals, but without precise

                 (specifically, symmetric encryption and secret
                 sharing). We bridge this gap in the present work. We
                 analyze the scheme in the context of the rigorous
                 models of modern cryptography. We obtain formal results
                 in simple, symbolic terms close to the vocabulary of

                 important, especially in hostile environment, where we
                 must ensure that data is authentic, confidential, and
                 not tampered on the road. Network authenticity and
                 confidentiality need the existence of shared keys.
                 These keys are highly recommended to be in small scopes
                 so that the compromise of one node will not affect the
                 whole network. Key management is critical to maintain
                 the security functions. In this paper we introduce a
                 new key management algorithm, which ensures that most
                 of the node's neighbors are reliable. The proposed
                 algorithm minimizes interaction with base station,
                 number of transmitted packets, and energy consumption.
                 In addition, it does not use large scope keys.
                 Simulation results proof that the proposed algorithm is
                 scalable in terms of storage and communication
                 overhead, such that there is no correlation between the

                 schemes that allow multiple signers to sequentially and
                 non-interactively produce a compact, fixed-length
                 signature. First, we introduce a new primitive that we
                 call {\em ordered multisignature\/} (OMS) scheme, which
                 allows signers to attest to a common message as well as
                 the order in which they signed. Our OMS construction
                 substantially improves computational efficiency and
                 scalability over any existing scheme with suitable
                 functionality. Second, we design a new identity-based
                 sequential aggregate signature scheme, where signers
                 can attest to different messages and signature
                 verification does not require knowledge of traditional
                 public keys. The latter property permits savings on
                 bandwidth and storage as compared to public-key
                 solutions. In contrast to the only prior scheme to
                 provide this functionality, ours offers improved
                 security that does not rely on synchronized clocks or a
                 trusted first signer. We provide formal security
                 definitions and support the proposed schemes with
                 security proofs under appropriate computational
                 assumptions. We focus on applications of our schemes to

                 servers and in Database Service Providers and the
                 growing interest for different forms of selective data
                 dissemination are different factors that lead to move
                 the access-control from servers to clients. Different
                 data encryption and key dissemination schemes have been
                 proposed to serve this purpose. By compiling the
                 access-control rules into the encryption process, all
                 these methods suffer from a static way of sharing data.
                 With the emergence of hardware security elements on
                 client devices, more dynamic client-based
                 access-control schemes can be devised. This paper
                 proposes a tamper-resistant client-based XML
                 access-right controller supporting flexible and dynamic
                 access-control policies. The access-control engine is
                 embedded in a hardware-secure device and, therefore,
                 must cope with specific hardware resources. This engine
                 benefits from a dedicated index to quickly converge
                 toward the authorized parts of a potentially streaming
                 XML document. Pending situations (i. e. , where data
                 delivery is conditioned by predicates, which apply to
                 values encountered afterward in the document stream)
                 are handled gracefully, skipping, whenever possible the
                 pending elements and reassembling relevant parts when
                 the pending situation is solved. Additional security
                 mechanisms guarantee that (1) the input document is
                 protected from any form of tampering and (2) no
                 forbidden information can be gained by replay attacks
                 on different versions of the XML document and of the
                 access-control rules. Performance measurements on
                 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
                 effectiveness of the approach. Finally, the paper

                 potentially preventing us from recovering any digital
                 evidence from a computer. Because strong encryption

  abstract =     "A feature exhibited by many modern computing systems
                 is their ability to improve the quality of output they
                 generate for a given input by spending more computing
                 resources on processing it. Often this improvement
                 comes at the price of degraded performance in the form
                 of reduced throughput or increased response time. We
                 formulate QDSL, a class of constrained optimization
                 problems defined in the context of a queueing server
                 equipped with multiple levels of service. Solutions to
                 QDSL provide rules for dynamically varying the service
                 level to achieve desired trade-offs between output
                 quality and performance. Our approach involves reducing
                 restricted versions of such systems to Markov Decision
                 Processes. We find two variants of such systems worth
                 studying: (i) VarSL, in which a single request may be
                 serviced using a combination of multiple levels during
                 its lifetime and (ii) FixSL in which the service level
                 may not change during the lifetime of a request. Our
                 modeling indicates that optimal service level selection
                 policies in these systems correspond to very simple
                 rules that can be implemented very efficiently in
                 realistic, online systems. We find our policies to be
                 useful in two response-time-sensitive real-world
                 systems: (i) qSecStore, an iSCSI-based secure storage
                 system that has access to multiple encryption
                 functions, and (ii) qPowServer, a server with
                 DVFS-capable processor. As a representative result, in
                 an instance of qSecStore serving disk requests derived
                 from the well-regarded TPC-H traces, we are able to
                 improve the fraction of requests using more reliable
                 encryption functions by 40-60\%, while meeting
                 performance targets. In a simulation of qPowServer
                 employing realistic DVFS parameters, we are able to
                 improve response times significantly while only
                 violating specified server-wide power budgets by less

  abstract =     "Security in wireless sensor networks has become
                 important as they are being developed and deployed for
                 an increasing number of applications. The severe
                 resource constraints in each sensor make it very
                 challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover,
                 sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended
                 environments and hence are susceptible to various
                 attacks, including node capture, physical tampering,
                 and manipulation of the sensor program. Park and Shin
                 [2005] proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that
                 verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor
                 device, called the program integrity verification
                 (PIV), in which sensors authenticate PIV servers
                 (PIVSs) using centralized and trusted third-party
                 entities, such as authentication servers (ASs). This
                 article presents a distributed authentication protocol
                 of PIVSs (DAPP) without requiring the commonly used
                 ASs. DAPP uses the Blundo scheme [Blundo et al. 1992]
                 for sensors and PIVSs to establish pairwise keys and
                 for PIVSs to authenticate one another. We also present
                 a protocol for PIVSs to cooperatively detect and revoke
                 malicious PIVSs in the network. We implement and
                 evaluate both DAPP and PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops,
                 showing that DAPP reduces the sensors' communication
                 traffic in the network by more than 90\% and the energy
                 consumption on each sensor by up to 85\%, as compared
                 to the case of using a centralized AS for
                 authenticating PIVSs. We also analyze the security of
                 DAPP under various attack models, demonstrating its
                 capability in dealing with diverse types of attacks.",

                 encrypt a message so that only the intended recipient

                 achieve timed-release security. We then give several

                 encryption: a generic scheme based on any
                 identity-based encryption scheme, and two more

  abstract =     "Most network routers and switches provide some
                 protection against the network attacks. However, the
                 rapidly increasing amount of damages reported over the
                 past few years indicates the urgent need for tougher
                 security. Deep-packet inspection is one of the
                 solutions to capture packets that can not be identified
                 using the traditional methods. It uses a list of
                 signatures to scan the entire content of the packet,
                 providing the means to filter harmful packets out of
                 the network. Since one signature does not depend on the
                 other, the filtering process has a high degree of
                 parallelism. Most software and hardware deep-packet
                 filters that are in use today execute the tasks under
                 Von Neuman architecture. Such architecture can not
                 fully take advantage of the parallelism. For instance,
                 one of the most widely used network intrusion-detection
                 systems, Snort, configured with 845 patterns, running
                 on a dual 1-GHz Pentium III system, can sustain a
                 throughput of only 50 Mbps. The poor performance is
                 because of the fact that the processor is programmed to
                 execute several tasks sequentially instead of
                 simultaneously. We designed scalable deep-packet
                 filters on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to
                 search for all data-independent patterns
                 simultaneously. With FPGAs, we have the ability to
                 reprogram the filter when there are any changes to the
                 signature set. The smallest full-pattern matcher
                 implementation for the latest Snort NIDS fits in a
                 single 400k Xilinx FPGA (Spartan 3-XC3S400) with a
                 sustained throughput of 1.6 Gbps. Given a larger FPGA,
                 the design can scale linearly to support a greater
                 number of patterns, as well as higher data
                 throughput.",

  abstract =     "Almost any cryptographic scheme can be described by
                 tweakable polynomials over GF(2), which contain both
                 secret variables (e.g., key bits) and public variables
                 (e.g., plaintext bits or IV bits). The cryptanalyst is
                 allowed to tweak the polynomials by choosing arbitrary
                 values for the public variables, and his goal is to
                 solve the resultant system of polynomial equations in
                 terms of their common secret variables. In this paper
                 we develop a new technique (called a cube attack) for
                 solving such tweakable polynomials, which is a major
                 improvement over several previously published attacks
                 of the same type. For example, on the stream cipher
                 Trivium with a reduced number of initialization rounds,
                 the best previous attack (due to Fischer, Khazaei, and
                 Meier) requires a barely practical complexity of 255 to
                 attack 672 initialization rounds, whereas a cube attack
                 can find the complete key of the same variant in 219
                 bit operations (which take less than a second on a
                 single PC). Trivium with 735 initialization rounds
                 (which could not be attacked by any previous technique)
                 can now be broken with 230 bit operations, and by
                 extrapolating our experimentally verified complexities
                 for various sizes, we have reasons to believe that cube
                 attacks will remain faster than exhaustive search even
                 for 1024 initialization rounds. Whereas previous
                 attacks were heuristic, had to be adapted to each
                 cryptosystem, had no general complexity bounds, and
                 were not expected to succeed on random looking
                 polynomials, cube attacks are provably successful when
                 applied to random polynomials of degree $d$ over $n$
                 secret variables whenever the number $m$ of public
                 variables exceeds $d + \log_d n$. Their complexity is
                 $2^{d-1}n + n^2$ bit operations, which is polynomial in
                 $n$ and amazingly low when $d$ is small. Cube attacks
                 can be applied to any block cipher, stream cipher, or
                 MAC which is provided as a black box (even when nothing
                 is known about its internal structure) as long as at
                 least one output bit can be represented by (an unknown)
                 polynomial of relatively low degree in the secret and
                 public variables. In particular, they can be easily and
                 automatically combined with any type of side channel
                 attack that leaks some partial information about the
                 early stages of the encryption process (which can
                 typically be represented by a very low degree
                 polynomial), such as the Hamming weight of a byte
                 written into a register.",

                 needs to securely exchange messages with its
                 neighboring processes. In this network, each sent
                 message is encrypted using one or more symmetric keys
                 that are shared only between two processes: the process
                 that sends the message and the neighboring process that
                 receives the message. A straightforward scheme for
                 assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in
                 such a network is to assign each process {\em O\/}
                 ({\em d\/}) keys, where {\em d\/} is the maximum number
                 of neighbors of any process in the network. In this

                 assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in
                 a communication network. This scheme, which is referred
                 to as logarithmic keying, assigns {\em O\/} (log {\em

                 show that logarithmic keying can be used in rich

                 networks, acyclic networks, limited-cycle networks,
                 planar networks, and dense bipartite networks. In
                 addition, we present a construction that utilizes
                 efficient keying schemes for general bipartite networks

  abstract =     "The OR-SAT problem asks, given Boolean formulae
                 $\Phi$_1, \ldots{}, $\Phi$_m$ each of size at most $n$,
                 whether at least one of the $\Phi$_i$'s is satisfiable.
                 We show that there is no reduction from OR-SAT to any
                 set A where the length of the output is bounded by a
                 polynomial in $n$, unless NP $\subseteq$ coNP/poly, and
                 the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy collapses. This result
                 settles an open problem proposed by Bodlaender et. al.
                 [4] and Harnik and Naor [15] and has a number of
                 implications. A number of parametric NP problems,
                 including Satisfiability, Clique, Dominating Set and
                 Integer Programming, are not instance compressible or
                 polynomially kernelizable unless NP $\subseteq$
                 coNP/poly. Satisfiability does not have PCPs of size
                 polynomial in the number of variables unless NP
                 $\subseteq$ coNP/poly. An approach of Harnik and Naor
                 to constructing collision-resistant hash functions from
                 one-way functions is unlikely to be viable in its
                 present form. (Buhrman-Hitchcock) There are no
                 subexponential-size hard sets for NP unless NP is in
                 co-NP/poly. We also study probabilistic variants of
                 compression, and show various results about and
                 connections between these variants. To this end, we
                 introduce a new strong derandomization hypothesis, the
                 Oracle Derandomization Hypothesis, and discuss how it
                 relates to traditional derandomization assumptions.",

                 integrity policies conveniently specify the permitted
                 flows of information between different parts of a
                 program with diverse levels of trust. These policies
                 enable a simple treatment of security, and they can
                 often be verified by typing. However, their enforcement
                 in concrete systems involves delicate compilation
                 issues.\par

                 We consider cryptographic enforcement mechanisms for
                 imperative programs with untrusted components. Such
                 programs may represent, for instance, distributed
                 systems connected by some untrusted network. In source
                 programs, security depends on an abstract
                 access-control policy for reading and writing the
                 shared memory. In their implementations, shared memory
                 is unprotected and security depends instead on
                 encryption and signing.\par

                 We build a translation from well-typed source programs
                 and policies to cryptographic implementations. To
                 establish its correctness, we develop a type system for
                 the target language. Our typing rules enforce a correct
                 usage of cryptographic primitives against active
                 adversaries; from an information-flow viewpoint, they
                 capture controlled forms of robust declassification and
                 endorsement. We show type soundness for a variant of
                 the non-interference property, then show that our
                 translation preserves typeability.\par

                 We rely on concrete primitives and hypotheses for
                 cryptography, stated in terms of probabilistic
                 polynomial-time algorithms and games. We model these
                 primitives as commands in our target language. Thus, we
                 develop a uniform language-based model of security,
                 ranging from computational non-interference for

                 However, existing measurement tools, like ping,
                 traceroute, and trajectory sampling, are vulnerable to
                 attacks that can make a path look better than it really
                 is. In this paper, we design and analyze path-quality
                 monitoring protocols that reliably raise an alarm when
                 the packet-loss rate and delay exceed a threshold, even
                 when an adversary tries to bias monitoring results by
                 selectively delaying, dropping, modifying, injecting,
                 or preferentially treating packets.\par

                 Despite the strong threat model we consider in this
                 paper, our protocols are efficient enough to run at

                 sketching protocol for identifying when packet loss and
                 delay degrade beyond a threshold. This protocol is
                 extremely lightweight, requiring only 250-600 bytes of
                 storage and periodic transmission of a comparably sized
                 IP packet to monitor billions of packets. We also

                 the expense of somewhat higher storage and

                 overhead. We also compare how our protocols perform in
                 the client-server setting, when paths are asymmetric,

                 self-testing were pioneered by [Blum and Kannan] and
                 [Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld] in the mid eighties as a new
                 way to gain confidence in software, by considering
                 program correctness on an input by input basis rather
                 than full program verification. Work in the field of
                 program checking focused on designing, for specific
                 functions, checkers, testers and correctors which are
                 more efficient than the best program known for the
                 function. These were designed utilizing specific
                 algebraic, combinatorial or completeness properties of
                 the function at hand. In this work we introduce a novel
                 composition methodology for improving the efficiency of
                 program checkers. We use this approach to design a
                 variety of program checkers that are provably more
                 efficient, in terms of circuit depth, than the optimal
                 program for computing the function being checked.
                 Extensions of this methodology for the cases of program
                 testers and correctors are also presented. In
                 particular, we show: For all $i \geq 1$, every language
                 in RNC$^i$ (that is NCO-hard under NCZ-reductions) has
                 a program checker in RNC$^{i-1}$. In addition, for all
                 $i \geq 1$, every language in RNC$^i$ (that is NCO-hard
                 under ACZ-reductions) has a program corrector, tester

                 checkers are designed for a wide class of functions
                 characterized only by its complexity, rather than by
                 algebraic or combinatorial properties. This
                 characterization immediately yields new and efficient
                 checkers for languages such as graph connectivity,
                 perfect matching and bounded-degree graph isomorphism.
                 Constant-depth checkers, testers and correctors for
                 matrix multiplication, inversion, determinant and rank.
                 All previous program checkers, testers and correctors
                 for these problems run in nearly logarithmic depth.
                 Moreover, except for matrix multiplication, they all
                 require the use of the library notion of
                 [Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld], in which checkers have access to
                 a library of programs for various matrix functions,
                 rather than only having access to a program for the
                 function being checked. Furthermore, we provide
                 conditions under which program libraries can be
                 eliminated. Important ingredients in these results are
                 new and very efficient checkers for complete languages
                 in low complexity classes (e.g. NCO). These
                 constructions are based on techniques that were

  abstract =     "In the setting of secure two-party computation, two
                 mutually distrusting parties wish to compute some
                 function of their inputs while preserving, to the
                 extent possible, various security properties such as
                 privacy, correctness, and more. One desirable property
                 is fairness, which guarantees that if either party
                 receives its output, then the other party does too.
                 Cleve (STOC 1986) showed that complete fairness cannot
                 be achieved in general in the two-party setting;
                 specifically, he showed (essentially) that it is
                 impossible to compute Boolean XOR with complete
                 fairness. Since his work, the accepted folklore has
                 been that nothing non-trivial can be computed with
                 complete fairness, and the question of complete
                 fairness in secure two-party computation has been
                 treated as closed since the late '80s.\par

                 In this paper, we demonstrate that this widely held
                 folklore belief is false by showing completely-fair
                 secure protocols for various non-trivial two-party
                 functions including Boolean AND/OR as well as Yao's
                 `millionaires' problem'. Surprisingly, we show that it
                 is even possible to construct completely-fair protocols
                 for certain functions containing an `embedded XOR',
                 although in this case we also prove a lower bound
                 showing that a super-logarithmic number of rounds are
                 necessary. Our results demonstrate that the question of
                 completely-fair secure computation without an honest
                 majority is far from closed.",

                 makes Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) an interesting
                 alternative to conventional asymmetric cryptosystems,
                 like RSA. Operands in ECC require significantly less
                 bits at the same level of security, resulting in a
                 higher computational efficiency compared to RSA. With
                 growing computational capabilities and continuous
                 technological improvements over the years, however, the
                 question of the security of ECC against attacks based
                 on special-purpose hardware arises. In this context,
                 recently emerged low-cost FPGAs demand for attention in
                 the domain of hardware-based cryptanalysis: the
                 extraordinary efficiency of modern programmable
                 hardware devices allow for a low-budget implementation
                 of hardware-based ECC attacks---without the requirement
                 of the expensive development of ASICs.\par

                 With focus on the aspect of cost-efficiency, this
                 contribution presents and analyzes an FPGA-based
                 architecture of an attack against ECC over prime
                 fields. A multi-processing hardware architecture for
                 Pollard's Rho method is described. We provide results
                 on actually used key lengths of ECC (128 bits and
                 above) and estimate the expected runtime for a
                 successful attack.\par

                 As a first result, currently used elliptic curve
                 cryptosystems with a security of 160 bit and above turn
                 out to be infeasible to break with available
                 computational and financial resources. However, some of
                 the security standards proposed by the Standards for
                 Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) become subject to
                 attacks based on low-cost FPGAs.",

  abstract =     "Current constructions of cryptographic primitives
                 typically involve a large multiplicative computational
                 overhead that grows with the desired level of security.
                 We explore the possibility of implementing basic
                 cryptographic primitives, such as encryption,
                 authentication, signatures, and secure two-party
                 computation, while incurring only a constant
                 computational overhead compared to insecure
                 implementations of the same tasks. Here we make the
                 usual security requirement that the advantage of any
                 polynomial-time attacker must be negligible in the
                 input length.\par

                 We obtain affirmative answers to this question for most
                 central cryptographic primitives under plausible,
                 albeit sometimes nonstandard, intractability
                 assumptions. We start by showing that
                 pairwise-independent hash functions can be computed by
                 linear-size circuits, disproving a conjecture of
                 Mansour, Nisan, and Tiwari (STOC 1990). This
                 construction does not rely on any unproven assumptions
                 and is of independent interest. Our hash functions can
                 be used to construct message authentication schemes
                 with constant overhead from any one-way function. Under
                 an intractability assumption that generalizes a
                 previous assumption of Alekhnovich (FOCS 2003), we get
                 (public and private key) encryption schemes with
                 constant overhead. Using an exponentially strong
                 version of the previous assumption, we get signature
                 schemes of similar complexity. Assuming the existence
                 of pseudorandom generators in NC $z$ with polynomial
                 stretch together with the existence of an (arbitrary)
                 oblivious transfer protocol, we get similar results for
                 the seemingly very complex task of secure two-party
                 computation. More concretely, we get general protocols
                 for secure two-party computation in the semi-honest
                 model in which the two parties can be implemented by
                 circuits whose size is a constant multiple of the size
                 $s$ of the circuit to be evaluated. In the malicious
                 model, we get protocols whose communication complexity
                 is a constant multiple of $s$ and whose computational
                 complexity is slightly super-linear in $s$. For natural
                 relaxations of security in the malicious model that are
                 still meaningful in practice, we can also keep the
                 computational complexity linear in $s$. These results
                 extend to the case of a constant number of parties,
                 where an arbitrary subset of the parties can be
                 corrupted.\par

                 Our protocols rely on non-black-box techniques, and
                 suggest the intriguing possibility that the ultimate
                 efficiency in this area of cryptography can be obtained
                 via such techniques.",

  abstract =     "Public key cryptography is widely used because it
                 enables secure communication with a party accessing the
                 site for the first time. But it is widely known that
                 the quantum computers become available then the public
                 key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm
                 problem such as RSA cryptosystem and Elliptic Curve
                 cryptosystem will no longer be secure. To address these
                 issues, Akiyama-Goto algebraic Surface Public-key
                 Cryptosystem (ASC) was developed [1], and opened to
                 general public at website as a research news of Toshiba
                 corporation in 2005. Its security is based on a
                 decision randomizing polynomial problem which is
                 related to a problem of finding sections on fibered
                 algebraic surfaces. This problem can be reduced to
                 solving a multivariate equation system and it is known
                 to be NP-complete. In 2007, in the case that public-key
                 is in a certain form, Uchiyama and Tokunaga successed
                 to attack in the sense of getting plain text from
                 cipher text using reductions efficiently without
                 solving section finding problem [2].And the abstract is
                 introduced in CRYPTREC report 2006 [3] in the Appendix
                 Chapter, which is known to be the important report
                 related to e-Government recommended ciphers in Japan.
                 Note that, at this point, the cryptosystem can be used
                 safely if only we avoid to adopt using public key with
                 vulnerability in the key generation step. However, the
                 author suggested two algorithms applicable to all cases
                 [5] i.e. the cryptosystem is completely broken. One is
                 the generalization of Uchiyama-Tokunagas attack from
                 polynomial ring over IFp to polynomial ring over
                 rational function field. And the other takes advantages
                 of Gr{\"o}bner base techniques so as to deal with in
                 the polynomial ring over IFp. And in [6], the author
                 also suggested methods for calculating zero point of
                 the algebraic surface and a new attack utilizing it,
                 and the approach resulted in the difficulty of making a
                 suggestion of the invulnerable algebraic surface
                 public-key cryptosystem without changing ideas
                 progressively. On the other hand, Inanov-Volochs attack
                 using trace map [9] was developed. In these background,
                 Akiyama-Goto developed improved version of their
                 Algebraic surface public-key cryptosystem (improved
                 ASC) [8] on January 2008 [8] which has tolerance to
                 Uchiyama-Gotos attack using reduction and Volochs
                 attack using the trace map. Ivanov and Voloch suggested
                 the substitution attack briefly on improved ASC in
                 section 3 in [9], but the details are unspecified. In
                 section 2, the improved ASC is described, and then, in
                 section 3, a new reduction attack on the improved ASC
                 is presented.",

                 classical problems in foundations of cryptography:
                 secret sharing and multiparty computation, suggested by
                 Halpern and Teague (STOC 2004). Our goal is to design
                 games and fair strategies that encourage rational
                 participants to exchange information about their inputs
                 for their mutual benefit, when the only mean of
                 communication is a broadcast channel.\par

                 We show that protocols for the above information
                 exchanging tasks, where players' values come from a
                 bounded domain, cannot satisfy some of the most
                 desirable properties. In contrast, we provide a
                 rational secret sharing scheme with simultaneous
                 broadcast channel in which shares are taken from an
                 unbounded domain, but have finite (and polynomial
                 sized) expectation.\par

                 Previous schemes (mostly cryptographic) have required
                 computational assumptions, making them inexact and
                 susceptible to backward induction, or used stronger
                 communication channels. Our scheme is
                 non-cryptographic, immune to backward induction, and
                 satisfies a stronger rationality concept (strict Nash
                 equilibrium). We show that our solution can also be
                 used to construct an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium secret
                 sharing scheme for the case of a non-simultaneous

                 definitions based on computational indistinguishability
                 of distributions over program states have to be used.
                 These definitions, as well as the accompanying analysis
                 tools, are complex and error-prone to argue about.
                 Cryptographically masked flows, proposed by Askarov,
                 Hedin and Sabelfeld, are an abstract execution model
                 and security definition that attempt to abstract away
                 the details of computational security. This abstract
                 model is useful because analysis of programs can be
                 conducted using the usual techniques for enforcing
                 non-interference.\par

                 In this paper we investigate under which conditions
                 this abstract model is computationally sound, i.e. when
                 does the security of a program in their model imply the
                 computational security of this program. This paper
                 spells out a reasonable set of conditions and then
                 proposes a simpler abstract model that is nevertheless
                 no more restrictive than the cryptographically masked
                 flows together with these conditions for soundness.",

                 implementation of elliptic curve cryptography over
                 F$_{2 {\em p\/}}$ for sensor networks based on the
                 8-bit, 7.3828-MHz MICA2 mote. We offer, along the way,
                 a primer for those interested in the field of
                 cryptography for sensor networks. We discuss, in
                 particular, the decisions underlying our design and
                 alternatives thereto. And we elaborate on the
                 methodologies underlying our evaluation.\par

                 Through instrumentation of UC Berkeley's TinySec
                 module, we argue that, although symmetric cryptography
                 has been tractable in this domain for some time, there
                 has remained a need, unfulfilled until recently, for an
                 efficient, secure mechanism for distribution of secret
                 keys among nodes. Although public-key infrastructure
                 has been thought impractical, we show, through analysis
                 of our original implementation for TinyOS of point
                 multiplication on elliptic curves, that public-key
                 infrastructure is indeed viable for TinySec keys'
                 distribution, even on the MICA2. We demonstrate that
                 public keys can be generated within 34 seconds and that
                 shared secrets can be distributed among nodes in a
                 sensor network within the same time, using just over 1
                 kilobyte of SRAM and 34 kilobytes of ROM. We
                 demonstrate that communication costs are minimal, with
                 only 2 packets required for transmission of a public
                 key among nodes. We make available all of our source
                 code for other researchers to download and use. And we
                 discuss recent results based on our work that
                 corroborate and improve upon our conclusions.",

                 operating systems that direct them are at the heart of
                 major forms of malicious activity. Criminals can use
                 computers as the actual target of their malicious
                 activity (stealing funds electronically from a bank) or
                 use them to support the conduct of criminal activity in
                 general (using a spreadsheet to track drug shipments).
                 In either case, law enforcement needs the ability (when
                 required) to collect evidence from such platforms in a
                 reliable manner that preserves the fingerprints of
                 criminal activity. Though such discussion touches on
                 privacy issues and rules of legal veracity, we focus
                 purely on technological support in this paper.
                 Specifically, we examine and set forth principles of
                 operating system (OS) design that may significantly
                 increase the success of (future) forensic collection
                 efforts. We lay out several OS design attributes that
                 synergistically enhance forensics activities.
                 Specifically, we pose the use of circuit encryption
                 techniques to provide an additional layer of protection
                 above hardware-enforced approaches. We conclude by
                 providing an overarching framework to incorporate these

                 symmetric-key encryption, pseudo-random generators, and
                 secret sharing schemes. Our lower bound shows that the
                 amortized cost of updating the group key for each group
                 membership change (as a function of the current group
                 size) is at least $\log_2(n) - o(1)$ basic rekey
                 messages. This lower bound matches, up to a subconstant
                 additive term, the upper bound due to Canetti et al.
                 [Proc. INFOCOM 1999], who showed that $\log_2(n)$ basic
                 rekey messages (each time a user joins and/or leaves
                 the group) are sufficient. Our lower bound is, thus,
                 optimal up to a small subconstant additive term. The
                 result of this paper considerably strengthens previous
                 lower bounds by Canetti et al. [Proc. Eurocrypt 1999]
                 and Snoeyink et al. [Computer Networks, 47(3):2005],
                 which allowed for neither the use of pseudorandom
                 generators and secret sharing schemes nor the iterated
                 (nested) application of the encryption function. Our
                 model (which allows for arbitrarily nested combinations
                 of encryption, pseudorandom generators and secret
                 sharing schemes) is much more general and, in
                 particular, encompasses essentially all known multicast
                 key distribution protocols of practical interest.",

  abstract =     "This article presents a novel invisible robust
                 watermarking scheme for embedding and extracting a
                 digital watermark in an image. The novelty lies in
                 determining a perceptually important subimage in the
                 host image. Invisible insertion of the watermark is
                 performed in the most significant region of the host
                 image such that tampering of that portion with an
                 intention to remove or destroy will degrade the
                 esthetic quality and value of the image. One feature of
                 the algorithm is that this subimage is used as a region
                 of interest for the watermarking process and eliminates
                 the chance of watermark removal. Another feature of the
                 algorithm is the creation of a compound watermark using
                 the input user watermark (logo) and attributes of the
                 host image. This facilitates the homogeneous fusion of
                 a watermark with the cover image, preserves the quality
                 of the host image, and allows robust
                 insertion-extraction. Watermark creation consists of
                 two distinct phases. During the first phase, a
                 statistical image is synthesized from a perceptually
                 important subimage of the image. A compound watermark
                 is created by embedding a watermark (logo) into the
                 statistical synthetic image by using a visible
                 watermarking technique. This compound watermark is
                 invisibly embedded into the important block of the host
                 image. The authentication process involves extraction
                 of the perceptive logo as well statistical testing for
                 two-layer evidence. Results of the experimentation
                 using standard benchmarks demonstrates the robustness
                 and efficacy of the proposed watermarking approach.

                 authenticating and validating syslogs for forensic
                 analysis. This technique uses a modification of the
                 Needham Schroeder protocol, which uses nonces (numbers
                 used only once) and public keys. Syslogs, which were
                 developed from an event-logging perspective and not
                 from an evidence-sustaining one, are system treasure
                 maps that chart out and pinpoint attacks and attack
                 attempts. Over the past few years, research on securing
                 syslogs has yielded enhanced syslog protocols that
                 focus on tamper prevention and detection. However, many
                 of these protocols, though efficient from a security
                 perspective, are inadequate when forensics comes into
                 play. From a legal perspective, any kind of evidence
                 found at a crime scene needs to be validated. In
                 addition, any digital forensic evidence when presented
                 in court needs to be admissible, authentic, believable,
                 and reliable [4]. Currently, a patchy log on the server
                 side and client side cannot be considered as formal
                 authentication of a wrong doer [5]. This paper presents
                 a method that ties together, authenticates, and
                 validates all the entities involved in the crime
                 scene---the user using the application, the system that
                 is being used, and the application being used on the
                 system by a user. This means that instead of merely
                 transmitting the header and the message, which is the
                 standard syslog protocol format, the syslog entry along
                 with the user fingerprint, application fingerprint, and
                 system fingerprint are transmitted to the logging
                 server. The assignment of digital fingerprints and the
                 addition of a challenge response mechanism to the
                 underlying syslogging mechanism aim to validate
                 generated syslogs forensically.",

  abstract =     "Broadcast authentication is a critical security
                 service in wireless sensor networks. There are two
                 general approaches for broadcast authentication in
                 wireless sensor networks: digital signatures and
                 $\mu$TESLA-based techniques. However, both
                 signature-based and $\mu$TESLA-based broadcast
                 authentication are vulnerable to Denial of Services
                 (DoS) attacks: An attacker can inject bogus broadcast
                 packets to force sensor nodes to perform expensive
                 signature verifications (in case of signature-based
                 broadcast authentication) or packet forwarding (in case
                 of $\mu$TESLA-based broadcast authentication), thus
                 exhausting their limited battery power. This paper
                 presents an efficient mechanism called message-specific
                 puzzle to mitigate such DoS attacks. In addition to
                 signature-based or $\mu$TESLA-based broadcast
                 authentication, this approach adds a weak authenticator
                 in each broadcast packet, which can be efficiently
                 verified by a regular sensor node, but takes a
                 computationally powerful attacker a substantial amount
                 of time to forge. Upon receiving a broadcast packet,
                 each sensor node first verifies the weak authenticator,
                 and performs the expensive signature verification (in
                 signature-based broadcast authentication) or packet
                 forwarding (in $\mu$TESLA-based broadcast
                 authentication) only when the weak authenticator is
                 valid. A weak authenticator cannot be precomputed
                 without a non-reusable (or short-lived) key disclosed
                 only in a valid packet. Even if an attacker has
                 intensive computational resources to forge one or more
                 weak authenticators, it is difficult to reuse these
                 forged weak authenticators. Thus, this weak
                 authentication mechanism substantially increases the
                 difficulty of launching successful DoS attacks against
                 signature-based or $\mu$TESLA-based broadcast
                 authentication. A limitation of this approach is that
                 it requires a powerful sender and introduces
                 sender-side delay. This article also reports an
                 implementation of the proposed techniques on TinyOS, as
                 well as initial experimental evaluation in a network of

                 small, low-cost sensor nodes, are characterized by
                 their large-scale and unattended deployment,
                 necessitating ``secure'' communications between nearby,
                 as well as remote, sensor nodes for their intended
                 applications and services. Key setup/sharing is crucial
                 to the protection of such applications/services from
                 attacks, but existing (public-key, cluster-based, or
                 pairwise) solutions become too expensive (hence,
                 inefficient) when the underlying applications/services

                 DKSs, we develop two secure routing protocols: (1)
                 secure geographic forwarding that delivers packets by
                 using a chain of DKS lookups, each secured with its own
                 key and forwarded geographically; and (2) key
                 establishment that creates a secure session between two
                 distant sensor nodes based solely on symmetric-ciphers.
                 These protocols enable low-cost, low-power sensors to

                 an imaginary computer known as the Turing Machine; in
                 an age before computers, he explored the concept of
                 what it meant to be computable, creating the field of
                 computability theory in the process, a foundation of
                 present-day computer programming. The book expands
                 Turing's original 36-page paper with additional
                 background chapters and extensive annotations; the
                 author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing's
                 statements, making the original difficult-to-read
                 document accessible to present day programmers,
                 computer science majors, math geeks, and others.
                 Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of
                 Turing's own life: his years at Cambridge and
                 Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during

                 design method also includes the method for test vector

                 C-testability is achieved with three control inputs and
                 approximately 6\% additional hardware. Only
                 8 constant vectors are required irrespective of the

  abstract =     "Hardness amplification is the fundamental task of
                 converting a $\delta$-hard function $f : (0, 1)^n
                 \rightarrow (0, 1)$ into a ($1/2 - \epsilon$)-hard
                 function $\Amp(f)$, where $f$ is $\gamma$-hard if small
                 circuits fail to compute $f$ on at least a $\gamma$
                 fraction of the inputs. Typically, $\epsilon$, $\delta$
                 are small (and $\delta = 2^{-k}$ captures the case
                 where $f$ is worst-case hard). Achieving $\epsilon =
                 1/n^{\Omega(1)}$ is a prerequisite for cryptography and
                 most pseudorandom-generator constructions.\par

                 In this paper we study the complexity of black-box
                 proofs of hardness amplification. A class of circuits
                 cal $D$ {\em proves\/} a hardness amplification result
                 if for any function $h$ that agrees with $\Amp(f)$ on a
                 $1/2 + e$ fraction of the inputs there exists an oracle
                 circuit $D \in D$ such that $D^h$ agrees with $f$ on a
                 $1 - \delta$ fraction of the inputs. We focus on the
                 case where every $D \in D$ makes {\em non-adaptive\/}
                 queries to $h$. This setting captures most hardness
                 amplification techniques. We prove two main
                 results:\par

                 (1) The circuits in $D$ `can be used' to compute the
                 majority function on $1 / \epsilon$ bits. In
                 particular, these circuits have large depth when
                 $\epsilon \leq 1 / \poly \log n$. \par

                 (2) The circuits in $D$ must make $\Omega \log(1 /
                 \delta) / e^2$ oracle queries.\par

                 Both our bounds on the depth and on the number of
                 queries are tight up to constant factors.\par

                 Our results explain why hardness amplification
                 techniques have failed to transform known lower bounds
                 against constant-depth circuit classes into strong
                 average-case lower bounds. When coupled with the
                 celebrated `Natural Proofs' result by Razborov and
                 Rudich (J. CSS '97) and the pseudorandom functions by
                 Naor and Reingold (J. ACM '04), our results show that
                 {\em standard techniques for hardness amplification can
                 only be applied to those circuit classes for which
                 standard techniques cannot prove circuit lower
                 bounds.}\par

                 Our results reveal a contrast between Yao's XOR Lemma
                 ($\Amp(f) := f(x_1) \oplus \ldots{} \oplus f(x_t) \in
                 zo$ and the Direct-Product Lemma $(\Amp(f) := f(x_1)
                 \circ \ldots{} \circ f(x_t) \in zo^t)$; here $\Amp(f)$
                 is non-Boolean). Our results (1) and (2) apply to Yao's
                 XOR lemma, whereas known proofs of the direct-product
                 lemma violate both (1) and (2).\par

                 One of our contributions is a new technique to handle
                 `non-uniform' reductions, i.e. the case when $D$
                 contains many circuits.",

                 perform best for my problem?\/} Recognizing the problem
                 as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine
                 learning community has developed the field of
                 meta-learning, focused on learning about learning
                 algorithm performance on classification problems. But
                 there has been only limited generalization of these
                 ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts
                 have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and
                 operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection
                 problem in different ways, introducing different
                 terminology, and overlooking the similarities of
                 approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained
                 from a greater awareness of developments in
                 meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized
                 to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning)
                 algorithms. In this article we present a unified
                 framework for considering the algorithm selection
                 problem as a learning problem, and use this framework
                 to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in
                 tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss
                 the generalization of meta-learning concepts to

                 search and seizure has predominantly been to pull the
                 plug on the suspect machine and subsequently perform a
                 post mortem examination on the storage medium. However,
                 with the advent of larger capacities of memory, drive
                 encryption and anti-forensics, this procedure may
                 result in the loss of valuable evidence. Volatile data
                 may be vital in determining criminal activity; it may
                 contain passwords used for encryption, indications of
                 anti-forensic techniques, memory resident malware which
                 would otherwise go unnoticed by the investigator. This
                 paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the

  abstract =     "The Caernarvon operating system was developed to
                 demonstrate that a high assurance system for smart
                 cards was technically feasible and commercially viable.
                 The entire system has been designed to be evaluated
                 under the Common Criteria at EAL7, the highest defined
                 level of assurance.\par

                 Historically, smart card processors have not supported
                 the hardware protection features necessary to separate
                 the OS from the applications, and one application from
                 another. The Caernarvon OS has taken advantage of the
                 first smart card processors with such features to be
                 the first smart card OS to provide this kind of
                 protection. Even when compared with conventional
                 systems where the hardware protection is routine, the
                 Caernarvon OS is noteworthy, because of the EAL7
                 assurance.\par

                 This approach facilitated implementation of a formally
                 specified, mandatory security policy providing
                 multi-level security (MLS) suitable for both government
                 agencies and commercial users. The mandatory security
                 policy requires effective authentication of its users
                 that is independent of applications. For this reason,
                 the Caernarvon OS also contains a privacy-preserving,
                 two-way authentication protocol integrated with the
                 Mandatory Security Policy.\par

                 The Caernarvon OS includes a strong cryptographic
                 library that has been separately certified under the
                 Common Criteria at EAL5+ for use with other systems.
                 The Caernarvon OS implements a secure method for
                 downloading trusted and untrusted application software
                 and data in the field, with the assumption that all
                 applications are potentially hostile. While the initial
                 platform for the operating system was smart cards, the
                 design could also be used in other embedded devices,
                 such as USB tokens, PDAs, cell phones, etc.",

  abstract =     "Implementation cryptanalysis has emerged as a
                 realistic threat for cryptographic systems. It consists
                 of two classes of attacks: fault-injection and
                 side-channel attacks. In this work, we examine the
                 resistance of the Fiat--Shamir scheme to
                 fault-injection attacks, since Fiat--Shamir is a
                 popular scheme for ``light'' consumer devices, such as
                 smartcards, in a wide range of consumer services. We
                 prove that an existing attack, known as the Bellcore
                 attack, is incomplete. We propose an extension to the
                 protocol that proactively secures Fiat--Shamir systems
                 from the Bellcore attack and we prove its strength.
                 Finally, we introduce a new attack model, which, under
                 stronger assumptions, can derive the secret keys from
                 both the original Fiat--Shamir scheme as well as its
                 proposed extension. Our approach demonstrates that
                 countermeasures for implementation cryptanalysis must
                 be carefully designed and that deployed systems must
                 include appropriate protection mechanisms for all known
                 attacks and be flexible enough to incorporate
                 countermeasures for new ones.",

  abstract =     "Application layer multicast (ALM) has been proposed to
                 overcome current limitations in IP multicast for
                 large-group multimedia communication. We address
                 offering data confidentiality tailored for ALM. To
                 achieve confidentiality, a node may need to
                 continuously {\em re-encrypt\/} packets before
                 forwarding them downstream. Furthermore, keys have to
                 be changed whenever there is a membership change,
                 leading to {\em rekey\/} processing overhead at the
                 nodes. For a large and dynamic group, these
                 reencryption and rekeying operations incur high
                 processing overhead at the nodes. We propose and
                 analyze a scalable scheme called Secure Overlay
                 Multicast (SOM) which clusters ALM peers so as to
                 localize rekeying within a cluster and to limit
                 re-encryption at cluster boundaries, thereby minimizing
                 the total nodal processing overhead. We describe the
                 operations of SOM and compare its nodal processing
                 overhead with two other basic approaches, namely,
                 host-to-host encryption and whole group encryption. We
                 also present a simplified analytic model for SOM and
                 show that there exists an optimal cluster size to
                 minimize the total nodal processing overhead. By
                 comparing with a recently proposed ALM scheme (DT
                 protocol), SOM achieves a substantial reduction in
                 nodal processing overhead with similar network
                 performance in terms of network stress and delay.",

                 guarantee the originality and quality of the
                 information. In this article, robust watermarking is
                 used to embed content-based fragile signatures in
                 multimedia signals to achieve efficient authentication
                 without requiring any third-party reference or side

                 caused by the embedding perturbation and other possible
                 encoding operations, a closed-form compensation
                 technique is proposed for ensuring signature
                 consistency by employing a Lagrangian-based approach. A
                 minimum distortion criterion is used to ensure signal
                 quality. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
                 investigated with simulations of examples of image
                 authentication in which signatures are designed to
                 reveal tamper localization. Results using quantitative
                 performance criteria show successful authentication
                 over a range of robustness in embedding watermarks
                 using both QIM-DM and spread-spectrum techniques. A

                 operation in public-key cryptography. Its elliptic
                 curve counterpart, called multi-scalar multiplication
                 is extensively used for digital signature verification.
                 Several algorithms have been proposed to speed-up those
                 critical computations. They are based on simultaneously
                 recoding a set of integers in order to minimize the
                 number of general multiplications or point additions.
                 When signed-digit recoding techniques can be used, as
                 in the world of elliptic curves, Joint Sparse Form
                 (JSF) and interleaving w-NAF are the most efficient
                 algorithms. In this paper, a novel recoding algorithm
                 for a pair of integers is proposed, based on a
                 decomposition that mixes powers of 2 and powers of 3.
                 The so-called Hybrid Binary-Ternary Joint Form require
                 fewer digits and is sparser than the JSF and the
                 interleaving w-NAF. Its advantages are illustrated for
                 elliptic curve double-scalar multiplication; the
                 operation counts show a gain of up to 19\%.",

  abstract =     "A system for private stream searching, introduced by
                 Ostrovsky and Skeith, allows a client to provide an
                 untrusted server with an encrypted search query. The
                 server uses the query on a stream of documents and
                 returns the matching documents to the client while
                 learning nothing about the nature of the query. We
                 present a new scheme for conducting private keyword
                 search on streaming data which requires $O(m)$ server
                 to client communication complexity to return the
                 content of the matching documents, where $m$ is an
                 upper bound on the size of the documents. The required
                 storage on the server conducting the search is also
                 $O(m)$. The previous best scheme for private stream
                 searching was shown to have $O(m \log m)$ communication
                 and storage complexity. Our solution employs a novel
                 construction in which the user reconstructs the
                 matching files by solving a system of linear equations.
                 This allows the matching documents to be stored in a
                 compact buffer rather than relying on redundancies to
                 avoid collisions in the storage buffer as in previous
                 work. This technique requires a small amount of
                 metadata to be returned in addition to the documents;
                 for this the original scheme of Ostrovsky and Skeith
                 may be employed with $O(m \log m)$ communication and
                 storage complexity. We also present an alternative
                 method for returning the necessary metadata based on a
                 unique encrypted Bloom filter construction. This method
                 requires $O(m \log(t / m))$ communication and storage
                 complexity, where $t$ is the number of documents in the
                 stream. In this article we describe our scheme, prove
                 it secure, analyze its asymptotic performance, and
                 describe a number of extensions. We also provide an
                 experimental analysis of its scalability in practice.
                 Specifically, we consider its performance in the
                 demanding scenario of providing a privacy preserving
                 version of the Google News Alerts service.",

  abstract =     "Motif discovery methods play pivotal roles in
                 deciphering the genetic regulatory codes (i.e., motifs)
                 in genomes as well as in locating conserved domains in
                 protein sequences. The Expectation Maximization (EM)
                 algorithm is one of the most popular methods used in de
                 novo motif discovery. Based on the position weight
                 matrix (PWM) updating technique, this paper presents a
                 Monte Carlo version of the EM motif-finding algorithm
                 that carries out stochastic sampling in local alignment
                 space to overcome the conventional EM's main drawback
                 of being trapped in a local optimum. The newly
                 implemented algorithm is named as Monte Carlo EM Motif
                 Discovery Algorithm (MCEMDA). MCEMDA starts from an
                 initial model, and then it iteratively performs Monte
                 Carlo simulation and parameter update until
                 convergence. A log-likelihood profiling technique
                 together with the top-$k$ strategy is introduced to
                 cope with the phase shifts and multiple modal issues in
                 motif discovery problem. A novel grouping motif
                 alignment (GMA) algorithm is designed to select motifs
                 by clustering a population of candidate local
                 alignments and successfully applied to subtle motif
                 discovery. MCEMDA compares favorably to other popular
                 PWM-based and word enumerative motif algorithms tested
                 using simulated $(l, d)$-motif cases, documented
                 prokaryotic, and eukaryotic DNA motif sequences.
                 Finally, MCEMDA is applied to detect large blocks of
                 conserved domains using protein benchmarks and exhibits
                 its excellent capacity while compared with other
                 multiple sequence alignment methods.",

  abstract =     "AES is the best known and most widely used block
                 cipher. Its three versions (AES-128, AES-192, and
                 AES-256) differ in their key sizes (128 bits, 192 bits
                 and 256 bits) and in their number of rounds (10, 12,
                 and 14, respectively). In the case of AES-128, there is
                 no known attack which is faster than the $2^{128}$
                 complexity of exhaustive search. However, AES-192 and
                 AES-256 were recently shown to be breakable by attacks
                 which require $2^{176}$ and $2^{119}$ time,
                 respectively. While these complexities are much faster
                 than exhaustive search, they are completely
                 non-practical, and do not seem to pose any real threat
                 to the security of AES-based systems. In this paper we
                 describe several attacks which can break with practical
                 complexity variants of AES-256 whose number of rounds
                 are comparable to that of AES-128. One of our attacks
                 uses only two related keys and $2^{39}$ time to recover
                 the complete 256-bit key of a 9-round version of
                 AES-256 (the best previous attack on this variant
                 required 4 related keys and $2^{120}$ time). Another
                 attack can break a 10 round version of AES-256 in
                 $2^{45}$ time, but it uses a stronger type of related
                 subkey attack (the best previous attack on this variant
                 required 64 related keys and $2^{172}$ time). While
                 neither AES-128 nor AES-256 can be directly broken by
                 these attacks, the fact that their hybrid (which
                 combines the smaller number of rounds from AES-128
                 along with the larger key size from AES-256) can be
                 broken with such a low complexity raises serious
                 concern about the remaining safety margin offered by
                 the AES family of cryptosystems.",

  abstract =     "As the number of RFID applications grows, concerns
                 about their security and privacy become greatly
                 amplified. At the same time, the acutely restricted and
                 cost-sensitive nature of RFID tags rules out simple
                 reuse of traditional security/privacy solutions and
                 calls for a new generation of extremely lightweight
                 identification and authentication protocols.\par

                 This article describes a universally composable
                 security framework designed especially for RFID
                 applications. We adopt RFID-specific setup,
                 communication, and concurrency assumptions in a model
                 that guarantees strong security, privacy, and
                 availability properties. In particular, the framework
                 supports modular deployment, which is most appropriate
                 for ubiquitous applications. We also describe a set of
                 simple, efficient, secure, and anonymous (untraceable)
                 RFID identification and authentication protocols that
                 instantiate the proposed framework. These protocols
                 involve minimal interaction between tags and readers
                 and place only a small computational load on the tag,
                 and a light computational burden on the back-end
                 server. We show that our protocols are provably secure
                 within the proposed framework.",

  abstract =     "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of tiny
                 devices with limited computation and battery
                 capacities. For such resource-constrained devices, data
                 transmission is a very energy-consuming operation. To
                 maximize WSN lifetime, it is essential to minimize the
                 number of bits sent and received by each device. One
                 natural approach is to aggregate sensor data along the
                 path from sensors to the sink. Aggregation is
                 especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between
                 sensors and the sink (or aggregate integrity) is
                 required. In this article, we propose a simple and
                 provably secure encryption scheme that allows efficient
                 additive aggregation of encrypted data. Only one
                 modular addition is necessary for ciphertext
                 aggregation. The security of the scheme is based on the
                 indistinguishability property of a pseudorandom
                 function (PRF), a standard cryptographic primitive. We
                 show that aggregation based on this scheme can be used
                 to efficiently compute statistical values, such as
                 mean, variance, and standard deviation of sensed data,
                 while achieving significant bandwidth savings. To
                 protect the integrity of the aggregated data, we
                 construct an end-to-end aggregate authentication scheme
                 that is secure against outsider-only attacks, also
                 based on the indistinguishability property of PRFs.",

  abstract =     "Privacy is an important issue in data publishing. Many
                 organizations distribute non-aggregate personal data
                 for research, and they must take steps to ensure that
                 an adversary cannot predict sensitive information
                 pertaining to individuals with high confidence. This
                 problem is further complicated by the fact that, in
                 addition to the published data, the adversary may also
                 have access to other resources (e.g., public records
                 and social networks relating individuals), which we
                 call adversarial knowledge. A robust privacy framework
                 should allow publishing organizations to analyze data
                 privacy by means of not only data dimensions (data that
                 a publishing organization has), but also
                 adversarial-knowledge dimensions (information not in
                 the data). In this paper, we first describe a general
                 framework for reasoning about privacy in the presence
                 of adversarial knowledge. Within this framework, we
                 propose a novel multidimensional approach to
                 quantifying adversarial knowledge. This approach allows
                 the publishing organization to investigate privacy
                 threats and enforce privacy requirements in the
                 presence of various types and amounts of adversarial
                 knowledge. Our main technical contributions include a
                 multidimensional privacy criterion that is more
                 intuitive and flexible than previous approaches to
                 modeling background knowledge. In addition, we identify
                 an important congregation property of the
                 adversarial-knowledge dimensions. Based on this
                 property, we provide algorithms for measuring
                 disclosure and sanitizing data that improve
                 computational efficiency several orders of magnitude
                 over the best known techniques.",

  abstract =     "In today's digital world, computer security issues
                 have become increasingly important. In particular,
                 researchers have proposed designs for secure processors
                 that utilize hardware-based memory encryption and
                 integrity verification to protect the privacy and
                 integrity of computation even from sophisticated
                 physical attacks. However, currently proposed schemes
                 remain hampered by problems that make them impractical
                 for use in today's computer systems: lack of virtual
                 memory and Inter-Process Communication support as well
                 as excessive storage and performance overheads. In this
                 article, we propose (1) address independent seed
                 encryption (AISE), a counter-mode-based memory
                 encryption scheme using a novel seed composition, and
                 (2) bonsai Merkle trees (BMT), a novel Merkle
                 tree-based memory integrity verification technique, to
                 eliminate these system and performance issues
                 associated with prior counter-mode memory encryption
                 and Merkle tree integrity verification schemes. We
                 present both a qualitative discussion and a
                 quantitative analysis to illustrate the advantages of
                 our techniques over previously proposed approaches in
                 terms of complexity, feasibility, performance, and
                 storage. Our results show that AISE+BMT reduces the
                 overhead of prior memory encryption and integrity
                 verification schemes from 12\% to 2\% on average for
                 single-threaded benchmarks on uniprocessor systems, and
                 from 15\% to 4\% for coscheduled benchmarks on
                 multicore systems while eliminating critical

                 complete depending on the data being processed. These
                 timing differences can sometimes disclose confidential
                 information. Indeed, researchers have been able to
                 reconstruct an RSA private key purely by querying an
                 SSL Web server and timing the results. Our work
                 analyzes the limits of attacks based on accurately
                 measuring network response times and jitter over a
                 local network and across the Internet. We present the
                 design of filters to significantly reduce the effects
                 of jitter, allowing an attacker to measure events with
                 15--100$\mu$s accuracy across the Internet, and as good
                 as 100ns over a local network. Notably,
                 security-related algorithms on Web servers and other
                 network servers need to be carefully engineered to

                 server-proxy-user architecture for multimedia delivery
                 promises significantly improved system scalability. The
                 introduction of the intermediary transcoding proxies
                 between content servers and end users in this
                 architecture, however, brings unprecedented challenges

                 authentication problem in the server-proxy-user
                 context, where intermediary proxies transcode
                 multimedia content dynamically. We present a formal
                 model for the authentication problem, propose a
                 concrete construction for authenticating generic data
                 modality and formally prove its security. We then apply
                 the generic construction to authenticating specific
                 multimedia formats, for example, JPEG2000 code-streams
                 and MPEG-4 video streams. The prototype implementation

  abstract =     "The PseudoRandom Number Generator (PRNG) used by the
                 Windows operating system is the most commonly used
                 PRNG. The pseudorandomness of the output of this
                 generator is crucial for the security of almost any
                 application running in Windows. Nevertheless, its exact
                 algorithm was never published.\par

                 We examined the binary code of a distribution of
                 Windows 2000. This investigation was done without any
                 help from Microsoft.We reconstructed the algorithm used
                 by the pseudorandom number generator (namely, the
                 function CryptGenRandom). We analyzed the security of
                 the algorithm and found a nontrivial attack: Given the
                 internal state of the generator, the previous state can
                 be computed in 223 steps. This attack on forward
                 security demonstrates that the design of the generator
                 is flawed, since it is well known how to prevent such
                 attacks. After our analysis was published, Microsoft
                 acknowledged that Windows XP is vulnerable to the same
                 attack.\par

                 We also analyzed the way in which the generator is used
                 by the operating system and found that it amplifies the
                 effect of the attack: The generator is run in user mode
                 rather than in kernel mode; therefore, it is easy to
                 access its state even without administrator privileges.
                 The initial values of part of the state of the
                 generator are not set explicitly, but rather are
                 defined by whatever values are present on the stack
                 when the generator is called. Furthermore, each process
                 runs a different copy of the generator, and the state
                 of the generator is refreshed with system-generated
                 entropy only after generating 128KB of output for the
                 process running it. The result of combining this
                 observation with our attack is that learning a single
                 state may reveal 128KB of the past and future output of
                 the generator.\par

                 The implication of these findings is that a buffer
                 overflow attack or a similar attack can be used to
                 learn a single state of the generator, which can then
                 be used to predict all random values, such as SSL keys,
                 used by a process in all its past and future
                 operations. This attack is more severe and more
                 efficient than known attacks in which an attack",

                 the main memory in most modern computers, retains its
                 contents for several seconds after power is lost, even
                 at room temperature and even if removed from a
                 motherboard. Although DRAM becomes less reliable when
                 it is not refreshed, it is not immediately erased, and
                 its contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or
                 forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory
                 images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability
                 of an operating system to protect cryptographic key
                 material from an attacker with physical access to a
                 machine. It poses a particular threat to laptop users
                 who rely on disk encryption: we demonstrate that it
                 could be used to compromise several popular disk
                 encryption products without the need for any special
                 devices or materials. We experimentally characterize
                 the extent and predictability of memory retention and
                 report that remanence times can be increased

                 in ``innocent-looking'' public communication so that
                 the presence of the secret messages cannot be detected.
                 This paper introduces a cryptographic formalization of
                 steganographic security in terms of computational
                 indistinguishability from a channel, an indexed family
                 of probability distributions on cover messages. We use
                 cryptographic and complexity-theoretic proof techniques
                 to show that the existence of one-way functions and the
                 ability to sample from the channel are necessary
                 conditions for secure steganography. We then construct
                 a steganographic protocol, based on rejection sampling
                 from the channel, that is provably secure and has
                 nearly optimal bandwidth under these conditions. This
                 is the first known example of a general provably secure
                 steganographic protocol. We also give the first
                 formalization of ``robust'' steganography, where an
                 adversary attempts to remove any hidden messages
                 without unduly disrupting the cover channel. We give a
                 necessary condition on the amount of disruption the
                 adversary is allowed in terms of a worst case measure
                 of mutual information. We give a construction that is
                 provably secure and computationally efficient and has
                 nearly optimal bandwidth, assuming repeatable access to
                 the channel distribution.",

                 about quantum states.\par

                 {\em Substate theorem:\/} Let $\rho$ and $\sigma$ be
                 quantum states in the same Hilbert space with relative
                 entropy $S(\rho || \sigma) : Tr \rho (log \rho - log
                 \sigma) = c$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there is a
                 state $\rho\prime$ such that the trace distance
                 $||\rho\prime - \rho || _{tr} : Tr \sqrt(\rho\prime -
                 \rho)^2 \leq \epsilon$, and $\rho\prime / 2^{O(c /
                 \epsilon 2)} \leq \sigma$.\par

                 It states that if the relative entropy of $\rho$ and
                 $\sigma$ is small, then there is a state $\rho\prime$
                 close to $\rho$, i.e. with small trace distance
                 $||\rho\prime - \rho||_{tr}$, that when scaled down by
                 a factor $2^{\em O\/}(c)$ `sits inside', or becomes a
                 `substate' of, $\sigma$. This result has several
                 applications in quantum communication complexity and
                 cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we derive a
                 privacy trade-off for the {\em set membership
                 problem\/} in the two-party quantum communication
                 model. Here Alice is given a subset $A \subseteq [n]$,
                 Bob an input $i \in [n]$, and they need to determine if
                 $i \in A$.\par

                 {\em Privacy trade-off for set membership:\/} In any
                 two-party quantum communication protocol for the set
                 membership problem, if Bob reveals only $k$ bits of
                 information about his input, then Alice must reveal at
                 least $n/2^{O(k)}$ bits of information about her
                 input.\par

                 We also discuss relationships between various
                 information theoretic quantities that arise naturally

                 NTRUEncrypt, is a parameterized family of lattice-based
                 public key cryptosystems. Both the encryption and
                 decryption operations in NTRU are based on simple
                 polynomial multiplication which makes it very fast
                 compared to other alternatives such as RSA, and
                 elliptic-curve-based systems. Recently, the NTRU system
                 has been accepted to the IEEE P1363 standards under the
                 specifications for lattice-based public-key
                 cryptography (IEEE P1363.1). In this paper, we
                 investigate several hardware implementation options for
                 the NTRU encryption algorithm. In particular, by

  abstract =     "Although the content of sensor messages describing
                 ``events of interest'' may be encrypted to provide
                 confidentiality, the context surrounding these events
                 may also be sensitive and therefore should be protected
                 from eavesdroppers. An adversary armed with knowledge
                 of the network deployment, routing algorithms, and the
                 base-station (data sink) location can infer the
                 temporal patterns of interesting events by merely
                 monitoring the arrival of packets at the sink, thereby
                 allowing the adversary to remotely track the
                 spatio-temporal evolution of a sensed event. In this
                 paper we introduce the problem of temporal privacy for
                 delay-tolerant sensor networks, and propose adaptive
                 buffering at intermediate nodes on the source-sink
                 routing path to obfuscate temporal information from the
                 adversary. We first present the effect of buffering on
                 temporal privacy using an information-theoretic
                 formulation, and then examine the effect that delaying
                 packets has on buffer occupancy. We observe that
                 temporal privacy and efficient buffer utilization are
                 contrary objectives, and then present an adaptive
                 buffering strategy that effectively manages these
                 tradeoffs. Finally, we evaluate our privacy enhancement
                 strategies using simulations, where privacy is
                 quantified in terms of the adversary's mean square
                 error.",

  abstract =     "Mutual authentication and authenticated key exchange
                 are fundamental techniques for enabling secure
                 communication over public, insecure networks. It is
                 well known how to design secure protocols for achieving
                 these goals when parties share {\em high-entropy\/}
                 cryptographic keys in advance of the authentication
                 stage. Unfortunately, it is much more common for users
                 to share weak, {\em low-entropy\/} passwords which
                 furthermore may be chosen from a known space of
                 possibilities (say, a dictionary of English words). In
                 this case, the problem becomes much more difficult as
                 one must ensure that protocols are immune to {\em
                 off-line dictionary attacks\/} in which an adversary
                 exhaustively enumerates all possible passwords in an
                 attempt to determine the correct one.\par

                 We propose a 3-round protocol for password-only
                 authenticated key exchange, and provide a rigorous
                 proof of security for our protocol based on the
                 decisional Diffie--Hellman assumption. The protocol
                 assumes only public parameters --- specifically, a
                 ``common reference string'' --- which can be
                 ``hard-coded'' into an implementation of the protocol;
                 in particular, and in contrast to some previous work,
                 our protocol does {\em not\/} require either party to
                 pre-share a public key. The protocol is also remarkably
                 efficient, requiring computation only (roughly) 4 times
                 greater than ``classical'' Diffie--Hellman key exchange
                 that provides no authentication at all. Ours is the
                 first protocol for password-only authentication that is
                 both {\em practical\/} and {\em provably-secure using
                 standard cryptographic assumptions}.",

                 research interest due to its ability to provide greater
                 security per bit compared to public key systems such as
                 RSA. The designer of an elliptic curve hardware
                 accelerator is faced with many choices at design time,
                 each of which can impact the performance of the
                 accelerator in different ways. There are many examples
                 in the literature of how these design choices can
                 effect the area and/or speed of an elliptic curve
                 hardware accelerator. The effect of design choices on
                 power and energy consumption in elliptic curve hardware
                 has been less well studied. This article studies the

                 operations such as compression, simplification or
                 watermarking, which may introduce some geometric
                 artifacts on the shape. The main issue is to maximize
                 the compression/simplification ratio or the watermark
                 strength while minimizing these visual degradations.
                 However few algorithms exploit the human visual system
                 to {\em hide\/} these degradations, while perceptual
                 attributes could be quite relevant for this task.
                 Particularly, the {\em masking effect\/} defines the
                 fact that one visual pattern can hide the visibility of
                 another. In this context we introduce an algorithm for
                 estimating the {\em roughness\/} of a 3D mesh, as a
                 local measure of geometric noise on the surface.
                 Indeed, a textured (or {\em rough\/}) region is able to
                 hide geometric distortions much better than a smooth
                 one. Our measure is based on curvature analysis on
                 local windows of the mesh and is independent of the
                 resolution/connectivity of the object. The accuracy and
                 the robustness of our measure, together with its
                 relevance regarding visual masking have been
                 demonstrated through extensive comparisons with
                 state-of-the-art and subjective experiment. Two
                 applications are also presented, in which the roughness
                 is used to lead (and improve) respectively compression
                 and watermarking algorithms.",

                 against radio jamming. The situation becomes worse if
                 energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting
                 knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the
                 packets may help to prevent the jammer from taking
                 actions based on the content of the packets, but the

                 examined. In addition, we validate our simulation model
                 by comparing its results with measurements obtained
                 from actual implementation on our sensor node
                 prototypes. We show that it takes little effort to
                 implement such effective jammers, making them a
                 realistic threat.\par

                 Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the
                 respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC reveals
                 that those protocols are, to some extent, also
                 susceptible to our attacks. The result of this
                 investigation provides new insights into the security
                 considerations of MAC protocols.",

  abstract =     "In this article, we present an approach for realizing
                 a {\em safe execution environment (SEE)\/} that enables
                 users to ``try out'' new software (or configuration
                 changes to existing software) without the fear of
                 damaging the system in any manner. A key property of
                 our SEE is that it faithfully reproduces the behavior
                 of applications, as if they were running natively on
                 the underlying (host) operating system. This is
                 accomplished via {\em one-way isolation\/}: processes
                 running within the SEE are given read-access to the
                 environment provided by the host OS, but their write
                 operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE.
                 As a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior
                 of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the
                 host OS. SEEs support a wide range of tasks, including:
                 study of malicious code, controlled execution of
                 untrusted software, experimentation with software
                 configuration changes, testing of software patches, and
                 so on. It provides a convenient way for users to
                 inspect system changes made within the SEE. If these
                 changes are not accepted, they can be rolled back at
                 the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be
                 committed so as to become visible outside the SEE. We
                 provide consistency criteria that ensure semantic
                 consistency of the committed results. We develop two
                 different implementation approaches, one in {\em
                 user-land\/} and the other in the {\em OS kernel}, for
                 realizing a safe-execution environment. Our
                 implementation results show that most software,
                 including fairly complex server and client
                 applications, can run successfully within our SEEs. It
                 introduces low performance overheads, typically below
                 10 percent.",

  abstract =     "This study explores whether internet users' concerns
                 for personal information privacy, principally
                 manifested as online privacy, are related to their
                 attitudes to government surveillance and national ID
                 cards (often perceived as a surveillance tool). This is
                 a relationship which needs to be explored in-depth
                 because of three concurrent trends -- first, the push
                 towards e-government, where citizen-government
                 transactions are increasingly conducted online; second,
                 the growing use of smart cards, RFID tags and other
                 portable information collection and transmission
                 devices by governments and businesses; and third, calls
                 for greater government surveillance, both online and
                 offline, to counter terrorism in the post 9/11
                 environment.\par

                 While prior research has dealt with individual concerns
                 about online privacy and individual concerns about
                 government surveillance, studies exploring the
                 relationship between the two are limited. This study
                 seeks to fill that gap by surveying Internet users
                 across five cities which vary in their experience of
                 government surveillance and the use of national ID
                 cards -- Bangalore, New York, Seoul, Singapore and
                 Sydney.\par

                 Personal information privacy is the individual's
                 ability to personally control information about
                 him/herself. Such information could include anything
                 from one's birth registration details, to the
                 identities and coordinates of one's next-of-kin, income
                 and expenditure patterns and even health records. In
                 countries where day-to-day transactions with commercial
                 and government entities are increasingly being
                 conducted online, involving the electronic collection
                 of personal information, online privacy is the
                 principal manifestation of personal information
                 privacy.\par

                 As e-commerce and e-government services become more
                 pervasive, Internet users' concerns about online
                 privacy are likely to grow. Individual online privacy
                 concerns have been classified into improper
                 acquisition, improper use and privacy invasion.$^{12}$
                 Concerns about improper acquisition relate to
                 unauthorized access to personal information, improper
                 collection of one's private information and improper
                 monitoring of consumers' online activities. Concerns
                 about improper use cover unauthorized analysis of
                 consumers' online shopping behavior and the subsequent
                 business-to-business transfer of such analyses.
                 Concerns about privacy invasion refer to the
                 transmission of information to Internet users without
                 their prior consent, such as spam, as well as the
                 improper storage of personal information. To maintain
                 their online privacy, Internet users can engage in
                 self-protective behaviour such as opting out, using
                 privacy enhancing technologies, reading privacy
                 policies, or checking trust marks.\par

                 Studies have been conducted to test concern about
                 online privacy as a function of demographic variables.
                 Sheehan$^{10}$ found that gender was a significant
                 factor in that female consumers were generally more
                 concerned about their personal privacy than male
                 consumers. In general, older consumers$^2$ were also
                 more concerned about online privacy. The relationship
                 between consumers' experience with the Internet and
                 online privacy concerns has also been explored. Bellman
                 et al.$^2$ reported that consumers' online privacy
                 concerns diminished with Internet experience. As more
                 consumers use the Internet and the average level of
                 experience rises, online privacy concerns should
                 gradually diminish. In general, studies have
                 demonstrated that demographic variables and
                 Internet-related experiences significantly affect
                 Internet users' concern about online privacy.",

                 for many security and digital rights management
                 protocols. PUF-based security approaches have numerous
                 comparative strengths with respect to traditional
                 cryptography-based techniques, including resilience
                 against physical and side channel attacks and
                 suitability for lightweight protocols. However,
                 classical delay-based PUF structures have a number of
                 drawbacks including susceptibility to guessing, reverse
                 engineering, and emulation attacks, as well as
                 sensitivity to operational and environmental
                 variations.\par

                 To address these limitations, we have developed a new

                 can be exploited to eliminate the stated PUF
                 limitations. We also show how FPGA-based PUFs can be

                 reconfigurability enables the introduction of new
                 techniques for PUF testing. The effectiveness of all

                 fails, however, under a CCA2 attack. In fact, since the

                 attack on WPA. Their attack (called the Beck--Tews
                 attack) can recover plaintext from an encrypted short
                 packet, and can falsify it. The execution time of the
                 Beck--Tews attack is about 12--15 minutes. However, the
                 attack has the limitation, namely, the targets are only
                 WPA implementations that support IEEE802.11e QoS
                 features. In this paper, we propose a practical message
                 falsification attack on any WPA implementation. In
                 order to ease targets of limitation of wireless LAN
                 products, we apply the Beck--Tews attack to the
                 man-in-the-middle attack. In the man-in-the-middle
                 attack, the user's communication is intercepted by an
                 attacker until the attack ends. It means that the users
                 may detect our attack when the execution time of the
                 attack is large. Therefore, we give methods for
                 reducing the execution time of the attack. As a result,
                 the execution time of our attack becomes about one

                 for C language programs that is fully compatible with
                 the ANSI C specification.\par

                 Programs written in C often suffer from nasty errors
                 due to dangling pointers and buffer overflow. Such
                 errors in Internet server programs are often exploited
                 by malicious attackers to crack an entire system. The
                 origin of these errors is usually corruption of
                 in-memory data structures caused by out-of-bound array
                 accesses. Usual C compilers do not provide any
                 protection against such out-of-bound access, although
                 many other languages such as Java and ML do provide
                 such protection. There have been several proposals for
                 preventing such memory corruption from various aspects:
                 runtime buffer overrun detectors, designs for new
                 C-like languages, and compilers for (subsets of) the C
                 language. However, as far as we know, none of them have
                 achieved full memory protection and full compatibility
                 with the C language specification at the same
                 time.\par

                 We propose the most powerful solution to this problem
                 ever presented. We have developed {\em Fail-Safe C}, a
                 memory-safe implementation of the full ANSI C language.
                 It detects and disallows all unsafe operations, yet
                 conforms to the full ANSI C standard (including casts
                 and unions). This paper introduces several
                 techniques--both compile-time and runtime--to reduce
                 the overhead of runtime checks, while still maintaining
                 100\% memory safety. This compiler lets programmers
                 easily make their programs safe without heavy rewriting
                 or porting of their code. It also supports many of the
                 'dirty tricks' commonly used in many existing C
                 programs, which do not strictly conform to the standard
                 specification. In this paper, we demonstrate several
                 real-world server programs that can be processed by our
                 compiler and present technical details and benchmark
                 results for it.",

  abstract =     "Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice
                 problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning
                 problem. This learning problem is a natural extension
                 of the ``learning from parity with error'' problem to
                 higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of
                 decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe,
                 gives a strong indication that these problems are hard.
                 Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient
                 solution to the learning problem implies a {\em
                 quantum\/} algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open
                 question is whether this reduction can be made
                 classical (i.e., nonquantum).\par

                 We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem
                 whose security is based on the hardness of the learning
                 problem. By the main result, its security is also based
                 on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP.
                 The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than
                 previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is
                 of size $\Otilde(n^2)$ and encrypting a message
                 increases its size by a factor of $\Otilde(n)$ (in
                 previous cryptosystems these values are $\Otilde(n^4)$
                 and $\Otilde(n^2)$, respectively). In fact, under the
                 assumption that all parties share a random bit string
                 of length $\Otilde(n^2)$, the size of the public key
                 can be reduced to $\Otilde(n)$.",

  abstract =     "Since the first announcement of a Side Channel
                 Analysis (SCA) about ten years ago, considerable
                 research has been devoted to studying these attacks on
                 Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), such
                 as smart cards or TPMs. In this article, we compare
                 power-line attacks with ElectroMagnetic (EM) attacks,
                 specifically targeting Field Programmable Gate Array
                 devices (FPGAs), as they are becoming widely used for
                 sensitive applications involving cryptography.\par

                 We show experimentally that ElectroMagnetic Analysis
                 (EMA) is always faster than the historical Differential
                 Power Analysis (DPA) in retrieving keys of symmetric
                 ciphers. In addition, these analyses prove to be very
                 convenient to conduct, as they are totally
                 non-invasive.\par

                 Research reports indicate that EMA can be conducted
                 globally, typically with macroscopic home-made coils
                 circling the device under attack, with fair results.
                 However, as accurate professional EM antennas are now
                 becoming more accessible, it has become commonplace to
                 carry out EM analyses locally.\par

                 Cartography has been carried out by optical means on
                 circuits realized with technology greater than 250
                 nanometers. Nonetheless, for deep submicron
                 technologies, the feature size of devices that are
                 spied upon is too small to be visible with photographic
                 techniques. In addition, the presence of the 6+
                 metallization layers obviously prevents a direct
                 observation of the layout. Therefore, EM imaging is
                 emerging as a relevant means to discover the underlying
                 device structure.\par

                 In this article, we present the first images of
                 deep-submicron FPGAs. The resolution is not as accurate
                 as photographic pictures: we notably compare the layout
                 of toy design examples placed at the four corners of
                 the FPGAs with the EM images we collected. We observe
                 that EM imaging has the advantage of revealing active
                 regions, which can be useful in locating a particular
                 processor (visible while active---invisible when
                 inactive).\par

                 In the context of EM attacks, we stress that the exact
                 localization of the cryptographic target is not
                 necessary: the coarse resolution we obtain is
                 sufficient. We note that the EM imaging does not reveal
                 the exact layout of the FPGA, but instead directly
                 guides the attacker towards the areas which are leaking
                 the most. We achieve attacks with an accurate sensor,
                 both far from (namely on a SMC capacitor on the board)
                 and close to (namely directly over the FPGA) the
                 encryption co-processor. As compared to the previously
                 published attacks, we report a successful attack on a
                 DES module in fewer than 6,300 measurements, which is
                 currently the best cracking performance against this
                 encryption algorithm implemented in FPGAs.",

  abstract =     "Users are storing ever-increasing amounts of
                 information digitally, driven by many factors including
                 government regulations and the public's desire to
                 digitally record their personal histories.
                 Unfortunately, many of the security mechanisms that
                 modern systems rely upon, such as encryption, are
                 poorly suited for storing data for indefinitely long
                 periods of time; it is very difficult to manage keys
                 and update cryptosystems to provide secrecy through
                 encryption over periods of decades. Worse, an adversary
                 who can compromise an archive need only wait for
                 cryptanalysis techniques to catch up to the encryption
                 algorithm used at the time of the compromise in order
                 to obtain ``secure'' data. To address these concerns,
                 we have developed POTSHARDS, an archival storage system
                 that provides long-term security for data with very
                 long lifetimes without using encryption. Secrecy is
                 achieved by using unconditionally secure secret
                 splitting and spreading the resulting shares across
                 separately managed archives. Providing availability and
                 data recovery in such a system can be difficult; thus,
                 we use a new technique, approximate pointers, in
                 conjunction with secure distributed RAID techniques to
                 provide availability and reliability across independent
                 archives. To validate our design, we developed a
                 prototype POTSHARDS implementation. In addition to
                 providing us with an experimental testbed, this
                 prototype helped us to understand the design issues
                 that must be addressed in order to maximize security.",

                 the flow of information are desirable, for example,
                 when handling important cryptographic keys or sensitive
                 financial data. We present a novel architecture capable
                 of tracking all information flow within the machine,
                 including all explicit data transfers and all implicit
                 flows (those subtly devious flows caused by not
                 performing conditional operations). While the problem
                 is impossible to solve in the general case, we have
                 created a machine that avoids the general-purpose
                 programmability that leads to this impossibility
                 result, yet is still programmable enough to handle a
                 variety of critical operations such as public-key
                 encryption and authentication. Through the application
                 of our novel gate-level information flow tracking
                 method, we show how all flows of information can be
                 precisely tracked. From this foundation, we then
                 describe how a class of architectures can be
                 constructed, from the gates up, to completely capture
                 all information flows and we measure the impact of

                 multiplicity of evolving 1-way conversations, can a
                 machine or an algorithm discern the conversational
                 pairs in an online fashion, without understanding the
                 content of the communications? Our analysis indicates
                 that this is possible, and can be achieved just by
                 exploiting the temporal dynamics inherent in a
                 conversation. We also show that our findings are
                 applicable for anonymous and encrypted conversations
                 over VoIP networks. We achieve this by exploiting the
                 aperiodic inter-departure time of VoIP packets, hence
                 trivializing each VoIP stream into a binary
                 time-series, indicating the voice activity of each
                 stream. We propose effective techniques that
                 progressively pair conversing parties with high
                 accuracy and in a limited amount of time. Our findings
                 are verified empirically on a dataset consisting of
                 1,000 conversations. We obtain very high pairing
                 accuracy that reaches 97\% after 5 min of voice
                 conversations. Using a modeling approach we also
                 demonstrate analytically that our result can be

                 difficulties in achieving real-time authentication.
                 Public Key Cryptography (PKC), however, can satisfy the
                 real-time requirements, and recent trends indicate that
                 public key is becoming feasible for sensor
                 networks.\par

                 However, PKC operations are still expensive
                 computations. It is impractical to use PKC in the
                 conventional ways for broadcast authentication in
                 sensor networks. To reduce costs, we propose {\em
                 ShortPK}, an efficient Short-term Public Key broadcast
                 authentication scheme. The basic idea is to use
                 short-length public/private keys, but limit their
                 lifetime to only a short period of time. To cover a
                 long period of time, we need to use many public/private
                 key pairs; distributing these public keys to sensors is
                 a challenging problem. We describe a progressive key
                 distribution scheme that is secure, efficient, and
                 packet-loss resilient. We compare our scheme with the
                 traditional 160-bit ECC public key schemes, and show
                 that our scheme can achieve a significant improvement
                 on energy consumption.",

                 delegates its data management tasks to a location-based
                 service (LBS), which indexes the data with an
                 authenticated data structure (ADS). The LBS receives
                 queries (ranges, nearest neighbors) originating from
                 several clients/subscribers. Each query initiates the
                 computation of a verification object (VO) based on the
                 ADS. The VO is returned to the client that can verify
                 the result correctness using the public key of the
                 owner. Our first contribution is the MR-tree, a
                 space-efficient ADS that supports fast query processing
                 and verification. Our second contribution is the
                 MR*-tree, a modified version of the MR-tree, which
                 significantly reduces the VO size through a novel
                 embedding technique. Finally, whereas most ADSs must be
                 constructed and maintained by the owner, we outsource
                 the MR- and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to
                 the LBS, thus relieving the owner from this

                 it allows an original signer to delegate her signing
                 capability to a proxy signer and the proxy signer can
                 produce a signature on behalf of the original signer.
                 In this paper, we propose an ID-based and repairing
                 NTRUSign-based anonymous multi-proxy signature scheme.
                 With the characteristic of NTRUSign, our scheme has
                 more effective the key generation and rapid computation
                 speed than other similar schemes based on RSA or ECC.
                 The signers in our scheme are all anonymous so that no
                 one can forge the signing key composed of the hash
                 value of the original and all the proxy signers'
                 identities. The secretly chosen small polynomials were
                 transmitted among signers according to a certain order
                 without secure channels. The signing key is the
                 combination of the original and all the proxy signers'
                 keys. We also show our INBAMPS scheme satisfies all the
                 properties of the general multi-signature scheme. And
                 we point out that our scheme is resistant to
                 existential message attack based on repairing NTRUSign.
                 Thus, our INBAMPS scheme is secure.",

                 verifiability using standard elliptic curve signature
                 [10][1]. An elliptic curve based signcryption scheme
                 SC-ECDSA was proposed. A one time padding cipher with a
                 session key generated by respective secret knowledge
                 was constructed to encrypt messages. The standardized
                 signature scheme ECDSA was used to sign and verify.
                 Proof shows that SC-ECDSA matches the three security
                 notions: unforgeability, non-repudiation and
                 confidentiality (provable CUF-CPA). For typical
                 security parameters, SC-ECDSA saves 80\% computation
                 time and 4.7\% message expansion than other schemes. It
                 presents a 29.2\% reduction in computation time and a
                 6.9\% reduction in message expansion than traditional
                 Sign-then-Encrypt.",
