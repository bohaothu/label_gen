	developed by the ``DFG-Forschergruppe Petrinetz-Technologie''. The
	two main concepts of Petri net transformations considered in this
	context are net class and net model transformations. Net class transformations
	are transformations between different Petri net classes, like elementary
	nets, place/transition nets and algebraic high-level nets. Net model
	transformations on the other hand are transformations of the net
	structure for nets within one Petri net class, like place or transition
	refinement. The main technical results are concerning the preservation
	of safety resp. liveness properties of net model transformations
	and compatibility results between net class and net model transformations.},

  abstract = {The ``classical'' approach to represent Petri nets by graph transformation
	systems is to translate each transition of a specific Petri net to
	a graph rule (behavior rule). This translation depends on a concrete
	model and may yield large graph transformation systems as the number
	of rules depends directly on the number of transitions in the net.
	Hence, the aim of this paper is to define the behavior of Algebraic
	High-Level (AHL) nets, a high-level Petri net variant, by a parallel,
	typed, attributed graph transformation system. Such a general parallel
	transformation system for AHL nets replaces the translation of transitions
	of specific AHL nets. After reviewing the formal definitions of AHL
	nets and parallel attributed graph transformation, we formalize the
	classical translation from AHL nets to graph transformation systems
	and prove the correctness of the translation. The translation approach
	then is contrasted to a definition for AHL net behavior based on
	parallel graph transformation. We show that the resulting amalgamated
	rules correspond to the behavior rules from the classical translation
	approach. },

  abstract = { In order to model the behaviour of open concurrent systems by means
	of Petri nets, we introduce open Petri nets, a generalization of
	the ordinary model where some places, designated as open, represent
	an interface of the system towards the environment. Besides generalizing
	the token game to reflect this extension, we define a truly concurrent
	semantics for open nets by extending the Goltz-Reisig process semantics
	of Petri nets. We introduce a composition operation over open nets,
	characterized as a pushout in the corresponding category, suitable
	to model both interaction through open places and synchronization
	of transitions. The deterministic process semantics is shown to be
	compositional with respect to such composition operation. If a net
	Z3 results as the composition of two nets Z1 and Z2, having a common
	subnet Z0, then any two deterministic processes of Z1 and Z2 which
	``agree'' on the common part, can be ``amalgamated'' to produce a
	deterministic process of Z3. Vice versa, any deterministic process
	of Z3 can be decomposed into processes of the component nets. The
	amalgamation and decomposition operations are shown to be inverse
	to each other, leading to a bijective correspondence between the
	deterministic processes of Z3 and pair of deterministic processes
	of Z1 and Z2 which agree on the common subnet Z0. Technically, our
	result is similar to the amalgamation theorem for data-types in the
	framework of algebraic specification. A possible application field
	of the proposed constructions and results is the modeling of interorganizational
	workflows, recently studied in the literature. This is illustrated
	by a running example. },

	which are diagrams of sub-specifications. The graph of a diagram
	presents the architecture: the nodes correspond to the sub-specifications

	visual specification technique, so this approach is in the tradition
	of high-level replacement systems. We discuss how to transform such
	specification architectures and distinguish local and global changes.
	The main emphasis of this contribution is the specification and transformation
	of specification architectures using \GenGEDp. In GenGED, a visual
	language (VL) is defined by a visual alphabet and a visual syntax
	grammar. We define a VL for specification architectures by composing
	VLs for graphs and for P/T nets enhanced by Petri net morphisms.
	From this VL definition a syntax-directed editor is generated supporting
	the editing of consistent specification architectures. Local and
	global changes of a specific specification architecture then can
	easily be defined as transformation rules in our VL and visualized
	in the GenGED environment. },

  abstract = {The theory of algebraic graph transformation has proven to be a suitable
	underlying formal framework to reason about the behavior of model
	transformations. In order to model an arbitrary number of actions
	at different places in the same model, the concept of amalgamated
	graph transformation has been proposed. Rule applications of certain
	regularity are described by a rule scheme which contains multirules
	modeling elementary actions and a common kernel rule for their synchronization
	(amalgamation). The amalgamation theorem by B{\"o}hm et al. ensures
	that for two multi-rules, the application of the amalgamated rule
	yields the same result as two iterative rule applications, respecting
	their common kernel rule application. In this paper, we propose an
	extension of the amalgamation theorem to an arbitrary finite number
	of synchronous rule applications. The theorem is used to show parallel
	independence of amalgamated graph transformations by analyzing the
	underlying multi-rules. As example, we specify an excerpt of a model
	transformation from Business Process Models (BPM) to the Business
	Process Execution Language (BPEL).},

	(actors) can transmit content (via channels), which is contextually
	interpreted. Actors may join, move in or leave so-called communication
	spaces, where the actors’ preferences, access rights and roles are
	respected and define a temporary set of communicating partners and
	a context of interpretation for communicated data. An adequate modeling
	technique for such dynamic
	
	communication-based systems (DCS) should take into account the changing
	communication relations between DCS actors.
	
	Conventional modeling techniques for communicationbased systems like
	Petri nets or UML are restricted to model communication based on
	a static, immutable network topology.
	
	In our research project ”Formal modeling and analysis of flexible
	processes in mobile ad-hoc networks”, we have proposed an appropriate
	integration of Petri nets and Petri net transformation rules, based
	on graph transformation (reconfigurable Petri nets).
	
	In this paper, we extend this previous work on reconfigurable Petri
	nets on the one hand by marking-changing Petri net transformations,
	and on the other hand by a technique parallelizing the application
	of net transformation rules at several matches at once. Both extensions
	together allow for a flexible modeling of communication concepts
	in DCS, like e.g. multicasting, where one actor transmits contents
	to a group of selected actors. We apply our extended technique to
	model multicasting group communication.},

	Models of these languages are the basis for simulation with the purpose

	Auf diese Weise kann eine komplexe {\"A}nderung durch eine Reihe
	von einfachen Regeln beschrieben und durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Wir

	werden die Ver{\"a}nderungen an diesem Graphen ausgewertet und auf

	namely the workflow layer, the mobility layer and the team layer.
	Dividing the aho net model into layers immediately rises the question
	of consistency. We suggest a formal notion of layer consistency requiring
	that the team layer is given by the mapping of the individual member's
	activities to the gluing of the workflow and the mobility layer.
	The main results concern the maintenance of the layer consistency

	On the one hand, the Resource Desription Framework (RDF) is the basis
	of the Semantic Web. On the other hand, algebraic graph transformation
	has a long history of providing formally well-founded modification
	concepts for various graph and graph-like structures. By designing
	an algebraic transformation approach for RDF, the rich theoretical
	results of algebraic graph transformation are made available to the
	RDF world. To achieve this goal, the formal abstract syntax and semantics
	of RDF is first reformulated in the language of category theory which
	is used heavily in graph transformation. Then, an abstract, categorical
	transformation framework is developed which is suitable for being
	afterwards instantiated by RDF structures. This is necessary since
	the existing frameworks are not applicable in an unmodified form.
	The main theoretical results are a sequential composition operation
	for transformation rules and theorems showing the possibility to
	analyse and synthesise transformations for these sequentially composed
	rules. Moreover, these results are also available for transformation
	rules with negative application conditions. The applicability of
	the resulting concept of RDF graph transformations is shown by two
	application scenarios. One is a classical Semantic Web application
	managing bibliographical metadata, while the other uses RDF as an
	abstract syntax for domain-specific modelling languages.},

	a finitary M-adhesive category and finitariness is preserved under
	functor and comma category constructions based on M-adhesive categories.
	This means that all the classical results are also valid for corresponding

  abstract = {In category theory, most set-theoretic constructions -- union, intersection,
	etc. -- have direct categorical counterparts. But up to now, there
	is no direct construction of a deletion operation like the set-theoretic
	complement. In rule-based transformation systems, deletion of parts
	of a given object is one of the main tasks. In the double pushout
	approach to algebraic graph transformation, the construction of pushout
	complements is used in order to locally delete structures from graphs.
	But in general categories, even if they have pushouts, pushout complements
	do not necessarily exist or are unique. In this paper, two different
	constructions for pushout complements are given and compared. Both
	constructions are based on certain universal constructions in the
	sense of category theory. More specifically, one uses initial pushouts
	while the other one uses quasi-coproduct complements. These constructions
	are applied to examples in the categories of graphs and simple graphs.},

	In the context discussed here, they should be modeled in a decentralized,

	By discussing a simplified loan granting process in the context of
	a Business Continuity Management System at Credit Suisse, we show
	how algebraic graph transformation can contribute a methodologically
	sound solution being compatible with all these requirements in a
	coherent way. As a consequence significant benefits of automation
	and quality can be realized. The presented contribution is theoretically
	sound and implementable by the people in the field.},

	in Latin -- is a new algebraic approach to abstract rewriting in
	any category. sqpo rewriting is a deterministic and conservative
	extension of double-pushout (dpo) rewriting, which allows to model
	``deletion in unknown context'', a typical feature of single-pushout
	(spo) rewriting, as well as cloning. After illustrating the expressiveness
	of the proposed approach through a case study modelling an access

  abstract = {Subobject transformation systems STS are proposed as a novel formal
	framework for the analysis of derivations of transformation systems
	based on the algebraic, double-pushout (DPO) approach. They can be
	considered as a simplified variant of DPO rewriting, acting in the
	distributive lattice of subobjects of a given object of an adhesive
	category. This setting allows a direct analysis of all possible notions
	of dependency between any two productions without requiring an explicit
	match. In particular, several equivalent characterizations of independence
	of productions are proposed, as well as a local Church–Rosser theorem
	in the setting of STS. Finally, we show how any derivation tree in
	an ordinary DPO grammar leads to an STS via a suitable construction
	and show that relational reasoning in the resulting STS is sound
	and complete with respect to the independence in the original derivation
	tree.},

	only the changed parts can, under certain conditions, give the required
	assurance. This opens the possibility of creating formally verified,
	reusable refactoring patterns. However, a mechanism for extracting
	such patterns is needed. To address this problem, a theoretical framework
	is presented that allow to formally reason about the rule extraction
	process. In order to harness the theoretical results, a visual editor
	and tool chain are introduced to aid developers in extracting refactoring
	rules and prove their behavioural correctness.},

	the low-level net Flat(N) which is obtained from N via the well-known
	flattening construction. This low-level notion of processes for high-level
	nets, however, is not really adequate, because the high-level structure
	is completely lost. For this reason we have introduced in a previous
	paper a new notion of high-level net processes for high-level nets
	which captures the high-level structure. The key notion is a high-level
	occurrence net K, which generalizes the well-known notion of occurrence
	nets from low-level to high-level nets. In contrast to the low-level
	case we consider high-level occurrence nets together with a set of
	initial markings of the input places. In this paper we show under
	which conditions the behavior of low-level occurrence nets and processes
	can be generalized to the high-level case. A key notion is the instantiation
	L of a high-level occurrence net K, where L is a low-level subnet
	of the flattening Flat(K) with isomorphic net structures of L and
	K. One of our main results characterizes under which conditions a
	high-level occurrence net - and hence a high-level net process -
	has unique and nonoverlapping instantiations and can be represented
	by the union of all its instantiations. },

	These architectures were designed by components, consisting of a

	consisting of a body specification and a set of import interfaces
	plus connecting transformations in both cases. A major restriction
	of this framework was given by the assumption of non-overlapping
	connector interfaces. In order to make the generic framework for
	connector architectures more applicable, it is enriched by the possibility
	of handling overlapping connector interfaces. Fortunately, it is
	possible to extend the main results presented at FESCA '04 also to
	the new framework. Moreover, it is shown that the new framework can
	be applied to UML class diagrams, state machines and sequence diagrams
	as heterogeneous specification techniques. The resulting connector
	framework, including a concept for the composition of components
	and architectural reduction for UML specifications, is illustrated
	by a case study concerning the meta data management in Topic Maps.

	to e.g. report analysis results, or keep coherence between models.
	In several application-oriented papers it has been shown that triple

	But up to now, there is no formal result showing under which condition
	corresponding forward and backward transformations are inverse to
	each other in the sense of information preservation. This problem
	is solved in this paper based on general results for the theory of

  abstract = {Success and efficiency of software and system design fundamentally
	relies on its models. The more they are based on formal methods the
	more they can be automatically transformed to execution models and
	finally to implementation code. This paper presents model transformation
	and model integration as specific problem within bidirectional model
	transformation, which has shown to support various purposes, such
	as analysis, optimization, and code generation. The main purpose
	of model integration is to establish correspondence between various
	models, especially between source and target models. From the analysis
	point of view, model integration supports correctness checks of syntactical
	dependencies between different views and models. The overall concept
	is based on the algebraic approach to triple graph grammars, which
	are widely used for model transformation. The main result shows the
	close relationship between model transformation and model integration.
	For each model transformation sequence there is a unique model integration
	sequence and vice versa. This is demonstrated by a quasi-standard
	example for model transformation between class models and relational

	Part IV contains a practical case study on model transformation and

	have been introduced in the literature as categorical frameworks

	several weak variants, especially weak adhesive HLR with horizontal

	and related to each other. We propose as weakest version the class
	of vertical weak adhesive HLR categories, short $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive
	categories, which are still sufficient to obtain most of the main
	results for graph transformation and HLR systems. The results in
	this paper are summarized in Fig.~\ref{f:hierarchy} showing a hierarchy

  abstract = {Local confluence is an important property in many rewriting and transformation
	systems. The notion of critical pairs is central for being able to
	verify local confluence of rewriting systems in a static way. Critical
	pairs are defined already in the framework of graphs and adhesive
	rewriting systems. These systems may hold rules with or without negative
	application conditions. In this paper however, we consider rules
	with more general application conditions -- also called nested application
	conditions -- which in the graph case are equivalent to finite first-order
	graph conditions. The classical critical pair notion denotes conflicting
	transformations in a minimal context satisfying the application conditions.
	This is no longer true for combinations of positive and negative
	application conditions -- an important special case of nested ones
	-- where we have to allow that critical pairs do not satisfy all
	the application conditions. This leads to a new notion of critical
	pairs which allows to formulate and prove a Local Confluence Theorem
	for the general case of rules with nested application conditions.
	We demonstrate this new theory on the modeling of an elevator control
	by a typed graph transformation system with positive and negative
	application conditions.},

  abstract = {The DPO approach for graph transformations is based on productions
	and direct transformations defined by two pushouts, where, roughly

	we consider productions which are cospans of graph morphisms, and
	K corresponds to the union of L and R. As before, direct transformations
	are defined by double pushouts, but now the first pushout adds all
	items in KnL and the second one deletes KnR. This basic idea can
	be extended to an alternative graph transformation approach, called
	cospan DPO approach. Key notions of the classical DPO approach can
	be reformulated in the cospan DPO approach and our main result shows
	in which way corresponding concepts and results are equivalent.},

	means that they can be composed in any order leading to equivalent
	high-level net processes which especially have the same input/output

	smoothly integrates with the DPO approach, has a very constructive
	nature and requires only a minimum of category theory. The core part

	commutative diagram $D$ over the scheme $N$ which associates local
	graphs $D(n_i)$ and graph morphisms $D(e) : D(n1) \to D(n2)$ to nodes
	$n1, n2$ and edges $e : n1 \to n2 in N$. Although there are several
	interesting applications of distributed graphs and transformations,
	even the basic pushout constructions for the double pushout approach
	of distributed graph transformation could be shown up to now only
	in very special cases. In this paper we show that the category of
	distributed graphs can be considered as a Grothendieck category over
	a specific indexed category, which assigns to each network $N$ the
	category of all diagrams $D$ of shape N. In this framework it is
	possible to give a free construction which allows to construct for
	each diagram $D1$ over $N1$ and network morphism $h : N1 \to N2$
	a free extension $F_h(D1)$ over $N2$ and to show that the Grothendieck
	category is complete and cocomplete if the underlying category of
	local graphs has these properties. Moreover, an explicit construction
	for general pushouts of distributed graphs is given. This pushout
	construction is based on the free construction. The non-trivial proofs
	for free constructions and pushouts are the main contributions of
	this paper and they are compared with the special cases known up
	to now. },

	presented at FASE 2002 [H. Ehrig, F. Orejas, B. Braatz, M. Klein,

	In Proc. FASE '02, LNCS 2306. Springer, 2002] to a specific kind
	of connector architectures similar to architectural connections in
	the sense of Allen and Garlan [ACM Transactions on Software Engineering
	and Methodology, 1997]. In our generic component framework we have
	considered components with explicit import, export and body parts
	connected by embeddings and transformations and composition of components
	with a compositional transformation semantics. Our framework, however,
	was restricted to components with a single import and export interface.
	Here we study architectures based on connectors with multiple imports
	and components with multiple exports. Architectures studied in this
	paper are built up from components and connectors in a noncircular
	way. The semantics of an architecture is defined by reduction step
	sequences in the sense of graph reductions. The main result shows
	existence and uniqueness of the semantics of an architecture as a
	normal form of reduction step sequences. Our generic framework is
	instantiated on one hand to connector architectures based on CSP
	as the formal specification technique in the approach by Allen and
	Garlan. On the other hand it is instantiated to connector architectures
	based on high-level-replacement systems in general and Petri nets
	in particular. A running example using Petri nets as modeling technique
	illustrates all concepts and results.},

  abstract = {Triple graph transformation has become an important approach for model
	transformations. Triple graphs consist of a source, a target and
	a connection graph. The corresponding rules also contain these parts
	and describe the simultaneous construction of both the source and
	the target model. From these rules, forward rules can be derived
	which describe the model transformation from a given source model
	to a target model. The forward transformation must be source consistent
	in order to define a valid model transformation. Source consistency
	implies that the source and the target model correspond to each other
	according to a triple transformation. In this paper, the relationship
	between the source consistency of forward transformations, and NAC
	consistency and termination used in other model transformation approaches
	is analysed from a formal point of view. We define the kernel of
	a forward rule and construct NACs based on this kernel. Then we give
	sufficient conditions such that source consistency implies NAC consistency
	and termination. Moreover, we analyse how to achieve local confluence
	independent of source consistency. Both results together provide
	sufficient conditions for functional behaviour of model transformations.
	Our results are illustrated by an example describing a model transformation
	from activity diagrams to CSP. },

	systems with the concept of adhesive categories introduced by Lack
	and Soboci´nski. While graphs, typed graphs, attributed graphs and
	several other variants of graphs together with corresponding morphisms
	are adhesive HLR categories, such that the categorical framework
	of adhesive HLR systems can be applied, this has been claimed also
	for Petri nets. In this paper we show that this claim is wrong for
	place/transition nets and algebraic high-level nets, although several
	results of the theory for adhesive HLR systems are known to be true
	for the corresponding Petri net transformation systems. In fact,
	we are able to define a weaker version of adhesive HLR categories,
	called weak adhesive HLR categories, which is still sufficient to
	show all the results known for adhesive HLR systems. This concept
	includes not only all kinds of graphs mentioned above, but also place/transition
	nets, algebraic high-level nets and several other kinds of Petri
	nets. For this reason weak adhesive HLR systems can be seen as a
	unifying framework for graph and Petri net transformations. },

  abstract = {In recent years, visual models represented by graphs have become very
	popular in systems development, as the wide-spread use of UML and
	Petri nets proves. While visual modeling techniques provide a precise
	way to model the structure and behavior of systems, visual models
	tend to be complex and are not always adequate for behavior validation.
	\\ The main objective of this doctoral thesis is to improve the validation
	process for visual behavioral models by providing a formal framework
	and tool support for simulation and animation based on typed algebraic
	graph transformation. To attain this goal, the thesis proposes to
	use \emph{animation views} for simulation instead of the notation
	of abstract modeling languages. Animation views allow to simulate
	model behavior in the layout of the application domain, at a freely
	chosen level of abstraction. Thus, they provide better insights of
	model behavior and lead to an earlier detection of inconsistencies
	and possible missing requirements in the model. A visual behavioral
	model is mapped to an animation view by so-called Simulation-to-Animation
	transformation (\emph{$\mathit{S2A}$ transformation}). Formal graph
	transformation properties allow to ensure semantical equivalence
	of a model and its animation view. The prototypical tool environment
	supports simulation, animation view definition, $\mathit{S2A}$ transformation
	and animation based on graph transformation. Animation scenarios
	can be visualized in animation views as smooth movements instead
	of discrete simulation steps.},

  abstract = {Visualizing and simulating the behavior of formal models in an adequate
	and flexible way becomes increasingly important for the design and
	validation of complex systems. Using graph transformation, the concrete
	and abstract syntax of various visual modelling languages can be
	described, and the semantics can be formalized. Moreover, graph transformation
	tools support visual model specification, simulation and analysis
	on the basis of the rich underlying theory. Despite these benefits,
	often the simulation of formal visual behavior models (e.g. Petri
	nets or statecharts) is not flexible enough and results in an ineffective
	validation process. In this paper we propose a formal, view-based
	approach to simulate and animate the behavior of visual models at
	different abstraction levels on the basis of typed, attributed graph
	transformation. We introduce so-called animation views, which allow
	to define scenario animations for a given behavior model in a systematic
	way. Based on the visual language definition for Algebraic High-Level
	Petri nets, the well-known specification of {\em The Dining Philosophers}
	serves as running example for the definition of an animation view
	and a scenario animation which directly visualizes the behavior of
	the dining philosophers sitting around a table. A prototypical implementation
	of the concepts for view definition, view transformation, simulation
	and scenario animation as new features of \GenGEDp, an environment
	for the definition of visual languages and the specification and
	simulation of visual behavior models, is presented.},

  abstract = {The ``classical'' approach to represent Petri nets by graph transformation
	systems is to translate each transition of a specific Petri net to
	a graph rule (behavior rule). This translation depends on a concrete
	model and may yield large graph transformation systems as the number
	of rules depends directly on the number of transitions in the net.
	Hence, the aim of this paper is to define the behavior of Algebraic
	High-Level (AHL) nets, a high-level Petri net variant, by a parallel,
	typed, attributed graph transformation system. Such a general parallel
	transformation system for AHL nets replaces the translation of transitions
	of specific AHL nets. After reviewing the formal definitions of AHL
	nets and parallel attributed graph transformation, we formalize the
	classical translation from AHL nets to graph transformation systems
	and prove the correctness of the translation. The translation approach
	then is contrasted to a definition for AHL net behavior based on
	parallel graph transformation. We show that the resulting amalgamated
	rules correspond to the behavior rules from the classical translation
	approach. },

  abstract = {Finitary M-adhesive categories are M-adhesive categories with finite
	objects only, where the notion M-adhesive category is short for weak
	adhesive high-level replacement (HLR) category. We call an object
	finite if it has a finite number of M-subobjects. In this paper,
	we show that in finitary M-adhesive categories we do not only have
	all the well-known properties of M-adhesive categories, but also
	all the additional HLR-requirements which are needed to prove the
	classical results for M-adhesive systems. These results are the Local
	Church-Rosser, Parallelism, Concurrency, Embedding, Extension, and
	Local Confluence Theorems, where the latter is based on critical
	pairs. More precisely, we are able to show that finitary M-adhesive
	categories have a unique E-M-factorization and initial pushouts,
	and the existence of an M-initial object implies in addition finite
	coproducts and a unique E0-M0-pair factorization. Moreover, we can
	show that the finitary restriction of each M-adhesive category is
	a finitary M-adhesive category and finitariness is preserved under
	functor and comma category constructions based on M-adhesive categories.
	This means that all the classical results are also valid for corresponding
	finitary M-adhesive systems like several kinds of finitary graph
	and Petri net transformation systems. Finally, we discuss how some
	of the results can be extended to non-M-adhesive categories.},

  abstract = {Several different approaches to define the formal operational semantics
	of statecharts have been proposed in the literature, including visual
	techniques based on graph transformation. These visual approaches
	either define a compiler semantics (translating a concrete statechart
	into a semantical domain) or they define an interpreter using complex
	control and helper structures. Based on the existing visual semantics
	definitions it is difficult to apply the classical theory of graph
	transformations to analyze behavioral statechart properties due to
	the complex control structures. In this paper, we define an interpreter
	semantics for statecharts based on amalgamated graph transformation
	where rule schemes are used to handle an arbitrary number of transitions
	in orthogonal states in parallel. We build on an extension of the
	existing theory of amalgamation from binary to multi-amalgamation
	including nested application conditions to control rule applications
	for automatic simulation. This is essential for the interpreter semantics
	of statecharts. The theory of amalgamation allows us to show termination
	of the interpreter semantics of well-behaved statecharts, and especially
	for our running example, a producer-consumer system.},

	Der Layoutalgoritmus wird in das Graphtransformationstool AGG integriert.
	Dieses Layout wird hier als evolution{\"a}res Layout bezeichnet,
	da auch das Layout von aufeinander folgenden Graphen aufeinander
	auf- baut. Dabei soll das Layout der einzelnen Graphen m{\"o}glichst

	Vorwissen {\"u}ber die Art und den Anwendungszweck der Graphen herangezogen

	Graphen realisiert werden. Ein Beispiel f{\"u}r eine solche Anforderung
	ist die Erwartung, dass in einem Klassenmodell in einer Vererbungsstruktur

	the net, and a transformation system built directly from the net
	are presented. The second part of the paper analyzes the correspondence
	between transformation system compositon operations applied to place-transition
	net semantics, and syntactical operations on place-transition nets.
	It is shown that no correspondance exists for the general case, and
	reasons for this situation are outlined. Some elementary mechanisms
	are presented, showing the way in which certain characteristics of
	synchronized compositions correspond to syntactical composition operations
	on nets, that go beyond the usual gluing techniques. This corresponds
	very much to finding out to what extent marking graph synchronization
	can be reflected by operations on nets.},

  abstract = {Graph transformation systems (gts) are suitable for modelling concurrent
	and distributed behaviour of systems and in particular of workflows.
	Analysis of the behaviour of these models is in general highly complex,
	but it is of main interest, especially for optimizing the system
	execution. Main focus of the PhD project is a formal approach for
	constructing the process of a workflow scenario to support possibilities
	of efficient analysis and execution. Based on the abstract framework
	of adhesive high level replacement systems the developed techniques
	will be applied on two levels. First, the framework is instantiated
	to different kinds of graph as well as Petri net transformation systems,
	which are key ingredient for modelling mobile networks in [1]. In
	the second level, the modelling techniques are used to specify the
	production of industrial products, which can involve several thousands
	of production steps. A case study will show how a chain of production
	steps taken from a real production facility can be modelled as gts
	derivation. Formal techniques for process construction and analysis
	known for basic cases only have to be extended in various dimensions
	in order to be applied to the model and in general to the domain
	of workflows. A practical evaluation will compare the results with
	those derived by standard techniques for process analysis. },

	For this reason, we discuss the general challenges that arise for

	In this context, triple graph grammars show many benefits for the
	specification process, e.g. modelers can work on an intuitive level

	completeness and efficient execution. In order to verify model transformations
	with respect to behavioural equivalence we apply well-studied techniques
	based on the double pushout approach with borrowed context, for which
	the model transformations specified by triple graph transformation
	rules are flattened to plain (in-situ) graph transformation rules.
	The potential and adequateness of the presented techniques are demonstrated
	by an intuitive example, for which we show the correctness of the

	systems. In \cite{icgt04} a policy framework based on graph transformations
	is presented providing an intuitive visual formalism for the manipulation
	of policy-based systems. The policy framework is defined by a type
	graph and sets of policy rules, positive and negative constraints,
	resp. Mobile policies have the additional capability to move around
	with the object e.g between different companies. We investigate how
	the distribution and modification of mobile policies can be modeled
	with Algebraic Higher-Order (AHO) nets, a high-level net class which
	is an extension of Petri nets by concepts of the higher-order specification
	language HasCASL. Due to the higher-order features graphs and rules
	are allowed to be dynamical objects in AHO-nets and the behavior
	of an AHO-net simulates the modification needed to achieve the flexibility
	of adapting objects. For our purpose, the AHO-net gives an overview
	of the different locations where the mobile policies could reside.
	Furthermore, the coupling of a set of rules which are used to modify
	the mobile policies, to certain locations, which have the authority
	to modify the mobile policies, is given by the net topology. Technically,
	we extent the HasCASL-specification of rule-based modifications on
	the one hand by adding negative application conditions and on the
	other hand by using specific operations for the modification of mobile
	policies. },

  abstract = {The paper presents an evolutionary layout algorithm of graph transformation
	sequences which is based on the well-known spring embedder layout
	algorithm. The spring embedder algorithm already fulfills two important
	requirements for layouting a graph sequence: the highest single layout
	quality and the lowest difference between two successive layouts.
	But this layout algorithm does not fit well for incomplete graph
	sequences, since the following two new requirements are not fulfilled:
	\\ 1. the option for future extensions of graph sequences without
	ruining the layout, \\ 2. by taking also typing of graph edges into
	account. \\ So we extended the spring embedder layout algorithm by
	two new concepts: 1. A concept of node ageing and protection of senior
	node positions in the layout that allows the user to keep track of
	changes during transformation steps. The persistence of node positions
	throughout a sequence is most helpful to preserve the mental map.
	Especially the concept of ageing was the reason to name the algorithm
	an evolutionary layout algorithm. \\ 2. A concept of layout patterns
	based on edge typing. \\ This new layout algorithm tries to solve
	the following problems for an evolving graph transformation sequence:
	\\ 1. The quality of every single layout should be as optimal as
	possible. \\ 2. The mental distance from one layout to its successor
	layout should be small. \\ 3. The graph sequence may have future
	extensions, without loosing the layout`s quality. \\ 4. The changes
	between two graphs should be easily recognizable in the layout of
	two subsequent graphs.},

	to establish sufficient criteria for consistency. The automated checking

  abstract = {Model driven engineering as a methodology for designing and implementing
	systems and processes is established for years now. The industry
	on one hand and Open Source communities on the other hand provide
	a large variety of frameworks for model driven development processes.
	The EclipseModeling Framework (EMF) implements a modeling approach
	by providing code generation facilities for structural data models.
	Although there already exist proposals for EMF model transformations,
	a graphbased approach, where model transformations can be defined
	in a visual, rule-based manner has not been considered yet. In this
	thesis, a formal interpretation of modeling concepts is presented
	and a model transformation approach for EMF is introduced, based
	on formal graph transformation. An implementation is provided in
	the form of a graphical editor for the Eclipse platform, that allows
	the visual definition of in-place transformations for EMF-compliant
	models. EMF model instantiations are interpreted as attributed typed
	graphs with special containment edges. The order properties of these
	containment edges are formalized and conditions are stated, that
	must be satisfied to apply transformation rules to this kind of graphs.
	Further, a concept of consistency is introduced, that ensures well
	defined instantiations of EMF models. Applications of the framework
	are given through two examples, one for endogenous and one for exogenous
	model transformations. },

	connecting require and provide interfaces. Component composition
	is defined in terms of extension and multiple extension of transformations
	or transformation families, respectively. It is proven that the result
	of two composition steps is not affected by the order of the calculation.
	The framework offers a semantics to component architectures by reducing
	them to components by composition. This semantics is proven to be
	well-defined and unique if multiple extension and composition of
	extension diagrams as well as disjoint require interfaces are given.
	Moreover, the framework offers a semantics for components which is
	shown to be compositional. The abstract framework is primary meant
	to be instantiated with formal specification techniques featuring
	a mathematical semantics, and thus, enabling the application of formal
	analysis techniques like formal verification and model-checking to
	component architectures specified by those techniques. A case study

  institution = TUB,

  number = {2010/07},
  abstract = {Local confluence is an important property in many rewriting systems.
	The notion of critical pairs is central for being able to verify
	local confluence of rewriting systems in a static way. Critical pairs
	are defined already in the framework of graphs and adhesive rewriting
	systems. These systems may hold rules with or without negative application
	conditions. In this paper however, we consider rules with more general
	application conditions -- also called nested application conditions
	-- that are known to be equivalent to finite first-order graph conditions.
	The classical critical pair notion denotes conflicting transformations
	in a minimal context satisfying the application conditions. This
	is no longer true for combinations of positive and negative application
	conditions -- an important special case of nested ones -- where we
	allow that critical pairs do not satisfy the application conditions.
	This leads to a new notion of critical pairs which allows to formulate
	and prove a Local Confluence Theorem for rules with nested application
	conditions in the framework of adhesive rewriting systems based on
	the DPO-approach. It builds on a new Embedding Theorem and Completeness
	Theorem for critical pairs based on rules with nested application
	conditions. We demonstrate this new theory on the modeling of an
	elevator control by a typed graph transformation system with positive
	and negative application conditions.},

	critical pairs allowing a more efficient conflict detection. This
	is based on a new conflict characterization, which determines for
	each conflict occuring between the rules of the system the exact
	conflict reason. This new notion of conflict reason leads us to an
	optimization of conflict detection. Efficiency is obtained because
	the set of essential critical pairs is a proper subset of all critical
	pairs of the system and therefore the set of representative conflicts
	to be computed statically diminishes. It is shown that for each conflict
	in the system, there exists an essential critical pair representing
	it. Moreover each essential critical pair possesses a unique conflict
	reason and thus represents each conflict not only in a minimal, but
	also in a unique way. Main new results presented in this paper are
	a characterization of conflicts, completeness and uniqueness of essential
	critical pairs and a local confluence lemma based on essential critical
	pairs. The theory of essential critical pairs is the basis to develop

	of a graph transformation system is equivalent to checking both local
	confluence and termination. A graph transformation system is locally
	confluent, if all its conflicts in a minimal context can be resolved.
	Formally, this means, that all critical pairs of the graph transformation
	system should be strictly confluent. Thus, answering the question
	of local confluence of a graph transformation system, requires the
	following two steps. At first, the computation of all critical pairs
	is necessary. Secondly, this set of critical pairs has to be tested
	for strict confluence. This paper concentrates on the first step,
	proposing an efficient method to compute the set of all critical
	pairs of a given graph transformation system. Efficiency is obtained,
	because of the following two main reasons. At first, all pairs of
	rules are analyzed to check, if they can actually cause a conflict.
	Then for each conflict inducing pair of rules, the set of critical
	pairs is computed in a constructive way, avoiding needless computations.

  abstract = {Complex systems are characterized by components that may have to be
	described using different notations. For the analysis of such a system,
	our approach is to transform each component (preserving behaviour)
	into a single common formalism with appropriate analysis methods.
	Both source and target notations are described by means of meta-modelling
	whereas the translation is modelled by means of graph transformation.
	During the transformation process, the intermediate models can be
	a blend of elements of the source and target notations, but at the
	end the resulting model should be expressed in the target notation
	alone. In this work we propose defining also a meta-model for the
	intermediate process, in such a way that we can apply some validation
	methods to the transformation. In particular, we show how to prove
	functional behaviour (confluence and termination) via critical pair
	analysis and {\em layering conditions}, and discuss other desirable
	properties of the transformation, namely: syntactic consistency and
	behaviour preservation. The automation of these concepts has been
	carried out by combining the AToM3 and AGG tools. },

  abstract = {This paper presents our approach to model distributed discrete event
	simulation systems in the framework of distributed graph transformation.
	In particular, we use distributed typed attributed graph transformation
	to describe a conservative simulation protocol. We use local control
	flows for rule execution in each process as the use of a global control
	would imply a completely synchronized evolution of all processes.
	These are specified by a {\em Statechart} in which transitions are
	labelled with rule executions. States are encoded as process attributes,
	in such a way that rules are only applicable if the process is in
	a particular state. For the analysis, we introduce a {\em flattening}
	construction as a functor from distributed to normal graphs. Global
	consistency conditions can be defined for normal graphs which specify
	safety properties for the protocol. Once the flattening construction
	is applied to each rule, the global conditions can then be translated
	into pre-conditions for the protocol rules, which ensure that the
	protocol fulfills the global constraints in any possible execution.
	Finally, the paper also discusses tool support using the AToM$^3$
	environment.},

	a node type inherits the attributes and edges of all its ancestors.
	Based on these concepts, it is possible to define abstract productions,
	containing abstract nodes. These productions are equivalent to a
	number of concrete productions, resulting from the substitution of
	the abstract node types by the node types in their inheritance clan.
	Therefore, productions become more compact and suitable for their
	use in combination with meta-modelling. The main results of this
	paper show that attributed graph transformation with node type inheritance
	is fully compatible with the existing concept of typed attributed
	graph transformation.},

	Some interactions may be intended or may be emerging behavior while
	others are the source of unexpected inconsistencies. Thus, it is
	desirable to detect inconsistencies as early as possible, preferably
	at the modeling level. We propose an approach for analyzing interactions
	and potential inconsistencies at the level of requirements modeling.
	We use a variant of UML to model requirements in a use-case driven
	approach. Activities, which are used to refine use cases, are the
	join points to compose cross-cutting concerns. The activities and
	their composition are formalized by using the theory of graph transformation
	systems, which provides analysis support for the detection of potential
	conflicts and dependencies between rule-based transformations. This
	theory is used to effectively reason about potential interactions
	and inconsistencies caused by aspectoriented composition. The analysis
	is performed with the graph transformation tool AGG. The automatically
	analyzed conflicts and dependencies also serve as an additional view
	that helps in better understanding the potential behavior of the

	Petri nets with individual tokens (AHOI nets). This approach is an
	integration of the well-established modeling techniques Petri nets,
	algebras, and rule-based Petri net transformation (based on graph
	transformation). It is intended to cover the main aspects of CS and
	to analyze and verify properties specific to them. In this article,
	an informal introduction of the new approach is given and demonstrated
	on an example modeling of the widely known Internet telephone software
	Skype. This allows us to discuss the advantages of the new formal

	called \engquote{Petri nets with individual tokens}, together with
	rule-based transformation following the double pushout approach.
	The most important change to former Petri net transformation approaches
	is that the marking of a net is no longer a \engquote{collective}
	set of tokens, but each each has an own identity leading to the concept
	of Petri nets with individual tokens. This allows us to formulate
	rules that can change the marking of a net arbitrarily without necessarily
	manipulating the structure. As a first main result that depends on
	nets with individual markings we show the equivalence of transition
	firing steps and the application of firing-simulating rules.
	
	We define categories of low-level and of algebraic high-level nets
	with individual tokens, called PTI nets and AHLI nets, respectively,
	and relate them with each other and their collective counterparts
	by functors.
	
	To be able to use the properties and analysis results of \MCAL{M}-adhesive
	HLR systems (formerly know as weak adhesive high-level replacement
	systems) we show in further main results that both categories of
	PTI nets and AHLI nets are \MCAL{M}-adhesive categories. By showing
	how to construct initial pushouts we also give necessary and sufficient
	conditions for the applicability of transformation rules in these
	categories, known as gluing condition in the literature.},

  abstract = {Changing environments - commercial, technical or social - demand software
	systems that can be adapted to those changes with reasonable effort.
	Component-based systems have been proposed as an adequate support
	for that task. Today there is no doubt on the importance of component-based
	systems. There are various specifications for the description of
	component-based software architectures. Component-based software
	engineering needs to be backed by thorough formal concepts and modeling
	techniques, so that the correctness and consistency of the component
	and the component-based system increase. Formal specification of
	the component interface and the component specification allow the
	precise modeling and the verification of required functionality.
	Moreover, the composition of components can be given formally and
	correctness and consistency can be ensured even in the composed system.
	In our approach the formal description is the basis to make the conditions
	under which a component can be changed or exchanged explicitly. The
	compatibility of component transformation with component composition
	is an key issue of component transformation as it represents the
	core question of changing a component in some given context. The
	second main results concerns the conditions for the most complex
	case: transforming both components and their interfaces in different
	ways and keeping the composition of these components via their interfaces
	intact. This result is given by the Compatibility Theorem stating
	that the result of first transforming the two components and the
	composing them is the same (up to renaming) as composing the two
	components first and applying then the composed rule. Transformations
	of components arise whenever a component-based system is changed
	and new components are introduced, components are replaced by other
	ones, components are changed, or components are deleted. In this
	paper we present a formal frame for the description of these transformations.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces safety properties in the temporal logic sense
	to Petri net modules. Petri net moduleshave been achieved by a transfer
	of algebraic specification modules to Petri nets. They consist of
	three nets; the interface nets import and export, and the body of
	the module. The import net states the prerequisites the modules assumes.
	The body net represents the internal functionality. The export net
	gives an abstraction of the body that can be used by the environment.
	The interfaces IMP and EXP are related to the body BOD via morphisms.
	These modules conform with the basic concepts of components and component-based
	systems of Continuous Software Engineering (CSE). We make precise
	what it means that a Petri net module has specific safety properties.
	We differentiate between explicit and implicit properties. Explicit
	safety properties are stated additionally to the export net. Implicit
	are those properties that hold in the export net without being stated
	explicitly.The main advantage of our approach are module operations
	to compose larger modules from basic ones. We can show that the composition
	of modules preserves safety properties: Given two modules with implicit
	or explicit safety properties then the composition of these modules
	is again a module with implicit or explicit safety properties.},

	namely the workflow layer, the mobility layer and the team layer.
	Dividing the AHO net model into layers immediately rises the question

	that the team layer is given by the mapping of the individual member’s
	activities to the gluing of the workflow and the mobility layer.

	are almost no approaches so far for the modeling and the analysis
	of those MANETs which are urgently needed for a correct course of
	the relevant processes. Here, we introduce algebraic higher-order
	(AHO) nets that have been developed in our project forMAlNET as a
	formal technique which on the one hand enables the modeling of flexible
	processes in MANETs and on the other hand supports changes of the
	network topology and the transformation of processes. They can be
	roughly described as Petri nets where the tokens are reconfigurable
	nets and rules for the reconfiguration. This paper concentrates on
	two important topics for modeling of the flexible processes in MANETs:
	the analysis of conflict situation and the development of a tool
	environ-ment for AHO nets.},

	For the development and analysis of reconfigurable systems, not only

	which additionally include markings of nets.
	
	In this paper, we summarize the results for different kinds of AHL
	schemas and nets, and extend these results to AHL systems. The category

	by pure typing are, however, relatively weak. In the context of meta-modelling
	it is common practice to enrich type information with structural

	properties using graph constraints in type graphs with inheritance,

	to equivalent constrained simple type graphs. From existing theory
	it then follows that graph constraints can be translated into pre-conditions

  abstract = {Domain specific modeling languages are of increasing importance for
	the development of software and other systems. Meta tools are needed
	to support rapid development of domain-specific solutions. Usually,
	domainspecific modeling languages are defined by providing a meta
	model using the MOF/EMF approach. The language definition can be
	used to generate a corresponding editor using meta tools such as
	Eclipse GMF. The meta model defines all symbols and relations of
	the domain-specific model which can be used to provide an editor
	with basic editing commands. In addition, further language properties
	can be formulated by OCL constraints which form the input to a syntax
	checker. If the modeling language has not only simple syntax structures,
	syntax-directed editing would increase the convenience. Up to now,
	meta CASE tools being based on EMF do not provide support for the
	definition of complex editing commands. A natural way to define editing
	commands is the formulation by transformation rules, specifying the
	pre- and post-conditions of each command. The background for this
	approach is the grammar-based definition of visual modeling languages.
	While the transformation rules for simple commands can be generated
	automatically, complex commands are defined by the language designer.
	The formal basis for this kind of editor definition is given by graph
	transformation. A meta model-based editor specification extended
	by such rules shall be used to generate Eclipse plug-ins for domain-specific
	editing with complex editing commands.},

	transformation, four different model transformation approaches are

	most developers to deal with XML parsing and transformation. XML
	is used as format to e.g. render data, query documents, deal with
	Web services, generate code from a model or perform model transformation.
	Nowadays XSLT is the most common language for XML transformation.
	But, although meant to be simple, coding in XSLT can become quite
	a challenge, if the coding approach does not only depend on the structure
	of the source document, but the order of template application is
	also dictated by target document structure. This is the case especially
	when dealing with transformations between visual models. We propose
	to use a graph-based approach to simplify the transformation definition
	process where graphs representing documents are transformed in a
	rule-based manner, as in XSLT. The differences to XSLT are mainly
	that rules can be developed visually, are more abstract (since the
	order of execution does not depend on the target document), IDREFs
	are dealt with much more naturally, and due to typed transformations,
	the output document is guaranteed to be valid with respect to the
	target schema. Moreover, graph-based transformation definitions can
	be automatically reversed in most cases. This is especially useful
	in model transformation (e.g. in OMG's MDA approach).},

  abstract = {The theory based incremental approach to the stepwise development
	of Petri net process models plays an important role as Petri net
	based models have been used in many successful applications in practice.
	This incremental approach is based on the ability to transform a
	model (by replacing one submodel with another) and to change the
	class of models (by adding features previously ignored). Formally,
	these transformations are called \emph{net model transformation}
	and \emph{net class transformation}. This thesis continues recent
	research in the area of net class transformations and \emph{open
	Petri nets}. It provides a rigorous foundation for the different
	Petri net classes formalized as categories and the net class transformations
	formalized as functors in the framework of category theory. In the
	first part, eight categories are presented, three of them newly introduced
	in this thesis. Basic Petri net categories are extended to open Petri
	net categories. Open Petri nets are a generalization of the ordinary
	models where some places designated as open represent an interface
	of the system towards the environment. In all categories, the existence
	and structure of pushouts and initial objects are discussed. The
	main result in the first part is that the different open Petri net
	categories share similar properties concerning morphisms and pushouts.
	These numerous variants of Petri nets have been developed in order
	to express specific features in these domains. In the software development
	process a simple initially proposed Petri net can be incrementally
	extended, for example, by exception handling, initial state etc.
	In the different development steps different Petri net models are
	produced, each enhancing the initial model with further aspects and
	details. Transformations are tools to develop more complex Petri
	net process models from simple ones. In the second part, these transformations,
	formally functors between the categories of part one, are defined.
	It is proven that they preserve pushouts and initial objects if they
	exist. A further main result in this part is that functors between
	a basic Petri net category and its respective open Petri net category
	are adjoint.},

  abstract = {The meta modeling approach to syntax definition of visual modeling
	techniques has gained wide acceptance, especially by using it for
	the definition of UML. Based on class structures and well-formedness
	rules, which could be formalized by OCL, the abstract syntax of visual
	modeling techniques is defined in a declarative way. Since meta-modeling
	is non-constructive, it does not provide a systematic way available
	to generate all possible meta model instances. But for example, when
	developing model transformations, it is desirable to have a large
	set of valid instances at hand to perform large-scale testing. In
	our approach, an instance-generating graph grammar is automatically
	created from a given meta model. This graph grammar ensures correct
	typing and cardinality constraints. To satisfy also the given OCL
	constraints, well-formedness checks have to be done in addition.
	As a first step, a restricted form of OCL constraints can be translated
	to graph constraints which are to be checked during the instance
	generation process.},
