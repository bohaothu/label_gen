                 section on order relations and on interval arithmetic,
                 round-off errors are discussed in connection with
                 fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic. Results
                 obtained in this arithmetic are compared with those
                 using interval tools combined with an outward rounding.
                 The role of computing the ranges of functions and of
                 computing with sets is emphasized. \par A central
                 section addresses the problem of formulating an
                 appropriate stopping criterion. It is illustrated by
                 examples using the interval Newton method. Remarks on

  abstract =     "The use of interval analysis has steadily increased
                 over the past 40 years. This development was taken into
                 account when writing the present book. It presents the
                 basics in real interval arithmetic and covers
                 elementary methods for verifying and enclosing zeros of
                 functions, global minimizers, solutions of integral and
                 differential equations. It deals with integration of
                 interval functions and shows how interval methods can
                 be applied in various fields of science. Moreover, an
                 introduction into the interval toolbox INTLAB of MATLAB
                 is given in order to understand the many programs which
                 realize the algorithms of the book. Numerous examples
                 illustrate the theory and are spread over more than 220
                 pages.\par

                 The book starts with a short introduction on the
                 necessity of enclosures and on bounding roundoff
                 errors. The interval number system is presented in
                 Chapter 2 including set theoretic operations as well as
                 order relations and operations for intervals, interval
                 vectors, and interval matrices. Some historical
                 references are added. Chapter 3 discusses the problem
                 of computing with inexact initial data and therefore
                 results in first applications of interval arithmetic.
                 It considers outwardly rounded interval arithmetic and
                 gives a first glance to INTLAB. Chapter 4 is devoted to
                 algebraic properties of interval arithmetic, to
                 symmetric intervals and to inclusion isotonicity.
                 Interval functions are introduced in Chapter 5
                 including elementary interval functions and
                 interval-valued extensions of real functions together
                 with fundamental properties.\par

                 The topological side of intervals and of interval
                 arithmetic is considered in Chapter 6. Equipped with
                 the Hausdorff metric the set of intervals turns out to
                 be a complete metric space for which convergence and
                 continuity can be defined in the usual way. Nested
                 interval sequences, finite convergence, refinement of
                 interval extensions, and various centered forms are
                 additional topics of this chapter which is concluded by
                 the Skelboe--Moore algorithm. This algorithm is a
                 prototype of a branch-and-bound algorithm applied in
                 global optimization. Interval matrices form the subject
                 of the succeeding Chapter 7, where linear systems with
                 inexact input data are also discussed. In this
                 connection the Krawczyk method is mentioned as well as
                 the interval Gauss--Seidel method and Gaussian
                 elimination.\par

                 Nonlinear equations are studied in Chapter 8. Here the
                 interval Newton method is commented, and cases are
                 presented which imply the necessity of an extended
                 interval arithmetic. For systems of nonlinear equations
                 the Krawczyk method and multivariate interval Newton
                 methods are applied and safe starting intervals are
                 defined. Chapter 9 is devoted to the integration of
                 interval functions, particularly of interval
                 polynomials since for sufficiently smooth functions $f$
                 a Taylor expansion is used to construct an enclosure
                 for $f$. Therefore, automatic differentiation and
                 automatic generation of Taylor coefficients are also
                 handled in order to find enclosures for definite
                 integrals -- also multiple ones -- over $f$. A short
                 chapter lists some ideas for verifying and enclosing
                 solutions of integral equations, initial value
                 problems, and boundary value problems. Some literature
                 for partial differential equations is added. The final
                 Chapter 11 gives a first impression of how the tool
                 `interval analysis' is applied in practice. Problems
                 are listed which use computer-assisted proofs based on
                 interval arithmetic. A prototypical algorithm is
                 discussed for global optimization. Numerous examples
                 from engineering are mentioned.\par

                 An appendix covers a variety of topics: Sets and
                 functions, a formulary for intervals, hints for
                 selected exercises, Internet resources, and INTLAB
                 commands and functions. More than 250 references
                 conclude a wonderful book which is written for all who
                 are interested in scientific computation, in its
                 reliability, and in automatic verification of
                 results.",
