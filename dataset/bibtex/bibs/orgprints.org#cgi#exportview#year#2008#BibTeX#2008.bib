        abstract = {This proceedings volume contains the papers presented at the CODIS
2008 congress held on 27 - 29 February 2008 in Solothurn (Switzerland).
The composting and digestion of biogenic waste materials and the subsequent
application of compost and digestate to soil contributes to nutrient
recycling and renewable energy production. Moreover, compost and
digestate can improve soil fertility and suppress plant diseases. On the
other hand, compost and digestate may also contain a variety of pollutants
hazardous to soil, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants.
Compost and digestate have been thoroughly investigated in the framework
of two associated projects entitled ?Organic Pollutants in Compost
and Digestate in Switzerland? and ?Effects of Composts and Digestate on
the Environment, Soil Fertility and Plant Health?. These projects yielded
new insights into the properties of compost and digestate, mainly with
regard to biological parameters and the occurrence of both ?classic? and
?emerging? organic pollutants.
The CODIS 2008 congress was the final event of these two projects.

careful and prudent action agro-environmental monitoring and epidemic risk assessment.
Often, however, the plant protection products are distributed in a non-targeted way, even
when reduced incidence of pests do not require any treatment.
In order to optimize the treatments against downy mildew, multi-annual field trials, both in
conventional and organic vineyards, have been carried out.
In all farms were considered 3 thesis: 1 untreated control thesis (Test), in order to follow the
coarse of infection, 1 standard farm reference thesis (St), where the treatments were carried
out according to the usual farm procedures and 1 experimental thesis (X).
Guideline EPPO?OEPP PP 1?31 (3) have been carried out.
We monitored different environmental parameters capable to influence Plasmopora viticola
(Berk. and Curt.) Berl. and De Toni development. In fact by a network of RTUs (Remote Terminal
Units) distributed all over the vineyards transmitting every 15 minutes via radio or via
GPRS to a centralized Data Base 12 environmental parameters: time, data, precipitation, soil
temperature, solar radiation, wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric relative humidity,
atmospheric temperature, leaf wetness, soil humidity to cm 20 and soil humidity to cm 40.
In different phenological growth stages we carried out careful disease assessments on leaves
and bunches to evaluate the onset and development of P. viticola.
We have studied the downy mildew infections through monitoring the environmental parameters,
knowledge of P. viticola biological cycle, the evaluation of cultivar sensibility, the agricultural
production method and the area characteristics, to try to optimize the anti- downy
mildew treatments.
The achieved results have underlined the possibility to obtain a satisfactory protection
against P. viticola by correct placing of treatments.
In experimental thesis (X) the number of treatments was generally lower than the number
made on the thesis standard (ST), with efficacy comparable if not better.
This result is most evident in conventional farms where surveillance is less accurate because
is can also use plant protection products with a curative action.
The trial showed the possibility of obtaining real cost containment management and a lower
environmental impact associated with reduced fungicidal treatments.}

April 2007 an der Fachhochschule Eberswalde nachgegangen, das im Rahmen des Bundesprogramms {\"O}kologischer Landbau gef{\"o}rdert wurde. Die Ergebnisse sind in einer KTBL-Schrift wiedergegeben.
Die {\"o}kologische Tierhaltung erhebt f{\"u}r sich den Anspruch, in hohem Ma{\ss}e den Anforderungen an eine umweltschonende und tiergerechte sowie sozial und {\"o}konomisch nachhaltige Tierhaltung gerecht zu werden. Inwieweit ihr dies aber gelingt und wo Optimierungspotential steckt, ist nur durch eine umfassende Systembewertung zu ermitteln. Die Einhaltung der Richtlinien des {\"o}kologischen Landbaus gew{\"a}hrleistet noch nicht, dass dieser Anspruch erf{\"u}llt wird.
Die geeignete Bewertungsmethode ist von der jeweiligen Fragestellung abh{\"a}ngt. So ist zur Bewertung von Haltungsverfahren eine andere Herangehensweise zu w{\"a}hlen als zum Beispiel bei der Beurteilung von Betrieben oder ganzen Sektoren. Auch die Zielsetzung spielt eine Rolle: Werden Ist-Zust{\"a}nde beschrieben oder Optimierungen durchgef{\"u}hrt, gelten andere Anforderungen. 
Gr{\"o}{\ss}te Herausforderung ist nach wie vor die Bestimmung entsprechend einfacher und handhabbarer Bewertungskriterien. Es stellen die {\"o}kologische und die konventionelle Tierhaltung die gleichen Anforderungen an die Methodik. Der wichtige Aspekt Tiergerechtheit l{\"a}sst sich nach Aussage der Experten nicht ohne weiteres f{\"u}r eine Systembewertung heranziehen, da diese Beurteilung am Tier vor Ort erfolgen muss.
Da die meisten Betriebsbewertungssysteme bisher die Tierhaltung nur sehr wenig ber{\"u}cksichtigen k{\"o}nnen, wurde diskutiert, inwieweit der Nationalen Bewertungsrahmen Tierhaltungsverfahren in die Systembewertung der Tierhaltung im {\"o}kologischen Landbau einbezogen werden kann. 

In der KTBL-Schrift 462: ?Systembewertung der {\"o}kologischen Tierhaltung? sind die Tagungsbeitr{\"a}ge, die Diskussion und die verbliebenen offenen Fragen zusammengestellt. Sie spiegeln die Anspr{\"u}che an eine Systembewertung und Vorschl{\"a}ge zur Vorgehensweise bei der Bewertung auf der Verfahrens- und Betriebsebene wider. Dadurch wird zur Entwicklung einer umfassenden und abgestimmten Systembewertung als Basis f{\"u}r eine nachhaltige {\"o}kologische Tierhaltung beigetragen.}

Vidensyntesen, der er bestilt af F{\o}devareministeriet, har unders{\o}gt muligheder og barrierer for fortsat v{\ae}kst i den {\o}kologiske sektor. Den nye vidensyntese er et resultat af et omfattende udredningsarbejde, som er udf{\o}rt af Internationalt Center for Forskning i {\O}kologisk Jordbrug og F{\o}devaresystemer (ICROFS, tidligere F{\O}JO). Udredningsarbejdets form{\ra}l har v{\ae}ret at skabe en syntese af viden om muligheder og barrierer for fortsat markedsbaseret v{\ae}kst i produktion, forarbejdning og oms{\ae}tning af {\o}kologiske produkter.

GOD GROBUND FOR MERE {\O}KOLOGI
Vidensyntesen viser, at {\o}kologien har et solidt fodf{\ae}ste i Danmark: Forbrugerne eftersp{\o}rger {\o}kologiske produkter, detailhandlen er meget {\ra}ben for {\o}kologiske produkter, {\o}kologisk produktion giver god drifts{\o}konomi for producenterne, og der er god plads til meget mere {\o}kologi p{\ra} de danske marker.

En stor sten p{\ra} vejen er oml{\ae}gning til {\o}kologi. For markedet kr{\ae}ver flere {\o}kologiske produkter end der produceres. Prim{\ae}rproducenterne t{\o}ver med at reagere p{\ra} markedets signaler, og oml{\ae}gning til {\o}kologisk produktion er for lille i Danmark. Det betyder et uudnyttet potentiale b{\ra}de for hjemmemarked og eksport. Men der er ogs{\ra} andre sten p{\ra} vejen. Derfor anbefaler den ny vidensyntese fem v{\ae}sentlige, langsigtede strategiske indsatser, som skal sikre fremtiden for den {\o}kologiske sektor i Danmark. Anbefalingerne bygger p{\ra} en r{\ae}kke pr{\ae}misser, eller vilk{\ra}r, som vidensyntesen har klarlagt.

{\O}KOLOGIENS FIRE POSITIVE LIVSVILK{\rA}R
Den markedsbaserede {\o}kologi i Danmark hviler if{\o}lge vidensyntesen p{\ra} fire positive grundforhold.

1. Der er et v{\ae}rdibaseret marked
Markedsmulighederne for {\o}kologiske produkter er i dag overordentligt gode, og der er stor v{\ae}kst i detailoms{\ae}tningen. Eksporten er kun svagt stigende, mens importen er steget kraftigt. I Danmark har de seneste megatrends p{\ra} f{\o}devareomr{\ra}det flyttet fokus for forbruget hen p{\ra} v{\ae}rdibaseret forbrug, dvs. v{\ae}k fra m{\ae}ngde og hen mod "mening med maden", "sund mad" og "anst{\ae}ndige f{\o}devarer". Eftersp{\o}rgslen efter {\o}kologiske f{\o}devarer kobles sammen med symbolske aspekter og global ansvarlighed af et relativt stort forbrugersegment, som har en grundl{\ae}ggende tillid til {\o}kologerne.

2. Detailhandlens interesse stimulerer til innovation og produktudvikling
Vidensyntesen viser, at mange detailhandelsk{\ae}der nu bruger {\o}kologien som en del af deres strategiske profil, fordi {\o}kologiske forbrugere tilh{\o}rer trends{\ae}tterne inden for f{\o}devarer. Der har fundet en positiv markedsinnovation sted, som blandt andet har {\o}get tilg{\ae}ngeligheden og synligheden af {\o}kologiske varer. Detailhandelens ny interesse for ? og {\o}gede afs{\ae}tning af ? {\o}kologi har stimuleret interessen hos forarbejdningsvirksomhederne til innovation og produktudvikling. Derfor er der plads til en underskov af mindre {\o}kologiske virksomheder, men de skal bakkes op med viden p{\ra} mange omr{\ra}der.

3. {\O}kologisk produktion giver god drifts{\o}konomi
{\O}kologi giver generelt et h{\o}jere afkast end konventionel produktion. Det g{\ae}lder b{\ra}de heltidsplanteavl, kv{\ae}gbrug og svinebrug, hvor d{\ae}kningsbidrag og l{\o}nningsevne er h{\o}jere blandt {\o}kologiske bedrifter. P{\ra} trods af det, har der v{\ae}ret en meget begr{\ae}nset oml{\ae}gning til {\o}kologi hos prim{\ae}rproducenterne i de senere {\ra}r. Motivationen til at l{\ae}gge om er faldet blandt konventionelle landm{\ae}nd, som nu er afventende. For 2007 ses der en lille stigning i det {\o}kologiske areal og en nettotilgang p{\ra} godt 40 bedrifter, men den overordnede forsyningssituation skal forbedres v{\ae}sentligt.

4. Der er plads til meget mere {\o}kologi i Danmark
Der er geografisk set s{\ae}rdeles gode muligheder for en st{\o}rre {\o}kologisk produktion i Danmark. Eksempelvis er der plads til en firedobling af {\o}kologisk m{\ae}lkeproduktion, med udgangspunkt i de eksisterende bedrifter, og der ville stadig v{\ae}re plads til meget mere {\o}kologisk husdyrhold og planteavl. {\O}kologisk jordbrug kunne bidrage v{\ae}sentligt til at bevare naturv{\ae}rdier og fremme biologisk mangfoldighed i Danmark. Der er et vist overlap mellem de omr{\ra}der, der har stort potentiale for {\o}get {\o}kologisk produktion, og de omr{\ra}der, hvor der er s{\ae}rlige samfundsm{\ae}ssige forpligtelser og udfordringer med hensyn til naturbeskyttelse og udvikling af landskab og landdistrikter.

Vidensyntesen anbefaler fem strategiske indsatser
P{\ra} baggrund af den {\o}kologiske sektors nuv{\ae}rende situation anbefaler vidensyntesen fem vigtige indsatsomr{\ra}der, hvor der b{\o}r s{\ae}ttes ind, hvis det fremtidige {\o}kologiske marked skal sikres.

1. Styrke positiv dynamik i forarbejdning og afs{\ae}tning
Markedet er modent til flere {\o}kologiske produkter. V{\ae}rdibaseret eftersp{\o}rgsel hos den trends{\ae}ttende forbruger giver genklang i detailsektoren, og detailsektorens interesse stimulerer forarbejdningsvirksomheder og producenter. Den nuv{\ae}rende positive dynamik p{\ra} markedet skal forts{\ae}ttes og styrkes, blandt andet ved at underst{\o}tte produktudvikling.

2. {\O}kologisk intensivering - oml{\ae}gning halter efter eftersp{\o}rgslen
Der er akut behov for en m{\ra}lrettet og langsigtet indsats for {\o}get oml{\ae}gning til {\o}kologisk produktion. Indsatsen handler blandt andet om at formidle et attraktivt og vision{\ae}rt billede af {\o}kologi som en fremtidig del af landbruget, og skabe bedre vilk{\ra}r for oml{\ae}gning gennem langtidskontrakter. Derudover skal der udvikles nye typer af {\o}kologiske bedrifter, som kombinerer {\o}kologisk intensivering med multifunktionalitet og nye samarbejdsformer mellem specialiserede driftsgrene.

3. Styrke og opretholde forbrugertillid
Vidensyntesen viser, at forbrugernes tillid er afg{\o}rende for udviklingen af det {\o}kologiske marked og produktionssystem. Tilliden skal derfor opretholdes gennem en fortsat forbedring af metoder til produktion og forarbejdning i harmoni med de {\o}kologiske principper. Og der skal sikres en {\ra}ben og involverende kommunikationen med forbrugerne.

4. Skabe synergi mellem {\o}kologi og samfund
Metoder for {\o}kologisk drift kan bidrage til at fremme natur og biodiversitet og kan reducere forurening af vandmilj{\o} og udledning af drivhusgasser. Navnlig i udvalgte omr{\ra}der, hvor der er et s{\ae}rligt behov for beskyttelse, kan en st{\o}rre udbredelse af de {\o}kologiske arealer bidrage til den biologiske mangfoldighed. Der er ogs{\ra} den mulighed at kombinere milj{\o} og naturbeskyttelse med produktion af bioenergi og udvikling af nye specialprodukter. Mange {\o}kologiske landbrug vil gerne {\ra}bne deres g{\ra}rde for bes{\o}gende, s{\ra} naturoplevelser kan kombineres med kontakt til landbruget.

5. Indfri et stort behov for ny viden
Vidensyntesen peger p{\ra}, at der er stort behov for fortsat forskning og videnopbygning for at fremme udviklingen af {\o}kologisk f{\o}devareproduktion og f{\o}devaresystemer. Vigtige udviklingsomr{\ra}der er synergieffekter i sammensatte {\o}kologiske produktionsformer, {\o}kologisk intensivering og mere bevidst brug af mangfoldighed i og uden for markerne samt for{\ae}dling. Desuden forarbejdning og mikro-processering og sektorens bidrag til natur, milj{\o} og landdistriktsudvikling.}

        abstract = {Strategic orientations on farms are becoming more diverse: in addition to those who focus on cost-effectiveness in conventional primary production, many farmers add value to their agricultural products through processing, direct sales and niche-products, or diversify their activities into non-agricultural businesses. This development indicates that farmers are taking the initiative and pursuing ways to develop their businesses. Obviously, this development implies the need for entrepreneurial skills.

In this study entrepreneurial skills are understood as the skills of recognizing and realizing business opportunities, networking and utilizing contacts, as well as creating and evaluating a business strategy. Are these skills relevant in the farm context? Do farmers consider these skills important?

How do they assess themselves regarding these skills? How do farmers explain the development of these skills? What could be done to enhance the development of these skills? 

This book?s aim is to answer these questions with the help of a detailed analysis of qualitative interviews with farmers in six European countries. The book reports the results from the main study of the EU-funded research project ?Developing Entrepreneurial Skills of Farmers? (ESoF).

Both organic and conventional farmers were intereviewed.

The quality of organic grain can be modulated by agronomic modifications on genotypes, crop management, crop rotation and soil fertility, but the milling process and finally the baking process are also key factors in producing bread of high baking quality, nutritional value, taste and flavour. Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient in achieving acceptable yield levels of sufficient bread-making quality, but previous results have shown that organic wheat tends to have lower protein content, dough mixing tolerance and loaf volume. The selection of genotypes with high N use efficiency, weed competitiveness and disease resistance allowed improving the agronomic performance. Besides protein content and protein composition, the baking performance of organic wheat bread also depended on flour starch damage, amylase activity, ash content and particle size distribution. The milling technique had a critical effect on both baking performance and nutritional value whereas the baking process may improve the bioavailability of minerals through acidification process (sourdough). Finally, this programme allowed to better characterize stakes and constraints of the whole organic wheat-flour-bread chain due to a multidisciplinary approach.}

Results showed that IMF content ranged on a comparably high level of about 2.2 \%. In contradiction to previous results under standardized conditions the factor feeding had no significant influence on the IMF. The feeding effect was overlapped by heterogeneous conditions on the different farms. IMF content showed greater variation between the farms than between groups within each farm. }

The paper investigates the possibility to conciliate the environmental conservation with the small farming expansion in the Amazon, to build agrobiodiversity, and at the same time improve food security. This social practice consequently would contribute to the reduction of deforestation and could thus falsify the old diagnosis of incriminating the poor farmers for forest and soil destruction. The study was conducted by the Associa{\cc}{\~a}o de Produtores Alternativos, localized in territory of Ouro Preto d? Oeste, Rond{\^o}nia, in the  Southwest of the Amazon. The study documented a number of forest preservation and agroecological methods used and concludes that institutional support to strengthening of social organization and local sustainable development projects is fundamental for the consolidation and amplification of the ecological experiences in the Amazon. }

How much this strain influences the piglets depends mostly on their immune system. Piglets from organic production are weaned later (at least 40 days) than piglets from conventional rearing, but the performance and health status of organic piglets are often not satisfying. Therefore, it was the aim to investigate whether a prolonged suckling period of 63 days results in better immune status of piglets than with weaning at day 42. To answer that question we vaccinated piglets at different times with a ?known? (by vaccination of dam) and an ?unknown? antigen and analysed the plasma for immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration and the antigen-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA. Two farrowing cycles of 36 sows were recorded. Time of vaccination did not influence IgG concentration. In contrast, early weaned piglets showed a higher IgG concentration on day 49 than late weaned piglets. During the first farrowing cycle a significant immune response against both antigens was present in piglets vaccinated on day 42. Such a response was not found in piglets vaccinated on day 63 and in piglets of the second farrowing cycle. In conclusion, the results did not show an improved immune status of piglets undergoing a suckling period of 63 days.}

There are several reports about chemical residues in vegetables that have serious side effects on human health and the environment in that country. On other hand, many Iranian farmers traditionally use organic production practices, but organic cultivation in Iran is not in accordance with international regulations. Since vegetables are the most important category of organic products, and since the future of organic agriculture will largely depend on consumer demand, a survey of 470 respondents was performed in Shiraz regarding their level of awareness about organic vegetables, their tendency to consume of organic vegetables, the effect of proper appearance of vegetables on the tendency to purchase organic vegetables and the importance of the organic label and certification of organic vegetables. Results showed that about half of the respondents have knowledge of organic vegetables and that their tendency to consume organic vegetable is very high. The results also showed that proper appearance does not effect the tendency to purchase organic vegetables, and that almost all consumers prefer to purchase organic vegetables labelled as certfied. It is suggested that organic vegetable production be introduced and supported by the Iranian government.}

important pests on both trees. They are Brachycaudus amygdalinus and
Brachycaudus helichrysi, which are aphids that feed on the young leaves causing
stunted growth; and Pterochloroides persicae which is a species that attack the bark
and excretes large quantities of honeydew. A survey of natural enemies of B.

species of each of Chrysopidae and Chamaemyiidae, and one beetle, in addition to
one parasitoid. Some Arachinids were also mentioned to prey on this aphid. Most

It is important to acknowledge this heterogeneity when investigating the dynamics and governance of organic agriculture. We suggest a polyocular approach that facilitates a comprehensive and balanced understanding of organic agriculture by enabling us to handle different perspectives reflexively. To illustrate this approach we describe three significant perspectives on organic agriculture based on protest, meaning and market. No perspective is the ?right? one and, we claim, different perspectives on organic agriculture cannot be merged to one. We hope that polyocularity as a general analytical tool, and the three specific perspectives, will be helpful in understanding the future development of organic agriculture and how it may be influenced.}

        abstract = {In southern Brazil several small farmers developed an innovative organic conservation tillage system (OCT) that does not depend on herbicides for weed control but relies instead on the use of cover crop mixtures (including various combinations of rye, vetch and raphanus) that leave a thick residue mulch layer on which traditional grain crops are directly planted, suffering very little weed interference during the growing season and reaching agronomically acceptable yield levels. Our research showed that the rye, fodder radish and vetch mixture effectively suppressed emergence of summer annual weeds in OCT systems. Because of the allelopathic effect of phytotoxins associated with the cover crops residues, farmers avoid toxic effects by placing crop seeds below the toxic layer (allelopathic zone) formed by the phytotoxins leached a short distance (5-10cm) from the mulch into the soil. In addition to weed suppression, residues also have positive effects on subsequent crops from increased soil quality parameters, improved crop nutrition, and in some cases suppression of soil-borne pathogens. Yields in most cases are 5-10\% lower in OCT systems when compared to CT systems, but such differences are easily offset by the lower costs of production and the environmental benefits of OCT systems. In our trials the combination of grass and legumes enhanced biomass production and therefore mulch thickness, weed suppression, and organic matter inputs.}

Yet previously no studies on the structure, economic outcomes and internal benefits of biogas production on organic farms existed. Therefore in 2006 and 2007 an empirical study, designed as a census, has been carried out to investigate these questions. Based on the empirical study a simulation model was built to analyse the economic potential. The highest economic potential, particularly if organic food and energy production are to be accomplished, was found for biogas plants which are mainly residual-based and on a farm scale size. The construction of small but also low priced biogas plants for organic farms will be a challenge.      }

The choice and usefulness of a cover crop species strictly depend on its adaptability to specific climate and soil conditions, but also on its relationships with other species (crops and weeds) and on the quality of farm management. Nine different pure species and three species mixtures were cultivated for two years as winter cover crops in a rainfed stockless arable organic cropping system as part of the MASCOT long-term experiment. Leguminous cover crops showed the highest level of biomass production in both years. Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), either in pure stand or in mixture with grasses, was the most productive and stable species, and had the highest N uptake (ca. 200 kg ha-1). Besides, leguminous species significantly increased the content of N (up to 100\%) and P (up to 50\%) in weeds and associated grass crops, probably as a result of increased nutrient availability in soil through root exudates.}

To achieve this, a comparative experimental design involving one conventional and one nearby organic field was used. Our results show that the effect of A. sterilis invasion on resident weeds and cereal biomass depended on the cropping system. Species richness and diversity of weed community were more negatively affected by the invasion in the conventional field, whereas cereal biomass was drastically reduced in the organic field. The cropping system did not affect the invasive ability of A. sterilis, but the higher A. sterilis biomass recorded in the conventional field suggests strong potential long-term invasions in this system.}

In vitro, the experimental model consisted of a host-pathogen system: cucumber-Pythium ultimum. The results of the bioassay show that cucumber plants in compost inoculated with the pathogen and containing onion or leek by-products show better vegetative growth than the control. In vivo, soil biodisinfection with onion by-products in asparagus leads to a yield intermediate between the untreated soil and the methyl bromide treatment. Another aim of the present study was to get more data about the nematicidal activity of disulfides. The activity of DMDS and DADS was evaluated on two nematode species.}

Transplanted onions generally performed much better than direct sown onions. The best strategies in transplanted onions decreased the hand weeding time by 70\% and increased marketable yield by 96\% compared with the best strategies in direct-sown onions.


In transplanted onions, one weed harrowing and three in-row cultivations with torsion weeders reduced in-row weed numbers by 85\%, reduced hand weeding time by 73\%, and caused no yield reduction compared with the normal strategy of one weed harrowing and ordinary inter-row cultivation. In direct-sown onions, pre-emergence flame weeding and repeated torsion weeding reduced hand weeding time by 40\% and caused no yield reduction compared with flame weeding and inter-row cultivation. The effectiveness of in-row cultivation was very dependent on the timing of treatments. Using transplanted onions and in-row weed control is a way to ensure high yields and reduce labour requirements for hand weeding compared with direct-sown onions and interrow cultivation.

Legume catch crops were compared with non-legume catch crops in systems with spring barley as the main crop each year. Grain yields were determined and N leaching losses measured by means of installed ceramic suction cups. The legume catch crops, especially white clover and red clover, showed large residual effects in  succeeding spring barley, and clover was efficient in reducing N leaching losses.

        abstract = {In the United Kingdom it is mandatory for organic livestock farms to have an animal health plan as a document providing evidence of active management of disease and building positive health (Anon 2006). Many organisations, both organic and non organic, (e.g. BCVA, Defra Compendium of UK Organic Standards, Soil Association, RSPCA Freedom Food, NDFAS, FAWL) develop, describe and use animal health planning as a part of their strategy (see Box 1). Currently, it is the presence of a regularly updated health plan document that serves as evidence that this is in place. 

The benefits of health plans, including animal welfare improvement, financial gain and increased farm efficacy have all been highlighted in various publications (Sibley 2000, Gray \& Hovi 2001, Dobbs 2005, Lovatt 2004). It has frequently been suggested that, through good stockmanship and appropriate use of veterinary medicinal products, health planning can improve the smooth running of a farm. 

An animal health plan should be an active tool for animal health and welfare planning. However, as organic certification and several farm assurance schemes require a health plan there is a danger that they become seen as something to be policed when in fact they should being used as a forum for advice. In order to fulfil this challenge a health plan must therefore be farm specific and relate to farm specific issues. }

The exclusive use of organically produced animal feedstuffs is fixed in the EU-VO 2092?91 for the year 2011. The differences of the contents of crude nutrients between the data of conventionally and organically analysed feedstuffs, as well as the possible differences of the contents from year to year, point out that a satisfying calculation of feed rations needs an exact knowledge of the chemical constituents of the feed components used. Therefore, well-defined material from field trials of the experimental station of the Institute of Organic Farming in Trenthorst of the years 2002-2005 was used for the determination of the contents of crude nutrients and energy in different grain legumes and cereals. All samples were analysed by classical chemical methods and also scanned by NIRS. Predictions of crude protein, crude ash, ether extract, starch, sugar and energy contents for pigs and dairy cattle showed satisfactory accuracy. The correlation coefficients for crude protein, ether extract and starch were 0.98, respectively. Standard error of prediction was below 0.1 MJ ME (pig) kg-1  DM and below 0.08 MJ NEL kg-1 DM. The prediction accuracy for crude fiber, fiber fractions and AMEN was poor. The prediction accuracy should be improved during further growing seasons.}

59 species in the crops? stands. The annual dicotyledonus were dominating groups of the weed
flora. The most abundant weeds were lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), quackgrass
(Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski), common yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br.p.p.). The
significantly smaller amount of weeds among crop rotation links was observed in the link rye? oil

crop rotation in the organic farming system is dependent on the cultivated crops, the succession of
crops in the crop rotation links and crop cultivation technologies.}

The demand for information relating to the nutrition of horses in a cold environment is increasing with the popularity of loose housing of horses. This study examined the energy intake and growth of 10 weanling horses from November to March (22 weeks) in a loose housing system (paddock and insulated sleeping hall with deep-litter bed). The horses were measured weekly for body condition and body weight, and the feeding was adjusted according to a horse?s body condition. Metabolizable energy (ME) intake was compared to Finnish (MTT 2006) and Swedish (SLU 2004) nutrient requirements for 6?12-month-old horses. ME intake (75.5 {$\pm$} 11.8 MJ d-1, mean {$\pm$} SD) was on average 24.6\% above the requirements. The intake varied in a non-linear fashion in the course of the winter: y = 0.086x2 ? 0.902x ? 71.5, where x is weeks from November to March (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001, R2=0.63). Low ambient temperature increased ME intake by about 1.8\% in November (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001), 0.5\% in December (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001) and 0.2\% in January (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) per 1 ?C decrease in ambient temperature when compared to nutrient requirements, but not in February and March. We conclude that the amount of extra energy needed decreases during the winter as the horses grow and acclimatize to the cold housing environment, i.e. as their body insulation increases. Horses gain weight at or above expected rates in cold conditions when the increased energy need is taken into account in the feeding. }

Here we investigated the performance of geographically different isolates of two fungal species, Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices, by assessing plant growth responses and P and N uptake in Medicago sativa, in order to select the most efficient fungi for this host plant. The four selected Glomus isolates significantly increased shoot dry weights and shoot N and P content of mycorrhizal plants, but their performances were different. In particular, G. intraradices IMA6 significantly differed from G. mosseae IMA1 in inducing larger growth responses relative to all parameters measured.}

This combination of requirements implies that varieties for organic farming need to be better characterised with respect to genotype x environment interactions than varieties for conventional farming. Such interactions, which often are found for quantitatively expressed traits, are in general difficult to deal with in phenotypic selection. New approaches for QTL analyses (e.g. using physiological models) facilitate estimation of effects of genes on a trait (the phenotype) as a response to environmental influences. From such analyses, markers can be identified which may help to predict the trait expression of a plant genotype in relation to defined environmental factors. The application of markers to select for loci with specific interactions with the environment could, therefore, be especially important for plant breeders targeting organic farming systems.}

As part of this effort, we have looked at the traditional folk practices prevalent among farmers as well as information from classical literature on the subject drawn from Vrkshayurveda (traditional Indian plant science).  Following this, we have carried out experiments for standardizing and field testing promising natural products by determining the precise range and kind of pests controlled by them, determining the optimum concentration where they can be effective against pests without being harmful to useful organisms and predators as well as studying their mode of action.  Subsequently, we have also developed storage forms of various of these products by using methods based on Ayurveda.  Studies on the stability and shelf life of these products are also being carried out through an insect rearing laboratory.  Finally, we have also set up village based biopesticides units where a range of these products are being prepared thus providing valuable inputs to sustainable agriculture and a means of livelihood to rural women and farmers.}

The three systems are applied to a spinach-potato-cabbage-tomato two-year crop sequence and include different levels of technical innovation: Standard Crop Management System (SCMS); Intermediate Crop Management System (ICMS); and Advanced Crop Management System (ACMS). ICMS is based on a sequence of physical weed management treatments, whereas ACMS also includes a subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) living mulch. In this paper we analyse the results obtained on spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in terms of crop yield and weed suppression. Both innovative systems increased total spinach fresh weight yield compared to SCMS, despite higher weed biomass. In ACMS, total weed biomass decreased linearly with increasing biomass of the subterranean clover living mulch. }

Proteins quality was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D EF). Nitrite and nitrate content were measured by the Griess reaction.  Metals were detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy. 
Electrophoretic data show differences in the quality of water-soluble proteins in uncooked products, in contrast to thermal treatment results, which revealed no differences between the organic and conventional products, although it is difficult to interpret these data.
Metal analyses show significantly higher levels of Fe, Zn, Ca, Se, and Cu in organic meat.
There was no significant difference detected in nitrite content, while nitrate was lower in organic compared to conventional salami. These results suggest that cooked organic meat products do not have any nutritional advantage over conventional ones, and that only seasoned products preserve the original quality of organic meat.

Soil N, soil microbial biomass, crop nutrient uptake, canopy light interception, disease, GHG emissions and biomass were measured. Results show that the mustard cover crop reduced soil nitrate (NO3-) in winter and also during the tomato crop, which was associated with decreased growth and canopy development. All cultivar mixtures had fairly similar yield and shoot biomass. The ?choice cultivar? (i.e. farmer?s best choice) showed plasticity depending on the mixture, tending to have higher biomass production in mixtures. This study shows the complexity of cultivar-mixture interactions. To achieve the greatest benefit for ecosystem functions in organic farming, mixtures require greater understanding of cultivar plasticity and phenological and physiological trait diversity.}

Data records of one and a half year and 49 cows were analysed. 132 of 203 udder quarters were treated with an antibiotic at drying off. The treated quarters had significant higher readings for electrical conductivity, California Mastitis Test and the somatic cell count during lactation than the untreated group. Red and White Holstein cows received significantly more often a DCT than Holstein-Friesian cows. Thus, the results of our study do not support the presumption that older breeds are more robust against diseases and therefore fit better into organic dairy farming. Discussions about this topic should consider that the term ?local condition? includes not only the climate but also the management conditions of the organic dairy farm. }

the above-ground biomass of white cabbage, with two prunings giving higher cabbage yields than one, but there
were clear differences between the living mulch species tested (red clover, birdsfoot trefoil, salad burnet, winter
rye). Below-ground growth and competition were examined by measuring root distribution in minirhizotrons and
uptake of 15N placed at different soil depths. These studies showed that the ability of mulch species to compete
for resources at depth was restricted by pruning, and that this was crucial for the development of the white

        abstract = {This study explores claims that organic agriculture may be an empowering development strategy by investigating the impacts of conversion to organic farming systems on the lives of small-scale farmers in Cambodia. The thesis interrogates the diverse uses and abuses of the term ?empowerment? in development rhetoric and argues for an empowerment model that is derived from farmers? self-defined concepts of development. This model was used to conduct a qualitative case study involving semi-structured interviews and focus groups with members of organics initiatives in seven diverse Cambodian communities. 

Results indicate that many farmers in all communities felt that their most important objective was not only to achieve food security, but to achieve 'food sovereignty' by being able to grow sufficient rice to feed their family. Farmers joined the organics initiatives primarily to improve their health and reduce the cost of farming inputs. As a result of joining the initiatives, all farmers (including both certified and non-certified organic farmers) felt they had improved their health and food security. Most farmers also increased incomes, created stronger family and community ties and felt they had more control over their livelihoods. These benefits were not, however, distributed equally amongst individuals or communities. Very poor and isolated farmers could not generally access benefits. The three main factors that determined the impact of the organics initiatives on farmer empowerment were identified as: the individual?s level of resources, the strength of the farmer group, and the policies and values of the supporting organisation. 

The implications for future initiatives are, firstly, the tremendous potential for farmers and wider rural communities to benefit from organic agriculture as a development strategy. However, this study also shows that if organics is to be viable for low-resource people, it may be necessary to promote both resources and techniques in organics initiatives. Also, a focus on building strong relationships both within the farmers group and linkages with local and wider stakeholders may enhance long-term sustainability of organics initiatives.   }

Increasing the distance between rows of winter wheat from 12.5 cm to 50 cm proved advantageous for the indirect quality parameters sedimentation value and gluten and crude protein concentration. Either no yield decreases or low decreases only up to 10\% were noted. Because of an increased tendency to erode and in order to improve of the preceding crop?s value, creation of a green zone with legumes between the rows is necessary.

Compared to soy bean meal yellow lupins have higher protein content but a low yield. While the energy content of lupins as feed for pigs, cattle and milking cows was only slightly higher than of soy bean meal, its feed energy for poultry was nearly comparable.
In the case of mixed intercropping with spring cereals the feed energy content for pigs and cattle by using spring wheat or- barley as partner was higher than a comparable mixture of wheat and soy bean meal. The lowest feed energy contents were achieved with mixtures of legumes and oats.

We present the results of soil analyses after three cropping years (2002-2005). Soil organic carbon (Corg) increased over that period by 7.4\% (?1.5 g Corg kg-1 soil) in the 0-10 cm soil layer in the reduced tillage plots, while it remained constant in the ploughed plots. Soil microbial carbon (Cmic) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA, TTC-reduction) were 28\% higher in reduced-tillage plots in this soil layer. Biological soil quality as calculated by Cmic to Corg was 15\% enhanced under reduced tillage. In the 10-20 cm soil layer no significant Corg, Cmic, Cmic to Corg and DHA differences between the tillage schemes were found. It is suggested that reduced tillage improves important indicators of soil fertility during the conversion period. Long-term aspects of soil fertility, crop yield and weed infestation need investigation over a prolonged experimental period.}

        abstract = {Conservation tillage (no-till and reduced tillage) brings many benefits with respect to soil fertility and energy use, but it also has drawbacks regarding the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides. Our objective was to adapt reduced tillage to organic farming by quantifying effects of tillage (plough versus chisel), fertilization (slurry versus manure compost) and biodynamic preparations (with versus without) on soil fertility indicators and crop yield. The experiment was initiated in 2002 on a Stagnic Eutric Cambisol (45\% clay content) near Frick (Switzerland) where the average annual precipitation is 1000 mm. This report focuses on the conversion period and examines changes as tillage intensity was reduced. Soil samples were taken from the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths and analysed for soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial biomass (Cmic), dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and earthworm density and biomass. Among the components tested, only tillage had any influence on these soil fertility indicators. Corg in the 0-10 cm soil layer increased by 7.4\% (1.5 g Corg kg-1 soil, p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) with reduced tillage between 2002 and 2005, but remained constant with conventional tillage. Similarly, Cmic was 28\% higher and DHA 27\% (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) higher with reduced than with conventional tillage in the soil layer 0-10 cm. In the 10-20 cm layer, there were no significant differences for these soil parameters between the tillage treatments. Tillage had no significant effect on total earthworm density and biomass. The abundance of endogeic, horizontally burrowing adult earthworms was 70\% higher under reduced than conventional tillage but their biomass was 53\% lower with reduced tillage. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spelt (Triticum spelta L.) yield decreased by 14\% (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) and 8\% (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05), respectively, with reduced tillage, but sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) yield was slightly higher with reduced tillage. Slurry fertilization enhanced wheat yield by 5\% (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) compared to compost fertilization. Overall, Corg, Cmic, and DHA improved and yields showed only a small reduction with reduced tillage under organic management, but long-term effects such as weed competition remain unknown.}

These measures are for example the obliged indoor confinement during so-called risk periods ort the allowance to vaccinate against this virus infection. These measures have consequences for the organic poultry sector. It seems there is a large diversity between the different European countries concerning what prescriptions there are and especially the definitions of risk areas and risk periods seem to vary. The consequence in the Netherlands, for example, is that in 2007, approximately 95\% of the organic laying hens were confined during nearly 5 months, while there was no single case of avian influenza within the Dutch borders. In most other European countries, only small numbers of farms in single risk areas had to keep their animals inside. This is not only a threat to animal welfare, it also does not fit in the ?organic way? of keeping animals and it is impossible to communicate this to the consumer who simply expects the animals to be outside.      }

The light penetration within the canopy measured during the first experiment (2002), was decreased up to 90\%, due to the increase of the companion crops? leaf area. In both years the decrease of the available light to the weeds, has led to the reduction of the weed dry matter, in comparison to the pure stands. Finally the oat-bean intercrop system gave better results than oat-peas system. As a result we can say that the intercrop system constitutes a new approach to weed control for low input agriculture under Mediterranean conditions.}

Roots fresh weight and surface was significant higher under shade for organic transplants and significant lower under shade for conventional transplants. Hence, shoots fresh weight and surface was significant higher under shade for organic as well as conventional transplants. Because of the described differences in roots development, the transplants which were produced in the organic float system nursery had better quality under shade in contrast to those produced in conventional float system nursery which had better quality under light. The quality of transplants is related to their behaviour during the transplanting process, their resistance to the transplanting stress and their survival in the field.}

Kenya experiences bimodal type of rainfall with two rainfall peaks; the long (730 mm) and the short (376 mm) rains. Rainfall fluctuations in both seasons are becoming more common in the recent years with a likelihood of crop failure in one out of five years. The question addressed was how to utilize the short rains for food and biomass production. Lablab (Dolichos lablab), a N-fixing legume was sown in the short rains and the seeds harvested. The effect of lablab biomass incorporation on organic maize and potatoes planted in the long rains was evaluated in comparison with farmyard manure application. The 3-year trial showed that dry matter biomass (1.95 t?ha) and grain yield (0.5 t?ha) of lablab was a factor of the amount of rainfall. The amount of lablab biomass applied was proportional to maize grain and potato tuber yields. Similarly, amount of yield and biomass in the long rains was species specific and were a factor of both rainfall amounts and distribution.}

This paper addresses possibilities and limitations that Mexican small-scale farmers are facing to enhance sustainable livelihoods in the amaranth value chain. The study reveals that amaranth, as an alternative crop and livelihood, is perhaps one of the most complete endogenous natural resources that small-scale farmers have to combat the above-mentioned problems. The study identified several local and regional barriers for increasing the level of farming, production, processing and consumption. A striking and paradoxical limitation is the monopolization practices developed by some of the associations in relation to knowledge and technology transfer, seeds distribution and contact to potential national and foreign buyers.}

Four funnel pitfall traps (10 cm diameter) were used to catch spiders in three stripe-types in two geographical regions in two years over 5 weeks in May and June: in total 12 sets of data. Spider species typical for open habitats were dominant, mostly lycosids (6 of 10 most active species). The results were analysed together with environmental factors using a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and spiders were compared with carabid beetles (Coeloptera: Carabidae). Geographical region, though not very distant, had the largest influence on both spiders and carabids. The age and type of the habitats had a stronger influence on spiders than on carabids. In spiders a larger part of the total variance was explained by the analysed factors. Finally we discuss briefly a remarkable spider species. A rewiew of all known records of Phrurolithus nigrinus in Switzerland and Germany, together with adjacent regions in France, is given.

Neben den umfangreichen Arbeiten zur Saatgutqualit{\"a}t wurden die Saatgutpillierung von Petersilie und K{\"u}mmel untersucht. Die Schwierigkeit des Vorhabens lag im fehlenden Grundlagenwissen zu vielen Wirt-Pathogenbeziehungen. Resultierend aus den Versuchsarbeiten k{\"o}nnen der Praxis umfangreiche Erfahrungen zur Saatgutbehandlung vorgestellt werden. Die Arbeiten verdeutlichten, dass dem Produktionsfaktor Saatgut mehr Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt werden sollte und vor dem Anbau wichtige Qualit{\"a}tsparameter (Keimf{\"a}higkeit, Befall mit samenb{\"u}rtigen Pathogenen) beim Saatguthandel erfragt werden sollte.}

To speak about pests and diseases of plants may not be as exciting as when speaking of human beings; however, entomology and phytopathology hold methodological similarities to conventional medicine, which, thus, allow for correlations among them. After all, plant protection and human medical science are based under common epistemological principles of modern scientific thought. Hence, the goal of this essay is to disclose certain disagreements of the disciplines of phytopathology and entomology with agroecological based science; yet, giving way to a discussion according to ecological principles. This is a theoretical essay, based on bibliographical research and on the direct experience of the authors with family farmers in the South of Brazil during the last 20 years. }

This research had, thus, the objective of studying the efficacy of homeopathic preparations, homemade formulations and genetic variability in the management of pests and diseases at field conditions on organic farming systems of potato crops. Two field experiments were installed during the 2006?07 crop season. In experiment 1, the following genotypes were planted as treatments: Catucha and Epagri (landrace), Monalisa and Agata (Holland), and Panda (Germany). In experiment 2, the statistical design was a split plot with the Monalisa, Catucha and Epagri genotypes as sub plots, and nine spray preparations as the main plot as follows: Chamomilla 60CH, Silicea 60CH, Kali 60CH, Thuya 60CH, biotherapic of Phytophthora infestans 60CH, water 60CH, the homemade preparations of Bordeaux mixture at 0,3\% and of propolis extract at 0,5\%, and, finally, a no-intervention treatment. Results showed that the Catucha genotype, a bred landrace, yielded 21 t ha-1 and presented the lowest disease incidence. Even though no preparation differed significantly from another; the Thuya homeopathic treatment yielded the best results with more than 26 t ha-1. Natural enemies were not affected by any of the spray preparations.}

Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types of blue lupins, the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR): 50\% : 50\%, 62,5\% : 37,5 \% and 75\% : 25\% of the respective pure cropping seeding rate. We present data on total grain yield, yield of blue lupins, yield percentage of blue lupins, protein content, and protein yield. Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR of blue lupins whereas, in contrast, the yield of blue lupins, protein content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability of blue lupins against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25\%. From the view of plant production and the purpose of animal nutrition the percentage of grain legumes should be higher and comparable to those of other crop mixtures like peas with spring barley or beans with oat. }

At the ICSS-site the cultivars Vitabor, Boltensia, Borlu and Sonet showed the lowest yield. Yield was similar between the branched and determinate cultivars at both sites, but the crude protein content (CP) was in the majority of the cases higher in the branched cultivars. The CP content ranged between 28.2\% and 37.8\% DM at the IOF-site and between 34.7 and 39.2\% DM at the ICSS-site, respectively. The newer cultivars Idefix and Probor, which were tested at ICSS-site in 2006 and 2007, had the highest CP content (39.2 and 38.8\% DM). Additionally, the predicted Net Energy for Lactation (NEL) in dairy cow and the predicted Metabolized Energy for pigs (ME) showed interactions between year and cultivar with the exception of ME at the ICSS-site. Cultivars with a high NEL respectively ME were Bora, Boruta, Bolivio and Borlu at the IOF-site and Probor, Borlu, Idefix, Boregine and Boltensia at the ICSS-site. }

In 2005 and 2006 click beetles were monitored at different locations in northern Germany. Because of the warmer springtime in 2005, the first peak of click beetles was about two weeks earlier than in 2006. The second peak was found one month later. The presented data show the highest occurrence of click beetles in ryegrass-clover mixtures in both years. The catches in cereals were much lower than in ryegrass-clover. The reasons for the differences of the trapped click beetles in the different cereal fields cannot been explained so far. In the majority of cases the trapped number of Agriotes lineatus was higher than for  A. obscurus.  }

During this period two important droughts occurred, which highly affected the fodder self-sufficiency of the organic farms, having consequences on more than a year of production. The conventional farms were less affected than the organic ones, and the farmers developed varied strategies including a reduction of the LU and the use of more maize. To maintain the stability of the milk production, organic farms had to increase the reliance on external fodder resources. The lack of security forage stores can explain the sensitivity of these farms and their incapacity to recover a good level of self-sufficiency.}

The N surplus in ORG was 32\% higher than in CONV, while no differences were recorded on N content in the top soil, so that ORG implicated a higher N loss from that soil layer. In ORG we recorded a higher phosphatase activity but a lower available soil P (due to application of rock phosphate in sub-alkaline soil) and a lower exchangeable K.}

The looming global scarcity of fossil fuels has spurred interest in producing ethanol from corn (Zea mays) but legitimate objections remain to the idea of supporting this vision.  The purpose of this study was to initiate a prairie restoration on marginal soil of a 16.2 ha. farm in southeastern Minnesota and to determine which restoration procedure (only native grass species versus a mixture of grasses and forbes) was most effective for the establishment of prairie on the land that may yield biomass for biofuels.  We planted 11.4Kg.?ha. of grasses on 4.7 ha. and 0.70Kg.?ha. of forbs on 3.2 ha., in June 2007.  An evaluation of species richness was conducted after 90 days in the 5 restored plots.  The mean percent cover in the grass plots was 0.935, whereas the one in the grass-and-forbs plots was 0.944.  A t-test with two independent samples complemented the computation of the diversity index and indicated that there was not a statistically significant difference in species diversity among the plots. This paper postulates a model of prairie rehabilitation in synergy with renewable energy production from native prairies.  This could inspire agriculture in the Midwest of the U.S.  to a vision of ecological restoration and sustainability.}

This novelty is based on the irradiation of samples in a bench-top EDXRF equipment provided with a Rh tube and further treatment of the spectral data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multivariate analysis results showed a tendency in separating the samples according to the production mode (organic or conventional). Regarding the spectra obtained, the K alpha peak of potassium showed to be the most responsible for discriminating different categories of samples. The chlorine K-alpha peak presented high capability in discriminating tomato and coffee samples from different origins. The method can be useful for food quality control to rapidly classify samples since the measurements can be done ?in situ? with portable instruments. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to build robust classification models with a larger number of samples.}

Die Untersuchungen wurden unter Einbeziehung von 8 Praxisbetriebspaaren ({\"o}kologisch vs. konventionell), 3 {\"o}kologischen Versuchsbetrieben und 16 Dauerfeldversuchen durchgef{\"u}hrt. 
Ergebnisse:
1. Eine Absicherung von Unterschieden in Niveau und Entwicklung der Humusgehalte unter konventioneller und {\"o}kologischer Bewirtschaftung war sowohl unter Praxisbedingungen, wie auch in den Dauerfeldversuchen kaum m{\"o}glich. Hier wurde die Notwendigkeit einer differenzierten Betrachtung der Bewirtschaftungssysteme deutlich. 
2. Aufgrund der dargestellten Sachverhalte konnten h{\"o}here Humusgehalte unter {\"o}kologi?scher Bewirtschaftung im Vergleich zu konventionell bewirtschafteten Fl{\"a}chen dann abgesichert werden, wenn sich die verglichenen Bewirtschaftungssysteme in Fruchtfolge und?oder D{\"u}ngung wesentlich unterschieden.
3. Die Ergebnisse zur Bedeutung der Humusdynamik f{\"u}r die Ertragsbildung bei {\"o}kologischer und konventioneller Bewirtschaftung ergaben kein einheitliches Bild. Allerdings wurden in der Auswertung der Dauerfeldversuche engere Korrelationen zwischen durchschnittlichem Marktfruchtertrag und fast allen Indikatoren der Humusdynamik bei den {\"o}kologischen Parzellen gegen{\"u}ber den konventionell bewirtschafteten festgestellt. 
4. Ein quantitativer Einfluss einer differenzierten Intensit{\"a}t der Grundbodenbearbeitung auf die Humusdynamik konnte weder in Praxisbetrieben noch in Dauerfeldversuchen festgestellt werden. 
5. Die im Rahmen des Projektes entwickelte modellbasierte Humusbilanzmethode (HUMOD) ist eine Weiterentwicklung der dynamischen Humuseinheitenmethode und zeigte in der Anwendung in Dauerfeldversuchen und Praxisbetrieben eine akzeptable Aussagequalit{\"a}t. Eine wesentlich bessere Erfassung der Humusreproduktion von Anbausystemen als mit den aktuell etablierten Methoden wird zwar noch nicht erreicht. Der gro{\ss}e Vorteil der neuen Methode ist jedoch die M{\"o}glichkeit der reproduzierbaren Ermittlung von Humusreproduktionskoeffizienten f{\"u}r Fruchtarten in unterschiedlichen Anbausystemen unter Ber{\"u}cksichtigung der Standortbedingungen. }

        abstract = {Humus balances provide a profitable approach for humus dynamics assessment in farming practice. Nevertheless, there is a clear demand for methodological adaptation.     This article presents a new approach to humus balancing using reproducible algorithms for the estimation of balance coefficients. Humus balance coefficients for crops and organic fertilizers are estimated according to a bipartite algorithm. Humus demand  is calculated on the basis of crop yields referring to the nitrogen household in the plant-soil system. Humus supply is derived from organic matter input with plant material and fertilizers. The new approach facilitates the adaptation of the method to new situations. }

Humus dynamics were basically influenced by environmental site conditions, but at a given site differences between farming systems could be ascerted. Mixed farming systems with farmyard manure application as a rule had a more favourable impact on humus dynamics than stockless systems. Whether an advantageous performance of humus dynamics in organic farming as compared to conventional farming will occur or not, is dependent on the respective farm types of both systems that are related to each other. }

In particular, problems in accessing knowledge and technical inputs are likely to translate into difficulties in adopting and maintaining organic production practices. This case study raises the question of whether the global organic model, which is highly dependent on specialized, knowledge-intensive techniques and expensive inputs, offers a true alternative for the developing country context. A locally developed model based on low-cost, local resources and disseminated through local information networks with substantial farmer participation may offer a more viable alternative. }

        abstract = {Organic farming has gained in importance in Germany during recent years.Therefore an increasing demand exists for varieties with specific adaptation to this farming system. In the present study we therefore conducted comparative field experiments with modern maize breeding materials under organic versus conventional farming conditions (ORGandCON, respectively) to estimate quantitative genetic parameters needed for developing optimal breeding strategies and to investigate the perspectives of selection for specific adaptation to ORG. Starting from two broad samples of elite germplasm, consisting of 178 flint and dent lines, respectively, fractions of 11 flint and 11 dent lines were selected based on their testcross performance under ORG. A corresponding set of lines was selected under CON. Testcross performance was evaluated in three regions of Germany and selection of superior lines was practiced across two stages in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
The specifically selected lines were crossed in a factorial manner for production of experimental interpool single-cross hybrids which were field-tested under ORG and CON in two regions in 2006. Average grain yields were about 16\% lower under ORG than under CON.Variance components and entry-mean heritability coefficients under ORG largely resembled those obtained under CON. Phenotypic correlations between ORGandCONweremoderate for grain yield and strong for grain dry matter content. No consistent estimates were obtained for the corresponding genotypic correlation for grain yield. At the first stage of testcross selection no evidence of specific adaptation to ORG or CON was observed whereas the factorial crosses tested in 2006 displayed distinct, yet non-significant, advantages when evaluated under the respective target farming system. A small top fraction of hybrids showed outstanding performance under both ORG and CON.
The chances of detecting such broadly adapted genotypes are increased if ORG test sites are included in the regular testing system.

        abstract = {Der {\"O}kologische Landbau hat in den letzten Jahren in Deutschland stetig an Bedeutung gewonnen. Die Entwicklung hierf{\"u}r geeigneter Sorten stellt daher eine wichtige Aufgabe der Pflanzenz{\"u}chtung dar. In diesem Zusammenhang ist zu {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen, ob die Zuchtziele, der Sortentyp und die Z{\"u}chtungsstrategie auf die Anforderungen der {\"o}kologischen Wirtschaftsweise abgestimmt werden m{\"u}ssen. Dazu wurde von der Universit{\"a}t Hohenheim und der KWS SAAT AG von 2004 bis 2006 bei Mais ein Forschungsprojekt durchgef{\"u}hrt, in dessen Rahmen die vorliegende Arbeit entstand. Die wichtigsten Fragestellungen hierbei waren:
(1) K{\"o}nnen durch z{\"u}chterische Selektion spezifisch an die Bedingungen des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus angepasste Sorten entwickelt werden und welche Selektionsstrategie ist hierf{\"u}r am besten geeignet?
(2) Tr{\"a}gt die Sortenstruktur zur Eignung f{\"u}r die {\"o}kologische Wirtschaftsweise bei?
(3) Besitzt aus Landrassen entwickeltes Zuchtmaterial ein erh{\"o}htes Anpassungspotential und eignet es sich deshalb besonders gut als genetische Basis f{\"u}r die Z{\"u}chtung von Sorten f{\"u}r den {\"O}kologischen Landbau?
Zur Beantwortung dieser Fragestellungen wurden Feldversuche mit modernem Elite- sowie mit Landrassenzuchtmaterial in drei Regionen Deutschlands (Einbeck?Niedersachsen, Stuttgart?Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg und Erding?Bayern) vergleichend unter {\"o}kologischen und konventionellen Anbaubedingungen durchgef{\"u}hrt.
Ausgehend von zwei breiten Stichproben modernen Elitezuchtmaterials, die aus 178 Flint- bzw. Dentlinien bestanden, wurden f{\"u}r jede Wirtschaftsweise die 11 besten Flint- und die 11 besten Dentlinien in einem zweistufigen Verfahren selektiert, um daraus im Winter 2005?2006 zwei Sets spezifisch angepasster Hybriden ({\"O}KO-Hybriden, KON-Hybriden) aufzubauen. Aus dem gleichen z{\"u}chterischen Ausgangsmaterial wurden vier im Hinblick auf Komponentenzahl (22, 44, 88) und Vermehrungsgeneration (Syn-2, Syn-3) unterschiedliche Synthetics entwickelt.
Die Selektion der f{\"u}r den Aufbau von Experimentalhybriden und Synthetics geeigneten Linien erfolgte nach deren Testkreuzungsleistung in den Jahren 2004 und 2005. Zu diesem Zweck wurden in den Jahren 2004 und 2005 jeweils vier Materials{\"a}tze gebildet, von denen jeweils zwei aus Testkreuzungen der Flint- bzw. Dentlinien bestanden. Im Jahr 2004 wurden alle Linien der beiden Ausgangsstichproben getestet, 2005 dagegen nur die im Vorjahr unter den jeweiligen Anbaubedingungen etwa 25 \% besten. Das Testen der Flintlinien erfolgte mit Denttestern und das der Dentlinien mit Flinttestern. Im ersten Versuchsjahr wurden jeweils eine Einfachkreuzung, im zweiten je zwei verschiedene Linien als Tester eingesetzt. Die Leistungspr{\"u}fungen wurden als 10{$\times$}10- bzw. 10{$\times$}8 Gitter mit zwei Wiederholungen in allen drei Regionen angelegt. In einer abschlie{\ss}enden Leistungspr{\"u}fung 2006 wurden die beiden Sets spezifisch entwickelter Hybriden ({\"O}KOHybriden, KON-Hybriden) zusammen mit den vier Synthetics getestet.
Zwei weitere Feldversuche in den Jahren 2005 und 2006 dienten der Untersuchung des nat{\"u}rlichen Anpassungspotentials von aus Landrassen entwickeltem Zuchtmaterial an die {\"o}kologische Wirtschaftsweise. Anhand einer Testkreuzungsserie mit Linien, die mittels invivo-Haploidentechnik aus Landrassen entwickelt worden waren, sollten 2005 erste Kombinationsf{\"a}higkeitsdaten gewonnen werden. In einem abschlie{\ss}enden Versuch 2006 wurde die Testkreuzungsleistung von Linien, die aus den Populationssorten (Landrassen) ?Gelber Badischer Landmais? und ?Schindelmeiser? entwickelt worden waren, mit derjenigen von veralteten und modernen Elite-Linien verglichen. Die Versuche wurden in beiden Jahren in allen drei Regionen als 10{$\times$}10 Gitter angelegt.
Anhand der 2006 gepr{\"u}ften Sets spezifisch entwickelter Hybriden ({\"O}KO-Hybriden, KONHybriden) konnte gezeigt werden, dass durch gezielte Selektion eine Anpassung an die {\"o}kologische Wirtschaftsweise erreicht werden kann. Bei {\"o}kologischer Wirtschaftsweise erreichten die {\"O}KO-Hybriden einen um durchschnittlich 2,2 \% h{\"o}heren Kornertrag als die KON-Hybriden. Umgekehrt waren die KON-Hybriden den {\"O}KO-Hybriden unter konventionellen Anbaubedingungen um durchschnittlich 1,6 \% {\"u}berlegen.
Im Hinblick auf die Wahl der optimalen Selektionsstrategie l{\"a}sst sich anhand der vorliegenden quantitativ-genetischen Parameter keine abschlie{\ss}ende Aussage treffen. Die f{\"u}r die {\"o}kologische Wirtschaftsweise ermittelten Varianzkomponenten- und Heritabilit{\"a}tssch{\"a}tzwerte waren den unter konventionellen Bedingungen {\"a}hnlich. Die gesch{\"a}tzten ph{\"a}notypischen Korrelationen zwischen {\"o}kologischer und konventioneller Wirtschaftsweise waren m{\"a}{\ss}ig straff f{\"u}r den Kornertrag und straff f{\"u}r den Korn-TSGehalt.
F{\"u}r die entsprechenden genotypischen Korrelationskoeffizienten ergaben sich keine konsistenten Sch{\"a}tzwerte.
Wie aufgrund ihrer Struktur erwartet, zeigten die neu entwickelten Populationssorten (Synthetics) eine {\"u}berdurchschnittliche Anpassung an die {\"o}kologische Wirtschaftsweise.
Der Ertragsr{\"u}ckgang von konventioneller zu {\"o}kologischer Wirtschaftsweise betrug hier durchschnittlich nur 8 \%, hingegen 15 \% f{\"u}r die Vergleichshybriden. Allerdings war die Ertragsf{\"a}higkeit der Synthetics deutlich (ca. 23 \%) geringer als die der Hybriden. Mittels DH-Technik aus den Landrassen ?Gelber Badischer Landmais? und ?Schindelmeiser? entwickelte Linien lagen in der Testkreuzungsleistung bei 73 bzw. 79 \% der Leistung moderner Elitesorten. Bezogen auf die Leistung von Linien aus der Anfangsphase der Hybridz{\"u}chtung (First-Cycle-Linien) erzielten die aus Landrassen entwickelten DH-Linien eine um durchschnittlich 4 \% bessere Testkreuzungsleistung bei {\"o}kologischer im Vergleich zu konventioneller Wirtschaftsweise. Diese Ergebnisse best{\"a}tigten, dass aus Landrassen entwickeltes Zuchtmaterial eine wertvolle genetische Ressource f{\"u}r die Z{\"u}chtung von {\"O}ko Sorten darstellt. Die aus den Landrassen ?Gelber Badischer Landmais? und ?Schindelmeiser? entwickelten Linien befanden sich in der Testkreuzungsleistung auf einem {\"a}hnlichen Ertragsniveau wie die ber{\"u}hmte First-Cycle-Linie ?F2?, die auf die Franz{\"o}sische Population ?Lacaune? zur{\"u}ckgeht. Die Landrassen ?Gelber Badischer Landmais? und ?Schindelmeiser? bieten somit {\"a}hnlich gute Nutzungsperspektiven wie ?Lacaune?. Au{\ss}erdem konnte gezeigt werden, dass mit der DHTechnik ein Werkzeug zur Verf{\"u}gung steht, das es erlaubt, Landrassen effektiv als genetische Ressource f{\"u}r die Pflanzenz{\"u}chtung einzusetzen.}

But piglets weaned in such a period are often characterized by inferior performance and health status. It is the aim of the present study to examine whether a prolonged suckling period of 63 days results in better performance and health status of the piglets. Therefore 36 sows were divided into 2 groups of 18 sows each as a control group with 42 days suckling period and a test group with 63 days suckling period. The rearing period for both the control group and the test group ended on day 77 p.n., which was also the end of the piglets? data collection period. Three farrowing cycles with 108 litters were recorded. The extended suckling period resulted in an improved growth rate and in a reduced number of medically treated piglets and did not negatively affect the body condition and teats of the sows. Hence a prolongation of the suckling period compared to the minimum requirement of the EEC Regulation 2092?91 seems to be advisable.}

However, they did not (a) investigate seasonal differences, (b) include non-organic, lowinput systems or (c) compare individual carotenoids, stereoisomers of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-tocopherol or isomers of conjugated linoleic acid. This survey-based study compares milk from three production systems: (i) high-input, conventional (10 farms); (ii) low-input, organic (10 farms); and (iii) low-input non-organic (5 farms). Samples were taken during the outdoor grazing (78 samples) and indoor periods (31 samples).
RESULTS: During the outdoor grazing period, on average, milk from the low-input systems had lower saturated FAs, but higher mono- and polyunsaturated FA concentrations compared with milk from the high-input system.
Milk from both the low-input organic and non-organic systems had significantly higher concentrations of nutritionally desirable FAs and antioxidants ? conjugated linoleic (60\% and 99\%, respectively) and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-linolenic (39\% and 31\%, respectively) acids, {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-tocopherol (33\% and 50\%, respectively) and carotenoids (33\% and 80\%, respectively) ? compared with milk from the high-input system. Milk composition differed significantly between the two low-input systems during the second half of the grazing period only; withmilk from non-organic cows being higher in antioxidants, and conjugated linoleic acid, and that from organic cows in {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-linolenic acid. In contrast, few significant differences in composition were detected between high-input and low-input organic systems when cows were housed.
CONCLUSIONS: Milk composition is affected by production systems by mechanisms likely to be linked to the stage and length of the grazing period, and diet composition, which will influence subsequent processing, and sensory and potential nutritional qualities of the milk.

The energy efficiency in terms of output:input ratios were about 190:1 in the managed beech forest and 6:1 in the managed grassland. This is discussed in relation to nitrogen cycling, carbon storage and energy efficiency of biomass production. }

However, the absence of local origin labels is significantly affecting the choice of conventional farmers who do not convert to organic farming.}

The area (elevation 20 m), located in Bologna province, Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), is characterised by mean annual temperature 13.1 ?C and rainfall around 750 mm.
In the horizon 0-15 cm of the row an increase of about 14 tons ha-1 of TOC has been calculated after 18-years of cultivation and amendment compared to the control soil, which had received just mineral fertilisation.  A significant increase of TOC (about 6.3 tons ha-1) was also measured in the top layer (0-15 cm) in the grassed inter-row, where this C sink is exclusively due to the cover crop.  A survey of the role of organic vs. conventional farming on soil C sink?source is started in 2007 in 8 typical organic orchard farms located in Emilia-Romagna Region and it is still running.

The study is organized in two sections. The first part, after a brief literature review of the most recent statistical methodologies applied to identify the two similar groups of farms, presents some key economic variables (production, costs and revenues) and the most widely-used structural, economic and balance sheet indexes.
The second part describes findings from a case study on the Italian fruit-growing sector.
A non-parametric input-oriented frontier analysis (Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA)was used to evaluate which technique makes better use of their disposable productive inputs. Findings show that organic farmers can (partially) overcome the productivity gap (with respect to conventional ones) by more efficient use of their inputs (with respect to their own frontier).}

It is difficult to treat: recurrence rate is high and no single universally effective treatment for ES is known. Viscum album extracts (VAE) are used as adjunct in the treatment of some human cancers without known side effects.
Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the long-term therapy with VAE (Iscador? P) is effective in Equine Sarcoids as a single treatment or as an adjunct treatment to selective surgical excision.
Material and methods: Of 53 horses with ES, 42 were treated solely with VAE as monotherapy and 11 were treated after selective excision of ES. Horses were randomly assigned to the treatment group (VAE; n=32) or control group (Placebo; n=21). The horses received rising concentrations of Iscador? P extract from 0.1 mg per ml to 20 mg per ml or physiological NaCl solution 3 times a week over 105 days s.c. Number, localization, size and type of the ES were documented over 12 months. Horses were grouped in 3 classes: individuals with {\ensuremath{<}}3 ES, 3 to 9 ES and {\ensuremath{>}}9ES. Statistical analysis of effects was divided in horse level and sarcoid level analysis. In horse level analysis effects were assessed considering the development of all 3
tumours found in the horse. Outcome of this analysis was cure, improvement (decrease of tumour size by 50\% or more in at least half of the tumours), unchanged status or deterioration, respectively. Sarcoid level assessment included analysis of 1 to 7 clinically relevant sarcoids per horse comparing parameters of size and quality of single tumours in both treatment groups. All analyses were performed using statistical package STATA ver.9.2. Significance level was set at p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05.
Results: Horse level: In the VAE group, 13 horses (40.6\%) showed an improvement. Of these, 9 patients showed complete remission (28.1\%). In the control group only 3 cases (14\%), all showing complete remission, were classified as improved. Significantly better results were observed after VAE treatment in horses with 3 to 9 ES compared to those with {\ensuremath{<}}3 ES or {\ensuremath{>}}9 ES. Sarcoid level: After one year observation time in the VAE group 27 ES showed complete remission (37.5\%) and there was an improvement in 48 (66.7\%) ES. In contrast, in the control group 9 ES with complete remission (13.2\%; n.s.) and 17 ES (39.5\%; p=0.005) with improvement were found. The only side effects observed after VAE were slight oedema at the injection site in 5 of 32 cases, which disappeared spontaneously within two to three days.
Conclusions: VAE (Iscador? P) represent a safe and effective treatment for ES, particularly in cases with multiple sarcoids.}

        abstract = {The question of whether farmers, and organic farmers in particular, should be rewarded for sequestering C in soils is controversial. A review of the literature on long term experiments comparing organic and conventional systems, demonstrates that soils under organic management tend to have higher soil organic carbon (SOC) contents than conventionally managed soils. But the logistics of designing a system that compensates individual farmers for this ecosystem service are challenging. Agreements would have to be reached on the baseline system used for calculation of relative gains in SOC, values for emissions of other GHGs from soils (e.g. methane and nitrous oxide), the direct and indirect CO2 emissions associated with energy use and crop production inputs in the C sequestering system, and emissions associated with sources of SOC imported onto the farm.  Alternatively, the evidence for generally higher SOC under organic management could justify an additional payment, for example under the UK Government?s Organic Entry Level Scheme. }

Here emergy evaluation is applied in order to assess sustainability of crop production exemplified by winter wheat. Emergy evaluation takes into account all inputs involved in a production system (i.e. renewable and non-renewable, local and imported) and transforms them into a common measure of direct and indirect solar energy requirement. The evaluation of winter wheat production is conducted by comparing conventional and organic management on two soil types using Danish reference conditions. The resource use efficiency of wheat production per kg biomass is higher using conventional management practices. This is due to high yield based on large use of non-renewable resources. The environmental loading ratio from organic management practices is about a third of the conventional implying that the organic management can be considered more sustainable. }

This poses problems due to difficulty in obtaining organic wax, passage of residues from old wax to new residue-free foundations and the risk of contamination of foundations in the wax transforming firms. To monitor the residue levels of Italian beeswax, samples produced between 1990 and 2006 were analysed for residues of most commonly used acaricides. The samples analysed for the two most commonly used active ingredients, coumaphos and fluvalinate, were classified according to the production method (organic, conventional or converting) and according to the kind of wax (melted or foundation). For all the considered a.i. the average levels of residues in all kinds of samples (organic and conventional) grouped by year, decreased during the considered time period. Classification according to production method showed that organic beekeeping practices have definitely reduced levels of residues, although these persist in wax for a long time. Average levels of acaricide residues in organic melted cap beeswax were used by most Italian Control Bodies for fixing thresholds levels for use of wax in organic beekeeping (200ppb for coumaphos and 100ppb for fluvalinate).}

As the salts tested may be approvable for organic farming, the trial results are also of
value for the development of scab an mildew control strategies for organic fruit growing. As
new fungicides are mainly unisite action fungicides, the problem of fungicide resistance
development is becoming more important every year. Combining chemical fungicides,
which is the best anti-resistance strategy, is not always possible or recommended in the
case when the number of available chemical fungicides are limited or a reduction in
fungicide use is asked for. Therefore the use of salts as an anti-resistance strategy was
looked upon. The salts evaluated were K(HCO3), KH2PO3, KHPO4 and K2SiO3. When
using these salts as an anti-resistance strategy the efficacy obtained when spraying the
compounds alone was often to low to be used in rotation with chemical fungicides. Only
with K(HCO3)2 a good efficacy can be observed in some years. The variation in efficacy
with K(HCO3)2 observed is higher for powdery mildew. K(HCO3)2 can be considered as a
ideal product for scab control in organic orchards at moments of low infection risk.}

In the high-technology greenhouses a high production level is realized but nitrogen balances of this production system have been questioned. In order to document and improve the nitrogen balance, the production of seven greenhouses was monitored and soils were repeatedly analysed. The model ?Bemestingsrichtlijn biologische kasteelten? (Fertilization Guide Organic Greenhouse Production) has been developed to simulate nitrogen availability and to fine-tune manure applications to crop demand. In the course of four years the overall nitrogen surpluses decreased sharply, but due to the observational character of the research no statistical analyses can be made. Part of the high surpluses in the first years can be explained by initial investments in soil organic matter. Calculation of the dynamic balance gives more possibilities to fine-tune farmers? fertilization strategies. Growers that followed the model-based advise for manure application, realized a substantial reduction of nitrogen surpluses.}

        abstract = {In 2007 heeft het Louis Bolk Instituut onderzoek gedaan naar de eigenschappen van 12 hulpmeststoffen die gebruikt kunnen worden in de biologische landbouw: verenmeel, vinasse (restproduct uit de verwerking van suikerbieten),protamylasse (restproduct uit de winning van aardappelzetmeel), Maltaflor (restproduct op basis van moutkiemen van gerst en vinasse), ricinusschroot (restproduct uit de winning van wonderolie uit de plant Ricinus communis), luzernebrok, koolzaadschroot, Condit (restproduct op basis van melkwei op een drager van zaagsel en tarwestro, met toevoeging van zeoliet), twee kippenmesten, een digestaat op basis van co-vergisting van rundveemest met energiema{\"i}s en kuilgras, en een digestaat op basis van puur energiema{\"i}s. De meststoffen zijn toegepast in een bemestingsexperiment in zomertarwe (Lavett) op zeeklei met een organische stofgehalte van 4,6\%. De tarwe is bemest met een najaarsgift van 10 ton vaste rundermest. De hulpmeststoffen zijn vlak na uitstoeling van de tarwe toegediend, met een gift van gemiddeld 138 kg N?ha. De proef is aangelegd in een compleet gerandomiseerde blokkenproef met 4 herhalingen, na het inzaaien van de tarwe. Elk veld is daarna in twee{\"e}n gesplitst, waarbij de helft van het veld met tarwe begroeid was, en de andere helft door branden en schoffelen braak werd gehouden.
De weersomstandigheden zijn dit jaar erg extreem geweest, met een zeer droge (12 weken) en warme periode vroeg in het voorjaar. Dit heeft gezorgd voor een slechte kieming en uitstoeling van de tarwe. Daarnaast was de onkruiddruk met het wortelonkruid Akkermelkdistel in het proefveld zeer hoog. De opbrengsten waren laag; vari{\"e}rend van 1,4 ton?ha (koolzaadschroot) tot 3,9 ton?ha (controle zonder hulpmeststoffen). De hoogste opbrengsten in de velden zonder hulpmeststoffen werden ook gevonden in een onafhankelijk experiment met zomertarwe op hetzelfde bedrijf. De veel hogere onkruiddruk in de bemeste percelen kan een mogelijke verklaring geven voor de verschillen in opbrengst.

Er zijn significante verschillen gevonden in kwaliteit van de tarwe tussen de verschillende meststoffen, maar door de extreme weersomstandigheden, kunnen hier geen harde conclusies uit getrokken worden. De eiwitgehalten van de tarwe liepen uiteen van 10,4\% (controle) tot 14,0\% (luzernebrok). Zeleny-sedimentatiewaarden liepen uiteen van 39 (digestaat uit co-vergisting) tot 53 ml (luzenebrok). De valgetallen van de tarwe waren allemaal hoog, tussen 343 (digestaat uit co-vergisting) en 400 (verenmeel). De hectoliter gewichten waren laag, vari{\"e}rend van 69 (vinasse) tot 76 (zowel in de controle als in de behandeling met Condit). Besmettingsniveaus met Fusarium liepen uiteen van 9\% (controle) tot 18\% (vinasse).
Het gehalte aan nitraat in de bodem is op 4 momenten tijdens de teelt bepaald, zowel in de met tarwe begroeide als in de braak percelen. In de met tarwe begroeide veldjes werden de stikstofgehalten, ondanks de hoge giften, bij de laatste twee metingen zo laag, dat er geen significante verschillen tussen de behandelingen waren. In de braak percelen traden wel significante verschillen in nitraat gehalten op tussen de verschillende meststoffen. Hieruit valt af te leiden dat met name uit vinasse, protamylasse en condit, veel stikstof snel beschikbaar komt. Deze worden gevolgd door verenmeel, ricinusschroot en digestaat uit co-vergisting. Voor een meer gestage stikstoflevering door het seizoen lijken met name luzernebrok, koolzaad en Maltaflor geschikt. Daarbij kan de stikstoflevering wellicht versneld worden door inwerken van de korrels, waardoor deze sneller uit elkaar vallen. De kippenmesten en digestaten bevatten net zoals vinasse veel N-mineraal in het product, maar hier kan mogelijk ook veel verloren gaan naar de atmosfeer. Na 6 weken hadden de kippenmesten, digestaten en condit juist de laagste gehaltes aan beschikbaar stikstof in de bodem. Bij protamylasse, digestaat uit co-vergisting, condit en verse kippenmest was na 6 weken bovendien een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid stikstof verdwenen ten opzichte van de controle behandeling.}

? Algemene maatregelen zijn het gebruik van compost of andere organische toevoegingen, en de introductie van wisselgewassen.

Ziektewerendheid is een weer nauwere invulling van het begrip bodemkwaliteit en heeft uitsluitend betrekking op het vermogen van gronden om, ondanks de aanwezigheid van pathogenen, de expressie van de pathogeen in het gewas laag te houden. Negen mechanismen waarop de ziektewerendheid gebaseerd kan zijn worden beschreven.

Het feitelijk vaststellen (meten) van ziektewerendheid gebeurt in biotoetsen met specifieke plant-pathogeen combinaties. Dat is duur en tijdrovend. Daarom wordt gezocht naar afgeleide indicatoren en parameters. Resultaten uit de literatuur worden gepresenteerd.
Uiteindelijk is het van belang of telers de ziektewerendheid daadwerkelijk kunnen sturen door teeltmaatregelen. Vijf (groepen van) teeltmaatregelen worden besproken.

Door alleen te spitten en niet daarna nog te frezen werd de structuur van het bodemprofiel over het geheel verbeterd, afgemeten aan de parameters indringingsweerstand, waterinfiltratie en bulkdichtheid. De opbrengst nam substantieel toe. Het effect op de structuur was echter tijdelijk van aard: kort na de grondbewerking kon het gemeten worden (april ? mei), maar in oktober was een verschil niet meer meetbaar.
De vervanging van compost door stalmest, gecombineerd met een halvering van de basisbemesting stikstof uit hulpmeststoffen gaf geen opbrengstreductie terwijl de hoeveelheid toegediende en beschikbare stikstof aanzienlijk verlaagd was. Of dit komt door de verbeterde bodemkwaliteit of door een overmaakt stikstof in de standaard werkwijze kan op basis van deze bevindingen niet uitgemaakt worden.
Het uitzetten van grauwe wormen is succesvoller dan het uitzetten van rode wormen. Hierdoor, en gezien het verschil in ecologische functie van die twee typen wormen mag van het uitzetten van rode wormen weinig effect verwacht worden op de bodemstructuur.}

in spring or in autumn at different doses, before CM pupation; in 2007 the EPN treatment
was applied only in autumn at 1.5 x 109 I.J. ha ?1. Every year it was distributed by means of
a conventional mist blower. The larval mortality was assessed directly on sentinel larvae in
card boards on the trunks and indirectly on the eggs laid by the females of the first CM
generation in spring. Moreover, each year, a trial was performed applying only S.
carpocapsae on sentinel larvae with the aim of testing this nematode at suitable
temperatures but at different water volumes.

in two orchards in north-western Switzerland in summer 2006. Both products were applied
at a concentration of 5.75x104 CFU ? ml. With four applications at seven day intervals the
whole flight period of R. cerasi was fully covered. During this period (5th June ? 6th July)
the temperature averaged 19.2?C, total precipitation was 60 mm. Under these conditions
Naturalis-L significantly reduced the number of damaged fruit (efficacy: 69-74\%), whereas
damage was not significantly reduced with PreFeRal?WG (efficacy: 27\%). Fungus
infested flies were found on the yellow sticky traps proving that the myco-insecticides
worked as predicted.
Climatic conditions were different in 2007: temperature averaged 15.9?C (16th May ? 4th
July), total precipitation was 281 mm. In 2007 only Naturalis-L was tested: with five
applications an efficacy of 73\% and 78\% was obtained on the cherry varieties Langstieler
and Dolleseppler, respectively. However, for the latest ripening and most infested variety
Schauenburger only an efficacy of 18\% was observed. In these cherries a high number of
young larvae were found indicating that the efficacy was low at the end of the treatment
period. In conclusion a control of R. cerasi with myco-insecticides seems possible.
However, application regime still has to be improved and should not only be adapted to the
flight period of R. cerasi, but also to the cherry varieties.}

A qualitative survey, combining interviews and focus groups, showed the high diversity of representations and the interactions linked to those two concepts and their combinations for the consumers.  If those two labels are used by food chain stakeholders as complementary, they have been differently perceived by consumers: more, some consumers perceived some contradictions between them. We can distinguish six different profiles of consumers on the basis of perceived specific interactions: from the total synergy to the contradiction between ?organic agriculture ?and ?fair trade?.  }

problems for the farmers. The production of apple under organic techniques in Asturias is

the first promising results of these experiments. With different concentrations of both

2007. There were positive effects on the vegetative growth of the trees and on the quality
of apples. In the spring 2007 we initiated new experiments with other cultivars (?Durona de

Two types of farmers were identified: 1-Rural, with origins and life trajectories in the rural area and 2-Neorural, with urban area background having migrated to the rural milieu. Farmers who sell directly to consumers use more than 3 marketing channels, their production systems are diversified (? than 20 products), management is complex and the farm is versatile (inn, restaurant, pick-and-pay, rural tourism) and producer?consumer relationship is bigger. Integrated farmers (indirect sales) have only one sales channel. Farmers follow production plans from the buying companies and the output is marketed through supermarket chains. Farming systems are simple (- than 5 products) and relationship with consumers is insignificant. Events such as visit to organic farms, advanced buying, producer?consumer direct credit and organic farming courses or field days, have strengthened producer?consumer relationship and provided consumer support to an organic farms network.}

This raises the issue of whether group policy capacities can be developed. While group scholars have long talked of group capacity, this has largely amounted to compiling a ?shopping list? of possible capacities general to all groups. There has not been much attention to variations in capacity among groups, or with the development of capacity by a single group over time. This paper takes a tentative step towards filling this gap.
In pursuing this general line of inquiry we argue that (i) initial ?selection? of group type shapes scope of capacity development, (ii) groups seek to adapt capacity to changing policy contexts, and (iii) adaptive efforts are shaped by the ?legacy? of the originating type ? change is bounded unless the group engages in ?radical? organisational changes (e.g. redefinition of entire purpose). This general argument is fleshed out by comparing and contrasting the evolution of the key organic interest groups in both the UK and Denmark.}

Monitoring results from a total of 25 farms between 2004 till 2007 are presented. Regression analysis indicates a negative effect of maize silage and positive effects of feeding fresh grass, grass pellets, red clover and addition of oil on CLA levels in milk fat. Results with omega-3 are similar, but omega-3 levels in milk fat seem less related to feed characteristics: the model with feed composition, seasonal effects and farm effects as major parameters, explains a smaller part of the variation, while farm influence is much larger with omega-3 compared to CLA. 
Farm influence might be caused by genetic differences and constant factors influencing roughage quality. Genetic influences are likely but could not be investigated as milk samples were not taken from individual cows. The influence of grass quality is suggested by the large effect of sampling date found in this study. Moreover, some high residual values and statistical estimates for individual farms seem often related to silage quality, botanically rich pastures and red clover feeding.

Intensive F{\"u}tterung wirkt sich in der Umweltwirkungskategorie Treibhauseffekt positiv aus, auf Ackerbaustandorten auch im Bereich Energieverbrauch. Risiken bestehen bez{\"u}glich der regionalen und lokalen Umweltwirkungskategorien. Auf Ackerbaustandorten ist intensive F{\"u}tterung in {\"o}kologisch vertretbarer Weise m{\"o}glich, wenn das erhebliche Stickstoff-Emissionsrisiko minimiert werden kann.

Treatments were carried out at callusing, rooting and callusing?rooting. Effects on the host-plant morpho-physiological characteristics were observed and depended on the type and timing of Trichoderma application. Treatment at rooting was the most effective whilst application at callusing and combination of treatments gave controversial results. The most noticeable effect of application of Trichoderma was an increase of quantitative-qualitative characteristics of the root system, with a consistent development of root hairs. Compared to untreated plants the percentage of certifiable plants treated at rooting was higher. }

        abstract = {The overall objective of the project CorePig is to promote animal health and welfare in organic pig herds in Europe. The variation in pig health between organic herds is likely to be caused by different management routines in the herds. To improve animal welfare it is therefore important to investigate the correlation between management and parasite?disease occurrence, and based on this, to develop a disease management tool applicable on farm. This will be achieved by carrying out the following three components:
?	To conduct an international knowledge synthesis for identifying needs for future research into disease and parasite prevention in organic pig production
?	To estimate risk factors for selected diseases and parasites in pigs in European organic herds by conducting an epidemiological survey in European organic pig herds.  
?	To develop and evaluate a HACCP based management and surveillance system for organic pig herds that will enable the organic pig farmer to prevent selected pig diseases and welfare problems by monitoring and controlling the risk factors
The results obtained in this study will benefit animal health and welfare of pigs in organic production systems, as well as the productivity in these herds. Knowledge of risk factors for disease in organic pigs will facilitate efforts to improve animal health in organic pig production, and organic pig producers will benefit from improved animal welfare on-farm by applying an efficient and feasible disease management tool. This will assist in promoting more sustainable farming systems and supporting the rural economy with special relevance to small farmers. The expected improvement in animal welfare in organic pig production is expected to enhance consumer interest in organic pork, and consequently lead to an increased market share of organic meat for the benefit of the economy in organic pig production.
Furthermore, the project aims to identify relevant research needs related to parasite and disease management in organic pig production. This can be applied to target future research to the actual problems experienced in commercial organic production.}

        abstract = {Soil fertility management is a major concern in organic farming. According to the EEC Regulation 2092?91, soil fertility must be maintained and?or increased by legumes cultivation. Native Mediterranean legumes ecotypes are more persistent than commercial varieties but their use in catch crop sequences is still limited. The N2-fixing legumes crops as a local resource can be considered as an alternative to improve nitrogen nutrition and to increase crop yields. This study aimed to investigate the agronomic performance of seven annual self-reseeding legumes and the short?term effect of nitrogen supply on the subsequent crops. Results are presented from field experiment on sandy-clay soil, pH 8.1 and 1.6\% of organic matter, in the south of Italy, where the self-reseeding legumes were evaluated during two cropping cycles for their adaptability and integration into Mediterranean cropping systems. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF)performance was also measured using 15N isotopic dilution method.

For the first cropping cycle, Trifolium spp. performed better than Medicago spp. and of the seven tested species, five were more suitable to the site conditions. These species could be used for managing soil fertility and enhancing biodiversity in orchards. Trifolium angustifolium and Medicago polymorpha were the most performing species. They fixed 132 and 90 kg N ha-1 of BNF, produced 1976 and 731 kg ha-1 of seeds and 8.7 and 5.5 t ha-1 of dry biomass (DM) respectively. In contrast, Medicago radiata and M. rigidula were the least performing species. 

For the second cropping cycle, their self-establishment capacity and their effect as green manure on two subsequent crops of zucchini and lettuce were investigated. Results showed again that Trifolium spp. performed better than Medicago. Except for M. radiata and M. rigidula, regenerated species appear to sustain optimum level of soil-available nitrogen and induced positive effects on both zucchini and lettuce growth parameters. Zucchini and lettuce marketable yield significantly increased influenced by the preceding legumes, on average 53\% and 24\% respectively over the control. T. angustifolium was again the best performing and promising species producing the highest DM (7.74 t ha-1) and fixing nitrogen (146.7 kg N ha-1) symbiotically. It induced the best effect on all zucchini and lettuce parameters including crop yield (42.66 and 48 t ha-1 respectively). In contrast, M. polymorpha was less performing (0.3 t ha-1 of DM and 11.5 kg ha-1 of BNF). Given the overall performance of all species, it was determined that T. angustifolium had the greatest potential for further development in this environment.

Lack of synchrony between mineralization of organic N sources and plant N requirements is causing many growers to use different techniques to overcome this problem. One of these techniques is the application of soluble water extracts of different farm residues and plants. A field study was conducted to study the crop uptake of applied 15N-labeled alfalfa and clover extracts as compared to the N uptake from15N-glycine and three levels of 15N-(NH4)2SO4. The results show that total N accumulation in the field crops, squash and lettuce, was primarily affected by the amount of added N (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) and not by the form in which the N was applied (P{\ensuremath{>}}0.05). The utilization efficiencies of N (pNdff) from plant extracts and glycine increased (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) gradually from 10, 20, to 30 days after application in contrast to (NH4)2SO4 which peaked in utilization efficiencies of 56\% around 20 days after application. The pNdff reached 60\%, 40\% and 36\% of the applied glycine, alfalfa and clover extracts, respectively in lettuce. Squash showed the same pattern during at 10, 20 and 30 days however the proportion of N derived from most of the treatments was higher in squash than in lettuce (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). These results indicate that plant extracts of clover and alfalfa can be used as efficient N fertilisers in low-external-input agroecosystems. }

Topsoil samples were collected from four arable sandy loam soils found as two pairs (FP1 and FP2) of neighbouring fields. One of the fields in FP2 had been grown for decades with annual cash crops without application of organic manures, while the other three fields had been managed with diversified crop rotations and manure dressings. Aggregates were segregated from the bulk soil by promoting brittle failure. The samples of soil structural units were fractionated to 4-8 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 0.063-0.25 mm aggregates during a process of air-drying with minimum energy input (e.g. short sieving times). We measured microbial biomass, ergosterol, clay dispersibility, hot-water extractable carbohydrates, and hyphal length. Generally, all four soils showed no significant differences among aggregate size classes in the content of microbial biomass, hot-water extractable carbohydrates and hyphal length. The FP2 soil grown with annual cash crops had significantly lower values for all soil attributes than its neighbouring soil, while a more complex pattern was observed for the FP1 soils. Our results do not indicate scaling according to aggregate size of the binding and bonding mechanisms studied. Results from the three fields with diversified crop rotations indicate satisfactory levels of bonding and binding agents for creation of stable aggregates. Exhaustion of soil organic matter as found in the cash crop system seems to change the way that clay particles interact with the biotic agents in aggregation.}

I en av tre behandlingar av vallen togs tv{\ra} sk{\"o}rdar, innan vallen br{\"o}ts efter andrask{\"o}rden. I ett annat led togs f{\"o}rsta sk{\"o}rden tillvara, medan {\ra}terv{\"a}xten pl{\"o}jdes ned vid tidpunkten f{\"o}r andrask{\"o}rden. I den tredje behandlingen utnyttjades vallen helt f{\"o}r gr{\"o}ng{\"o}dsling, med en putsning vid tiden f{\"o}r f{\"o}rsta vallsk{\"o}rden. Efter vallbrottet s{\ra}ddes h{\"o}straps. Vidare unders{\"o}ktes i vilken utstr{\"a}ckning flytg{\"o}dseltillf{\"o}rsel till h{\"o}strapsen p{\ra} v{\ra}ren f{\"o}rb{\"a}ttrade dess kv{\"a}vef{\"o}rs{\"o}rjning och avkastning. Efterverkan av vallen och h{\"o}strapsen studerades efter h{\"o}straps{\ra}ret, dels i h{\"o}stvete (med relativt tidig pl{\"o}jning efter rapssk{\"o}rden) och dels i v{\ra}rvete, med och utan stubbearbetning efter rapssk{\"o}rden samt med och utan f{\ra}nggr{\"o}da (r{\"o}dkl{\"o}ver?engelskt rajgr{\"a}s) som s{\ra}tts in i h{\"o}strapsen. I de led d{\"a}r v{\ra}rvete skulle s{\ra}s pl{\"o}jdes marken p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten eller v{\ra}ren d{\"a}refter. 

I de led d{\"a}r tv{\ra} sk{\"o}rdar togs av kl{\"o}vergr{\"a}svallarna f{\"o}rdes i medeltal drygt 160 kg N?ha bort med den sk{\"o}rdade gr{\"o}nmassan, och endast stubb inneh{\ra}llande n{\"a}rmare 20 kg N?ha brukades ned vid vallbrottet. D{\"a}r f{\"o}rstask{\"o}rden togs tillvara bortf{\"o}rdes med denna drygt 80 kg N?ha, och n{\"a}rmare 80 kg N?ha i gr{\"o}nmassa samt kv{\"a}ve i stubb pl{\"o}jdes ned i samband med vallbrottet. I det rena gr{\"o}ng{\"o}dslingsledet fastst{\"a}lldes en total kv{\"a}veproduktion p{\ra} ca 300 kg N?ha i form av avslaget v{\"a}xtmaterial och stubb, som l{\"a}mnades kvar p{\ra} marken fram till pl{\"o}jningen av vallen.

Den st{\"o}rre anhopningen av mineraliserat kv{\"a}ve i marken till f{\"o}ljd av vallbrottet togs v{\"a}l tillvara av den s{\ra}dda h{\"o}strapsen, d{\"a}r denna utvecklades bra (med ett N-upptag i blasten p{\ra} i medel-tal 47 kg N?ha p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten). I totalt sett fyra f{\"o}rs{\"o}k (ut{\"o}ver de fem n{\"a}mnda), d{\"a}r det var f{\"o}r torrt f{\"o}r att rapsfr{\"o}et skulle gro v{\"a}l, f{\"o}rblev emellertid det mineraliserade kv{\"a}vet outnyttjat och m{\"a}ngden mineralkv{\"a}ve (min-N) inom 0-90 cm markdjup p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten {\"o}kade fr{\ra}n i medeltal 20 kg N?ha till ca 90 kg N?ha, vilket var n{\"a}stan dubbelt s{\ra} mycket  som p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten i f{\"o}rs{\"o}ken med v{\"a}l etablerad h{\"o}straps. Torkans verkan blev s{\"a}rskilt p{\ra}taglig, genom att vallen tidigare t{\"o}mt marken p{\ra} vatten. Slutsatsen av detta {\"a}r, att man b{\"o}r ta den andra vallsk{\"o}rden och bryta vallen s{\ra} tidigt som m{\"o}jligt, s{\ra} att det blir st{\"o}rre chans att nederb{\"o}rd hinner fukta upp jorden inf{\"o}r h{\"o}strapss{\ra}dden. 

Efterverkan av vallen m{\"o}jliggjorde en fr{\"o}sk{\"o}rd av h{\"o}strapsen p{\ra} i medeltal 1720 kg ts?ha. De olika vallbehandlingarna (ett led med tv{\ra} b{\"a}rgade vallsk{\"o}rdar, ett led med en b{\"a}rgad sk{\"o}rd ? andra sk{\"o}rd utnyttjad som gr{\"o}ng{\"o}dsling och ett tredje led med gr{\"o}ng{\"o}dslingsvall som putsats en g{\ra}ng) hade mot f{\"o}rmodan ingen tydlig inverkan vare sig p{\ra} h{\"o}strapsens avkastning eller p{\ra} min-N p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten efter vallbrottet, under v{\ra}ren d{\"a}rp{\ra} eller vid sk{\"o}rden av h{\"o}strapsen. F{\"o}rklaringar kan vara ammoniakavg{\ra}ng vid putsningen av vallen, N-utlakning efter mineralisering av kv{\"a}ve i det nedpl{\"o}jda vallmaterialet och?eller att kv{\"a}ve h{\"a}rstammande fr{\ra}n vallens rotsystem {\"a}r en viktig komponent i dess N-efterverkan. Den n{\"o}tflytg{\"o}dsel som tillf{\"o}rdes p{\ra} v{\ra}ren till rapsen (i medeltal 76 kg N?ha som ammoniumkv{\"a}ve) hade ganska liten sk{\"o}rdestegrande verkan, men sk{\"o}rden blev {\"a}nd{\ra} signifikant st{\"o}rre {\"a}n i og{\"o}dslade led, i medeltal 300 kg rapsfr{\"o} per ha mer. Flytg{\"o}dseln {\"o}kade h{\"o}strapsens N-upptag med 21 kg N?ha, vilket motsvarade 28 \% av ammoniumkv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet. Eftersom det inte alltid {\"a}r farbart tidigt p{\ra} v{\ra}ren med tunga traktorekipage utrustade med flytg{\"o}dselspridare, tvingas man ofta sprida lite v{\"a}l sent i f{\"o}rh{\ra}llande med rapsens tillv{\"a}xtrytm, vilket f{\"o}rutom ammoniakavdunstning och denitrifikation av kv{\"a}ve kan vara en orsak till den l{\ra}ga mersk{\"o}rden. 

F{\ra}nggr{\"o}dan (r{\"o}dkl{\"o}ver?rajgr{\"a}s) och den stora m{\"a}ngden spontan vegetation (i ett led utan stubbearbetning och med sen pl{\"o}jning) inneh{\"o}ll 30-40 kg N?ha vid provtagning under senh{\"o}sten. Detta var tre ochfyra g{\ra}nger mer kv{\"a}ve {\"a}n i den spontana vegetationen efter stubbearbetning respektive i h{\"o}stvetebrodden p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten. I leden med den kraftigaste h{\"o}stvegetationen minskade mineralkv{\"a}vem{\"a}ngderna till ca 28 kg N?ha, vilket var omkring 50 \% mindre p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten {\"a}n i leden med h{\"o}stvete och tidig pl{\"o}jning. Det fanns en tendens till st{\"o}rre h{\"o}stmineralisering efter flytg{\"o}dseltillf{\"o}rseln till h{\"o}strapsen v{\ra}ren dessf{\"o}rinnan. Den uteblivna tidiga jordbearbetningen i leden med f{\ra}nggr{\"o}da och sen pl{\"o}jning medverkadetroligtvis till att h{\ra}lla N-frig{\"o}relsen p{\ra} en l{\ra}g niv{\ra}, medan pl{\"o}jning och harvning inf{\"o}r h{\"o}stvetes{\ra}dden, eller tidig stubbearbetning f{\"o}ljd av sen pl{\"o}jning, stimulerade N-mineraliseringen, med {\"o}kad N-utlakningsrisk som f{\"o}ljd. D{\ra} det efter h{\"o}straps normalt {\ra}terfinns mer mineralkv{\"a}ve i marken p{\ra} h{\"o}sten {\"a}n efter str{\ra}s{\"a}d, {\"a}r uppenbarligen f{\ra}nggr{\"o}da och senarelagd jordbearbetning viktiga {\ra}tg{\"a}rder f{\"o}r att minska vinterns kv{\"a}vef{\"o}rluster efter denna gr{\"o}da.
 
H{\"o}stvetet avkastade i genomsnitt 3870 kg?ha (15 \% vattenhalt) och v{\ra}rvetet 3530-3790 kg?ha i de olika leden, vilket {\"a}r f{\"o}rh{\ra}llandevis bra sk{\"o}rdar i j{\"a}mf{\"o}relse med officiell sk{\"o}rdestatistik f{\"o}r ekologisk odling. Orsaken {\"a}r troligen bl.a. god N-efterverkan av b{\ra}de kl{\"o}vergr{\"a}svallen och h{\"o}strapsen, med s{\ra} mycket som 120-130 kg utnyttjbart kv{\"a}ve fr{\ra}n mark och f{\"o}rfruktsgr{\"o}dor. Sk{\"o}rden av h{\"o}st- och v{\ra}rvetet p{\ra}verkades dock inte av den flytg{\"o}dsel som spritts till h{\"o}strapsen, och v{\ra}rvetesk{\"o}rden ej heller av jordbearbetningen efter rapssk{\"o}rden och av f{\ra}nggr{\"o}dan. Trots mindre min-N p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten genom f{\ra}nggr{\"o}dan och utebliven jordbearbetning fram till sen pl{\"o}jning, och eventuellt st{\"o}rre N-f{\"o}rluster {\"o}ver vintern i de {\"o}vriga leden (med dubbelt s{\ra} mycket min-N p{\ra} senh{\"o}sten), erh{\"o}lls ingen tydlig efterverkan i form av st{\"o}rre kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}ll i v{\ra}rvetet vid mognad och ej heller n{\ra}gon mersk{\"o}rd av detta i n{\ra}got av leden. En tendens till mer v{\"a}xttillg{\"a}ngligt kv{\"a}ve, som v{\ra}rvetet kunde utnyttja, fanns dock efter f{\ra}nggr{\"o}dan. 

Som framg{\ra}tt blev sk{\"o}rden av h{\"o}stvetet i genomsnitt lika stor som i medeltal f{\"o}r v{\ra}rvetet, men proteinhalten var signifikant h{\"o}gre i v{\ra}rvetet. Med ett pris f{\"o}r ekologisk v{\ra}rvete som de senaste fem {\ra}ren varit ca. 0,50 kr?kg h{\"o}gre {\"a}n f{\"o}r h{\"o}stvete blev det ekonomiska utbytet av v{\ra}rvete efter h{\"o}straps b{\"a}ttre {\"a}n med h{\"o}stvete efter h{\"o}straps.

In response to increasing problems with anthelmintic resistance, biological control, for example the use of nematophagous fungi, has received significant attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Duddingtonia flagrans orally applied to small ruminants on natural infection with gastrointestinal nematodes in a field study in Northern Germany.
20 goats and 20 sheep were fed daily for 3 months with 5x105 spores of D. flagrans per kg bodyweight. Differences in body weight, faecal egg count and larval development in faeces and on pasture in comparison with same-sized control groups were analysed. After 3 months the control goats showed significantly higher mean faecal egg count than the fungus-fed group. No significant difference was found between the two sheep groups. The maximum in larval reduction in faeces was 81.3 \% in the sheep groups and 67.9 \% in the goat groups (not significant). At the end of the study the body weight gain in the fungus-treated groups was 1.7 kg higher in goats and 0.7 kg higher in sheep than in the control groups (not significant). Regarding the first-year-grazing goats only, the bodyweights revealed significant differences (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in pasture larval counts.
In the study presented here, no clear effect of fungus could be observed. A modified feeding regimen, perhaps with permanent release boluses or feed blocks, may improve the efficacy. Furthermore, it seems that climatic conditions during the study period could have influenced the results and displayed how sensitive the fungus application may be on such parameters.}

In the final year, the effect of perennial ryegrass as a catch crop was investigated. The nitrogen fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of grassland cultivation was higher at 132 kg N ha-1 in the rotation with 75\% grassland compared to on average 111 kg N ha-1 in rotations with 25 and 38\% grassland and the NFRV of ryegrass in the rotation was higher than that of grass-clover. Nitrate leaching following cultivation was not affected by grassland proportion in the crop rotation or sward type. However, there was considerable effect of having a ryegrass catch crop following the final barley crop as nitrate leaching was reduced from 60 to 9 kg N ha-1. When summarising results from the crop rotations over a longer period (1997-2005) management in both grassland and arable phases appears to be the primary measures for avoiding nutrient losses from mixed crop rotations irrespective of grass proportion. In the arable phase the huge potential of catch crops has been demonstrated, but it is also important to realise that all parts of the grass-arable crop rotations must be considered potentially leaky.}

        abstract = {La tutela della risorsa suolo {\`e} tra gli aspetti fondamentali del metodo di produzione
biologico. L?applicazione di compost di qualit{\`a} coniuga la necessit{\`a} del recupero di
materia da scarti organici con l?esigenza di reintegrare il contenuto di sostanza
organica dei suoli. Tali premesse sono la base di una ricerca finalizzata alla
produzione di compost tramite un sistema innovativo, alla caratterizzazione del
prodotto finito e alla realizzazione di prove sperimentali in ambiente confinato e in
pieno campo, idonee ad individuare un codice di buona pratica agricola per l?utilizzo
del compost in agricoltura biologica.
Il protocollo sperimentale ha previsto la produzione di 4 tipi di compost (C1, C2,
C3, C4) ottenuti da una miscela di partenza contenente: sansa umida denocciolata
(sn), stallatico (st) e residui ligneocellulosici triturati (lc). I compost C1 (C?N=30) e C3
(C?N=45) sono stati ottenuti dalla miscelazione di sn :st: lc nel rapporto 7:1:5 (p?p) e
1:5:5 (p?p). C2 e C4 derivano rispettivamente da C1 e C3 per essiccazione all?aria in
strato sottile alla fine della fase di biossidazione accelerata (BA). L?essiccazione {\`e}
stata effettuata al fine di rallentare le attivit{\`a} microbiche ed i processi di evoluzione
della sostanza organica ottenendo matrici a due stadi di maturazione. I parametri di
processo monitorati sono stati: umidit{\`a}, temperatura, pH, e solidi volatili. Ad inizio
processo (T0), alla fine della fase di BA (T1) e alla fine della fase di curing (T2), sono
stati prelevati campioni rappresentativi dai cumuli per la misurazione dell?indice
respirometrico dinamico (IRD). I 4 compost, prodotti presso l?impianto di
compostaggio sperimentale IAMB, sono stati applicati su una rotazione biennale
farro - cece da granella e su una coltivazione di spinacio, entrambi condotti con
metodo di produzione biologico.
La fase di BA, della durata di 35 gg per C1 e C2 e 18 gg per C3 e C4, {\`e} stata
condotta in cassone areato non movimentato. La fase di curing (86 gg per C1 e 65
gg per C3) {\`e} stata condotta in cumulo statico. L?umidit{\`a} {\`e} stata controllata
settimanalmente e corretta al fine di garantire valori di processo tra 50 e 60\%, la
temperatura massima raggiunta {\`e} stata di 72 ?C per C1 e 76 ?C per C3.
L?IRD, partendo da valori compatibili con i dati di letteratura nella miscela iniziale
(T0: 4.171 mgO2 gSV-1 h-1 per C1 e C2; 5.955 mgO2 gSV-1 h-1 per C3 e C4), ha
raggiunto livelli di piena stabilit{\`a} per tutti i materiali gi{\`a} alla fine della fase di BA (T1:
424 mgO2 gSV-1 h-1 per C1e C2 e 789 mgO2 gSV-1 h-1 per C3 e C4).
I diversi rapporti C?N e i contributi della matrice sn nelle due miscelazioni hanno
comportato differenze nei tempi di processo e negli andamenti dei picchi di
temperatura giornalieri, risultando pi{\`u} brevi per C3-C4 rispetto a C1-C2.
In attesa dei risultati finali relativi all?applicazione in pieno campo, si ipotizza che il
prolungarsi del processo in C1-C3 rispetto a C2-C4 comporter{\`a} una diversa
disponibilit{\`a} di elementi nutritivi nelle relative tesi sperimentali per effetto del
procedere dei processi di biossidazione ed evoluzione della sostanza organica.}

The data for this study included all cows calving from September 1, 1990 to August 31, 2001; in total 154 organically and 156 conventionally managed animals. Calving-to-first insemination and calving interval were recorded to characterize RP. Animal health was studied by recording the number of veterinary treated cases of disease. Finally, we studied the length of productive life, from 1st calving to removal. Multivariable models were applied in the analyses to account for variables such as milk yield, parity, breed, calving season, and year of calving. Conventionally managed dairy cows in 3rd lactation or more were found to have longer time from calving-to-first service than organically managed dairy cows. Beside that difference, the groups did not differ in any aspect of RP. Comparisons of number of veterinary treated cases of disease per lactation and the length of productive life revealed no significant differences or trends. With this unique study design, applied in a well managed herd, we were not able to demonstrate any obvious differences in RP, general health or longevity between organically and conventionally managed dairy cows.

The study was based on clinical examinations and blood samples from cows within the range from 2 wk prepartum to 6 wk postpartum, collected from 20 organic and 20 conventional dairy farms with 3 visits at each farm. The farms were located in a southeastern area of Sweden and ranged in size from 45 to 120 cows. The blood parameters selected to reflect energy metabolism were nonesterified fatty acids, {\ensuremath{\beta}}-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and insulin. At clinical examination body condition score was registered. The shape of the lactation curve in early lactation was modeled to assess potential differences that could explain the blood parameter profiles. The conventionally managed cows increased their milk yield faster than OMC within the first 2 wk of lactation. Blood nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were similar between the management types, but with a tendency of lesser concentrations in OMC, primarily in early lactation. Postcalving {\ensuremath{\beta}}-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were constantly lesser in OMC during the first 6 wk of lactation. An interaction between season and insulin concentration necessitated stratification on season. During spring the profiles overlapped, but there was a significant difference in the first 4 d post-calving, when organically managed cows had greater insulin concentrations and in d 30 to 34 when conventionally managed cows had greater insulin concentrations. During fall the profiles overlapped completely and there was no significant difference at any point in time. Glucose concentrations tended to decrease slightly postcalving followed by a gradual elevation to a concentration just under the precalving concentration during the study period. Body condition scores decreased slightly over the study period. No differences were found between the management types with regard to glucose concentrations or registered body condition score. In conclusion, the OMC did not show a greater extent of mobilization of body tissue than CMC as expressed by our study variables. Hence, OMC adjusted the production amount according to feed intake.}

Organic farming has grown rapidly in European and Italian agriculture during the last decade. The aim of the trial was to compare five organic and five conventional broiler  farms from the productive, health and behavioural point of view. The productive performance showed that conventional broilers (CB) consumed significantly less feed then organic broilers (OB) and the first got a better FCR.. These different figures could be due to the different environment and life style. OB are more exposed to natural climate, they can move much more and then they increase feed consumption and FCR become worsen.
The different age at slaughter determined the significant difference observed for the final body weight of 2.943{$\pm$}0.2 CB vs 4.486{$\pm$}0.2 of OB (P=0.0003). The same trend was observed for carcass and chest weight. The first weighed 3.530{$\pm$}0.2 g for CB vs 4.410{$\pm$}0.2 for OB (P=0.01) and the second 2.450{$\pm$}0.15 for CB and 3.150{$\pm$}0.15 for OB (P= 0.01).
The mortality was similar and the main cause was SDS related to genetic factors. 
From the behavioural point of view the result might indicate that less intensive farming and the presence of an enriched environment, as in organic farming, seems to promote a better adaptation of animals, both to the environment and to man presence, ensuring better welfare conditions.}

The discussion on a Brazilian System for Fair Trade began in 2004, and PGS were considered helpful for organizing farmers, providing guarantees and improving the market. In 2007, a draft of PGS regulation for use in organic was elaborated. The same actors who helped build the Organic System are also discussing Fair Trade System.  With the help of public resources, NGOs and family farmers have established systems that provide credibility to consumers with regard to organic qualities and fair trade criteria. The use of PGS is a trend for family farmers trying to access quality markets and also helps participatory research. To some, one perceived challenge is to integrate the two policies (organic and fair trade) since the target publics are similar and the international cooperation agencies give support to both. However, current international initiatives for regulating PGS do not take into account the position of local movements. In the nineties a strategy blind to such a weakness split the organic movements in Latin America and it is unlikely that a similar strategy will promote harmonization or equivalence in the future.}

The ringtest not only aims to compare varieties, but also to support organic breeding, as it provides an opportunity to evaluate the ability of advanced lines bred for organic farming to meet the needs of farmers and millers for agronomic and quality traits. Trials are also used to study specific traits required for organic farming (such as weed competitiveness), so that they can become selection criteria in specific breeding programmes. In addition, protocols and results obtained in variety trials in organic farming give information to discuss about possibility of low input VCU testing (Value for Cultivation or Use).}

A two-year (2006-08) on-farm research is being carried out to test innovative operative machines for physical weed control on a typical vegetable crop sequence in the Arno Valley (Pisa, Italy). In this work we present the first results, obtained on organic fresh market spinach (Spinacia oleracea). The new strategy is compared with the standard crop and weed management system, characterised by the use of biodegradable maize starch mulch, and with a system in which the use of improved physical methods is coupled with the use of a subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) living mulch. Performances of the operative machines, labour time requirement and cultivation costs of the three crop and weed management systems are reported. The two innovative strategies showed interesting results, determining effective weed control and a significant reduction of costs for working and hand labour (-70\%).}

All three traits generally were on a higher level in calcaric Phaeozems than in Cambisols.

from larval mortality determined in bioassays with neonates of a susceptible codling moth
strain.
Only two agents with a pH of 11 (sodium silicate (water glass) and calcium polysulfide
(lime sulphur)) reduced the virulence of CpGV significantly.}

The additional grain N yield of 4 kg ha-1 with GML corresponded to only 3 \% of N in above-ground green manure biomass. On loamy soil with late autumn incorporated green manure the treatments did not affect the grain yield the subsequent year. How large part of the N that was lost through leaching or gaseous emissions and how large part that was built into soil organic matter was not measured. However, this investigation confirms that potential N losses from mowed green manure might be large. Alternative ways of using the herbage should be found.}

        abstract = {Composts and digestates can influence soil fertility and plant health. These influences can be positive or negative, depending of the quality of the composts. A currently important question is to know, if digestates differ from composts in these aspects. A Swiss project is concerned with the estimation of the potential of Swiss composts and digestates to influence soil fertility and plant health positively. For this, one hundred composts and digestates representative of the different composting systems and qualities available on the Swiss market were analyzed.
The organic matter and nutrient content of the composts varied greatly between the composts and the digestates; the materials of origin were the major factor influencing these values. The respiration rate and enzyme activities also varied greatly; they are particularly important in digestates. The organic matter of digestates is less stable than that of composts.
The N-mineralization potential from the majority of the digestates added to soil is high, in comparison to young composts. When digestates are not correctly treated or stored, however, they can immobilize nitrogen in the soil. This problem is hardly correlated with the management of the digestate in the first stage after leaving the fermenter. Especially products which have become too dry during this period lost their ammonia-nitrogen, and hence immobilized nitrogen in the soil. The risk of phytotoxicity is higher in digestates than in composts. This limits the possibility for use of digestate. With a post-treatment of digestate, it is possible to produce high quality compost with a high compatibility with plant growth and with a more stabilized organic matter.
In field experiments, digestates increased the pH-value and the biological activity of soil to the same extent than composts. These effects were observable also one season after compost application. No immobilization of nitrogen was observed.}

        abstract = {A yearly amount of 9.3x106t compost and digestate derived from separately collected organic waste is produced in the 25 European Union member states. The improvement of soil properties is a major benefit of compost application. However, little is known about the occurrence of organic pollutants in compost. In order to estimate the potential of Swiss composts and digestates to influence soil fertility and plant health, one hundred products representative for the different composting systems and qualities available on the Swiss market were analyzed in two research projects. In the first study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ortho substituted and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, DL PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD?F), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides, chlorinated paraffins (CPs), phthalates and nonylphenol (NP) were analyzed. All compound classes were detected except for NP. PFAS, HBCD, TBBPA, some compounds out of PBDEs and pesticides were found in compost and digestate for the first time. Concentrations of most compounds were in the low ppb range. Contents of PAHs were between 600 and 12473 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?kg dry weight (dw) and contents of HBCD and CPs between 17 and 384 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?kg dw. Tests with springtails (Folsomia candida) have been shown to be a versatile tool for ecotoxicological assessment. Within these tests, inhibiting and stimulating effects due to compost application were observed. Except for high PAHs contents, no major problem with regard to contamination of compost and digestate was identified.
In the second study, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the composts and digestats, and their influence on soil fertility and plant growth, were characterized. The organic substance and the nutrient content of the composts varied largely between the composts with the feedstock materials as major influencing factors. The respiration rate and enzyme activities exhibited large variations as well, particularly in the youngest composts. These differences decreased when the composts became more mature. Maturity, the degradation stage of the organic matter, depended not only on the age of the compost, but also on the management of the process. The N-mineralization potential of compost added to soil showed that a high proportion of young composts immobilized the nitrogen in the soil. Two compost parameters allowed to predict the risk of nitrogen immobilization in soil: the NO3- and the humic acids contents. The phytotoxicity of the composts varied largely even in mature composts, showing that the storage of the compost plays a decisive role. While the majority of composts protected cucumber plants against Pythium ultimum, only a few composts suppressed Rhizoctonia solani in basil. With respect to disease suppression, the management of the maturation process seems to play a major role. In field experiments, some biologically immature composts immobilized nitrogen in soil and reduced growth of maize. With additional fertilization, however, it was possible to compensate this effect. Digestates and composts increased the pH-value and the biological activity of soil. These effects were observable also one maize season after compost application. In conclusion, the management of the composting process seems to influence the biological quality of the composts and digestats to a higher extent than the feedstock materials or the composting system. More attention should be paid to this biological quality, in order to produce composts with more beneficial effects on crops.}

All species tested - black medic, birdsfoot trefoil, red clover, white clover and a legume-grass mixture - proved to be suitable. Compared to the ?not-undersown? control treatment the undersown N-fixing crops had no statistically significant effect on the yield, protein content and other grain quality characteristics of the winter wheat crop, except for one site where protein yield was significantly higher in one year. There was also no difference in disease incidence between ?undersown? and ?not-undersown? winter wheat. Depending on the seasonal rainfall pattern the establishment of N-fixing crops in wheat had either a negative or a positive effect on the yield of the subsequent crop of winter triticale. Reductions in yield only occurred in the 03?04 season, which had an extremely dry summer in 2003. In the seasons 04?05 and 05?06, which had a more favourable distribution of annual precipitation, the establish?ment of certain legume crops increased the yield and protein content of winter triticale; however the effect was not statistically significant for all years and sites. }

Specifically, field experiments demonstrated that soil disturbance events associated with cover cropping encouraged germination and seedling establishment thereby reducing the density of germinable seeds in the weed seedbank.  Of notable importance, however, are the disturbance events that preempt weed seed rain.  If weeds are permitted to reach reproductive maturity in cash or cover crops, the ?debits? to the seedbank resulting from early season disturbance will likely be overwhelmed by the resulting seed rain ?credits.?  }

The aim of this  project is to study the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the growth and development of Allium species and to determine whether it is possible to improve onions for mycorrhizal responsiveness by breeding. Variation among Allium species indicated that selection and thus breeding for high responsiveness to AMF is possible. Two years of experiments with genotypes of a population segregating for mycorrhiza responsiveness indicated that increase in dry matter may be a more reliable trait than responsiveness.}

        abstract = {Coffee is Nicaragua?s main organic product. There are 13,100 hectares of certified coffee. This area represents 10 percent of the total coffee production of Nicaragua and is managed by approximately 3,500 small producers. 90 percent of the organic coffee is sold for the export market.
In Nicaragua a legal framework for organic farming as well as regulations for the development of environmental services payments exist (forest conservation, water management, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration). There are also studies on carbon sequestration and carbon emissions in agriculture, forestry and industry. However, there are no investigations relating specifically to organic agriculture and climate change.

2. Background investigation 
Since 2004, the Costa Rican Corporation for Training and Development CEDECO has been carrying out investigations on organic agriculture and climate change in Costa Rica, Cuba and Brazil. The research consists in comparison between organic and conventional systems in order to define climate relevant parameters. With this aim the project includes a model in which physical, chemical, socio-economical and biological parameters are taken into account as factors that can influence the GHG emissions, carbon sequestration and the energy efficiency of the evaluated cropping systems.
Results of the Costa Rican research showed that organic coffee production reduces GHG emissions by 1 ton of carbon equivalent (Ceq) per hectare. If this is multiplied by the certified organic coffee area, we find a total GHG reduction of more than 13 thousand tons Ceq per year. In the voluntary carbon market this can represent approximately 300,000 USD yearly. For the 3,500 smallholder families this could deliver financial resources for projects to improve their livelihoods in their local communities. 

Moreover, results also show that, on average, organic coffee production needs 95\% less total energy per ha than conventional coffee production. This presents further cost savings for the small organic coffee producers. 

As concerns carbon storage, the organic coffee production system accumulates more organic carbon in deep soil layers than conventional coffee production. Carbon sequestration is a further element that can be used as a parameter for environmental services.

3. Assessment and improvement of climate relevant techniques in organic coffee production
Based on the above findings, CEDECO?UNA?FiBL proposes assessing and improving climate relevant techniques in organic coffee production in Nicaragua. A comparison of organic and conventional coffee production will be necessary in order to find out which parameters need to be taken into account along the full production chain. The results of the comparison between organic and conventional coffee production systems might offer the possibility to assess specifically which parameters and techniques can be used for environmental services in Nicaragua. A further aim of the proposal is to optimize climate relevant techniques during the life cycle and throughout the full value chain of organic coffee production. For example: how to obtain climate neutral coffee production, which compost technique has less GHG emissions and how can it be improved, how can the harvest residues be converted into biogas and energy that can be used in the rural areas etc. 

The following approaches will be used:
1.	Research: on station and on farm
2.	Dissemination: capacity building, exchange of experience, promotion, multiplication, networking
3.	Policy dialogue

The project processes shall include:
1.	Participatory process
2.	Linking stakeholders: producers, authorities, NGOs, research centres, etc.
3.	Generating local know-how 


How development cooperation can promote organic agriculture as a solution for climate mitigation
1.	Set up projects with smallholder groups to improve specific management techniques:
?	Fertility and carbon sequestration
?	Compost production
?	Biogas and energy production
?	Management of biodiversity
?	Management of wastes and natural resources
2.	Research, dissemination and policy dialogue
3.	Organic agriculture as excellent tool to mitigate climate change

Century plant, faba bean and lentil were identified as relict crops, supporting oral reports of past cultivation and providing evidence of genetic erosion. Overall greatest species similarity was found between Balad Seet and Al Jabal al Akhdar, as indicated by a S{\o}rensen coefficient of similarity of 67\%.

        abstract = {Organic farming requires cultivars that are specifically adapted to this low input cropping system. Hence, organic farmers and scientists joined in a participatory breeding approach to develop region-specific genotypes of spring faba bean for organic conditions in Germany. A set of 49 genotypes with contrasting degrees of heterozygosity and heterogeneity was used in field trials across five locations in Germany during 3 years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The material involved 18 inbred lines, their 18 polycross progenies, one blend of inbred lines, one blend of polycross progenies, one blend of hybrids and ten checks. Inbred lines are uniform, thus giving the option to be specifically adapted; whereas the polycross progenies and synthetics (Syn-1; predicted from the inbred lines and polycross progenies performance) are partly heterogeneous and heterozygous, thus giving the option to evolve. Agronomic performance was assessed and a ??personal appreciation?? score of the material was assigned to each genotype by each partner. This personal appreciation was strongly influenced by biotic and abiotic constraints faced by the crop in each location and by the expected grain yield of the genotypes. Uniformity was apparently appreciated by organic farmers. In all locations, the highest yielding inbred line yielded slightly better than the predicted highest yielding synthetic. However, this slight disadvantage of the synthetic is very likely to disappear if the synthetic (Syn-1) is propagated during successive generations.}

A total of 36 Italian Friesian lactating cows with subclinical mastitis were randomly divided into three homogeneous groups: phyto-treated group, placebo-treated group, and control group. In phyto-treated group, cows received 5 gr. of standardised fluid extract of Spirea ulmaria L. and 6 gr. of standardised extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE, administered orally as complex once daily for 15 days. Milk samples were collected from the mammary quarters before the beginning of the experiment, and  then 14, 28 and 56 days after for analysis of bacteria, and somatic cells count (SCC). Milk flow and production were also recorded. The treatment positively influenced the health status of mammary glands, resulting particularly effective against Coagulase Negative Staphilococci. A reduction of infected quarters was highlighted in treated group ( 16.7\% vs 30.2\% and 37.5\%, respectively in control and placebo groups; P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). Further studies are needed to ascertain some aspects of herbal extracts action in ruminants and their effectiveness in different experimental and practical conditions.}

However, numbers of earwigs have declined in both organic and IPM orchards in recent
years. Both Integrated and Organic fruit growers have tried to re-establish earwig
populations, thus far with little success. To understand earwig population dynamics and to
find measures to increase natural orchard populations, we conducted a detailed
phenological survey of earwigs in orchards. Earwigs were sampled while sheltering during
daytime in artificial refuges. They move into the trees from the third nymph stage onwards.
In most orchards, a small second brood is produced in summer, and this has a positive
impact on population size in fall. We see only minor differences in phenology between
apple and pear orchards, mainly caused by differences in alternative hiding places.
Earwigs show an inexplicable reduction in numbers at the timing of moulting into adults.
When earwig phenology is correlated with pest phenology in apple and pear, its use for
pest control of major pests is clear.}

The amino acid asparagine (Asn) and reducing sugars are considered to be the main precursors for AA formation. So far, research in AA has mainly focused on potato and cereal products, indicating the relevance of species, cultivars, amount of N fertilizer, and climatic conditions. Potential additional sources of acrylamide in food products might be pseudocereal grains (e.g. amaranth, quinoa). As amaranth and quinoa are often cultivated as cash crops in organic production systems, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of acrylamide formation in different amaranth and quinoa cultivars. Grain samples were collected from field trials in Germany and Austria consisting of 6 amaranth and 3 quinoa cultivars. The results indicated significant differences in the potential for acrylamide formation of quinoa cultivars and also slight differences between tested amaranth cultivars. It is obvious that the selection of cultivars with a low AA formation potential would offer a suitable strategy for the minimization of AA in foodstuffs.}

However, the statistical information base to describe this growth is either incomplete or inaccessible, and sometimes inaccurate.  In the U.S., fruits and vegetables make up 40\% of organic food sales, implying that the expanding overall market has also increased demand for organic temperate fruits such as apple, grape, and strawberry.  Organic fruit in several European countries comprises over 5\% of all fruit sales.  Data on organic temperate fruit production have been compiled by FiBL and Washington State University.  In 2006, there were at least 250,000 ha of organic temperate fruit (pome, stone, grapes, and berries) under production worldwide (fully converted plus in conversion).  Expansion rates vary by the fruit type and geographic location.  In Washington State, USA, a leading producer of apple, pear, and cherry, organic production will soon comprise 10\% of all apple and pear hectares.  Over 5\% of the grape hectares in Italy are under organic management.  Major organic temperate fruit production is spread around the globe but often is most successful with semi-arid, dry summer climates due to reduced disease problems.  Leading producers include Italy, Turkey, USA, France, Spain, Poland, and Germany, which together accounted for about three-quarters of the global organic temperate fruit hectares in 2006.  }

The most effective ways to keep the infestation of C. arvense at a low level were deep mouldboard ploughing and the use of a double-layer plough. After the experiment had run seven years, the thistle biomass was {\ensuremath{<}} 2 g DM m-2 in these treatments, compared to 23?26 g DM m-2 in the treatments with chisel ploughing or shallow ploughing. In all treatments, stubble tillage in addition to primary tillage significantly reduced the thistle biomass by 30?80 \%. A high density of lucerne?grass re-growth occurred in the chisel plough treatment. The soil seed bank of thistles ranged between 220 (deep plough) and 6,400 seeds m-2 (chisel plough) in the sixth year of the experiment. Stubble tillage is essential if the chisel plough or shallow ploughing is used for conservation tillage in organic farming. The double-layer plough can control C. arvense comparable to deep ploughing.}

Biomass from periodical cutting down of hedgerows is often unutilized litter. The study assesses different ways how to use wood chips from hedgerows, and quantifies the biomass potential for either mulching arable land with wood chips or, alternatively, for bioenergy use. The calculations are based on experiments at the experimental station for organic farming Kleinhohenheim and on literature. The yield of wood chips was clearly too low to mulch the total arable land of the model farm. Hedgerows on an area equal to 1\% of the farm area yielded wood chips for 0.05 ha if 160 m3 ha-1 were applied. This layer significantly reduced weeds. Hedgerows covering 5\% or 20\% of the farmland would provide wood chips for about 0.2 or 1 ha for mulching or, used as firewood, they would cover the corresponding fuel oil demand of more than one average household. Compared to poplars in short rotation coppice on the same area, the energy output is low. Since an energy use of wood chips is ecological and economical inefficient, mulching seems a reasonable way to use wood chips from cutting hedgerow, in spite of low yields. Wood chips should be applied to thoroughly selected areas, such as slopes (protection from soil erosion), crops with wide inter-row-distance or to perennial, high-value crops. }

If more than 1.5 ? 2\% of the grains are infected, the ground wheat loses its baking quality. In 2003, for the first time since the fifties, a significant occurrence of wheat bugs was recorded in Eastern Austria. Since in organic farming no insecticides are available for direct control, the farmers were advised to grow quality wheat at the greatest possible distance to fallows, windbreaks and other uncultivated areas. To clarify their significance for the wheat bug occurrence, a diploma thesis was performed in the year 2004. The sampling sites were situated in Burgenland, Eastern Austria. The spatial and temporal distribution of the bugs (Scutelleridae, Pentatomidae) was evaluated by hand-searching the ground litter and by sampling with enclosures, sweep net and visual observations in windbreaks, forest edges, field margins, grasslands, fallows and winter?wheat fields (1, 10 and 60 meters from the field edge) and sporadically also in other crops (lucerne, barley, rye and spelt). As a total, 368 individuals from 22 species of bugs were collected. 316 individuals belonged to potentially harmful 10 wheat bug species, Eurygaster maura (67\%), Aelia acuminata (16\%) and E. austriaca (4\%) being most abundant. The sweep net was the most efficient sampling method. The earliest wheat bugs occurred directly in the wheat fields. During the growing season, the species E. maura, A. acuminata und E. austriaca were found almost entirely in winter-wheat fields, whereas in the uncultivated habitats other species occurred. Our data do not suggest that landscape elements as well as fallows enhance wheat bug infestations. The wheat bug infestation of wheat fields might be influenced mainly by the weather conditions in spring and summer. After having compared the climatic conditions of 2003 with the ?wheat bug years? 1953 and 1954, we suggest that the recent outbreak of wheat bugs might have been due to the significantly above average temperatures in the years 2000 to 2003. }

Generally, total tuber yields depended very much on the growing season. However, highest yields were obtained when horn grits were applied along with potassium sulphate. Increasing yields after cattle manure fertilization could be attributed to K rather than N. Combined N and K fertilization may cause DM concentration to fall short of the required minimum for crisps. Pre-sprouting and storage increased tuber DM concentration considerably. Cultivars belonging to the very early and early maturity type showed the largest relative increase of reducing sugars due to storage.
On the whole, results suggest that the effect of agronomic measures such as fertilization, preceding crop and seed-tuber preparation may be rather small and the response of internal tuber quality and quality of fried products difficult to predict. The quality standards for tuber raw stock can be accomplished best when adequate cultivars suitable for storage are chosen.

This experiment was done in split-split plot based on randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Treatments were 2 production systems (Conventional and Low input system) in the main plots, 3 planting time (25 of March, 4 and 14 of April) in the sub plots and 2 seed types (Improved and Native of Khoozestan) in the sub-sub plots. Results showed that there was a significant difference between production systems. The highest height (125.8cm) and number of capitols per plant (10.4) were obtained in conventional system. While other traits including capitol diameter (7.028cm), number of seed per capitol (125), 1000 seed weight (25.006g), seed yield (1888.072kg?ha), silymarin percentage (\%7.711) and silymarin yield (150.443lit?ha) were recorded in the low input system. Results showed that because of using vermicopmpost and its effects on plant growth in low input system, highest seed yield and silymarin yield were obtained in this treatment.  Seed planting in the first time of planting (25 of March) had the same effect on growth and yield. Highest values were recorded in the first time of planting (25 of March). Also, improved seed caused more seed and silymarin yield. Results showed that for getting highest seed and silymarin yield, using improved seed and low input production system is necessary. Also, according to the climatic condition, seed must be planted as early as possible. In this investigation, the best time of planting is 5 March).}

Growing rape seed on 10\% of the land could produce bio-diesel to replace 50?60\% of the tractor diesel used on the farm. Increasing grass-clover area to 20\% of the land and using half of this yield for biogas production could change the cash crop farm to an etenergy producer, and reduce GHG emissions while reducing the overall output of products only marginally. Increasing grass-clover area would improve the nutrient management on the farm and eliminate dependence on conventional pig slurry if the biogas residues were returned to cash crop fields. }

        abstract = {Reduction of fossil energy use has a two-fold aim namely reducing the dependence of a limited, non-renewable resource and reduction of emissions of green house gasses (GHG). Consumers interested in reducing their carbon footprint from food consumption may consider whether a shift towards eating organic foods will do the job? This involves two questions: Is organic food more energy efficient and ?given that one is dedicated to eating organic ? which products and which producers results in a lower GHG emission. From a farmer perspective it is interesting to know how the carbon footprint of the production may be reduced. Over time the principles for organic agriculture has included specific references to the question of reducing the use of non-renewable energy (Woodward \& Vogtman, 2004) and this is still an explicit part of the objectives of the Danish organic farming movement. 

It is, however, questionable to which degree these objectives have been achieved as regards the dependence on fossil energy in the present form of organic agriculture. The majority of farms still depend on fossil energy for traction and electricity and energy self-reliance seems not to be a major concern in practice. As regards fossil energy use, the major difference to conventional farming is that the rejection of chemical fertilizer reduces the indirect energy use in organic farming and that the yields are lower, thus reducing the solar energy captured in crops. However, as regards the emission of GHG the picture is more diverse and the net GHG emissions can be lower in organic agriculture compared with conventional.

The aim of this paper is thus to discuss the different perspectives of reducing energy use and GHG emissions from organic agriculture by presenting results regarding
? Different methods and results of comparison of energy use efficiency in organic agriculture
? The potential for energy savings and self-reliance in organic agriculture
? The relative importance of fossil energy use for emissions of GHG from production of different organic products
? The relative importance of different organic and conventional food items for the total GHG emission of food consumption

        abstract = {Organic pig production has emerged as an alternative to the intensive conventional pig production in Europe with the animals confined indoors and often an imbalance between livestock and land for feed production and manure utilisation. The organic systems aim at improving animal welfare by supporting the pig?s natural behaviour (Hermansen et al., 2003), and improving soil fertility by better linking crop and livestock production from an agro-ecological point of view.

The differences between organic and conventional pig production is more fundamental than for example differences between dairy production systems, which may be why the share of pig herds within the organic holdings is considerably lower than the percentage of pig herds in conventional agriculture in both the UK (ADAS, 2001), Germany (Willer, et al., 2002) and Denmark (Plant Directorate, 2004b). However, the recent development has seen a dramatic increase in demand for organic pig meat in Denmark, Germany and the UK and present production cannot meet demand. Besides regulation on use of feedstuffs, the organic pig production has a main challenge in the regulation for housing. The sows need access to grazing in the summer time, and growing pigs need as a minimum requirement access to an outdoor run. In addition, the area requirements for indoor housing are higher than for conventional production.

These requirements have a major impact on what systems to consider, both from economical and agro-ecological points of view. And therefore, efforts to improve organic pig production should focus on the integration of livestock production and land use, but considering environmental impacts on local and global scales. 

The most commonly used system in Denmark is to combine an outdoor sow production all year round with rearing growing pigs in barns with an outdoor run (Hermansen \& Jakobsen, 2004). The type of stable most commonly used by full time producers in Denmark is a system with deep litter in the entire indoor area or deep litter?straw bed in half the area while the outdoor area consists of a concrete area. The use of a concrete covered area, from which the manure can be collected, is a way to comply with the environmental regulations stating that the outdoor run should be constructed in a way that prevents leaching. 

Research shows that very good production results can be obtained in such systems in terms of litter size, daily gain, feed consumption and health (Hermansen et al., 2003). However, two possible drawbacks exist. First, the space requirement per growing pig in housing facilities is considerable and, thus, capital demanding. For fattening pigs of 85-100 kg live weight, the indoor space required is equivalent to 1.3 m2?pig (of which at least 0.65 m2 must consists of a solid floor) and 1.0 m2 outdoors run (Council Regulation, 1999). In addition, each lying zone, i.e. straw bedding area, must be able to accommodate all pigs at a time. This put a heavy burden on costs of buildings (money and resource use) and at the same time it can be questioned if such rearing systems comply with the consumer expectations. Second, the outdoor sow production has been connected with high environmental burden in the form of N losses (Larsen et al., 2000; Eriksen et al., 2002). 
This made us to consider two alternatives to the organic pic system most often used presently. A system where all pigs were reared outdoors on grassland (and saving buildings) and a system where sows and growing pigs were kept in a tent system placed upon a deep litter area in order to reduce risk for N leaching. Both have been used under commercial conditions. In order to assess the possible trade-offs between environmental impacts on the one hand and the assumed advantages of these alternative systems (animal welfare, low investment) on the other hand an Environmental Impact Assessment was needed. Environmental assessment of livestock farming systems can be done on an area basis (e.g. nutrient losses per ha) or on a product basis (e.g. Green House Gas emission per kg meat or milk; Haas et al., 2001; van der Werf \& Petit, 2002; De Boer, 2003; Halberg et al., 2005). The area based assessment is relevant for locally important emissions such as nitrate leaching but a product based assessment is more relevant for emissions, which have a less localised impact (acidification) or even a global character (Green House Gasses). Moreover, since the organic production is often considered a more sustainable alternative to conventional intensive pig production, from a consumer point of view it might be interesting to compare the eutrophication per kg meat produced from different organic and compared to conventional systems. 

The objective of this paper is to compare the environmental impact and green house gas emission of organic pig production systems with different levels of integration of livestock and land use.

This article further develops the literature on governance and transformative capacity, adding deliberative networking as a key facet. Examining the development of the organic farming sector in Australia, it is argued that the absence of transformative capacity frustrates development. Specifically, although the state has slowly come to see a need for some interaction and facilitation of organic industry development, particularly of a national domestic standard, this intervention is made difficult by the absence of: (i) capable organic industry organisations; (ii) 'in-house' departmental expertise; and (iii) venues capable of fostering policy deliberation. We argue that the reworked concept of transformative capacity can have wider application in making sense of industry development in other infant industries.}

This paper compares the development of organic farming sectors in Australia and Denmark, countries at polar ends of the organic sector development continuum. They provide a good comparison as both countries share key characteristics, such as a history of state-agricultural industry partnerships, an implicit post-1980?s consensus around a market model for agricultural industry development, and the general absence of consumer distrust over food quality. After ruling out a number of well worn explanations for differential growth we focus on the role of governance capacity. We argue that the Danish case, in contrast with Australia, demonstrates that when well-developed associative and state capacities can combine alongside interest intermediation then governance capacity is generated and infant industry development is made possible.

They emerged from a similar milieu; yet they developed their capacities very differently. While all three associations have developed capacities for the promotion of the organic sector in relation to consumers, farmers and government, they differ significantly in relation to capacity development as it pertains to policy implementation. The key differences can be explained by variation in the organic farm policies of the three countries. The comparison also demonstrates that existing groups can adapt capacities when policy changes, even where neo-liberal inspired policy strategies are deployed.}

In this study, an inventory of white grub (Melolontha melolontha, Amphimallon solstitiale and Phyllopertha horticola) damages in Austrian grassland including organic cultivation was performed by questioning plant protection consultants of 74 Agricultural County Chambers. Altogether, a cumulated 14.800 hectares of white grub damages were recorded. From 2000 onwards, a steady increase of white grub damages occurred with a climax in the year of heat and drought 2003. The infested fields extended along the alpine main ridge from Vorarlberg up to the alpine foreland. Additionally, southern slopes of the Danube valley in Upper and Lower Austria were affected. Very likely, the damages were mainly due to the garden chafer P. horticola. From 2004 to 2006, the extent of damages decreased again all over Austria. By studying meteorological data, it became obvious that the damaged areas were mainly situated in regions with a strong precipitation deficit. On-farm investigations performed in 2007 strengthened the hypothesis that drought and elevated soil temperatures might be the decisive factors for a strong development of grub populations and subsequent feeding damages. Additionally, drought can increase the effects of grub damage by delaying the regeneration of the damaged sward. A strongly damaged sward on slopes can be dangerous for the farmers e.g. by slipping machines.}

The purpose of this experiment was to minimise boar taint and increase overall impression of sensory quality by feeding entire male and female pigs with fibrerich feedstuffs. The pigs have been fed three organic diets for either 1 or 2 weeks prior to slaughter of which two diets contained different fermentable fibre-rich feedstuffs ? 10?13.3\% dried chicory roots or
25\% blue lupines. These two treatments were compared with pigs fed with an organic control diet for either 1 or 2 weeks prior to slaughter. Lupines significantly reduced skatole in blood and backfat for both genders after 1 week. Moreover, lupines showed negative impact on growth rate and feed conversion whilst chicory showed no significant differences in this respect. However, the indole concentration was significantly lower in chicory than lupine fed pigs. From a sensory perspective, chicory and lupine feeding reduced boar taint since odour and flavour of manure related to skatole and urine associated to androstenone were minimised. The level of boar taint in the entire male pigs was most effectively reduced after 14 days by both fibre-rich feeds while lupine had the largest influence on ??boar? taint reduction in female pigs.}

are e.g. Fanny, Lilla, Palatina. However they are disease susceptible and must be
produced under a rain roof. Better suited cultivars still need to be found. Consumer
acceptance for organic table grapes produced in Switzerland is very positive. However
changes towards new cultivars and lower production costs are necessary. Spray programs
to achieve sufficient disease protection and no spray blotch seem to be realizable, mainly
for production under rain roof.}

Schools are the perfect setting for children to learn, and this influence can play an important role in preventing children from becoming obese and overweight. The purpose of this research was to examine whether organic food intervention in school meals could help children establish healthy eating patterns. This was determined through the comparisons between the public organic food procurement policy based schools and non policy based schools. The study undertook surveys among school food coordinators in selected Danish and Norwegian primary schools through a web-based questionnaire. The data shows the relations regarding the school food service between different types of schools, and also based on the ways and methods of food provision. Results indicate that organic food intervention can be effective in preventing the development of obesity and overweight issues among the children in schools. }

Since school increasingly is taking a role in both food provision and in health, environment and nutrition education of young people by implementing healthy and environmental friendly policies, it is relevant to investigate the relation between the different components of such interventions. In other words it is relevant to ask the question: does organic food supply police go hand in hand with healthy eating policies. This study that has been made possible through the iPOPY project looks at the relationship in Danish and Norwegian school food setting by asking school headmaster about their policies and operational procedure in relation to school food.

The analysis of input and efficient use of fossil energy carriers provides information on the environmental relevance of the farm operations. Apart from this, renewable energy production in the farming systems is compared to food production, and changes in the farm output are described. It turns out that organically run cash crop farms can benefit from a reasonable integration of a biogas plant, both in food crop and energy production. An increased orientation on the growing of energy crops, however, leads to worse utilization of fossil energy carriers and reduced food production. }

Shortage of organically produced protein crops for production of concentrates supplying the European market, and a contemporary ban on the use of fishmeal for ruminants in the EU has lead to an increased need for organically produced feedstuffs for production of concentrates in Norwegian organic husbandry. Pea is the most common cultivated protein-rich crop in organic agriculture in Norway. For ruminants, peas has a low bypass protein content compared to common protein supplements such as rape meal and soybean meal. Other high-protein crops with complementary properties are therefore needed to meet the demand in feed quality for ruminants, pigs and poultry. Oilseed crops, which are rich in both fat and protein, will become of considerable interest if problems related to their cultivation are solved. Currently, our experience with oilseed crops in organic agriculture is limited. In a four year research project "Organic protein feed and edible oil from oilseed crops" this experience will be extended and the feed quality of organically grown protein crops like rape, turnip rape and camelina will be evaluated. The project will provide knowledge about the rumen degradability of protein, starch and NDF (neutral detergent fibre) and intestine digestibility of protein and starch in organically grown protein-rich crops necessary for the production of concentrates with an optimal feed quality.}

Measured fruit firmness of ?Suvetar? was not significantly different from that of ?Polka?, but was better than ?Jonsok?. ?Valotar? originates from a cross between ?Jewel? and ?Senga Sengana?. Its measured fruit firmness was better than that of ?Jonsok? and ?Polka?. Considering sensory assessments, the good firmness seems to be largely due to good skin resistance.

Our aim is to assess the nutrient acquisition potential of old, new and organically bred winter wheat cultivars and to identify the role of AMF for nutrient uptake and growth. In October 2006, an experiment with 10 wheat cultivars was superimposed to all four field replicates of the DOK long-term experiment, comprising four different treatments with increasing nutrient input: unfertilized, biodynamic low and moderate intensity and conventional mineral system. Growth and harvest parameters such as plant density and length, growth habit, plant health, yield and grain quality will be assessed. Shoot and root samples were taken at tillering and flowering to analyse nitrogen and phosphorus content and AMF root colonization. In this paper, the current state of literature findings in the field of organic breeding is summarized and the experimental setup for variety testing in an existing long-term trial is outlined. }

It is intended to help advisers and farmers identify when the use of compost or a composting process is appropriate.  This review does not address the detailed issues surrounding the various production of compost but includes some basic information with particular respect to on-farm composting operations. 
The differences between well-made compost and semi compost (single turned) that may be revealed by this review could inform decisions about the approach taken to composting in an on-farm situation.
The specific issues addressed by the review will include:
?The different types of compost available to producers, and their qualities and properties.
?The role of composts in disease suppression and, where shown, the mechanism for any effects.
?The direct and indirect effects on crop yields.
?Detectable and measurable effects on crop quality (an appropriate definition of quality will be required).
?The effects of compost applications on soil biology and organic matter levels, and the implications for carbon sequestration.
?The most appropriate situations for the use of compost as opposed to fresh manure.
?This has a particular relevance in the production of ready to eat horticultural crops
This review does cover the use of bulky organic materials generated by fermentation or anaerobic types of process such as biogas generation, the use of compost teas and the use of compost(s) in growing media for plant raising and production.}

This study was conducted to determine whether inoculation with Azospirillum could improve nitrogen uptake and increase crop yield, and whether there are differences among wheat cultivars in the ability to benefit from inoculation of these diazotrophic bacteria.  Seed from twenty historic and modern wheat cultivars were either left untreated, or treated with a commercial inoculant of Azospirillum, and planted at two locations under certified organic management.  In one location with lower fertility, inoculation significantly increased yield and protein, and clear differences existed among individual cultivars in response to the inoculant.  In another location with higher fertility, none of the cultivars responded as favorably to the inoculant, and yield in some cultivars was reduced.  Plant breeders should be able to select for beneficial cultivar interactions with Azospirillum to increase wheat yield and protein levels.  Additional research is needed to determine the impact of site-specific soil conditions on the effectiveness of Azospirillum in organic systems.}

Potentially suitable varieties were collected, genotype x environment interactions were investiga-ted and selection was carried out within three crosses at three farms in Central and Northern Germany. The resulting selections were compared at all farms. Screening within organic horticulture was the most important means of finding suitable varieties. After three years of evaluation, 71\% of the 18 most successful varieties came from colleagues within organic horticulture. The analysis of the regional evaluation did not reveal strong interactions of varieties and locations. The rate of Phytophthora (late blight) fruit infections significantly depended on the year, thus stressing the need for long-term evaluation. Site specific adaptation was partially observed for late blight in-fections and for yield. The main advantage of multilocational selection, however, was to make use of the selection potential at each farm. At Rhauderfehn, the farm with the highest level of Phytophthora infections, selection led to reduced fruit infection and extended harvest period. Selection at Ellingerode resulted in the highest yield. We recommend multilocational breeding approaches with frequent exchange of breeding material and data.}

Farmers specialize in beef-suckler production. 60\% of them are part-time farmers. Beef production amounts to two thirds of their agricultural income. Most farmers keep only beef cattle on the farms. Other farm animals are kept in small stock sizes. This study has found only a few differences between conventional and organic farms. Organic farmers more often keep breeds of low intensity but more of them use direct marketing channels. On organic farms cows more frequently stay outside all year. Animal performances were the same in both production systems.}

        abstract = {In organic potato production yields are often reduced by potato late blight (Phytophthora infestans). Two aspects are important in late blight management: a sufficiently high (field) resistance to late blight, and early tuber formation. With early tuber formation the period of tuber growth is extended at the beginning, and with a high resistance level at the end. 
In 2006 and 2007 experiments were carried out in which the effects of the physiological age of seed tubers on field resistance to late blight and on tuber yield of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) were tested for early and moderately late varieties. The results indicate that with the use of physiologically older seed tubers (by pre-sprouting) the field resistance to late blight is generally lower than with younger seed tubers. With physiologically older seed tubers, however, yields are generally higher at the time the crop has to be defoliated because of late blight.
It is concluded that especially when the growing period of a potato crop is short, for example as a consequence of an early late blight epidemic, or when a late variety is grown, early tuber growth by the use of older (pre-sprouted) seed tubers is highly important to assure an acceptable yield level at the end of the growing season. Even in years with a long growing season, a late variety like Agria may yield up to 12 t?ha more when physiologically older seed tubers are used.

        abstract = {Milk is normally heat treated in order to obtain safe dairy products with an elongated shelf life as compared to raw milk. New methods, such as infusion pasteurization, for heat treatment of milk are currently being developed. This provides an opportunity for treating milk in a manner that creates different or improved functional properties compared to traditional indirect pasteurization.   
Infusion pasteurization has a time-temperature profile characterized by very rapid heating to relatively high temperatures, short holding times and very rapid cooling, which may lead to products with different properties as compared to products subjected to the standard low pasteurization at 72?C for 15s.
Infusion pasteurization was performed on raw milk with two different holding times (0.1s and 0.7s) and for each holding time samples were drawn at three different temperatures (80?C, 100?C, and 120?C). Samples were compared to raw milk and to milk from the same batch subjected to a standard pasteurization at 72?C for 15s. The size of the casein micelles and the viscosity were measured in skimmed milk samples, using dynamic light scattering and capillary viscometri, respectively.   
The results showed a broadening of the size distributions of the casein micelles as the temperature of the infusion pasteurization increased from 80?C to 120?C with no marked difference between the two holding times. The viscosity also increased with increasing intensity of the infusion pasteurization treatment. Little or no difference was seen between the raw milk, the standard pasteurization and the infusion treatments at 80?C regarding both casein micelle size and viscosity. 
The observed changes in the investigated physical properties of the infusion pasteurization treated milk indicate that this novel pasteurization process might result in milk with altered functionality when used in the production of dairy products. This is currently under investigation.

The skim milk was prepared at a commercial dairy and had been heated to approx. 60?C during the separation process. The whole milk was skimmed by centrifugation prior to the analyses. In the analyses, the infusion pasteurized samples were compared to a standard low pasteurization on the same batches of milk and samples of the raw milks. Particle sizes were analyzed using dynamic light scattering, and the viscosity of the samples were measured with a capillary viscometer.
The viscosity measurements showed no significant changes in viscosity after infusion pasteurization of skim milk, nor did the particle sizes change. On the other hand, when whole milk was infusion pasteurized an increase in viscosity of the skim milk fraction was seen as treatment temperature increased, and an increase in the z-average diameter of particles and broadening of the size distributions was observed. These observations were quite surprising and might be the result of influence of several different processes during and after infusion pasteurization.

In the past, a number of indicators characterizing SOM have been elaborated, which, however, do not allow to draw conclusions on separate management measures or even future development tendencies. A promising approach might be humus balancing, which quantifies and evaluates the humus supply of soils on the basis of crop rotation and fertilization. Comparative studies on adjacent arable sites under both organic and conventional management in different climatic regions of Germany have revealed that the indicator soil organic carbon (SOC) depends mainly on the site conditions, whereas indicators characterizing active SOM like hot water soluble C (Chws), C in microbial biomass (Cmic) and the enzyme activities of {\ensuremath{\beta}}-glucosidase and catalase are stronger related to management methods. It became evident that humus balancing is a good indicator of the active SOM pool and thus also a qualified tool for demonstrating management effects.}

Estonia and the Czech Republic have the highest share (over 7\%) in total organic area of UAA. At the same time these countries have seen a steady decrease of in-conversion area, which limits the potential for further growth. In the organic production structure, grassland and the production of fodder have become the main organic crop areas, mainly in Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia and Latvia. In relation to organic livestock, beef production dominated with 67\% in total CEECs organic livestock units, followed by dairy and sheep production with 14\% and 8\%, respectively, in 2005. Overall, sheep are the most popular species in nearly all CEECs when shares in total production are compared. Despite the rapid growth of organic farming (OF) in CEECs in recent years, the current arrangement of organic production can be noticed as one of many factors hindering the development of the organic food market and diversification of supplies.}

Participants of the public and private sector from eleven countries discussed the opportunities of organic agriculture. The Round Table was organized by FiBL and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy of Ukraine and supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the National Association of Agricultural Advisory Services of Ukraine. 
At the meeting participants shared their experiences with the organic farming development in their countries. Andrzej Dycha, Under-Sectretary of State, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Poland stressed the importance of organic agriculture which has given new prospects to Polish farmers. 12?000 farmers are farming organically in Poland, representing an increase of 500 \% in five years. The farmers are encouraged by national support measures such as research, subsidies for control costs and the rural development activities. Since 2007 an Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming is further strengthening the organic development in the field of information, science, control, economy and promotion.
Deputy Minister Jiri Urban from Czech Republic explained the national support measures contributing to the prosperous domestic market for organic products in Czech Republic. Such measures include the legal framework, an effective control and certification system, support for farmers, eduction of consumers, promotion activities and, since 2007, the support of processing companies.
The second day the Ukraine participants discussed the current draft of the organic agriculture law which is expected to be passed by the Parliament in 2009. In a closed workshop representatives of the Ministries exchanged their experience in the implementation of legal frameworks and explored the potential for further cooperation. It was agreed that further exchange between authorities and certification bodies on the regional level should be supported.

The participants and speakers represented the public and private sector from Ukraine, Albania, Czech Republic, Macedonia FYROM, Moldavia, Montenegro, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland and the EU.

The 1st cut of the different cutting regimes was done either at early shooting, shooting, early heading or seed maturity of Alopecurus pratensis L.. The 2nd cut of the 3 first treatments was simultaneous to the 1st cut of the 4th treatment and was ground dried to allow the seeds to fall on the soil.

With a 1st cut at seed maturity, A. pratensis produced the most seeds and its proportion in the sward increased, but the forage had the lowest quality. In the treatments with the 1st cut at early shooting or at shooting, A. pratensis produced significant quantities of seeds during the 2nd regrowth, maintained its population and forage of intermediate quality was produced. Sustainable production of quality forage on intensive foxtail meadows might be achieved by periodically having the 1st cut at shooting and using the second regrowth at seed maturity for ground dried hay. }

        abstract = {Relatively high levels of milk output are possible from organic clover-based grassland compared with average production on conventional dairy farms in Ireland. Although clover-based swards receiving no fertilizer have relatively low growth in spring, a long grazing season can be achieved by extending the grazing season during the autumn and winter. High growth rates during the summer and autumn and relatively low stocking densities on organic dairy farms facilitate this. Maintaining the clover content of swards is important to maintain productivity. Tight grazing to 4 cm throughout the year and particularly during the late autumn and winter is important. Identifying swards with declining clover contents due to competition from the grass component of the sward or due to hoof damage is also important. These swards need to be over- sown the following year with the target of over-sowing or re-seeding no less than 20\% of the farm each year.}

The objective of the present experiment was to study the need for the protein supplementation in the diet of growing dairy bulls (initial live weight 272 {$\pm$} 28.5 kg and final live weight 666 {$\pm$} 31.2 kg, on average) fed total mixed ration based on moderate digestible grass silage and barley. The experiment comprised 24 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 8 Holstein-Friesian bulls and included four treatments. The control diet (C) consisted of moderate digestible (653 g digestible organic matter in dry matter (DM) grass silage (450 g kg-1 DM), barley grain (275) and barley fibre (275) without protein supplementation. Three isonitrogenous experimental diets included also extra protein, i.e. (1) rapeseed meal (RSM) (supplementation 530 g DM per animal day-1), (2) wet distillers? solubles (WDS) (600 g) and (3) a mixture of barley protein (90\% of fresh weight) and wet distillers? solubles (10) (BPWDS) (480 g). In all isonitrogenous diets the crude protein content of concentrate increased from 137 to 150 g kg-1 DM (9\%) compared with the C diet. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The energy content of all diets was 11.6 MJ kg-1 DM. The live weight gain of the bulls tended to be higher with the BPWDS diet than with the C diet (C 1214 vs. BPWDS 1301 g d-1; p = 0.10), but the treatments had no significant effect on carcass gain, feed conversion or slaughter parameters. Only the BPWDS diet differed significantly from the C diet in DM (C 9.69 vs. BPWDS 10.38 kg DM d-1; p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.01) and energy intake (C 112.4 vs. BPWDS 120.3 MJ d-1; p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05). The apparent organic matter digestibility (OMD) was 5\% higher in the BPWDS diet than in the C diet (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001), but the RSM and WDS diets did not differ from the C diet in OMD. The results indicate that the supply of protein in dairy bulls is most probably adequate with moderate digestible, well-preserved grass silage and barley-based concentrates when intake of digestible organic matter is high enough to support microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. }

Specifically farmers? experiences with cultivation and integration of pigeonpea in maize-based cropping systems are discussed. This includes how the integration of pigeonpea affects the livelihood situation of rural smallholders ? male as well as female in terms of increased food security, increased income, improved gender equity in access to resources etc. While many ?blessings? of integrating the multi-purpose crop pigeonpea in maize-based cropping systems are confirmed, it is also shown that socio-economic and biophysical diversity must be taken into account when evaluating impact of pigeonpea on livelihoods of different groups of farmers.}

The outdoor pigs grew faster during phase 2 than the indoor pigs (p=0.001), although feed conversion ratio did not differ (p=0.358). Dressing percentage was higher for outdoor than for indoor pigs (p=0.011) but lean meat content did not differ (p=0.904). The results indicate a discrepancy between pigs housed in different production systems rather than between pigs directed to different dietary amino acid levels. This suggests that growing?finishing pigs fed ad libitum can compensate for dietary amino acid levels lower than the current Swedish recommendations without affecting production results.
Behaviour was affected by production system and showed that outdoor pigs walked significantly more (p=0.012) and tended to be rooting more (p=0.098) than indoor pigs. Sniffing, nibbling, pushing (p=0.001 for all) and tail manipulation (p=0.002) occurred more often indoors than outdoors. The incidence of pigs seropositive to erysipelas was higher outdoors ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2-test; p=0.001). Ascaris suum infections were present in both production systems, whereas Eimeria sp only was found among outdoor pigs.

Thirty newborn goat kids were randomly assigned to three experimental groups; goat colostrum (GC), cow colostrum (CC) and artificial colostrum (AC). At 2, 28, 56 and 86 days serum GGC and live weight were measured. The three colostrum types were analysed on immunoglobulin G (IgG). Goat colostrum contained twice as much IgG as cow colostrum and artificial colostrum. At 2 and 28 days GC kids had a higher serum GGC than CC and AC kids. At 56 and 86 days no significant differences in serum GGC between the groups were found. No effect of colostrum type on daily weight gain was found.  Eight out of thirty goat kids under study suffered from health problems. Health problems and mortality were heavier among the AC kids. It can be concluded that for a successful passive transfer of immunity goat colostrum is necessary. When it is not possible to provide goat colostrum because of health reasons (disease transmission), cow colostrum is the best alternative. In that case good farm management is even more important. }

Behaviour was observed with video cameras at two consecutive days for 24 hours. From video recordings urinations and defecations, including the corresponding times, were noted. Diagrams of the excretion activity pattern during the day for every weight class and every farm were made. From the figures of the frequency of urinations during the day it was clear, that in all the tree farms there were two excretion peaks ? one in the morning and one in the afternoon-evening hours. Clean areas inside emitted 1.9 g ammonia.day-1m-2 and clean areas ouside ? 2.7 gday-1m-2. Inside polluted areas had a higher emission than the polluted areas on the outside yard ? 13.3 gday-1m-2  vs 11.4 gday-1m-2, resp.

presented in this report.
The main aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform Defra policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming. This research builds on previous work on the economics of organic farming carried out by the Institute of Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University (Projects OF0190, covering 1995?96 to 1998?99 and OF0189, covering 1999?00 to 2004?05).
In this report, time series financial data are shown for an identical farm sample for the 2004?05 and 2005?06 financial years, covering seven organic farm types including cropping, horticulture, lowland and LFA dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep and mixed farming systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both 2004?05 and 2005?06. The total number of organic farms for 2005?06, also referred to as
the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets. 
Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines1. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some reasonable level of confidence in the data; however, it should be noted that the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type, although the results can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and
conventional farms. Smaller identical farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have some influence on  he average results. 
An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data (obtained from the main FBS sample) for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment indicators for individual organic farms. Broadly speaking, the indicators included farm type, FBS region, Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota holding (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples.
Overall, the identical samples of organic farms showed similar or lower levels of net farm incomes for all farm types in 2005?06 than in 2004?05, with the exception of cropping farms and arable farms with field vegetables, which increased over the period.  Although market conditions were starting to improve for many enterprises during this period, cost increases cancelled out many of the gains. However, compared with similar conventional farms, organic farms performed as well or better on average, and bstantially better for the cropping and mixed farm types.}

In this report, financial data are shown for the 2005?06 and 2006?07 financial years, including between year comparisons and comparisons with similar conventional farms. For this report only, it has not been possible to produce identical samples for all farm types due to the change in data collection approach between 2005?06 and 2006?07. Identical sample comparisons have only been possible for lowland dairy and lowland and LFA cattle and
sheep systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both the 2005?06 and 2006?07 datasets. The total number of organic farms for 2006?07, also
referred to as the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets. In the other cases, data for the full samples in 2005?06 and 2006?07 are presented, but comparisons should be treated with caution due to changes in sample composition. 
Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on
current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some
reasonable level of confidence in the data although it should be noted that the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type. However, the results can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and conventional
farms. Smaller farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have a significant influence on the average results. 
An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data (obtained from the main FBS sample) for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment indicators for individual organic farms. The indicators included farm type, FBS region, Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota held (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples. 
The identical samples of organic farms showed a much higher level of net farm incomes for lowland dairy and lowland  cattle and sheep in 2006?07 than in 2005?06, with LFA cattle and sheep showing a small decrease over the period. Overall, organic net farm incomes exceeded conventional in all sectors, with most sectors showing an organic NFI
twice that of the comparative conventional NFI. Increased organic prices and only small cost increases have led to substantial increases in organic NFI, especially in the livestock sectors.}

        abstract = {This farm-scale analysis of the three-year transition to organic from conventional vegetable production tracked the changes in crop, soil, pest and management on two ranches (40 and 47 ha) in the Salinas Valley, California. Many small plantings of a diverse set of cash crop and cover crop species were used, as compared to only a few species in large monocultures in conventional production. The general trends with time were: increase in soil biological indicators, low soil nitrate pools, adequate crop nutrients, minor disease and weed problems, and sporadic mild insect damage. Some crops and cultivars consistently produced higher yields than others, relative to the maximum yield for a given crop. Differences in insect and disease damage were also observed. These results support the value of initially using a biodiverse set of taxa to reduce risk, then later choosing the best-suited varieties for optimal production. The grower used some principles of organic farming (e.g., crop diversity, crop rotation, and organic matter management), but also relied on substitution-based management, such as fertigation with soluble nutrients, initially heavy applications of organic pesticides, and use of inputs derived from off-farm sources. The organic transition was conducive to both production goals and environmental quality. }

Plots were either fertilized with high or low amounts of mineral fertilizer or cattle manure since 27 years. At low fertilization levels there was no difference in yield between minerally and organically fertilized plants. High levels of mineral fertilizer application reduced wheat yields. Probable reasons can be that either the high nitrogen availability was less effectively used for grain development of minerally fertilized plants, or the mineral fertilization rendered the plants more sensitive towards drought stress. The extent of AM fungal root colonization appeared to depend on the plant P nutritional status rather than the type of fertilizer applied. The low fertilization treatments showed higher rates of AM root colonization. The number of AM spores, however, was higher in organically compared with minerally fertilized soil, indicating that organic fertilization increased reproduction of these beneficial microbes under dry soil conditions.}

In previous trials some 6-7 cultivars have usually been included in one block. Our results imply that the efficiency of testing procedures could be improved by using a block size as small as 4-5. The results further imply that if an experiment with an incomplete block design is well planned to mitigate the effects of within-block heterogeneity, the spatial mixed model techniques and the conventional analysis of variance techniques have approximately the same efficiency in testing pairwise yield differences. Thus, if appropriate blocking strategies are used in planning the trials, there is usually no need to change the conventional practice followed in statistical analysis.}

In addition to the amino acid profile the digestibility of the nutrients is important for the productivity of the fish production. The digestibility of the diets were determined in cylindrical tanks with the bottom of each tank being conical with a ball-valve at the outlet. At this outlet a container for collecting faeces was mounted. 
The collection method was compared with the stripping method. For this purpose yttriumoxide was added to the feed as a marker. The protein digestibilities were close for both methods, i.e. about 91-93 \% with the lowest values using the stripping method.

        abstract = {Twenty winter wheat varieties used as parents in a half diallel crossing programme for the production of wheat populations were grown in field trials at two organic and two non-organic sites over three years in England. Yields of the varieties between the two non-organic sites were highly correlated, but less so between the two organic sites and between the non-organic and organic sites. At the non-organic sites, most of the variation in yield (60\%) was due to varietal differences, whereas, at the organic sites, it was due largely to the effects of environment (79\%), and genotypic variation only accounted for 9\%. More detailed analysis, using AMMI (Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction), allowed stricter comparisons among individual varieties. With the exception of the variety Deben, different varieties performed well in terms of yield and stability in the two systems. In particular, Tanker performed well in the non-organic trials, but was below average under organic conditions, whereas Renan gave the reverse response. The results indicate the importance of specific trials for non-organic and organic variety performance evaluation.

        abstract = {This research review notes that cereal variety breeding in the last 50 years has been based on pedigree line bred varieties as part of the development of a production system dependent on oil-based inputs. The characteristics desirable for an organic system are frequently at odds with those designed for non-organic systems. Despite this, varietal choice for organic farmers remains largely from the pool of varieties developed for non-organic production. The challenges to address are on what basis can farmers and advisers select varieties, and how to develop varieties suitable for organic production. Plant characteristics are discussed and main desirable features outlined under the headings of: 
? Nutrient use efficiency
? Disease resistance
? Weed competitive ability
? Quality
Breeding selection parameters are then considered. The wide variation that occurs in organic systems and the aim to improve the consistency of performance (yield stability) means that the adaptability of a single variety is not sufficient to buffer these variables. The place for variety mixes is considered, and then the case for composite cross populations. The development of these alternative approaches is hindered by market acceptability and for composite populations by the legislative framework. The conclusions note there are many and different combinations of characteristics that may be of advantage. The suitability of a variety can be affected by the management of the whole organic system, not just one crop in isolation. The situation is complex and selection of genotypes is best undertaken under organic management. Low input line breeding programmes have achieved some success, but the review argues that better environmental adaptation is achieved by genotype diversity, either as variety mixes or as composite populations. For the future there is potential in the (relatively) short term for line breeding under organic conditions. For the longer term there is opportunity in mixtures, and especially of populations. For these to be successfully developed there is a need to address cultural attitudes, inertia in the market and production infrastructure and legislative framework.}

The use of copper is probably the most important factor for russeting. Therefore a worst

there was a particular interest in the effects on russeting of potassium bicarbonate
(Armicarb) because this product might be an important element in a copper free fungicide
scheme. Application of Armicarb was investigated on wet or dry canopy and effects of two
different dosages were studied. All the schemes were compared with a worst case organic
fungicide scheme with copper. The experiment was done on two year old Elstar trees
because Elstar is the most important organically grown cultivar in the Netherlands. Effects
of the schedules on russet and scab control were evaluated. At harvest no effects were
found on scab. Between the different schemes with copper no differences were found in
amount of russet. Only the highest dosage of Armicarb (10 kg?ha) and the schedules with
Armicarb on a wet canopy gave more russet compared with the worst case scheme. Also
effects on fruit rot were evaluated.}

The effect of the combined use of entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi on thrips should be investigated, in comparison to the effect of either pathogen alone. Commercially available products, Mycotal? (Koppert NL), PreFeRal? (Biobest BE), Naturalis L? (Intrachem IT), Nemaplus? and Nemagreen? (both E-Nema DE), were used. The trials were performed in onion, leek and chives, according to the EPPO guideline PP 1?85(3). Perfekthion? was used as chemical standard in onion. In leek, Spruzit? and Neudosan? were applied alternately. No chemical standard was applied in chives. The biocontrol products were applied either alone or in a mixture using common spray equipment. The nematodes were applied at a rate of 1x106 infective juveniles?m2. The dosage of the fungi was 1 kg (1.5 l in the case of Naturalis L?)?ha. The treatments started mid June and were repeated up to six times in weekly intervals.
Insect pressure was low at all four sites, throughout the summer. T. tabaci was recorded only in medium numbers (mean of 30 specimen?plant max.). In two trials, no differences were detected between the treatments and the control. In the third trial (onion), a significant reduction was recorded for the treatment ?PreFeRal?Nemaplus?, both in the number of thrips?plant (2 compared to 6 in the control) and the frequency of infestation (38 \% compared to 93 \% in the control), one week after the final application (3 times in total). Also in the fourth trial (leek), the number of thrips?plant was lowest for the treatments ?fungi?nematode? (4 compared to 7 in the control), one week after the final application (6 times in total). In this trial, yield was measured additionally, and the weight?plant registered at harvest was 20 \% higher for the treatments ?Nemaplus? and ?Mycotal?Nemaplus? than in the control (425 and 412 g?plant compared to 345 g respectively).
The results presented here, show that the use of biocontrol nematodes and fungi need not be restricted to protected environments, field application against insects on the upper parts of plants is possible. Moreover, their combination has the potential to give a better reduction of the pest population than each agent alone. In consideration of the extreme weather conditions in Germany in 2003, and in comparison to the effect of the chemical standards, the results are regarded as promising. However, each crop situation needs its own proof of feasibility, since factors like the microclimate, created by the plant?s individual characteristics and the canopy it forms, may influence the activity of the pathogens and by this their efficacy.}

However, most OVPS research is carried out in developed countries, mainly under temperate or subtropical climatic conditions. Institutionalized research in organic farming in most tropical countries appears to be relatively new, and it is not a significant focus for the International Agricultural Research Centers. Tropical farmers in Asia producing vegetables organically, whether by design or default, must overcome significant challenges organic growers in temperate climates seldom face, including a lack of suitable varieties, heavy rainfall and the year-round presence of pests. According to our online literature survey, tomato is the vegetable most commonly researched in organic farming, followed by lettuce, carrot and cucumber; we found little research on crops important to tropical Asia, such as eggplant, chili pepper, different cucurbits such as gourds, and locally important indigenous vegetables. To improve and promote OVPS in tropical countries, institutional research is needed to identify and develop vegetable varieties, alternative crop protection and management methods better suited to the tropics.}

A new application domain is row crops, where small AGV?s will perform weed control around individual crop plants. This paper defines the requirements and scope of a process- and behaviour-based scripting language needed to control the weeding AGV in an agricultural row crop. The goal is to traverse and cover the whole field with no human auxiliary input during the field operation. The basis is the transparent and tactical real-time control language (CL) for small mobile robots (SMR). This SMR-CL has been modified to include some necessary motion commands and a supplemental supervisory function to monitor and record the progressive coverage of the field. The control language was then tested by applying it to a scenario representing typical field conditions for row crops. The construction of a suitable SMR-CL script for use in a field clearly demonstrates the feasibility of adapting behaviour-based control systems to field structures. The conducted case study indicated the importance of including goal-directing modules. Such a module is described here as the ?supervisory field coverage monitor? (SFCM), which acts to coordinate the behaviours. The applicability of this modified SMR-CL has been successfully demonstrated using a vehicle test in a specially designed artificial row crop field. The analysis of the operational performance verified that it is possible to cover all rows in a field without conducting time-consuming planning procedures.}

Therefore, there were 105 weed species  in organic fields and 52 in conventional fields. More of the endangered species (Red List species) were found in organic fields. Low species diversity observed in 2003 compared to that in 1988 in the same field was attributed to higher temperature and low rainfall in the recent years. The question arises if under increasing temperature and dryness the diversity of species is regressing and endangered the biodiversity of weeds and linked with that also insects and other species as well as offers space for weeds with strong competition to cultivated crops.}

        abstract = {The organic sector is addressing climate change through a number of initiatives including label-ling, and in the case of one UK certifier in 2007, a proposed restriction on organic certification for products that are airfreighted to market. The International Trade Centre and the Danish Insti-tute for International Studies examined the economic impact in Africa of banning certification for airfreighted products. 
The study based on interviews with UK importers, retailers, African exporters and organic smallholders showed that a ban could have serious local economic impact in some of the poor-est rural communities in the world. A minimum of 21,500 livelihoods would be compromised. Women, youth and small producers would be hardest hit and several exporter-producers would simply go out of business while others would revert to conventional production. The producers have on average a carbon footprint 1?50th of the average EU citizen.
The study also showed that in the vast majority of cases, freight by sea or road was simply not an alternative. Hence a ban would also hamper the development of the organic market in the UK as early counter seasonal produce would be removed from the shelves and exporters would hesitate to make future investments in organic production. Consumers would have no choice but to buy air freighted conventional products instead of organic ones.
The certifier proposed that certification be conditional upon ethical or fair trade certification and upon planning for 'reducing any remaining dependence on air freight'. This decision was taken without any serious involvement of developing-country organic operators who would be the ones mostly affected by it. Follow up analysis showed that this action was discriminatory as it ignored other energy intensive areas of the supply chain (e.g. distribution to retailers in the end market) and that EU farmers receive fuel subsidies. There were moreover a number of unre-solved issues related to ethical or fair trade certification that would prevent many operators from pursuing this option. 
The example illustrates that the inclusion of climate change issues into organic standards needs very careful consideration in order not to produce effects that are socially unjust and?or envi-ronmentally harmful. It also shows the need for organic producers and exporters in developing countries to develop a much stronger voice in the end markets where organic standard setting takes place, including dialogue with private standard setters and the IFOAM EU group and lob-bying work in EU institutions. Finally, developing country operators need to continuously review and adapt their use of standards in addition to organic certification ('organic?') in response to changes in demand. Enhancing their capacities in these regards is the joint responsibility of the organic movements in the North and the South. }

They can be produced by the farmers themselves and applied in well controlled amounts flexibly in time and space. Most research investigating the N mineralization of grain legume seeds was carried out using coarsely milled seeds. We hypothesized that seed germination alters the chemical composition leading to a higher N release compared to seed meal. In a pot experiment the C:N ratio of lupine seeds was shown to decrease noticeably within the first two weeks after sowing. After an incubation period of 1300?Cd net N mineralization was significantly higher for the lupine seedlings compared to the seed meal and close relationships between N mineralization and C:N ratio were found. In field experiments with white cabbage, carried out in 2005 and 2006, similar relationships were found but sowing followed by an early incorporation of seedlings after 12 and 13 days showed an N supply similar to the seed meal treatment only. Strong priming effects, mainly caused by the lupine seed meal, are discussed to be a possible reason. Late incorporation after 42 and 37 days resulted in significantly lower N supply and cabbage yield.}

Historical data were used to determine if the warm springs experienced in recent decades have influenced time of sowing of spring cereals (barley, wheat and oats), potato and sugar beet in Finland. The start of the thermal growing season was used to represent all climatic factors affecting sowing time. Regional anomalies in sowing and start of growing season were computed for the years 1965?2007. The start of the growing season was 2?2.8 days earlier per decade, with a steeper increase since 1980. Sugar beet sowing advanced 2.5 (since 1980 5.2) and potato planting 3.4 (since 1980 4.5) days per decade, more than expected solely due to earlier starts to the growing season. Sowing of spring cereals advanced 0.6, 0.7 and 1.7 days per decade in the east, north and west respectively (since 1980 1.0, 1.9 and 3.1), with statistically significant trend (p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.01) in the west. Earlier sowings can be largely explained by warmer springs, but the trend was not as steep as that for the growing season. This has however not led to increased temperatures during early vegetative phases and thus faster development and increased drought or pest risk, which would have reduced the positive effects of earlier sowing on yield potential. Earlier sowing detected in the west can be explained by changes in spring temperatures, but may also result from economic and technological development. Farmers seem to have adequately adjusted their field activities to the changes in spring temperatures. }

nitrogen from organic products depends on the speed of their mineralization which is
primarily influenced by the composition and formulation of their raw material.
In apple production in the Alps-region especially during spring problems with nitrogen
supply are common. In that period, the weather conditions are sometimes bad, the
temperature in the soil is low and mineralization starts slowly - apple trees demand more
nitrogen than the soil can deliver.
To compensate the demand of the apple tree organic growers can not use mineral
fertilizers but only organic fertilizers and soil conditioners whose mineralization rate is often
unknown. There is a strong need in organic fruit production to receive more information
about the behaviour of fertilizers in the soil especially concerning their N-release under
different conditions.
To acquire that information, incubation experiments under controlled conditions
(temperature, type of soil, humidity of the soil) were carried out in the laboratory to
determine the mineralization-rate of different organic fertilizers and soil conditioners which
are available in our region.}

        abstract = {After the first news items concerning raised dioxin levels in eggs from hens with outdoor access were published in the summer of 2001, Wageningen UR carried out intensive research activities to understand the problem and to find a way to manage the problem.
In 2004 the first Wageningen UR report on this issue was published. It described the possible factors that were associated with high egg dioxin levels in organic poultry farms. The most striking feature was the number of laying hens on the farm. Small and middle sized farms regularly produced eggs that exceeded the dioxin levels set out by the EU. In a follow-up study the relationship between egg dioxin levels and flock size was further analyzed and on-farm control measures were tested. Flock size was shown to be correlated with the use of the outdoor run. Two explanations were found for this observation. The first explanation is that large farms only open the barn doors late in the morning or even at the beginning of the afternoon. Small farms, on the other hand, often do not have doors at all or open them early in the morning. Furthermore, it turns out that the amount of time spent in the outdoor run is inversely related with the size of the flock. Hens from a large flock spend no more than 20\% of the available time outside. The increasing scale of organic poultry systems thus already diminishes the problem with dioxin levels. Especially since large-scale organic poultry farms have a market share of 99\% in The Netherlands. Various observations from the current project confirm the hypothesis that duration of outdoor run use is related to egg dioxin levels. On one farm with the same flock of hens, but kept under three different management systems, we found a direct relation between duration of outdoor run use and egg dioxin levels. Secondly, on farms where we decreased the amount of time that the hens were allowed outside and fed them inside the barn, egg dioxin levels dropped markedly. Thirdly, we noted a marked lowering of egg dioxin levels after hens were confined inside the barn due to a potential threat of aviary influenza infection from wild birds. When outside, hens pick up soil, worms and insects. The dioxins present in these are transferred very efficiently to the hens? eggs. The longer the hens stay outside, the higher the intake from these sources, which results in high egg dioxin levels. Historical pollution of the soil with dioxins is the main cause of dioxin in the eggs of hens kept in outdoor runs. We found a clear correlation between dioxin levels in soil and in eggs from chickens kept on this soil. This project showed that replacing contaminated soil with fresh sand resulted in a marked drop in the egg dioxin levels. Although worms and other micro fauna could contribute to the egg dioxin levels, we still do not know what the relative contribution from these sources is as compared to the contribution from soil uptake. The knowledge that was gained with this project can now be used to efficiently control egg dioxin levels in poultry with outdoor access, by taking measures mainly directed at the duration of outdoor run use. Thanks to these measures and
the introduction of a dioxin monitoring protocol, dioxin levels can nowadays be managed quite easily. Small organic enterprises still need some attention, as they generally do not take part in the dioxin monitoring protocol, due to economic reasons. Their market share however, is less than 1\%.}

Recent calculations of the disease burden of toxoplasmosis rank this foodborne disease at the same level as salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis. The high disease burden in combination with disappointing results of the currently available treatment options have led to a plea for more effective prevention. In this review we describe Toxoplasma as a hazard associated with the consumption of undercooked meat or meat products and provide an analysis of the various options to control the risk of human toxoplasmosis via this source. Monitoring and surveillance programs may be implemented for pre-harvest control of Toxoplasma infection of farm animals, with the reduction of environmental oocyst load as the most important milestone. Alternatively, Toxoplasma safe meat can be obtained through simple post-harvest decontamination procedures, whereby freezing the meat may currently be the best option, although new technologies using irradiation or high-pressure treatment may offer promising alternatives. Influence of culture, religion and food handling customs may predispose a certain type of meat as an important source of infection, indicating that prevention needs to be tailored according to social habits in different regions in the world. The rationale for more stringent control measures to prevent toxoplasmosis both from disease and economic points of view is emphasized.

This issue was addressed in the current study by combining a 4-month rodent control campaign and a 7-month longitudinal analysis of T. gondii seroprevalence in slaughter pigs. Three organic pig farms with known rodent infestation were included in the study. On these farms, presence of T. gondii in trapped rodents was evaluated by real-time PCR. All rodent species and shrews investigated had T. gondii DNA in brain or heart tissue. Prevalence was 10.3\% in Rattus norvegicus, 6.5\% in Mus musculus, 14.3\% in Apodemus sylvaticus and 13.6\% in Crocidura russula. Initial T. gondii seroprevalence in the slaughter pigs ranged between 8\% and 17\% and dropped on the three farms during the rodent control campaign to 0?10\%, respectively. After 4 months of rodent control, T. gondii infection was absent from pigs from two of the three farms investigated and appeared again in one of those two farms after the rodent control campaign had stopped. This study emphasizes the role of rodents and shrews in the transmission of T. gondii to pigs and the importance of rodent control towards production of T. gondii-free pig meat.}

On the other hand, this is due to the fact that the organic market offers producers and trading companies in the South and East excellent export opportunities. How can developing countries develop local and regional markets? The promotion of organic markets ?? both on local and international level ? gets more and more attention in agricultural policies and in development cooperation. One big challenge is to support trade rules and favourable business conditions up to comprehensive national action plans in order to support the development of the organic market. Special focus needs the development of domestic markets for organic food products. There is a need for accompanying measures such as regional and national promotion activities, development of regional labels and capacity building. In each socio-economic environment, such initiatives and development programmes are differently. The paper analyzes examples of organic market development strategies, promotions programmes and projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America.}

To maintain the efficacy of anthelmintics is an important objective. The current project aims at the investigation of the current efficacy of macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics for strongylid nematodes in first season grazing (FSG) calves in Northern Germany. On 8 participating farms in Northern Germany faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) with ivermectin (IVM) were performed. On 3 farms the efficacy of IVM was found to be {$\leq$}90\% and on only 4 farms it was {\ensuremath{>}} 95\% at 14 days post treatment (d.p.t.). Only 2 farms showed a reduction ? 95\% at 21 d.p.t.. This survey reveals a rising problem of AR. The problem of drug resistance places the welfare of animals at risk. In organic farming, without a preventive treatment, livestock may harbour high worm counts. Therefore it is necessary to maintain powerful anthelmintic drugs to guarantee the welfare of animals that need salvage treatment. To investigate the AR problem in cattle more surveys with different anthelmintic drug classes are urgently needed.}

        abstract = {Background: Mistletoe extracts (Viscum album extracts, VAE) such as ISCADOR, have been used successfully in human oncology for many years. In veterinary medicine, there have been reports of successful treatment, but scientific data on efficacy are lacking. Two studies were therefore conducted to assess whether VAE can serve as an adjunct to standard treatment in horses and cats.
Methods: As part of a placebo-controlled double-blind study (study 1), 53 horses with equine sarcoid (a solitary or multifocal skin tumor) were treated with VAE pini (pine mistletoe) in progressively increasing doses (n=32) or with a sodium chloride solution (n=21). Three times a week for 15 weeks. All horses were observed over a period of 12 months for tumor recurrence and cure. In an observational study (study 2), 44 cats with fibrosarcoma, a very common skin tumor with a high rate of recurrence, were treated postoperatively with 0.1\% (0.5ml per dose) oral VAE quercus (oak mistletoe) twice daily, and disease free survival was measured.
Results: In study 1, treatment with ISCADOR led to significantly better results than placebo. Improvement was seen in 41\% of the cases (placebo 14\%), and cure was achieved in 28\% of the cases (placebo 14\%). In study 2, disease-free survival time in cats treated postoperatively with VAE quercus was 438 days compared with 365 to 475 days for conventional chemotherapies and 120 to 261 days for surgery alone, as seen in literature. Aggressive surgery combined with radiation and chemotherapy led to markedly superior results (661 to 986 days).
Conclusion: The study 1 was able to demonstrate, for the first time, the efficacy of VAE compared to placebo control. This study also showed that the effect of VAE apparently extends considerably beyond the treatment period; unexpectedly, only very few recurrences were observed between the end of treatment and the 12th month of observation.  The results of the study 2 show that oral administration of mistletoe preparations also yields satisfactory prophylactic effects. The discussion surrounding oral treatment and the question whether it can replace injection treatment must therefore be continued, even in human medicine. }

In order to identify important risk factors during the laying period as well as during the rearing period in an exploratory epidemiological approach, we followed birds from 23 organic rearing units in Austria and Germany to 46 laying units. Management and housing conditions were recorded during one day visits in the 16th to 18th and 30th to 40th week of age, respectively. As an indicator of feather pecking, feather conditions of random samples of 30 hens per laying farm were assessed. Average feather scores from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) were calculated. The average score of 0.73 ({$\pm$} 0.44) was not significantly different from the score of 0.77 ({$\pm$} 0.33) from 54 conventional farms assessed in the same way (p=0.247). 73 \% of the total variance in feather score between the different organic farms could be explained by 6 variables. About 79 \% of the explained variation was due to rearing conditions. The major risk factors for poor plumage were little elevated perch space, few drinking places and no regular scattering of grain during the rearing period, as well as poor litter quality during the laying period. It is concluded that these are feasible starting points for improved prevention strategies against feather pecking.}

The analysis indicates that organic farmers, compared to their conventional counterparts, are more likely to have larger farms, more education, be located closer to urban areas, be crop farmers, have 'sustainable and environment-friendly farming' as a goal and hold favourable views about the values of organic farming methods. Even though the farmers who are planning to convert seem to be more business-minded and less organically oriented than the existing organic producers, policies for promoting organic farming which confine itself to financial considerations may miss important factors which prompt farmers to convert.}

Important factors seem to be public regulations including standards for organic farming, agronomy, economy, and farm exit. While many organic farmers with relatively small holdings have opted out, farmers with more land and larger herds tend to convert to organic agriculture. The trend towards larger-scale farms in organic than in conventional agriculture, encouraged by the design of the organic farming payments, challenges the organic principles of diversity and fairness. Means should be considered to ensure that small organic enterprises are also economically viable.}

organic farming scab control depends on the use of fungicides based on copper or
sulphur. Since the use of copper will be restricted in the European Union and the use of
sulphur often leads to insufficient control and phytotoxicity, alternative control measures
are needed. The use of microbial antagonists may be an alternative to fungicides for scab
control.
Scab epidemics during summer are driven by conidia produced only on apple leaves. In
this situation, antagonists present in the phyllosphere may interfere with conidia of the
pathogen during sporulation or infection. Within the EU-funded project REPCO, more than
hundred fungi were isolated from sporulating scab colonies and tested on apple seedlings
for their potential to reduce sporulation of the pathogen. Since the aim of the study was to
contribute to the development of a biocontrol product, only candidates were selected which
fulfilled a range of additional criteria considering major constraints in development of
biocontrol products. The best antagonists were applied under orchard conditions during
two growing seasons. The antagonist H39 significantly reduced sporulation of V.
inaequalis after most applications. However, in a few cases no effect was found.}

Thus, a method to reduce this risk may be to slaughter the pigs at a low age and weight. This strategy is investigated as part of a new concept for organic pig production. It is hypothesised that organic pork has to differ markedly from conventional in order to overcome the heavy price competition. A seasonal outdoor rearing system based on production of small entire males, large female pigs and sows slaughtered after their first litter is believed to be a feasible strategy for producing organic pork with high credibility and superior eating quality. The study included a traditional breed, the Danish Black-Spotted. 17 gilts farrowed in April. Within the first week after birth all male pigs, except 2 male pigs per litter, were castrated. The piglets were weaned at 10 weeks of age in June?July but stayed in the paddocks with access to the farrowing hut. The entire male pigs were slaughtered in July at approximately 40 kg live weight. The female pigs were slaughtered in the beginning of November. hvad med Preliminary results showed e.g. a higher daily gain for entire males compared to castrated (390 vs. 332 g per day) and indicated higher content of skatole in the traditional breed compared to a more modern breed.

artificial insemination is permitted but natural mating is preferred. The outdoor multi-sire system, where the sows are placed in large paddocks with a group of boars, is one example of a service system, which complies well with the organic ideals of facilitating natural animal behavior. However, very little knowledge is available about such system. Seven groups of in total of 47 sows and 31 boars were observed to study the mating behavior in an outdoor multi-sire mating system and the subsequent reproduction results. The time of start of courtship, behavior and the cause of disruption if the courtship was terminated, were recorded each time a boar courted a sow. All aggressive interactions between the boars were also recorded to estimate the boar ranking order. The observations revealed numerous poor quality matings, a huge variation in the number of times sows are mated, and overworked boars. Only 35\% of all copulations lasted 2 min or more and 63\% of all copulations were disrupted, mainly by competitor boars. The higher social status of the boar, the more copulations did it disrupt ( p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05). The outcome was an unacceptable variation in reproduction results. Only 71\% of all estrus sows conceived, corresponding to a pregnancy rate of 77\% of all mated sows. A large inter-group variation in reproduction performance was observed, indicating scope for improvements. In some groups all sows showed estrus and
all sows conceived. Recommendations for improvement of the system are proposed.}

The veterinarian can use any medicine, which is effective for the indication and the animal species. If possible, effective homeopathics, phytotherapeutics or the like should have priority. 
Problems of implementing the EC organic regulation into the daily farm practice arise mostly from the doubling of the withdrawal period and the restriction of the numbers of treatments. The strict ban on prophylactic treatments is not mentioned any longer in the new regulation 834?2007, which shall apply as from 1st January 2009.
Clarification of the guidelines for animal treatments in organic farming seems to be useful for farmers, veterinarians and boards of control.

formulations as alternatives to GF-120 were used to define the right food bait quality for a
high attractiveness and low reproduction ability. Beyond, the negative effect on
reproduction of flies for azadirachtin (neem) was shown. During this project, promising
results, e.g. efficacies up to 99 \% with infestation rates below the infestation threshold
were obtained. From 2008 on, other insecticides, like azadirachtin (neem) and pyrethrine
in an appropriate food bait mixture will be used. Questions like efficacy, adequate

        abstract = {Agricultural biodiversity and climate change are rarely discussed in the same context. However, there are close mutual links. Biodiversity is reduced through climate change and ? at the same time ? is a strategic resource for coping with its consequences: The entirety of plants, animals and microorganisms in agricultural ecosystems and their genetic diversity represent the re-source base for food. 
With genetic resources gaining a new quality, present conservation approaches have to be re-vised. Instead of ex-situ conservation in gene banks a broader concept has to be envisaged which emphasises farmer conservation and is complemented by gene banks. The reason is twofold:
 	As future needs are unknown, a maximum of genetic resources has to be conserved at the lowest possible public cost. On-farm conservation is not necessarily less costly, but the costs are mainly borne by farmers while it produces both private and public benefits;
 	Secondly, adaptation of genetic resources to environmental change is necessary, a process that requires exposure to the environment, instead of being stored deep-frozen in a gene bank. 
Civil society organisations have taken a front-runner position in developing and spreading suit-able concepts at grassroots level. They have catalysed worldwide a boom of farmer initiatives that practise organic agriculture based on maintaining biodiversity, avoiding the use of hybrid seeds and prohibiting transgenic crops. Secondly, they are increasingly supporting local seed conservation initiatives that aim to empower local communities to protect their biodiversity and defend their community rights to seeds and knowledge. Thirdly, they have founded an alterna-tive market for plant breeding and seed production. Mainly in Europe, various initiatives have emerged that maintain, improve and make available open-pollinating varieties of cereals and vegetables, many of which are the result of crossbreeding and selection over centuries and in danger of being lost. 
All such activities make very clear: genetic resources must remain largely in the public domain with well-balanced benefit-sharing concepts among the various stakeholders that use and con-serve agro-genetic resources.

The insects and the leaves of potatoes were sprayed with the insecticide. Thus, the insecticide was toxic by exposure to treated surfaces and ingestion. Three concentrations of insecticide were used: 0.2\%, 0.1\% and 0.05\%. The effect was assessed the 6th day after treatment. All concentrations caused mortality both adults and larvae; however mortality of tested insect stages increased as concentration of spinosad increased. For adults was observed the highest mortality in combination with 0.2\% at 150C, whereas at this same temperature in combination with 0.1\% was reached the lowest mortality. In tests with the larvae was observed that 0.2\% of spinosad caused the lowest mortality at 250C, whereas concentration 0.1\% of spinosad reached the best results at this same temperature. For adults and larvae concentrations 0.05\% of spinosad reached the lowest mortality and differences between results in this combination depend on temperature were not observed.}

We have studied the importance of root growth and N uptake to a depth of 2.5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15N. These data were used for calculation of the potential rate of nitrate uptake below 1 m depth. The rate was found to be significant for the six crops studied. The effect of root depth on soil N left by an annual crop was simulated with the EU-rotate N model. The results showed that deep rooted crops exploit deep N when it is available and thereby reduce the amount of nitrate that is prone to leaching. Therefore deep roots and N uptake need to be considered to understand and model N cycling in agro-ecosystems.}

Research on organic weed management (OWM) in herb and vegetable production is increasing internationally, although in Australia very little work has been done to assess current OWM knowledge among growers, and to test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of the weed management practices used by organic growers. The effect of hand weeding, tillage, hay mulch, pelletised paper mulch and an unweeded control treatment on weed growth, crop growth and cost effectiveness were evaluated in several field trials on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales using lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and echinacea (Echinacea purpurea Moench. ?L.?). Weed management in lettuce was cost-effectively achieved using cheaper weeding methods such as tillage. More expensive methods such as hand weeding and hay mulching controlled weeds well, but were less cost effective. For echinacea, cheaper in-crop weeding methods (e.g. tillage, unweeded control) had poor weed suppression and low crop yields, while the more expensive weeding methods, hand weeding and hay mulch, controlled weeds well and were cost effective. Paper mulch controlled weeds very well but, again, had lower yields and was therefore not cost effective. The results highlight several important advantages and disadvantages of currently used OWM methods in the field.}

service through the whole production chain or chain of service activities. How
comprehensive this is, depends on the system boundaries of the particular
assessment. And at its best, LCA is not only restricted to principal system but covers
or makes linkages to periferic systems of production of process inputs (for instance
energy) and further processing of secondary or waste based products. LCA is a good
tool for development of zero-waste or carbon neutral systems. LCA is a highly
potential tool in benchmarking between various activity areas of society or economy
(Nissinen et al 2007), and in a few years it will be developed as a tool to benchmark
different food products and various brands of one category of food stuffs. By LCA such
new issues as virtual water will be easily handled.
LCA can be used in communication between food supply and demand. For that
purpose, results of LCA must be carefully modified to the cognitive frame and decision
making framework of consumer groups and stakeholders of a food chain. The
information based on LCA thinking has to be given from different sources and variable
aspects to consumers. The strongest progress will be taken if LCA is integrated into
integrated product policy (IPP) and IPP would be taken as an approach to reorient
environmental policy of food production. In that case, environmental policy would be
directly linked to food product quantity and quality, and as such linked to food
security.
But, LCA and the other neighbouring assessment systems are linking food supply
chain into more or less ?unified?, standard environment. LCA is as poor in taking into
account diversity in natural ecological framework and in human society. Therefore it is
a fortune, that many progressive companies that first started to publish environmental
reports have very quickly extended their approach to corporate social responsibility
report. In terms of environmental assessment there is now a big challenge on one
hand in trying to develop LCA towards assessment of impacts on biodiversity and
natural resilience or ecosystem services and on the other hand to develop the
qualitative environmental assessment and integrated that into socioeconomic?cultural
approach of CRS assessments.

        abstract = {Despite the considerable interest in organic farming the Irish organic sector remains small. Therefore to target support for the sector it is important to understand why farmers make decisions in favour or against organic farming as well as to identify drivers and barriers affecting that decision. Adoption of organic farming is assumed to be driven by a variety of different reasons such as economic and socio-economic, structural and institutional factors (e.g. Defrancesco et al., 2008; Burton et al, 2003). However, information gathering (e.g. Genius et al, 2006) and attitudes of the farmer (e.g. Willock et al, 1999, Hattam, 2006, Rehman et al, 2007) are also important in that decision.
This paper focuses on the role that the attitudes of farmers play in identifying drivers and barriers to the intention to convert to organic farming using the theory of planned behaviour. To set this paper in context, it is part of a larger study which aims to explain the decision to adopt or not to adopt organic farming over time with respect to a variety of factors such as economic, institutional and socio-economic as well as comparing the attitudes and objectives of organic and conventional farmers.
The results presented here suggest that, under current circumstances, large-scale conversion to organic farming by drystock farmers within the next five years is uncertain, but nevertheless 6\% of drystock farmers state considerable interest in going organic. It appears that farmers do not have strong opinions about organic farming but equally the results here suggest that they feel they do not have a good level of knowledge about organic farming. Therefore an increase in information mainly focused on promoting organic farming as a profitable alternative to conventional farming could have a positive impact on the tendency for conversion. Future conversion to organics is most likely to be financially driven, but nevertheless the farmers? perception that only rich people can afford to buy organic food remains a barrier and considerations might be given towards approaches that might alter this mindset.}

The performance efficiency of the housing system is determined on the basis of biological parameters, based on empirical data of a co-operation project. The influ-ence of the housing system on the construction costs for housing sows is examined by construction models, which are defined on the basis of empirical data and by an expert interview.
Better performance data are reached by the group housing system analysed here compared to other studies. The results show that the housing system is both suitable and efficient on farm level.
The group housing of lactating sows causes a reduction of construction costs. This difference is especially noticeable when modifying existing buildings. The saving potential is 993 ? per housing place.

Targeting technical, economical and marketing channel choices issues, elaboration of prices for organic commodities is studied through 20 interviews, where farmers? values were also considered. As results, first enhancement of the organic products is highly correlated to the natural and logistic resources. Moreover, most organic farmers have elaborated innovative marketing channels in order to cope with the local supply and demand. Indeed, a large number of farmers are involved in direct selling, even in combination with other marketing channels, in order to enhance their production through prices. Finally, farmers? values have an important influence on final prices. Indeed several organic farmers pay a great attention to social, ethical, environmental issues, beyond a basic compliance with the organic standards. As a result, fairness, environmental issues, or rural development lead farmers to implement innovative techniques and marketing strategies with a final incidence on price construction.}

The same is true for agriculture as scientific object. This is a particularly evident problem in organic farming, as the worldview of organic farming, arguments in marketing and farming practice seem to be in contrast to contemporary academic science which is, however, of great significance for organic research. Thus, organic research often appears to be carried out on the same theoretical basis which is opposed by organic practice and its ethical and philosophical backgrounds. At various levels, the apparent antagonism between holism and reductionism is part of this problem. This paper discusses whether holistic science is necessarily in contradiction to analytic and reductionist methods, or whether different scientific approaches could be brought together and linked in a cognitive process of building wholeness in thinking and imagination. }

Current data do not allow any solid conclusions to be drawn about the level of this risk, relative to conventional production systems. This review describes six Risk Reduction Points (RRPs) where risks from enteric pathogens can be reduced in ready-to-eat vegetables. Changes can be made to animal husbandry practices (RRP1) to reduce inoculum levels in manure. Outdoor livestock management (RRP2) can be optimized to eliminate the risk of faecal material entering irrigation water. Manure storage and processing (RRP3), soil management practices (RRP4) and timing of manure application (RRP5), can be adjusted to reduce the survival of pathogens originating from manure. During irrigation (RRP6), pathogen risks can be reduced by choosing a clean water source and minimizing the chances of faecal material splashing on to the crop.
Although preventive measures at these RRPs can minimize enteric pathogen risk, zero risk can never be obtained for raw ready-to-eat vegetables. Good food hygiene practices at home are essential to reduce the incidence of food-borne illnesses.}

Auf zwei Praxisbetrieben im Landkreis Nienburg wurden vom {\"O}koring e.V. acht verschiedene Zwiebelsorten untersucht, darunter waren die drei neuen mehltauresistenten Sorten sowie f{\"u}nf weitere Sorten, sowie die norddeutschen Standardsorten im {\"o}kologischen Anbau ?Profit?, ?Summit? und ?Hector?. Zur Aussaat war die Witterung warm und trocken, eine Zusatzbew{\"a}sserung fand nicht statt. Erst mit Einsetzen der Niederschl{\"a}ge ab Mitte Mai zeigte sich ein verst{\"a}rktes Wachstum. 
Der Falsche Mehltau trat in diesem Jahr ab Anfang Juli auf. An beiden Standorten war das Auftreten insgesamt m{\"a}{\ss}ig. Auff{\"a}llig war das der Befall am Standort 1 bei allen Sorten h{\"o}her war als an Standort 2. Dies lag vor allem an einem gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Befallsnest, das innerhalb der Versuchsfl{\"a}che lag. Ende Juli begann der Schlottenknick. 
An den mehltauresistenten Sorten wurden zu einem sehr sp{\"a}ten Zeitpunkt und in einem sehr geringen Ma{\ss}e Falscher Mehltau beobachtet. Ob dies auf noch vorhandene Sortenunreinheiten oder auf die Durchbrechung der Resistenz zur{\"u}ckzuf{\"u}hren ist, muss noch gekl{\"a}rt werden. 
Die Ertr{\"a}ge lagen an Standort 1 insgesamt h{\"o}her als an Standort 2. Die norddeutschen Standardsorten ?Profit?, ?Summit? und ?Hector? haben sich trotz des m{\"a}{\ss}igen Auftretens von Falschem Mehltau bew{\"a}hrt und zeigten an beiden Standorten vergleichsweise hohe Ertr{\"a}ge. Auch die neue mehltauresistente Sorte ?Yankee? zeigte einen hohen Ertrag. Allerdings neigt diese als Amerikaner-Typ in den norddeutschen Gefilden zum Schossen. Die mehltauresistenten Sorten ?Santero? und ?BGS 237? hatten einen etwas geringeren Feldaufgang und zeigten sich etwas ertragsschw{\"a}cher gegen{\"u}ber den Standardsorten. Die in den vergangenen Jahren ertragsstarke {\"O}ko-Sorte ?Bajosta? hatte an beiden Standorten den h{\"o}chsten Befall mit Falschem Mehltau, was wahrscheinlich zu einem geringeren Ertrag f{\"u}hrte. 

Teilversuch 2 Pflanzzwiebeln: Vergleich einer mehltauresistenten Sorte mit einer norddeutschen Standardsorte auf zwei Praxisfl{\"a}chen 
In 2007 wurden zwei Zwiebelsorten auf zwei Praxisbetrieben in Niedersachsen im Pflanzverfahren untersucht. Dabei wurde die mehltauresistente Sorte ?Yankee? sowie die in Norddeutschland bew{\"a}hrte Sorte ?Summit? getestet. 
Standort 1 war ein sehr schwerer, toniger Standort, auf dem die Pflanzzwiebeln vor allem im trockenen, hei{\ss}en April aufgrund von fehlender Bew{\"a}sserung Wachstumshemmungen zeigten. Die Gesamtertr{\"a}ge lagen an diesem Standort auf niedrigem Niveau. Der Amerikaner-Typ ?Yankee? hatte einen Ertrag von 301 dt?ha, ?Summit? lag bei 339 dt?ha. 
An Standort 2, auf einem lehmigen Sand, zeigten beide Sorte sehr hohe Ertr{\"a}ge: ?Yankee? hatte einen Gesamtertrag von {\"u}ber 600 dt?ha, ?Summit? von 523 dt?ha. 
Der Falsche Mehltau trat an beiden Stanorten nur im geringen Ma{\ss}e auf. 

Teilversuch 3: Vergleich der Lagereignung verschiedener Sorten bei S{\"a}- und Pflanzzwiebeln
Aus der Zwiebelsaison 2007 wurden aus den S{\"a}- und Pflanzversuchen eines von der Bundesanstalt f{\"u}r ?Landwirtschaft und Ern{\"a}hrung (BLE) gef{\"o}rderten Projektes verschiedene Zwiebelsorten unter Praxisbedingungen eingelagert und nach der Auslagerung auf die Lagereignung bonitiert. 
Die S{\"a}zwiebeln unterlagen dabei den {\"u}blichen Atmungsverlusten und waren zum Auslagerungstermin in einem guten Zustand. Die Zwiebeln von Betrieb 1 hatten tendenziell h{\"o}here Atmungsverluste als die von Betrieb 2. Der Anteil der ?nicht marktf{\"a}higen Zwiebeln? wurde vor allem durch ausgetriebene und faule Zwiebel verursacht. Der Anteil an getriebenen Zwiebeln war bei den S{\"a}zwiebeln sehr gering. 
An Standort 1 zeigte nur die {\"O}ko-Sorte ?Bajosta? zum Boniturtermin im Februar einen leichten Austrieb von 0,5 \%. An Standort 2 war der Anteil an ausgetriebenen Zwiebeln bei allen untersuchten Sorten etwas h{\"o}her. Die mehltauresistente Sorte ?Yankee? hatte hier den h{\"o}chsten Anteil an ausgetriebenen Zwiebeln mit 1,1 \%, vermutlich ist dies durch ihren Amerikaner-Typ zu begr{\"u}nden.
Der Anteil an faulen Zwiebeln lag bei den S{\"a}versuchen in einem geringen Ma{\ss}e, aber tendenziell gab es auch hier bei den S{\"a}zwiebeln vom Betrieb 2 h{\"o}here Verluste. Schalenlosigkeit verursachte kaum Verluste.  

Bei den Pflanzzwiebeln waren die Verluste durch Atmung wesentlich h{\"o}her als bei den S{\"a}zwiebeln. Es gab Atmungsverluste von bis zu 10 \%. Die neue mehltauresistente Sorte ?Yankee? hatte dabei an beiden Standorten wesentlich h{\"o}here Verluste als die Standardsorte ?Summit?. Weitere hohe Verluste gab es durch F{\"a}ulnis. Auch dabei hatte ?Yankee? h{\"o}here Einbu{\ss}en als die norddeutsche Standardsorte ?Summit? zu verzeichnen. 
Der hohe Anteil an F{\"a}ulnis wurde durch Botrytis sp. verursacht. Zum einen drangen die Erreger {\"u}ber das absterbende Laub ein und l{\"o}sten im Lager die so genannte Zwiebelhalsf{\"a}ule aus. Die Zwiebeln werden dabei im oberen Teil w{\"a}ssrig und braun. Zum anderen wurde die F{\"a}ulnis der Pflanzzwiebeln durch Botrytiserreger ausgel{\"o}st, die {\"u}ber Verletzungen in der Bulbe eingedrungen sind. Auch dort wird das Gewebe weich und w{\"a}ssrig, und bildet zum Teil einen grauen Pilzbelag, der sp{\"a}ter die gesamte Zwiebel bef{\"a}llt. Zur Ernte herrschte bei beiden Pflanzversuchen eine sehr feuchte, m{\"a}{\ss}ig warme Witterung, die den Botrytis-Befall beg{\"u}nstigt hat. 
Die mehltauresistente Sorte ?Yankee? hatte bei den Pflanzzwiebeln vermutlich aufgrund ihres Amerikaner-Typs auf beiden Standorten h{\"o}here Ausf{\"a}lle als die norddeutsche Standardsorte ?Summit?. }

In the present study pasture rotation routines on six pig farms representing two different organic management systems were compared; 1) a mobile system, in which the pigs during the summer were living in huts on pastures that were included in a long-term crop rotation scheme, while they during the winter were stabled with access to a concrete yard; 2) a stationary system, in which the pigs all year round were stabled with access to outdoor pastures in the summer time and a concrete yard in the winter. On one farm per system, the faecal excretion of nematode eggs from the pigs were analysed for a period of 3 years. Furthermore, soil samples were collected on a mobile farm to investigate levels of nematode eggs from fields with different pig?fertilizer history. The results showed that the use of a stationary system did not fulfil the actual recommendations for prevention of nematodes. The infection levels of A. suum and Oesophagostomum spp were high in the young pigs in both systems. In contrast, T. suis egg excretion was steadily very low in the mobile system, while the infection level increased during the observation period in the stationary system. The number of eggs in soil from the fields that had been used as pig pastures until November was larger compared to those used only until September, or that was fertilized by manure.}

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect over 6 years of organic (OR) and conventional (CO) field trials on 16 different genotipes of cauliflower, employing crop rotation. Yield of production and quality-nutraceuticals characteristic (dry matter, soluble solid residue, pH, titratable acidity, vitamin C, total polyphenols index, thiols content, antioxidant potential and main volatiles) were determined. Yield and florets weights gave a significant decrease in OR (about 25\% on total average) respect to CO. The differences in DM, Soluble Solids, pH and total acidity between each OR and CO genotipes were negligible, don?t showing a quality loss in OR-grown cauliflowers. The vit C content was higher (16\% on total average) in OR respect to CO. The total polyphenol index and the thiols content resulted slightly higher in OR, hence the difference resulted not significant with CO fields. The antioxidant profile showed high indexes in OR-grown cauliflowers, but the differences with CO resulted not significant. As regards the volatile amounts, the total average difference between OR and CO resulted not significant, with a difference for the single samplings: 4 resulted higher in CO and 2 resulted higher in OR-grown plants. The most important objective of OR management is to prevent quality loss by the produce respect to the CO one, and it seems that the present experiments meet this objective, with the exception of productivity.}

Considered acaricides were coumaphos (Perizin and Asuntol), fluvalinate (Apistan) and clorfenvinphos (Supona). Significant differences between the two replacement groups were observed only for the Apistan group in the third year, confirming high lipophilicity of fluvalinate. The residue levels in the newly built combs three years after beginning the conversion were significantly lower than initial levels for all products. Direct contamination of the combs was evaluated at the beginning of the trial and was found to be highest in Asuntol-treated hives and lowest in Perizin-treated hives. Residues in honey exceeding EU Maximum Residue Limit were found only in the case of Asuntol. }

Because there is still a lack of data measured at the farm scale, which also take farm type and farming practices into account, a comparison between an N-intensive non-organic, two organic all-arable crop rotations and a typical rotation of a mixed organic farm was carried out over a three-year period at a highly productive site in Northern Germany. Comparing the all-arable crop rotations, the organic systems had 70\% lower potential yields than the regional typical conventional crop rotation. In spite of 60\% lower input of fossil energy an N-intensive organic crop rotation showed 20 percent lower energy efficiency than a comparable conventional. In the present study, the higher N inputs and higher N surplus in the conventional system did not lead to significantly higher nitrate leaching than in the organic all-arable crop rotations. Comparison of an organic all-arable crop rotation with the corresponding mixed farming system showed significantly higher potential yields, higher energy efficiency and lower nitrate leaching in the organic mixed farming system. Management of the grass?clover (mulching versus feeding) had the strongest influence on nitrate leaching and energy efficiency in the organic systems. The decision to undertake stockless instead of mixed organic farming should not only be based on economic reasons, but also take the important aspects of energy and nitrogen efficiency into account. }

In 2003 and 2004 a field trial was conducted in Northern Germany to investigate autumn N uptake and nitrate leaching in autumn sown winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) grown intercropped with catch crops. Catch crops in pure stands were sown as control. In each system three catch crops common vetch (Vicia sativa), forage rape (Brassica napus) and oats (Avena sativa) were tested simultaneously. The experiment was run parallel after grass clover (high N status) and oats (low N status). N uptake, soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) and nitrate leaching of all stands were determined. Especially with winter wheat intercropping with catch crops increased N-uptake in autumn. In all stands forage rape and oats led to a higher N uptake than common vetch. In comparison to pure sown winter wheat, intercropping reduced Nmin by more than 30 \%. Nitrate leaching was highest after grass clover. Averaged over both pre crops intercropping of winter wheat and catch crops led to a reduction of nitrate leaching in a range of 38 to 60 \%. Grown as intercrop to winter oilseed rape forage rape and oats decreased nitrate leaching compared to pure sown rape by 50 and 39 \%, respectively. If cultivation of winter wheat after N intensive pre cop in winter mild climates is wanted, an intercropped production system with catch crops is a mean to reduce N leaching risks. Further investigations are necessary to clarify on yield performance of the main crops when growing together with catch crops.}

Results from a count data model and a national survey of U.S. organic farmers were used to decompose observed gender differences in technology adoption into a characteristics effect and a coefficient effect. The analysis shows that 40\% of the adoption differential is due to differences in characteristics of male and female organic farmers.  Education, experience, information sources, and institutional support are key factors causing the gender gap in number and type of adopted practices.}

        abstract = {During post harvest storage, a large proportion of carrots (more than 50\%) may have to be discarded due to the development of liquorice rot caused by Mycocentrospora acerina. This fungus is soil borne and brought into the store in to soil adhering to the root. Liquorice rot development is mainly related to physiological or structural resistance of carrot, therefore the control of this storage disease is based on cultural practices and storage conditions.
It is believed that carrots at the beginning of storage can resist disease developments due to chemical defence mechanisms involving some proteins, peptides and secondary metabolites. The hypothesis is that proteome changes during storage of carrots are related to the susceptibility to M. acerina. During root-pathogen interactions, several genes have been reported to provide resistance against pathogens but only few proteins have been identified using proteomic approaches. Little is known about proteins involved during   M. acerina - carrot interaction.
The carrots used in this study are grown under two different agricultural practices (one conventional, one organic) in order to investigate the effect of the cropping system on the susceptibility to liquorice rot.
We developed a bioassay for infection studies of M. acerina on conventional and organic carrots in order to determine the important time points of the infection process. Then the proteome is investigated at these different time points. The protocol for extraction of proteins has been improved so that it can be used to obtain an optimal recovery of proteins from both plant and pathogen on their own as well as from infected carrot roots.

Results showed that the organically fertilised wheat was preferred by rats (P = 0.001) while the organic crop protection resulted in reduced wheat consumption (not significant).

It involved semi-structured interviews with organic farmers, NGOs, consumers, marketing organisations, and the State Agricultural Department. The farmers in the case study perceived that they had improved their livelihoods over the long term by the conversion from conventional to organic farming. Reduced costs for external inputs and reduced labour requirements together with similar or higher yields and premium prices resulted in higher net-farm incomes. The conversion to organic farming reduced the reliance on credits and the risk of crop failure due to pests, diseases and droughts, thereby reducing vulnerability. In addition, the farmers mentioned enhanced natural assets, reduced risk of pesticide poisonings, improved food safety, higher levels of self-sufficiency, and the access to networks supporting knowledge exchange and political participation as important benefits of the conversion. However, almost all the case study farmers noted that the conversion period was difficult due to temporarily declining yields and a lack of information and experiences. This is likely to be a major constraint preventing asset-poor farmers from adopting organic agriculture.}

A project was started in 2007 to explore farmer?s reasons for opting out of certified organic production. Important factors seem to be public regulations including standards for organic farming, agronomy, economy, and farm exit. While many organic farmers with relatively small holdings have opted out, farmers with more land and larger herds tend to convert to organic agriculture. The trend towards larger-scale farms in organic than in conventional agriculture, encouraged by the design of the organic farming payments, challenges the organic principles of diversity and fairness. Means should be considered to ensure that small organic enterprises are also economically viable.}

School meals are only offered in very few primary schools, and the common school meal is a packed lunch (sandwiches) brought from home, consumed in the class room. Subscription schemes for milk were introduced around 1970, and for fruit around 1995. Organic milk and fruit is offered only in some regions. Since 2007, fruit is served without payment in all schools with a lower secondary level (class 8-10 or 1-10). This effort was introduced as a first step to develop a free school meal in all public schools, which is a goal of one of the political parties in the current government. As in many other European countries, free school meals were offered
(especially to poor children) in schools in the larger Norwegian cities around 1900. However, these meals were criticised for being unhealthy, and replaced by whole grain bread, milk and vegetables around 1930. Increasing private wealth, and increased demand for investments in school buildings, books etc changed the public priority and free school meals disappeared in Oslo around 1960. Today, there is not a general agreement about the optimal school meal composition, and whether or not the meals should be funded by the public. However, the increasing length of the school day and unsatisfactory scores of Norwegian pupils in international comparison tests (e.g. PISA) makes the school meal sector highly relevant in the public debate.
Three cases that will be studied in a research project about public organic food procurement for youth are briefly described: The municipality of Trondheim, {\O}ya music festival in Oslo and the Air Force Academy. (Increased) serving of organic food is an important aim in all these cases, and young people are an important target group.
The report is produced within the project ?innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth?, iPOPY, and will be updated and revised during the project period (2007-2010).}

The ideotype of a crop is a model of a plant community where all necessary and beneficial traits for crop performance in a particular environment are combined. It is important to consider the environment when developing an ideotype since climatic, edaphic and agronomic features of the target region have a major role in determining crop performance. New technologies, high yielding cultivars, irrigation and water management, plant protection materials and more skilful farm management practices have increased yields and yield potentials on cereals in Finland as in many other countries. In this paper we aim to summarize traits which would be useful from the farmers? perspective. The most important trait is increased early vigour of spring cereals, including faster rate of early development and increased leaf area to improve both the resource capture of the canopy and water use efficiency. Introduction of dwarfing genes would improve lodging resistance and harvest index due to improved partitioning of dry matter into grains whereas longer coleoptiles would improve emergence and seedling establishment. Improved ability of crops to utilize stem reserves during grain filling would increase resistance against environmental stresses. All of these traits would also increase the competitive ability of the plant against weeds as well as competition within the crop canopy and are already available from non-adapted germplasm of the various spring cereal species. }

In the alternative cropping systems study established in 1995, crop yields for organic system without any chemical input were 30-40\% lower than the conventional system with high inputs. But, lower input costs plus price premiums for organic produce normally more than offset lower yields, resulting in favourable economic performance and energy efficiency. Legume, green manure and compost manure helped to replace nutrients lacking in the soil and improved crop yields. In the organic system, amount of P removed in crop exceeded that of P replaced and this can be a major yield limiting factor. In amendments experiments, there was small effect of granular rock phosphate fertilizer and?or Penicillium bilaiae in increasing soil P level and crop yield in the application year. Other findings suggested the use of elemental S fertilizer, gypsum, manure, wood ash or alfalfa pellets to improve nutrient availability, and yield and quality of produce. In conclusion, integrated use of management practices and amendments has the potential to increase sustainability of crop production as well as improve soil quality plus minimize environmental damage. }

Olfactometric analysis showed that both, fresh UFA?CLA butter and fresh conventional butter had similar aroma profiles. After 6?8 weeks of storage, UFA?CLA butter showed stronger fatty (butanoic and 3-methyl butanoic acid), metallic ?(E,E)-2,4-nonadienal?, green ?(E)-2-hexenol? and creamy (2-pentanone) notes compared with the conventional samples. A sensory panel described the two fresh butter types as having a similar sensory profile, except for a stronger creamy aroma, a less intense cooked milk aroma and a significantly higher spreadability of the UFA?CLA butters. Sensory descriptive analysis showed also that both butter types aged in a very similar way, with an increase in rancid and oxidized notes.

Insects were collected in pitfall traps in outdoor microplots over 3 seasons in southern Ontario, Canada.  Treatments varied each season with crops of oats or soybeans, with residue of straw, corn stalks or paperfibre, and with residue tilled in or surface applied.  In 2006 at the peak of spider population density there was a significant effect of the plant and the paperfibre residue on increasing spider density. Existing data sets on spiders by Spiller and Schoener (1988 \& 1994) were analyzed to assess the potential to increase spider survival from improved carrying capacity of their habitat.  Spider census data was tested with curve fitting models in Aikaike Information Criteria (AIC). Spider populations of Metepeira, with sizeable numbers, were density dependent. Demographic data was assembled from Spiller \& Schoener, 1988 and population size was projected with RAMAS Ecolab.  Increasing the carrying capacity increased spider populations in the model projections.  Mulch improves spatial diversity and could increase spider density from reduced intraspecific competition in the plot experiments. Increasing spider numbers with habitat complexity in agricultural systems could allow spiders to reduce specific pest problems through maintaining the balance of insect species. }

The practice of green manuring with crop species belonging to the Brassicaceae family has recently expanded, in Italy and abroad, due to their demonstrated biocidal effect against soil-borne pathogens. In this plot-scale study we monitored the release of soil inorganic N in 3 soil types (1 clay and 2 loams), in the months following late-spring green manuring with plant material from Brassica juncea, Sinapis alba, and Raphanus sativus species. Soil inorganic N content increased and reached a maximum 2 months after GM incorporation (?14.4 mg N kg?1 dry soil, on average, over the initial inorganic N content), and subsequently declined. The inorganic N accumulation was higher in soil amended with R. sativus. We did not observe any significant influence of the soil type on the variation of inorganic N content in the period after GM incorporation. The inorganic N released after late-spring green manuring with Brassicaceae species may become available in the early growth phase of subsequent summer-autumn crops.}

Brassica juncea was significantly higher than the unamended control and the soil amended with Triticum aestivum and Eruca sativa. Metham sodium, while showing a remarkable nitrification inhibition activity, gave rise to amounts of inorganic N (mainly in the ammonium form) of the same level as B. juncea. Mineralization rate was higher in the loamy sand soil than in the loam and in the silty clay soils. Biofumigant crops used as green manure, by increasing N availability in soil, may represent an interesting source of N for the following crops in organic agriculture.}

In the latter part of period 2, L. monocytogenes populations were higher in the rumen, duodenum and faeces of steers offered 50M:50RC but in period 3, L. monocytogenes populations were lower in the faeces of steers fed the higher level of red clover silage (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05). Despite negligible E. coli levels in the diets, populations of E. coli, including E. coli 0157, were detected in the steers throughout the trial.

Die Europ{\"a}ische Union hat 2007 eine gesetzliche Regelung zu gesundheitsbezogener Lebensmittelwerbung erlassen. Derzeit wird ein Gemeinschaftsregister mit zugelassenen und durch die Wissenschaft best{\"a}tigten "Health Claims" (gesundheitsbezogene Angaben) erstellt, um die Verbraucher vor irref{\"u}hrenden Angaben zu sch{\"u}tzen. Nicht erforscht war bislang, wie stark deutsche Biokonsumenten im Vergleich zu K{\"a}ufern konventioneller Lebensmittel von Slogans wie "St{\"a}rkt die Abwehrkr{\"a}fte?" oder "Cholesterinsenkend?" beeinflusst werden. Eine Vergleichsstudie der Universit{\"a}t Kassel hat diese Forschungsl{\"u}cke geschlossen. 
Das Zitat:
"N{\"a}hrwert- oder gesundheitsbezogene Angaben steigern nicht nur bei konventionellen, sondern auch bei Biolebensmitteln den Absatz", fasst Nicole Maroscheck vom Fachgebiet Agrar- und Lebensmittelmarketing der Universit{\"a}t Kassel das Hauptergebnis des Kaufsimulationsexperiments zusammen. "Dieses Ergebnis hat nicht nur die Branche, sondern auch uns {\"u}berrascht. Bislang herrschte stets die Einsch{\"a}tzung vor, dass Biok{\"a}ufer Angaben zu Einzelmerkmalen von Lebensmitteln ablehnen, weil sie nicht zum ganzheitlichen Image von Biolebensmitteln passen."

Ein Produkt darf demnach nur noch dann mit einer n{\"a}hrwert- oder gesundheitsbezogenen Angabe (?Claim?) beworben werden, wenn es einem vorgegebenen N{\"a}hrwertprofil entspricht, also bestimmte Voraussetzungen (z.B. bez{\"u}glich des Zucker-, Fett- oder Salzgehalts) erf{\"u}llt.

Daher ist gerade im {\"O}ko-Lebensmittelmarketing der {\"u}berlegte Umgang mit Claims (n{\"a}hrwert- und gesundheitsbezogene Aussagen laut EG-VO Nr. 1924?2006) relevant. Projektziel war die Untersuchung des Verbraucherverhaltens bez{\"u}glich Claims auf {\"O}ko-Lebensmitteln. Gekl{\"a}rt werden sollte die Wirkung auf die Kaufentscheidung (positiv, negativ, neutral), deren Bestimmungsgr{\"u}nde (Soziodemographie, Einstellungen, etc.) sowie die Unterschiede zur Wirkung im konventionellen Bereich.
Hierzu wurden Kaufsimulationen sowie anschlie{\ss}ende Befragungen mit {\"O}ko-Konsumenten durchgef{\"u}hrt. Daraus gingen Daten zu 630 Kaufentscheidungen hervor, die mittels logistischer Regression und bivariaten Verfahren ausgewertet wurden. {\"U}ber den Vergleich mit einem analog im konventionellen Bereich durchgef{\"u}hrten DFG-Forschungsprojekt wurden die Unterschiede herausgearbeitet.
Im Ergebnis zeigte sich, dass Claims auf den Produkten oft nicht wahrgenommen wurden. Wenn Konsumenten jedoch Claims gelesen hatten, pr{\"a}ferierten sie diese Produkte im {\"O}ko-Bereich {\"a}hnlich stark wie im konventionellen Bereich. Auch schienen Claimprodukte dem Verbraucher ges{\"u}nder. Wie stark die Wirkung von Claims auf {\"O}ko-Lebensmitteln war, hing davon ab, wie gesund Verbraucher Produkte mit Claims im Gegensatz zu {\"o}kologischen und konventionellen Produkten ohne Claims einsch{\"a}tzten und wie wichtig ihnen solche Angaben waren. Zudem deuten bivariate Ergebnisse auf eine erh{\"o}hte Kaufwahrscheinlichkeit hin, wenn die Verbraucher j{\"u}nger als 31 oder {\"a}lter als 50 Jahre sind, keine Kinder in ihrem Haushalt leben und sie nicht zu ihrer Stammmarke greifen. Der Unterschied zur Wirkung im konventionellen Bereich erwies sich als gering.
Ausgehend von den Ergebnissen wurden Strategie{\"u}berlegungen dargestellt und zuvor erkundete Annahmen von {\"O}ko-Anbietern reflektiert, um die Nutzbarkeit der wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse f{\"u}r die Marketing{\"u}berlegungen der {\"O}ko-Anbieter zu erh{\"o}hen.}

In the field trial the Italian sweet lupin varieties (Multitalia) were the most interesting for CP production and pea the best for yield. The feeding trial provided that the protein content was higher for the A diet (with soya bean) while fat, somatic cells and urea content did not differ. }

The number of electric shocks the animals received from the training fence was recorded continuously. After the training period, the calves were turned to pasture. Nine of the animals were also grazed the following summer as yearlings, and observed before turnout in a smaller enclosure. The calves got more shocks from the fence during training hour 1 than during any of the following seven hours. The number of shocks the calves received from the fence also declined from training day 1 to 2 and from training day 3 to 4. The results indicate that the dairy bull calves learned to avoid an electric fence quickly, even within an hour from release into the training yard. A simple training procedure was sufficient to ensure that the animals could be grazed in and would avoid a light-built electric fencing system as calves and, even after a winter-housing period, as bulls. }

The study was carried out with mail surveys and telephone interviews on the Finnish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farms. The most challenging investments were in animal husbandry buildings and, as to these investments, the comparison of alternatives was the most challenging stage. For most investments, the planning phase was considered more challenging than the implementation. Before making the decision, farmers acquired information from many sources, of which the opinion of the main customer and the experiences of fellow farmers were the most valued. Some of the products considered were so new on the market that it was not easy to get adequate information and, furthermore, the information given by suppliers was not always accurate. Decision-making was supported by calculations, but qualitative factors had a dominating role. Large basic decisions were made relatively quickly, while details needed a longer time to process. In general, farm managers were satisfied with their investments. Improvements in work quality and quantity were especially mentioned and generally qualitative factors were the ones first in mind when evaluating the successfulness of the investment. }

The experiment was designed to enable clear differentiation between effects of the microorganisms in the EM treatments (Bokashi and EMA) and its substrate (sterilized treatments). Crop yields and soil microbiological parameters as soil respiration and microbial biomass were determined. The EM treatments showed no effect on yield and soil microorganisms which were caused by the EM microorganisms. Observed effects could be related to the effect of the carrier substrate of the EM products. The sampling time showed stronger effects on soil microbial biomass and soil respiration compared to the effect of the treatments. Hence ?Effective Microorganisms? are not able to improve yields and soil quality in mid term (4 years) in arable farming under temperate climatic conditions as in Central Europe.}

Green manures were ploughed into the soil in April 2004 and organic fertiliser was applied before sowing; neither green manure nor fertilizers were applied in 2005 to evaluate the residual effect of the treatments. The effect of the distribution of organic fertilizer was not efficient in comparison to green-manure. Field-bean increased maize productivity in both the years thanks to an increase in N availability as suggested by its total N uptake that exceeded the uptake of maize after control by 19.5 and 14,3 Kg N ha-1 in the first and second year. In our experimental conditions, with low organic matter and nitrogen content in the soil, the use of grasses as green-manure caused temporary immobilisation of N and maize yield reduction. }

This paper analyses the criteria that must be met when judging the use of animals during experiments, and investigates whether these can be applied in rodent control. This is important, because, until now, animal welfare has been less of an issue in pest control: effectiveness, hygiene and cost efficiency have been leading principles. Two options are available to solve the inconsistency: the first is to abandon the criteria used in animal experimentation; the second is to apply these criteria to both animal experimentation and rodent control. This latter option implies that rodent control methods should not lead to intense pain or discomfort, and any discomfort should have a short duration and should allow escaped rodents to lead a natural life. Adherence to this option will, however, require a shift in the design of rodent control methods: effectiveness will no longer be the leading principle. It will have to share its position with animal welfare and humaneness. }

This knowledge is essential in order to receive the most ecosystem services provided by entomopathogenic fungi in agricultural production. Knowledge of the basic ecology of the fungi is also necessary to include them in conservation biological control. In this biological control strategy, agricultural practices and?or habitat manipulations are applied to the farming system to favour living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests (Eilenberg et al., 2001).

These fungi have received a lot of interest due to their potential as biocontrol agents of pests. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the fundamental ecology of these fungi in both managed and natural ecosystems, but such information is necessary both for risk assessments prior to release of biocontrol agents in the environment as well as if we wish to understand the distribution of the fungi and their impact on host populations. This latter focus is essential if the fungi are to be included in pest management strategies based on conservation biological control.
	A series of unspecific PCR methods have been used to characterise isolates of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae, and many studies have concluded that the fungi contain a lot of genetic diversity. The problem with these methods is that they provide little phylogenetic information of the fungi and the characters can not be used to explicitly compare data between studies. Sequences from specific targets in the DNA provide tools for explicit comparison between isolates across studies. There is now a range of primer sets published along with reference sequences in GenBank to make these comparisons possible. Multi-gene phylogenies have revealed that both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are complexes of species that contain cryptic taxa or clades. Using merely morphological characteristics will not result in the same degree of taxa identification as will the use of DNA sequence data. Similarly, when using microsatellite markers for population genetic studies of fungal communities, it is necessary to first separate the populations in clades as allele sizes can convert across populations. In the near future, USDA-ARS in Beltsville will launch a web-based platform (MBID, Metarhizium-Beauveria ID) including lists of primers, databases of reference sequences and type isolates of new described species for the reliable identification of taxa for the scientific community. This tool should provide a common framework and nomenclature for scientists and create basis for making comparisons among studies. There should be great potential to learn more about the ecology of the entomopathogenic fungi with the application of these molecular markers. However, designing an appropriate sampling scheme in the environment is absolutely necessary to conduct these ecological studies. The use of isolates from culture collections should be avoided.

However, only a limited number of studies have focused on the impact of fungal pathogens on populations of non-pest insects. Effects of entomopathogenic fungi on non-pest host populations should receive more attention based on the increasing interest in conservation biological control. In this strategy, founded on competition theory, non-pest host populations adjacent to cropping systems will in principle affect pest populations through shared natural enemies. We present examples of selected non-pest host-fungus systems from temperate ecosystems that are relevant for the expected ecosystem service provided by entomopathogenic fungi. Predators are among the non-pest hosts that are infected by fungi. Recent advances in our understanding of the effect of pathogens on the behaviour of predators may shed light on the significance of entomopathogenic fungi for the regulation of predator populations. We discuss what we can learn about host-pathogen interactions from behavioural ecology and which life history parameters in the host that may be important for the impacts of fungal pathogens on their host populations.}

Pathogens are among the natural enemies of insects and entomopathogenic fungi attack a wide array of host species. Evidence documents that social insects in particular have adapted behavioural mechanisms to avoid infection by fungal pathogens. These mechanisms are referred to as 'behavioural resistance'. However, there is little evidence for similar adaptations in non-social insects. 
We have conducted experiments to assess the potential of common insect predators to detect and avoid their entomopathogenic fungal natural enemy Beauveria bassiana. The predatory bug Anthocoris nemorum was able to detect and avoid nettle leaves that were treated with B. bassiana. Females laid fewer eggs on leaf halves contaminated with the pathogen. Similarly, females were very reluctant to contact nettle leaves contaminated with the fungus compared to uncontaminated control leaves in ?no-choice? experiments. 
Adult seven spot ladybirds, Coccinella septempunctata, overwinter in the litter layer often in groups.  Adult C. septempunctata modified their overwintering behaviour in relation to the presence of B. bassiana conidia in soil and sporulating conspecifics by moving away from sources of infection.  Furthermore active (non-overwintering) adult C. septempunctata were also able to detect and avoid B. bassiana conidia on different substrates; bean leaves, soil and sporulating on dead conspecifics. 
Our studies show that insect predators have evolved mechanisms to detect and avoid pathogens that they are susceptible to. Fungal pathogens may be significant mortality factors among populations of insect predators, especially long-lived species that must diapause before reproduction. Likewise, actively foraging species are more likely to come in contact with pathogens than predators that sit and wait for prey. These particular groups of insects will benefit from adaptations to avoid pathogens.

The findings also suggest that these developments have been fuelled by a sub optimal functioning of the foodservice supply chain and that this in turn has forced administrators to see food procurement in a new horizontal perspective in which different types of public foodservice is looked upon as a whole. The findings suggest that the emerging organic food policies have modernised the way in which public food is governed and that organic foods have created a sense of public political consumption. The paper discusses the opportunities that this development creates for the organic food sector and in particular whether the development can open up further the public as a sales channel for organic food.}

        abstract = {There is increasing focus on the role that public food procurement and institutional food service can play in promoting sustainable production and consumption. Many metropolitan areas adopt strategies that include initiatives involving public kitchens and food procurement offices. In a number of countries sustainability policies have been launched aiming at increasing the volume organic foods in the public. Denmark is one of them. Public policies supporting the use of organic foods in the public sector has been around for a decade and municipalities has taken cornet actions aiming at increasing the share of organic and sustainable foods in food service Copenhagen is one of them and protection of soil and ground water plays an important role in this strategy. The aim of this paper is to present this case and demonstrate how public food systems can integrate organic foods in the public food service supply chain. The municipality aims at reaching a level where food consumption in public institutions is 75\% organic and this goal is pursued through the participation in the Dogme network. Civil servants and catering professionals from the different Dogme municipalities work together in a network on Organic Food and aims at strengthening the inter-municipal cooperation on conversion into organic food through information and knowledge-sharing. The paper presents concrete examples of the constraints and opportunities in this type of strategy as well as some concrete tools for monitoring the progress through the use of metrics.}

In order to argue for the use of organic food by public catering, the traditional nutrition oriented public catering is reframed and repositioned as sustainable public catering system, responsible in mediating the well-being of both bio-physical environment and individual consumers. The repositioning is based on theory of ecological communication within social systems by Niklas Luhmann. The development towards sustainable public catering systems is examined by analysing Danish and Finnish public catering cases, which make visible the role of economy, law, science, politics and education in contextual networks governing public catering. This theoretically based approach confirms the networks and their mutual communication as bearing on the use of organic food, rendering public catering organisations ?centres of sustainability? in every-day life of (post)modern citizens.}

However, this view may refer to difficulties in identifying sustainable developments in everyday business activities without particularly visible publicity. Currently, new serious activity towards sustainable food systems, starting from retailing, processing industries and farmers as well as other food system actors seem to strive to connect the supply chains for sustainable food. This paper makes use of the notion of ?social rhizomes? structured as different networks to identify sustainable developments in actors? lived experience. Furthermore, the notion of connectivity, as the ability to activate heterogenous ideas, persons, materials and spaces for sustainability within a ?social rhizome? is used to explain the progress towards sustainability within local, national and global food system. Empirically, the paper is based on two presentations given on the Finnish Organic Conference 2008. The presentations were analysed for the progress towards sustainability within social rhizomes structured as chanceworks, meshworks, strategic networks and socially overlaid networks. Results suggest, that connectivity between different networks leads to transformations between the networks towards more shared economic, environmental and socio-cultural benefits, which can be identified as common people?s sustainability.}

        abstract = {Public catering in Finland has strong historical roots from the 19th century, connected with the rise of the national state, industrialisation, democracy and modern times in general. The school meal system developed hand in hand with work place meal services, and inherently the aim was to offer lateral support for workers' and pupils' activities by healthy and wholesome nutrition. The public catering had initially a strong label of welfare services and implied economical use of ingredients.
Later on, the character of public service of the welfare state was emphasised, as public catering was perceived as a way to promote equality between citizens. The public meal system, and school meal system as part of it, represented not a self-evident and 'natural' developmental path, but can be seen as a result of extensive political, economic and organisational efforts, even fights. Further on, the nutritional and cultural orientations were strengthened when the public school meal system was made a statutory free service for all pupils, first in basic education, and later in secondary education. Today the Finnish welfare state meets the challenge of greying societies and decreasing labour force, and the school meal system, as all public provision systems, in confronted with the trend for increased efficiency and economical operations, including food procurement. Even within these restrictive organisational environments, there is interest in environmentally friendly food and sustainable development by public caterers, municipal officials and politicians of all parties. While the conventional meal system is the prevailing one, there are also movements towards sustainable catering in hundreds of schools around Finland, connected to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) program.
The report is produced within the project ?innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth?, iPOPY, and will be updated and revised during the project period (2007-2010).}

used to support consumption driven changes in production, leading to reduction of GHG emissions in
agriculture. This paper presents a pre-study, looking for discursive grounds by which institutional
consumers make choices when confronted with the knowledge of GHG emission characteristics of five
optional milk systems. The milk systems to be compared in terms of agricultural GHG emissions were
(Option I) conventional milk system based on imported soy protein feed, (Option II) conventional milk
system using domestic protein source and (Option III) organic milk system, as well as vegetable milk
systems based on (Option IV) imported soy and (Option V) domestic oat. The discursive turn to these
optional milk systems was taken by five catering information professionals, who tried to respond to the
idea of catering for sustainability. The results revealed four different discourses, with variable ability to
make use of emission information when systemic change is to be approached in everyday productive
activities. Regarding emission information, the least sensitive discourse was the one of modernization,
emphasising the use of conventional, cheap products. Sustainability and ecological modernization
discourses exhibited most imaginative and novel solutions in productive activities. Bioregionalism
discourse joined other discourses connecting them with the idea of domestic production. The
discourses identified in this pre-study were, however, very fine-grained and intermingled, offering
rather lean support for novel choices. Additionally the market position of organic milk suffered due to
emission information, stressing heavily the reliability of environmental information as a ?change agent?
on the market.

In contrast to the main agricultural trend of farms specialising and increasing in size in response to the national and global markets, increasing numbers of Swedish farmers are instead diverting their efforts towards selling at local markets. Based on a study of six farms, the paper explores the nature of diversity on these farms and identifies factors supporting diversity. The study shows that farmers who interact with consumers are encouraged to diversify their production. The actual crops and varieties grown are determined by a combination of the natural conditions prevailing on the farm and the conditions created by the farmer in terms of marketing strategy for the products. }

An in vivo study was designed in order to establish the antimicrobial effects of dietary nitrate on the gut microbiota and on the health of 96 weaning piglets. The pigs were fed a diet containing high levels of nitrate (15 mg?kg feed and 150 mg?kg feed) and then challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Changes of the intestinal microbiota composition were assessed by analysing the stomach and jejunum contents from all the pigs. 
Results showed that nitrate only affected the population levels of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in both segments. Pigs challenged with Salmonella showed a reduction in the levels of E. coli and clostridia in the jejunum suggesting a mechanism of competition for niches or for active sites. The time from challenge significantly decreased the number of LAB in stomach and jejunum. It also decreased the population density of clostridia in the stomach. The supplementation of feedstuff with high dietary nitrate intake contemporarily to the challenge with Salmonella did not affect the degree of ulceration in the pigs.

Responses of the tea yield, root system and mass volume sap flow were studied.
The tea bushes showed comparable responses between all the treatments, the differences of which were not statistically significant: They exhibited similar yield, root distribution, growth, extension rates, mortality, mass volume flow of water and water use efficiency (WUE). The organically grown (ORG) tea bushes invested more roots in deeper soil layers than the CONV bushes.
The results showed that in terms of plant growth, managing tea organically is as equally feasible as managing tea in the conventional manner.

N uptake and yield of non-leguminous main crops increased about 10\%, due to a more adapted allocation of nutrients within the whole cropping system by reallocation of N towards the crops with higher N needs.

Urine N excretion was lowest (as a ratio to N intake), and milk N secretion was highest, on diet RC10.  It is concluded that milk and protein yields can be improved by feeding RC silage as 1:1 mix with maize silage, but that the efficiency of utilisation of forage N was reduced when diets contained more than 0.1 RC silage.}

Brazil is the world largest coffee producer, with an average of 2,300,000 tons of green coffee in the last 5 years. Cultivation of organic coffee and shaded coffee are common in Central America, while in Brazil both conventional and organic coffee are cultivated in the full sun system. The full sun system is criticized due to the lack of biodiversity and high demand for inputs. Shaded coffee system has more biodiversity, recycles and fix more chemical elements, such as N, P, K, Ca and C, having a great potential to mitigate the global warming, being consequently more sustainable. In Brazil, shaded coffee system is not well trusted and known as less productive. Seeking for organic coffee sustainability, this work evaluates productivity, coffee quality and chemical composition of coffee beans from two distinct organic coffee systems: shaded and full sun, in the largest arabica coffee producing region of the world, south of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. For productivity and coffee quality there was no statistical difference, although there was a tendency of superiority for the shaded treatment. For coffee beans composition, the shaded system presented higher K values. Considering the results obtained, the shaded system can be suited to increase organic coffee sustainability in this region of Brazil.}

        abstract = {Community supported agriculture (CSA) is increasingly practised in different countries all over the world and can be seen as a step towards a new style of urban-rural relationship. However, it is argued that CSA is an ?utopian entertainment for a few middle class consumers and their fortunate few farmer friends? (Goodman and DuPuis 2002, p. 17). Often, such CSA projects rest on organic agriculture, a farming system which in turn provides food mainly to the middle class of well-educated concerned consumers (Morgan and Murdoch 2000). Thus, one could argue that organic CSA is a highly exclusive concept, and that, in consequence, building urban-rural relationships depends on a small part of society ignoring, for example, poorer, often less educated consumers. 
This paper outlines the planned research accompanying a pilot CSA project in a Swiss city targeted at less educated people without special concerns (or the budget needed) for healthy, organic or otherwise alternative food. It thereby critically reflects the predominance of middle class consumers in the urban-rural relationship. With the help of ethnographic methods, such as participatory observation and in-depth (narrative) interviews, the project will explore (learning) processes that lead to ?knowing? food in CSA.
Conceiving of the production-consumption relationship as a discourse sees consumer actions as political when they exercise ?the capacity to act? in a way that affects future society (Goodman and DuPuis 2002). The project will study in how far the target group of less educated people participates in this political action. It furthermore explores if there are processes which could empower them to decide deliberately whether or not to take part in such political action, and to effectuate their ?right to know? (Allen and Kovach 2000), thus democratizing the urban-rural link.}

For that reason, the response of organic potato was evaluated throughout a randomized block design experiment, with two cultivars (Raja and Virgo) and increasing rates of composted organic pig manure (0, 15, 30 and 45 t ha-1). These cultivars were also grown with mineral N fertilizer (120 kg N ha-1) under conventional practices to compare the results between crop systems, 30, 45, 60, 80 and 125 days after planting.
Crop yield was not improved with increasing rates of compost application because the N mineralization rate of the compost was small and soil organic matter was high (8\%). Organically grown cv. Virgo yielded 66.0\% of the conventional crop, whereas Raja yielded 46.6\%. The N uptake of the organic crop (tubers and foliage) was 37.0 kg ha-1 for Raja and 50.5 kg ha-1 for Virgo, respectively 21.1\% and 27.8\% of the N uptake by the same cultivars grown with mineral fertilizer. Although foliage N content was increased for the conventional crops, differences between N content of organic and conventional tubers were not significant, as well as for K, Ca and Mg.

competition for land and water between bioenergy and food crops. Another question is whether biomass for energy use can be produced in a sustainable manner given the current conventional agricultural production practices. Other than the land and water competition, this question is often neglected in scenarios to meet a significant part of global energy demand with bioenergy. In the following, I address this question.

There are sustainable alternatives, for example organic agriculture, to avoid the negative environmental effects of conventional agriculture. Yet, meeting a significant part of global energy demand with biomass grown sustainably may not be possible, as burning significant quantities of organic matter - inherent in bioenergy use - is likely to be incompatible with the principles of such alternatives, which often rely on biomass input for nutrient balance. There may therefore be a trade-off between policies and practices to increase bioenergy and those to increase sustainability in agriculture via practices such as organic farming. 

This is not a general critique of bioenergy but it points to additional potential dangers of modern bioenergy as a strategy to meet significant parts of world energy demand.}

In four scenarios, ecological and economic effects of restricting the more intensive farm management practice beyond the existing regulations of organic farming are analysed. In the initial situation, the intensive farm has a financial advantage of about 600.00 ? per ha compared with the low-input farm, while the environmental risks caused by its production system are higher in several Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) categories. We showed for the model case that limiting livestock density and using regional grown concentrates bring about considerable improvements in LCA results, while restricting the amount of concentrates used does not. These three scenarios result in economic deterioration for the intensive farm. A fourth scenario increasing the share of pasture in daily dry matter intake (DMI) to a minimum of 50\% during the grazing season has positive effects environmentally as well as economically. }

Here we report preliminary results that show that the grain mineral concentration in organic wheat was higher for copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) and lower in calcium (Ca), than the grain mineral concentration in conventional wheat. No difference was found between systems for iron (Fe) concentration.  Cultivar was significant in determining mineral concentration for Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn and P.  Soil mineral concentration was not responsible for grain mineral concentration, with the exception of P.  The organic wheat farming systems had higher grain mineral concentrations of Cu, Mg, Mn, P and Zn than the conventional systems, possibly due in part to increased soil organic matter and pH in the organic systems.  Growing specific cultivars capable of exploiting particular soil conditions may be necessary in order to optimize the nutritional value in organic farming systems.}

Intakes of nutrients and two most common food additives (benzoic acid and nitrite) by the children were calculated from the food intake data. A questionnaire was filled by the parents on information of their age, education and profession, number of children in the family, attitude to organic foods and use of organic foods.

Clinical health and immune status plus faeces samples and samples of the gut content from the duodenum, ileum, caecum and colon were collected from each animal. Since the second round of the feeding experiment was only finished in March, the datasets are still incomplete because analyses are ongoing, but preliminary results are already available. Microbial analysis showed that CFU (per g DM of faeces) of bifidobacteria ranged from 2.6?10{\^{ }}8 (maize silage treatment) to 8.7?10{\^{ }}8 (probiotic treatment). CFU counts of E.coli showed a significantly lower amount for the control treatment (4.4?10{\^{ }}5) compared with the grass silage- group (3.0?10{\^{ }}6). Blood analysis did not show significant differences between treatments. Both the high level of animal performance (ADG between 902 and 929 g?d) and the negative clinical findings confirm the good health status of the animals. Statistical analysis with the complete data set will soon show whether the trends from these preliminary results will be confirmed for the overall experiment. }

In the surface soil (1-2 cm) of areas that are affected by horse manure, like paddocks, we measured very high extractable P contents. When testing soils from these areas using a rainfall simulator we found a close correlation between the extractable soil P in the surface soil and the dissolved reactive P in runoff water. In a runoff treatment test trial we used ferric sulphate to treat paddock runoff water. The chemical dosage was carried out using a tube doser placed in a well. After ferric sulphate treatment the runoff was discharged into a sedimentation pond and then filtered in a sandbed. The chemical treatment was performed during one year and the reduction of the dissolved P and total P in the runoff was 95 \% and 81 \%, respectively. Our Agri-Environmental Programme has not been successful in reducing the total P status in our agriculturally loaded lakes. We suggest that the cost-effective chemical treatment of waters from the high P equine areas should be included in the programme. Also in other countries in the Baltic Sea catchment area reductions of P contents in waters from equine areas should be carried out.}

Organic products are generally perceived and experienced as expensive products, when compared to conventional alternatives. To organic consumer the rewards they perceive to gain from organic food is well beyond the resources (in terms of time and money) they employ to search for the higher quality of organic products. Institutional attempts to change consumer behaviour are commonly categorized into consumer information, consumer education and consumer advice (Peter et al., 1999).In order to increase both behavioural and attitudinal loyalty, the level of consumer information and product knowledge should be increased. Besides, consumers will become more committed if their beliefs regarding the intrinsic self-relevance of organic food will increase in the future.

Most organic farmers depend on conventional breeding programmes, which conflict with organic principles. Do we need a separate, distinct organic breeding system? And how can we support the development of organic breeding? These questions were explored in a PhD study. In general organic farmers and other interest groups express the need for a separate, fully organic breeding system, particularly in view of the modern reproduction technologies used in conventional breeding. Also the difference in the magnitude of GxE between organic and conventional milk production indicates that a separate breeding program might be needed. In practice, however, organic farmers respond to different, and sometimes opposing, strategic and practical considerations. In this situation three options are identified in the development of organic breeding: adaptation of conventional breeding, an organic breeding program and improved natural breeding. Each path has its own implications and demands. Organic breeding is the subject of experimentation and learning on the one hand and of social debate on organic principles on the other. This process needs to be enhanced and interconnected, before well-founded decisions can be taken on further development of organic breeding.}

We compared six Canadian spring wheat cultivars under organic and conventional management systems for yield, breadmaking quality and soil phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) profile. Yields were lower, but protein levels were higher in the organic system. Cultivars differed for quality traits, but all cultivars had acceptable levels for processing. There were small differences in PLFA profiles for cultivars in the conventional system, but none in the organic system. More significant correlations between grain quality and PLFA measures were present in the organic system. Protein levels and breadmaking quality at least equal to conventional systems can be achieved in organic systems. Wheat cultivars differed for grain quality in both organic and conventional systems, and culivars altered the soil microbial profile in conventional systems. Microbes may play a greater role in determining crop quality in organic systems than in conventional systems.}

These systems are based on the standards of mainstream certification agencies, but differ in that they adapt them to suit local conditions, employ simple verification procedures, minimize bureaucracy and costs, and incorporate an element of environmental and social education for both producers and consumers. This paper presents the experience of PGS in Mexico, with a focus on the case study of the Tianguis Org{\'a}nico Chapingo (Chapingo Local Organic Market).

Indeed, while Mexican agriculture as a whole has suffered severe crises, the organic sector has boomed, and today more than 83 000 producers farm organically on over 300 000 hectares of land. Of these producers, 98 percent are small scale, farming an average of three hectares, and over 50 percent are indigenous people. Unfortunately, as is the case in many developing countries, the vast majority of organic production remains focused on export crops ? particularly coffee, but also cocoa, coconut, and other fruit and vegetables ? with 85 percent of organic goods being sent to foreign markets. From an environmental point of view, exportoriented production is extremely damaging because of the amounts of fossil fuels required for transportation. In addition, packaging for export consumes precious resources and creates mountains of waste. Moreover, an export-oriented focus constrains the degree to which domestic markets are developed, and it leaves Mexican producers highly vulnerable to international market fluctuations.}

This disease is principally caused by Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Fomitiporia mediterranea. The ?wood decay? causes a reduced productivity and longevity in the vineyards and influences the quality of the final product. ?Wood decay? has a high incidence throughout the vineyards, and is difficult to eradicate once present, leaving prevention as the best defence strategy. The different pathogens causing the disease infect the plant mainly through pruning wounds. We studied a commercial formulation of Trichoderma harzianum T22 for the protection of pruning wounds, and thus for the prevention and reduction of the infection. The studies were carried out on potted plants, on shoots of the year that were cut, simulating a summer pruning, and treated with a T. harzianum commercial suspension. A different morphologic reaction was observed on treated and control shoots; physiological processes connected to the reaction, such as the variation in the levels of a growth-promoting hormone (auxin) and the content of total phenols were investigated through biochemical and histological analyses. The higher levels of auxin and phenols recorded in treated shoots suggested a stimulation of T. harzianum on the wound healing processes.}

Averaged over three years of investigation, skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and, less distinct, pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) occurred more often on organic fields. In contrast, yellow wagtails (Motacilla flava) showed higher abundances on conventional fields in one year. The diversity of farmland bird species was not affected by farming system (conventional?organic) neither during the breeding season nor during the non-breeding period. Over the winter, carnivore bird species occurred more often in organically managed fields while the total abundance of herbivore species was not affected by farming systems.}

The distinction between ?an animal health plan? and ?animal health planning? has also become evident (see Atkinson \& Neale, 2008 in these proceedings). Whereas a plan refers to documentation, planning is understood as a process which actively involves the farmer, is based on an assessment and evaluation of a real situation and includes an explicit formulation of the farmer?s goals regarding animal health and welfare. 

In order to develop a single yet adaptable approach to health planning that can be tested under diverse conditions, there is a necessity to identify key principles. This report describes workshop discussions and the consensus reached with regard to the identification of such principles.}

Especially South Asia and Southern Africa could suffer negative impact on several crops when no investments will be made into improved adaptiveness of the production systems. Besides specific technical measures (irrigation, breeding for drought improved or heat tolerant crops), the resilience of whole production systems is a very important focus.

Organic agriculture is a highly knowledge-based technique for manipulating complex agro-ecosystems, for breeding locally adjusted seeds and livestock, and for producing on-farm fertilizers and inexpensive nature-derived pesticides. Such knowledge is a crucial ?reservoir of adaptations?.

Soil fertility-building and soil conserving techniques bring organic farming in a good position to maintain productivity in the event of drought, irregular rainfall events with floods, and rising temperatures. Such techniques are i) the on-farm flux of manure from livestock production to cropland, ii) the use of composts, iii) the use of leguminous crops and green manure in rotations, iv) diversified crop sequences with permanent soil cover and different rooting depths as well as v) minimum or shallow tillage. 

Although organic agriculture is not designed to use water as efficient as possible, different agricultural techniques used in organic agriculture effect water use efficiency of organic arable crops in a positive way. In addition, organic management practices also decrease pollution in water effluent as the main pollutants like mineral nitrogen and pesticides are banned.

An additional strength of organic farming systems is their diversity ? including the diversity of crops, fields, rotations, landscapes and farm activities. The high level of diversity of organic farms provides many ecological services that significantly enhance farm resilience. Positive effects of enhanced biodiversity on pest and disease as well as on better utilization of soil nutrients and water prevention are well documented.

Genetic diversity of crops is generally considered a fundamental resource for adaptation and therefore crucial for the stability of food supply. As resilience and robustness to environmental stress are multigenetic characteristics, the in situ conservation and on-farm breeding are likely to be more successful than genetic engineering. There are many initiatives by plant and animal breeders in the context of organic farms.

To conclude, organic agriculture is a productive agro-ecosystem which might be very resilient and adaptive to climate change scenarios.

The Vision Paper
i) shows the strengths and weaknesses of organic food and farming, 
ii) identifies five global and European challenges and trends on which food and farming research should focus,
iii) groups the strategic priorities of future research and
iv) highlights a large number of specific research
activities for the future.

The potential for innovation on the basis of organic knowledge is considerable and its potential impact on public goods and services as well as on markets is also great. However, current spending on research and dissemination does not adequately reflect this potential. 

The paper is intended to show the way towards a European organic food and farming research agenda that will help to meet the major challenges of the next twenty years.

Parallel to the process of developing the Vision paper, a Technology Platform entitled ?Organics? was established with a focus on sustainable food systems and public goods, and will be officially launched in autumn 2008.}

Fresh tomatoes (cv. Perfectpeel), cultivated under organic and conventional practices were analysed for vitamin C, lycopene, ?-carotene, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, naringenin, rutin, quercetin, Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP). CaCO2 monolayer cell cultures were used for testing membrane damage by Trans Epithelial Electrical Resistance(TEER).
Results showed that for lycopene, naringenin and rutin no significant differences were observed. For ?-carotene and coumaric acid significantly higher values were found in organic samples. Values of vitamin C, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin and TAC were significantly higher in conventional tomato, but the FRAP values were significantly higher in organic tomato. The observed TEER values were not significant different between organic and conventional tomato.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to a theoretical and methodological platform for multidisciplinary research on multifunctional farming. With the notions of polyocular cognition and polyocular communication we introduce a second order, interdisciplinary communication process that can meet the challenge of creating a shared view on multifunctional farming. Polyocular communication must be based on other rules than the rules of the involved disciplines. Whereas disciplinary communication is about providing consistent, efficient and precise knowledge in the context of a sharply delimited research world, polyocular communication is about extending a multidimensional space of understanding. }

I {\ra}tta 3-{\ra}riga f{\"a}ltf{\"o}rs{\"o}k i V{\"a}stsverige, 2002-2006, har {\ra}kerb{\"o}nors f{\"o}rfruktseffekt unders{\"o}kts i tv{\ra} {\ra}rs efterf{\"o}ljande v{\ra}rs{\"a}d. Det f{\"o}rsta {\ra}ret odlades havre, {\ra}kerb{\"o}na som sk{\"o}rdades och {\ra}kerb{\"o}na som ej sk{\"o}rdades utan hela gr{\"o}dan pl{\"o}jdes ned. I tv{\ra} f{\"a}ltf{\"o}rs{\"o}k fanns {\"a}ven motsvarande led med sk{\"o}rdad och inte sk{\"o}rdad {\"a}rt, dessa anv{\"a}ndes vid inkuberingsf{\"o}rs{\"o}ket. Havren g{\"o}dslades det f{\"o}rsta {\ra}ret med 72 kg NH4-N?ha i form av flytg{\"o}dsel. Gr{\"o}dresterna av den sk{\"o}rdade gr{\"o}dan och hela den inte sk{\"o}rdade gr{\"o}dan pl{\"o}jdes ned i mitten av oktober. Under det andra {\ra}ret odlades v{\ra}rkorn och det tredje havre. 

Sk{\"o}rdarna i alla f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksrutor m{\"a}ttes genom f{\"o}rs{\"o}kstr{\"o}skning. Vid mognad DC 91-92 klipptes tre 0,25 m2 stora ytor i varje ruta. Ur den klippta gr{\"o}dan best{\"a}mdes f{\"o}rh{\ra}llandet mellan halm och k{\"a}rnor, b{\"o}nor eller {\"a}rtor. I dessa fraktioner analyserades kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet samt f{\"o}r halm {\"a}ven kolinneh{\ra}llet f{\"o}r ber{\"a}kning av kol?kv{\"a}ve-kvoten. F{\"o}r ber{\"a}kning av v{\ra}rkornets och havrens totala kv{\"a}vem{\"a}ngd antogs att kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet i r{\"o}tterna var 25\% av gr{\"o}dans totala kv{\"a}ve-inneh{\ra}ll (Hansson et al., 1987).

Markens kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}ll ner till 90 cm djup best{\"a}mdes vid fyra olika tillf{\"a}llen. F{\"o}rsta {\ra}ret n{\"a}r gr{\"o}dorna var fullmogna och innan pl{\"o}jning vid mitten av oktober. {\rA}r tv{\ra} i mitten av april samt vid v{\ra}rkornets mognad. Under det tredje {\ra}ret togs inga kv{\"a}veprofiler.

Tv{\ra} inkubationsstudier utf{\"o}rdes f{\"o}r att studera f{\"o}rfrukternas effekt p{\ra} kv{\"a}vemineralisering och immobilisering fr{\ra}n sk{\"o}rd av f{\"o}rfrukterna {\ra}r 1 till v{\ra}ren {\ra}r 2. Jord- och halmprover togs ut rutvis strax efter sk{\"o}rd i tre f{\"o}rs{\"o}k. I plastflaskor inkuberades jord och jord-halm blandningar fr{\ra}n de olika gr{\"o}dorna. Halm?jord blandningen best{\"a}mdes i f{\"o}rh{\ra}llande till den biologiska halmsk{\"o}rden i varje gr{\"o}da och f{\"o}rs{\"o}k med antagandet att halmen blandades in i ett 7 cm tjockt jordlager. Plastflaskorna placerades i ytlagret p{\ra} ett f{\"a}lt i V{\"a}stsverige och t{\"a}cktes med ett jordlager. Varje flaska hade ett ventilationsr{\"o}r som mynnade ca 30 cm ovanf{\"o}r markytan. Genom placeringen i f{\"a}lt utsattes flaskorna f{\"o}r den naturliga temperaturvariationen. I den f{\"o}rsta inkuberingen ingick material fr{\ra}n tv{\ra} f{\"a}ltf{\"o}rs{\"o}k och i den andra endast fr{\ra}n ett. Den f{\"o}rsta inkuberingen genomf{\"o}rdes 2003-10-10 till 2004-04-29 och den andra 2004-10-08 till 2005-04-28. Jordens kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}ll i flaskorna best{\"a}mdes vid fem olika tidpunkter under inkubationsperioden. 

Medelsk{\"o}rdarna av {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor och havre {\ra}r 1 var 2710 kg ts?ha respektive 3050 kg ts?ha. F{\"o}rsta efterverkans{\ra}ret var sk{\"o}rdarna av v{\ra}rkorn st{\"o}rst efter den inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nan, 4470 kg?ha (15\% vattenhalt). Sk{\"o}rden efter den sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nan var 3630 kg?ha och med havre som f{\"o}rfrukt 2980 kg?ha. Det var signifikant st{\"o}rre sk{\"o}rd, 650 kg?ha, efter sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor och efter inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor, 1490 kg?ha, i j{\"a}mf{\"o}relse med efter havre. Det andra efterverkans{\ra}ret fanns det inga signifikanta skillnader i havresk{\"o}rden.

Kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet i marken var i mitten av oktober, {\ra}r 1, 29 kg N?ha efter havre, 46 kg N?ha efter sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor och 49 kg N? ha efter de inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna. Det var signifikant mer kv{\"a}ve i jorden efter {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna i j{\"a}mf{\"o}relse med havre. Under vintern {\"o}kade kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet fast{\"a}n det {\"a}ven b{\"o}r ha skett f{\"o}rluster. I mitten av april var kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet efter havre 40 kg N?ha. J{\"a}mf{\"o}rt med havren var det signifikant mer kv{\"a}ve efter sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}-nor, 18 kg N?ha, och efter inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor, 29 kg N?ha. Under v{\"a}xtodlingss{\"a}songen minskade markkv{\"a}vet till 22-24 kg N?ha efter havre och sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor medan det efter inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor fanns 32 kg N?ha kvar.

M{\"a}ngden kv{\"a}ve i v{\ra}rkornet inklusive 25\% i r{\"o}tterna vid DC 91-92 var f{\"o}r havre 74 kg, sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor, 94 kg och f{\"o}r inte sk{\"o}rdade (nedpl{\"o}jda) {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor, 119 kg. Kv{\"a}veefterverkan efter de sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna blev allts{\ra} 20 kg N?ha och efter de inte sk{\"o}rdade 45kg N?ha i j{\"a}mf{\"o}relse med havre.

Mineralkv{\"a}vebest{\"a}mningarna p{\ra} v{\ra}ren och vid fullmognad (DC 91-92) {\ra}r 2 samt gr{\"o}dprov-tagningen vid det senare tillf{\"a}llet utnyttjades f{\"o}r att ber{\"a}kna f{\"o}rfrukternas inverkan p{\ra} kv{\"a}ve-mineraliseringstillskotten under v{\"a}xts{\"a}songen enligt f{\"o}ljande formel (Lind{\'e}n et al., 1992): Nnet=Nv{\"a}xt?Nmd-Nmv, d{\"a}r Nnet=Ber{\"a}knad nettomineralisering av kv{\"a}ve under v{\"a}xtperioden (tidig v{\ra}r ? full- mognad), Nv{\"a}xt=Kv{\"a}ve i gr{\"o}dan vid fullmognad (= utnyttjbart jord- och f{\"o}rfruktskv{\"a}ve under v{\"a}xts{\"a}songen), Nmd=Mineralkv{\"a}ve i marken (0-90 cm) vid fullmognad, Nmv=Mineralkv{\"a}ve i marken (0-90 cm) tidigt p{\ra} v{\ra}ren. Ber{\"a}knad nettomineralisering av kv{\"a}ve under v{\"a}xtperioden var efter havre, 57 kg N?ha, efter sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor 60 kg N?ha och efter inte sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor 83 kg N?ha. Den lilla skillnaden i kv{\"a}vemineralisering efter havre och sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}nor tyder p{\ra} att kv{\"a}veeffekten av {\ra}kerb{\"o}nsgr{\"o}dan huvudsakligen berodde p{\ra} att mer {\"o}vervintrat mineralkv{\"a}ve var tillg{\"a}ngligt i marken. Under {\ra}r 3 odlades havre och kv{\"a}veinneh{\ra}llet i gr{\"o}dan vid DC 91-92 visade inte p{\ra} n{\ra}gra skillnader beroende av havre eller {\ra}kerb{\"o}na som f{\"o}rf{\"o}rfrukt.

Inkuberingsstudien visade att inte bara havre- utan {\"a}ven {\ra}kerb{\"o}nshalmen gav upphov till kv{\"a}veimmobilisering under inkubationstiden. Detta kan f{\"o}rklaras av den h{\"o}ga C?N-kvoten i halmen av havre och {\ra}kerb{\"o}na, 43 respektive 80. Hos {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna upph{\"o}rde nettoimmobiliseringen vid tiden f{\"o}r vinterns ankomst. Hos havren p{\ra}gick kv{\"a}vefastl{\"a}ggning, uppenbarligen {\"a}nda fram till inkubationsperiodens avslutning i slutet av april. Detta var i {\"o}verensst{\"a}mmelse med mineralkv{\"a}vef{\"o}rr{\ra}dens storlek i f{\"a}ltf{\"o}rs{\"o}ken p{\ra} v{\ra}ren, d{\"a}r det fanns mindre mineralkv{\"a}ve efter f{\"o}rfrukt havre {\"a}n efter de sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna. Av b{\ra}de inkubationsstudierna och f{\"a}ltf{\"o}rs{\"o}ken att d{\"o}ma tycks {\ra}kerb{\"o}nornas och {\"a}rternas positiva N-efterverkan till den {\"o}verv{\"a}gande delen bero p{\ra} st{\"o}rre mineralkv{\"a}vef{\"o}rr{\ra}d i marken p{\ra} v{\ra}ren {\"a}n med havre som f{\"o}rfrukt. Skillnaderna i mineralkv{\"a}vem{\"a}ngderna uppkom i h{\"o}g grad redan vid {\ra}kerb{\"o}nornas och {\"a}rternas mognad och under h{\"o}sten. 

Sammanfattningsvis var det stora efterverkans effekter p{\ra} kv{\"a}vetillg{\ra}ngen och sk{\"o}rden av v{\ra}rkorn d{\"a}r hela {\ra}kerb{\"o}nsgr{\"o}dan pl{\"o}jdes ned. Kv{\"a}veefterverkan motsvarade ungef{\"a}r 18\% av kv{\"a}vet i den nedpl{\"o}jda {\ra}kerb{\"o}nsk{\"o}rden. Det var mindre kv{\"a}veefterverkan efter de sk{\"o}rdade {\ra}kerb{\"o}norna. Dessa b{\ra}da baljv{\"a}xtgr{\"o}dors kv{\"a}veefterverkan {\"a}r d{\"a}rf{\"o}r avh{\"a}ngig av, i vilken utstr{\"a}ckning mineralkv{\"a}vet finns kvar inom rotzonen under den efterf{\"o}ljande v{\ra}ren. Det fanns inga signifikanta skillnader i efterverkan det andra efterverkans{\ra}ret.

        abstract = {In agricultural systems which rely on organic sources of nitrogen (N), of which the primary source is biological N fixation (BNF), it is extremely important to use N as efficiently as possible with minimal losses to the environment. The amount of N through BNF should be maximised and the availability of the residual N after legumes should be synchronised to the subsequent plant needs in the crop rotation. Six field experiments in three locations in Finland were conducted in 1994-2006 to determine the productivity and amount of BNF in red clover-grass leys of different ages. The residual effects of the leys for subsequent cereals as well as the N leaching risk were studied by field measurements and by simulation using the CoupModel. N use efficiency (NUE) and N balances were also calculated. The yields of red clover-grass leys were highest in the two-year-old leys (6700 kg?ha) under study, but the differences between 2- and 3-year old leys were not high in most cases. BNF (90 kg?ha in harvested biomass) correlated strongly with red clover dry matter yield, as the proportion of red clover N derived from the atmosphere ({\ensuremath{>}}85\%) was high in our conditions of organically farmed field with low soil mineral N. A red clover content of over 40 \% in dry matter is targeted to avoid negative N-balances and to gain N for the subsequent crop. Surprisingly, the leys had no significant effect on the yields and N uptake of the two subsequent cereals (winter rye or spring wheat, followed by spring oats). On the other hand, yield and C:N of leys, as well as BNF-N and total-N incorporated into the soil influenced on subsequent cereal yields. NUE of cereals from incorporated ley crop residues was rather high, varying from 30 \% to 80 \% (mean 48 \%). The mineral N content of soil in the profile of 0-90 cm was low, mainly 15-30 kg?ha. Simulations of N dynamics by CoupModel functioned satisfactorily and is considered a useful tool to estimate N flows in cropping systems relying on organic N sources. Understanding the long-term influence of cultivation history and soil properties on N  dynamics remains to be a challenge to further research.}

A geostatistical method, model-based kriging, was used to determine the spatial variation in yield, clover content and BNF of clover-grass leys as well as soil chemical properties throughout two fields in 2004-2006. Based on this variation, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the similar patterns of variation. On one location, total dry matter yields of the leys decreased over three production years from 9 700 to 4 100 kg ha-1, clover content from 53 to 26\% and BNF from 150 to 40 kg N ha-1, whereas on the other location the yields increased from 6 500 to 7 100 kg ha-1, clover content from 52 to 62\% and BNF from 100 to 120 kg N ha-1. Nutrient concentrations in soil also varied greatly within the fields, although this depended on the nutrient species. Kriging combined with PCA described the spatial variation of ley parameters very informatively, but was not as powerful for describing the pattern of nutrients. Based on the spatial dependence determined in the two fields investigated, it seems that the sampling distance should be 80 m for soil nutrients, 100 m for yield and 60 m for clover content and BNF determination, respectively. }

Data from a survey of U.S. organic handlers is used to identify which characteristics are associated with the number of marketing outlets handlers serve.

Resulting uniform payment rates have been frequently discussed and criticised as being inefficient, having a low cost-effectiveness and generating excessive windfall profits. However, few empirical studies exist which quantitatively examine potentials of a more differentiated standard cost approach. By using German farm accountancy data, this study analyses effects of a payment differentiation according to regional and farm individual characteristics on producer rents, budget expenditures and economic efficiency. Preliminary results show that though overcompensation could be reduced in most cases, savings in budget expenditure are often small and might be even offset by increasing administration costs. Generally our analysis indicates that potential benefits of differentiated standard cost approaches can be partly exploited if a) variances of the cost of participation in the universe of farms are high and the discriminatory natures of differentiation are significant, and b) positive correlations between costs and environmental benefits are strong.}

It is important to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and decrease green house gas emission in organic agriculture (OA). Both biogas and bioethanol can be produced in OA and significantly contribute to the sustainability of organic farms. Soil fertility is the basis for OA: it has been of concern that the fertility might decline if most of the organic residues were converted into energy and only effluent from anaerobic digestion process was recycled. However, by intelligent management of organic residues and crop rotation it is possible to avoid decrease of soil fertility and at the same time produce renewable energy.
The presented study is part of the BioConcens project (http:??www.bioconcens.elr.dk?uk?). This study is focused on characterisation of relevant feedstock for co-production of biogas and bioethanol within organic farming. Clover grass silage, dry clover grass and dried grass from meadows were selected. Theoretical biogas and bioethanol yields were calculated. Biogas potential batch tests were performed for each substrate individually and the obtained yield in the lab was compared to the theoretical one. It is expected that the onfarm production of the bioenergy would improve not only sustainability of such a farm but as well economics. Further investigations will be carried out. }

        abstract = {Anaerobic digestion based on animal manure and energy crops is very effective technology to provide energy and reduce green-house gasses emission, in particular ammonia and methane. Besides, utilisation of biogas contributes to reduction of CO2 emission. On the other hand, production of bioethanol from starchy or lignocellulosic materials can supply farmers with liquid fuel necessary for agriculture machinery. Therefore, there is a need for development an effective biorefinery for sustainable energy production in organic agriculture. Due to large amount of existing technologies and many ways for co-production of feed and fuel, the application of process engineering tools is required. The new innovative process configurations can reduce energy production costs and increase a sustainability of the organic farms. Through the development of integrated bioprocesses (biogas, bioethanol and protein production) and combining those different steps into a single unit, it will be possible to develop sustainable energy production at the single organic farm.
A process-simulation model for 100 ha organic farm was developed in order to evaluate new strategies for production of renewable energy in sustainable agriculture. We developed simulation model using SuperPro Designer? software, it contains processing information like: composition of raw materials, flow rates of the various streams and description of the specific unit operations. The process includes feedstock handling and preparation, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation for ethanol production, anaerobic digestion for biogas production, protein separation and recovery, process water recirculation. Data for the development of the model was obtained from laboratory trials, literature data, expert?s consultancy, and results from BioConcens project (http:??www.bioconcens.elr.dk). Different design approaches were evaluated in order to find the most suitable configuration.
Clover grass, maize, rye, vetch, whey, and cattle manure were selected as raw materials for co-production of fuel and feed at the organic farm. Crops grown in organic agriculture were used as a key carbon sources whereas manure and whey were applied mainly as nutrients and process water supply for the fermentations (anaerobic digestion and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, respectively).  Results from batch and lab-scale fermentation trials were basic input for the model. For different energy crops biogas yield vary between 250 and 500mL of methane per gram of volatile solids. Theoretical ethanol yield based on glucose content in biomass i.e. for clover grass vary from 10 to 15g of ethanol per 100g dry biomass. The theoretical ethanol yield was measured both for dry and ensilaged clover grass, maize and rye. Several ways of storage and mild pre-treatment were investigated in a lab scale and evaluated in the simulation model.
Different scenario can be simulated adequately to the farmer?s needs. Particular case can be adjusted to a specific organic farm. Based on the presented model, we are able to estimate the cost of renewable energy in organic farms for the most promising configurations.

It could be concluded from quantification of selected indicators on economy, environment, cow health, milk quality, and labour time, that the organic dairy farms using AMS, in spite of the substantial decrease in grazing time, show potential for a sustainable development. }

During a 6-week period in early summer, 60 Holstein Frisian dairy cows (31.0{$\pm$}5.4 kg ECM) were randomly allocated to three different treatments, with grazing at clover-grass pasture during daytime for 4, 6.5 or 9 h daily. Indoor feeding, with a mixture of roughage and concentrates (13\% crude protein), was restricted for treatment 4 and 6.5 h to the amount the 9-h treatment could eat. Cows allowed grazing at pasture for 4 h moved more rapidly during pasture, moved longer distance per active hour and used a higher proportion of the time eating, both at pasture and indoor, than the cows allowed longer time at pasture. Limiting the grazing time had no influence on the urination (mean=0.26) and defecation (mean=0.37) frequency per cow per hour during pasture. Even though the proportion of time active (eating, drinking, standing or walking), and the actual time active during pasture was different for the treatments, the frequency of urination and defecation per active hour was also unaffected by the treatments. Urine and faeces were distributed in the pasture, without specific hot-spots. The estimated daily N-balance at animal level showed increased N excretion with time at pasture. Assuming that excretion follows the active periods during the day and 7000 kg DM foliage is available on yearly basis, this would result in total excretion at field level of 58, 86 and 108 kg N per ha espectively for treatment 4, 6.5 and 9 h. The results of this experiment show that it is possible to reduce the nitrogen excretion in a grazing system by restricting the grazing time of dairy cows together with restricted indoor feeding while maintaining high foliage intake. }

contribution of an Automatic Milking System (AMS) to sustainable development of

the current difference in AMS use on organic dairy farms between both countries
were explored. To answer above mentioned aims, farmers and advisors in both
countries were interviewed using a focus group approach. Questions of the interviews
were based on a literature review on sustainability issues affected by introduction of
AMS. Participants expressed no moral problems regarding AMS use. They, however,
pointed out uncertainty about the economic gain, difficulties with grazing,
adaptation problems to technology, and image problems towards consumers. The
latter results from a reduction in grazing time affecting both animal welfare and
product quality. The participants did not recognize eutrophication, as result of high
stocking density on farmstead lots, as a problem caused by AMS. The milk quality
problem related to AMS use, although acknowledged as crucial towards consumers,
was not prioritized very highly, especially not by the farmers in both countries. All
groups were, however, unanimous in their perception of how important image was as
far as the consumers are concerned. The perception analysis revealed that Dutch
participants were more concerned about the economic payoff of AMS use, and
showed more reluctance towards enlargement than Danish ones. In addition, they
acknowledged the small-scale naturalness of organic production. These differences in
perception could possibly explain observed differences in AMS use in organic dairy
production between Denmark and the Netherlands.}

However, information to guide growers about when nutrients become available in the soil over the growing season is lacking. Detailed analysis of plant nutrient supply was conducted over three years in a multi-site rotations experiment using two cropping sequences. The experiment compared conventional fertility treatment (synthetic fertiliser (1x N)) with organic treatments (annual compost amendment at a low (1x N) and a high rate (3x N)). Plant-available soil nutrients were captured using sequential two-week burials of ion exchange membranes. Ions were eluted and quantified. Variation in nutrient supply over time, and effects attributable to crop rotation and fertility regime were evaluated with analysis of variance and of principal components. Results showed season-long supply of plant nutrients was more affected by year than fertility regime or rotation, even in composted plots where large residual effects were expected. Synthetic fertiliser and 1x compost resulted in very similar seasonal plant nutrient supplies. While 3x compost caused some significant changes, the gains in plant nutrient supply was modest enough to suggest little or no advantage in this one respect to warrant the cost of amending at greater than the 1x rate.}

Light fraction C and N increased with compost amendment, with the C:N ratio significantly lower in composted plots than in synthetically fertilised plots. Rotation and weeding method played no role in the composition of LFSOM, or the percentage of LFSOM making up whole soil organic C or N. Light fraction N and C roughly doubled in the 1x compost plots over the three years, compared with synthetically fertilised plots, but was only 2.5 times higher in 3x compost plots. While the addition of 13 t ha-1 C increased whole soil C by 5.6 Mg ha-1, tripling the amount of added C raised whole soil C by 9.9 Mg ha-1. 1x and 3x compost increased whole soil N by 20 and 33\%, respectively, compared with the 1x synthetically fertilised plots.

The reviewed literature includes examples of a theory of conventionalisation which implies that later converting producers are less committed to core organic values than the previously established organic producers. The conclusions of this paper do not support this idea. In interpreting the observed differences between the values of established and converting producers, it is argued that these are consistent with some aspects of adoption diffusion model, but changes in external circumstances and the learning experience that conversion represents must also be considered. }

The main objective is to determine how commitment to a broader range of ethical values than those covered by European organic regulations can be reflected in communication with customers. 
This report represents the outcome of the first two work packages (WPs 1 \& 2). In WP 1, a conceptual framework for communicating ethical approaches in organic agriculture was developed. The most important ethical traditions frequently mentioned in the context of ethical consumerism and Corporate Social Responsibility was reviewed. It was established which of the concerns expressed by organic stakeholders go beyond current organic standards, in particular the European Regulations. These concerns and the activities with which they are associated are referred to as ?organicPlus? in this report. In WP 2, in a two step empirical study, organicPlus approaches and ?communication arguments? of organic companies were identified by analysing written company material and qualitative interviews. The first step involved mapping 101 companies to develop a general understanding of the issues for organic SMEs. In a second step, the background of organicPlus approaches was explored in greater detail in 20 case study companies. 
Chapter 1 summarises the basic rationale for the project. OrganicPlus activities have the potential to differentiate organic products in a growing and increasingly globalised market, where organic products compete with other ethical choices such as local or regional foods and ?Fairtrade? products. 
In Chapter 2, the relevance of ethical consumerism, fair trade and ethical business management concepts, such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), for the organic sector is explored. 
Chapter 3 uses stages of a tool-kit for food companies (Corporate Moral Responsibility Manual by Brom et al., 2006) to explore values expressed in literature about the organic sector and compares them with the European Regulation (EEC) 2092?91 and (EC) 834?2007 on organic production.
Chapter 4 describes how organic companies in the five partner countries integrate organicPlus approaches in their activities. 
The final chapter brings together the findings from the two WPs and provides concluding remarks related to the organicPlus approach, the most promising communication arguments for further study and some general conclusions and recommendations.

Results showed that the characteristics of the carcass of suckling lamb were similar for both types of production systems pointing out that organic production system did not affect fatness or muscle development. However, organic meat was darker (higher L? and a? values) probably related with the higher amount of exercise, although fat was not more yellow. In contrast consumers did not consider organic meat darker and there were not significant differences in appearance related with the similar conformation. These results reflect that consumer perceive organic meat as at least as good as conventional production not only regarding environmental quality but also regarding carcass quality.}

The curious concept of ?substantial equivalence? grants a presumption of safety to GMO food. This presumption has yet to be earned, and has been used to constrain labelling of both GMO and non-GMO food. It is an idea that well serves corporatism. It enables the claim of difference to secure patent protection, while upholding the contrary claim of sameness to avoid labelling and safety scrutiny. It offers the best of both worlds for corporate food entrepreneurs, and delivers the worst of both worlds to consumers.

The term ?substantial equivalence? has established its currency within the GMO discourse. As the opportunities for patenting food technologies expand, the GMO recruitment of this concept will likely be a dress rehearsal for the developing debates on the labelling and testing of other techno-foods - including nano-foods and clone-foods.}

        abstract = {China is rapidly adopting, adapting and developing green technology and ideas. China is now a world leader in organic production and this can have implications for world food production. This paper examines the rapid rise of green food and organic agriculture in China, the multiple motivations that have driven it, and the innovative implementation strategies underpinning it. The first organic export from China was in 1990. The Chinese national organic standard and national organic logo were established in 2005. Thirty eight certifiers now operate in China servicing both domestic and export markets. While ?Organic? is still poorly understood in the Chinese domestic market, ?Green Food? is well known and readily available. Green Food is a Chinese innovation and dates from 1990. The China Green Food Development Centre was founded in 1992 to oversee the implementation of this food production innovation. Certification for Green Food production involves the regulation of inputs, with the objective of reduced use of pesticides, the oversight of production, and the residue testing of the produce. This Green Food strategy has been used as a ?half-way house? between chemical food and organic food production. In 1995 Green Food certification was split into Grade A and Grade AA. It is this bifurcation of Green Food standards that laid the groundwork for the rapid articulation from Green Food certification to organic certification, and thus enabled the reported dramatic ten-fold increase in organic hectares in China in 2006 - and thereby placed China second in the world in terms of hectares under organic management, after only Australia. Longitudinal data are examined to reveal China?s organic and green trajectories, and potential future scenarios are presented. The new phenomenon of Chinese certified organic produce raises many questions. Data is presented to illuminate what role country of origin labelling (CoOL) might play, now and in the future, in a world market that is wary of Chinese food quality. China has gone well beyond being an adopter of organic concepts, and is now an active organic innovator - how successful and how exportable might these innovations be? Is the development of Chinese organics a threat or an opportunity, and for whom?

China's organic sector production is valued at between US\$5.6 and US\$10.2 billion. China's Green Food production is valued at US\$20.7 billion. China's Hazard-free agricultural production is valued between US\$29.1 an US\$39.7 billion. The total value of China's eco-labelled food production is between US\$55.4 and US\$70.6 billion. 

This paper reports on the new phenomenon of the export of China's Green Food production standards and certification procedures to other countries, including Canada.}

The association was based in Sydney, New South Wales, and the first issue of its journal, the Organic Farming Digest (OFD), was dated April 1946. This was Australia?s first, and the world?s second, ?organic? farming journal. The eighteen month delay between the founding of the society and the first publication of the journal was because paper was unavailable in Australia for that purpose during WWII. The society published a total of 378 articles in 29 issues from 1946 to 1954. Articles from Australia, UK, USA, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany and Denmark were published. Topics included: farming and gardening; health; environment; politics and economics; and animal welfare. More than 190 authors were published. British authors published included Sir Albert Howard, Lady Louise Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, and Friend Sykes. American authors published included Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, Jerome Rodale, Gaylord Hauser, and Louis Bromfield. Australian authors from the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland were published. These included Sir Stanton Hicks, then Professor of Physiology and Pharmacology at Adelaide University, NSW grazier Colonel Harold White, and Tasmanian MLC Henry Shoobridge. More than 130 original articles were published, and other articles were reproduced from many sources including: Organic Gardening (USA); Bio-Dynamic (USA); Soil and Health (UK); Health and the Soil (UK); Mother Earth, (UK); Trees and the Earth (UK); Farmers Weekly (South Africa) and Compost Magazine (NZ). The Society was wound up in 1955, due to lack of financial support. The digests published by the AOFGS document a decade of the thoughts, aspirations, focus, theory and practice of Australia?s first practitioners and proponents of organic farming, from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s.}

Of the Land \& the Spirit is a collection of essays and chapters that reflect the spectrum of Northbourne?s interests, including religion, art, education, gardening and agriculture. Lord Northbourne was trained at Oxford University in agriculture, and it remained one of his abiding interests. 

From a lifetime approaching nine decades, Of the Land \& the Spirit presents an account of four decades of Northbourne?s thoughts - beginning with excerpts from Look to the Land, through to the final chapter The Ineluctable Alternative: A Letter to my Descendants. Northbourne?s holistic views flow though his writings whether he is discussing farming, flowers or faith.}

In questing after the earliest organic farming society, and more particularly in pursuing the spread of the "organic" meme  from its 1940 birth in Britain, it was therefore a great surprise to uncover the Australian Organic Faming and Gardening Society (AOFGS) founded in October 1944. This appears to be the world's first "organic farming" association. It also resets the organic clock for Australia back by four decades. Here was an association, pre-dating the UK Soil Association by two years, formed half a world away from the birthplace of "organic", in a country at war, under food rationing, and with its workforce under Manpower regulations. Yet organic farming principles were clearly articulated by this Society, perhaps as clearly articulated as they have ever been, and particularised for Australia. The Society was constrained from publishing their journal due to wartime constraints on paper. The first appearance of the Organic Farming Digest (OFD) was in April 1946. Thereafter, for nearly a decade, the Society regularly published a journal, with the last issue appearing in 1954. This paper explores the Society; its principles; its journals; its people; its interactions with key organic figures of the time including Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, Eve Balfour, Albert Howard, and Jerome Rodale; its Australian contributors from five  states,  including Colonel Harold White and Professor Sir Stanton Hicks; its progress and ultimately its demise; and touch on how this history became lost.}

A recent study in the USA reported that all the adult subjects tested had bisphenol A in their urine. Canada has just declared bisphenol A to be a toxic substance. Canada has responded to the accumulating evidence that BPA leaches from polycarbonate baby bottles and behaves like an estrogen. An extra dose of female sex hormones is not the best of dietary supplements for babies, either male or female; or for teenagers, or even adults.

In systems with delayed drilling of the cereals between rows of rapeseed, wheat and barley had problems in field establishment and rapeseed yields were over-proportional in relation to the chosen seed reduction. Land equivalent ratios (LER) were around 1 in all systems. The use of those mixtures as practicable yield buffer in organic farms needs further evaluation.}

        abstract = {Nitrate leaching from agricultural areas is a political and environmental issue at both local scale in Denmark and at global scale. Plant-available nitrogen and nitrate in the rooting zone in the growing season is necessary in order to obtain satisfactory crop yields. However, surplus nitrogen leads to a risk of nitrate losses through leaching and denitrification. In addition to artificial applications of nitrate, nitrate is produced by mineralisation processes in the soil from plant residues and soil organic matter and by nitrification. Therefore nitrate losses can be difficult to control. This thesis investigates root growth in arable and vegetable crops through construction and improvement of existing models for determining root growth and associated N uptake. The models provide an insight into nitrate dynamics in the soil matrix, and can be used to predict plant yield and N uptake and changes in different soil N pools. Here, the models were used for analysing different physical and biological processes in soil. This was combined with analysis of model construction and parameterisation of crop modules, root sub-modules and soil organic matter pools for predicting nitrate leaching and retention.}

In the framework of a national study, we compared conservation (no tillage NT and reduced tillage RT) and conventional (mouldboard ploughing MP and shallow mouldboard ploughing SMP) tillage systems in 3 field experiments and 2 on-farm surveys. We measured the impacts of soil tillage on: (1) soil compaction: more compacted soil under NT and RT, (2) earthworm populations: more earthworms under NT, (3) weed infestation: weed level tends to be higher under NT, but it is not a general trend, and (4) crops: crop yields are lower under NT according to weed infestation. Then, independent of soil type and experimental year (2 to 5 years), it seems that soil physical fertility decreases under NT and RT. But, the first reason of a decline of crop yield under NT is the weed infestation. }

In the last decades a series of resistant cultivars (Re?-cultivars) bred in Dresden-Pillnitz has been released, ?Recolor? and ?Rekarda? in 2006. The main topic in the resistance breeding programme was scab resistance and the donor of scab resistance in most cultivars was Malus x floribunda 821. Due to the development of strains that are able to overcome resistance genes inherited by M. x floribunda 821 and due to the fact that single resistance genes can be broken easily, pyramiding of resistance genes is necessary. Besides scab, fire blight and powdery mildew are the main disease for which a pyramiding of genes is aspired in Pillnitz. Biotechnical approaches are necessary for the early detection of pyramided resistance genes in breeding clones. This paper will give an overview of the resistance breeding of apple in Pillnitz and the methods used.}

It concludes that to raise and maintain adequate plant-available P in these systems the importation of organic manures or composts from off-farm will be required, although the immediate issue may be access to economically viable sources.  Improving the P-use efficiency of the system by incorporating species into rotation or intercropping systems that are able to access P from less soluble sources has been a successful strategy elsewhere in the world and deserves further research effort in Australia. Agronomic management to maximise quantity and quality of pasture and crop plant residues undoubtedly builds labile soil organic matter and facilitates P cycling, but the strategy may be of limited benefit in low rainfall areas that do not have the capacity to produce large plant biomass inputs. Progress in selection and breeding for cereal genotypes that are more P-efficient and other plant genotypes that can access less labile P sources is gaining momentum but still remains a long term prospect.}

Hence, we determined the mineralization potential of several organic greenhouse soils maintained at two temperatures (17, 23?C) and water potentials (?35, ?250 mbars). Replicate cores of structurally intact soils were collected in plastic cylinders, saturated with water and adjusted to the appropriate matric potential. Additional soil samples were sieved, placed in glass jars and incubated under the same treatment conditions. Soil nutrients, gas concentration (O2, CO2, N2O) and microbial activity (CO2 release) were measured over a 25-week period during aerobic incubation. Large variations in nutrient and organic matter content were observed among intact soil samples. CO2 efflux declined exponentially with time, decreases being most apparent in soils having high organic matter content. An increase in temperature lead to enhanced soil respiration rates, mainly during the first weeks of incubation. Overall, mineralization rates were only slightly affected by moisture level or temperature. Gas diffusion, and thus soil biological activity, may be momentarily hindered during frequent irrigations. Yet, our findings indicate that in general matric potentials of ?35 and ?250 mbars both result in similar mineralization rates in these soils.}

The aim of the experiment was to test innovative strategies and operative machines for non-chemical (physical) weed control.
The innovative strategy was compared with the farm traditional technique. The innovative strategy consisted in the application of the stale-seedbed technique (by means of a rolling harrow and a flaming machine in the pre-transplanting phase) and precision hoeing interventions in post-transplanting phase (with an innovative machine equipped with rigid elements, for inter-row weed control, and elastic tines for selective intra-row weed control). Traditional technique consisted in two chemical pre-transplanting interventions and two post-transplanting rotary hoe treatments.
Innovative operative machines performances, weed density during the crop cycle, dry weed biomass at harvest and crop fresh yield were recorded.
The innovative strategy allowed to reach significantly higher yield values (?18\%), a good weed control and a relevant increase of gross marketable production with respect to traditional strategy (?4500 ? ha-1 as net value of weed management costs).
The experiment is still on-going and it will finish in 2008.

more leathery and small fruits. ?Florence? and ?Peco? had often sunburst (by intensive

As much success as consumers in the US and Germany had with the initiation and establishment of ge-free regions, US consumers did not succeed with their ge-food labelling campaigns. Only in Vermont a ge-seed Labelling law could be passed. In Germany ge-food, ge-feed and ge-seed have to be labelled by law. German Consumers and low input farmers tried to get also products derived from ge-feed included in ge-labelling laws. It seems a consumer influenced compromise that a new German legislation is about to be adopted which would allow for an easier Non-GMO-Labelling of food. Yet consumer opportunities to make informed choices about the food they eat seem to be still limited, especially in North America with the practical absence of federal ge-food, feed and seed labelling laws. Thus a few years ago, actors of the organic and natural food Industry teamed up to launch the so called Non-GMO Project, which shall soon open its Verification Program to the North American natural and organic food industry, offering a standard for ge-free or Non-GMO verification. }

Therefore it is important to evaluate how the sensory attributes such as taste, flavour and texture of fresh and processed products are influenced by the different management systems. For sensory evaluation, in crop year 2005  seven wheat samples were assessed by a trained sensory panel, each with 4 field replicates (in total = 28 samples). The wheat samples were processed to wholemeal bread and biscuits for evaluation. 

A descriptive panel (12 persons) was well trained according DIN 10967 as well as for quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). This method enables to show a complete product profile with all sensory characteristics and their intensity in appearance, aroma, texture, mouthfeel and flavour attributes.

For wholemeal-bread, results in crop year 2005 showed no significant differences between the different farming systems. The influence of varieties were higher than farming management effects. The varieties ?Paragon?, ?Zebra? and ?Fasan? were significant different to ?Monsun? in texture attributes.

Competition from buckwheat and mustard intercrops did not influence pest density on broccoli; rather, aphid pressure decreased and natural enemies of cabbage aphid were enhanced in intercropping treatments, but this varied with the intercropped plant and season (summer vs. fall).

        abstract = {There is a large base of evidence that fermented whole crop forages can be grown and conserved successfully in temperate conditions such as the UK offers. As preservatives are generally eschewed in organic production the crop is generally cut earlier in line with recommendations for fermented whole crop forages. Starch and protein levels will be lower at earlier harvest dates. This results in penalties in yield, greater losses in dry matter during fermentation and can lead to secondary fermentation when the clamp is opened to feed. Most of the research work reviewed is based on cereal whole-crop, although there is a developing body of knowledge based on intercropping of cereals and legumes as well as crops such as kale. Much of this work is addressed at the needs of the low-input and organic producer where fertiliser inputs and purchased feeds (in particular) proteins to the farm system are minimised. The bulk of this research however, has focused on production and conservation and relatively little on feeding of the forages to livestock. This is especially the case for cereal?legume mixtures which are most interesting to the organic livestock producer. This is surprising as all production of whole crop forages either as sole crops or as mixtures are ultimately as feeds for livestock. The nutritional quality (especially protein) can be somewhat lacking when grown as a sole cereal crop and the inclusion of a legume has been seen to partially overcome this although due to lower dry matter yields can detract from the objective of preventing forage production penalties where these crops are grown as nurse crops for grass re-seeds. Most workers agree that dry matter intakes are stimulated when offered as a feed to ruminants but few workers have found an increase in animal performance (weight gains, carcase quality or milk yields). There are however definitely opportunities to reduce reliance on purchased concentrates by growing and including, in particular legume-based forage mixtures to organic livestock. This attribute has become more important recently in the UK due to limited sources and costs of organic protein sources to purchase. On farm where re-seeding of pastures is practiced, whole crop forages can provide an excellent nurse crop and alternative feed to grass silage and help to overcome the seasonal production penalty usually associated with grass re-seeds.}

Stockless systems provide no opportunity for the creation of straw and animal manure based farm yard manure or compost. While there is no research evidence that the lack of animals or manure based compost affects overall soil fertility and crop yield, there is some research evidence that animal manure enhances soil mychorrizae populations and soil organic matter accumulation. This effect might also be seen from the use of plant based compost, sometimes sourced off-farm as ?green waste? in stockless systems, but there is no comparative work available. While the use of manures has the advantage of allowing movement of fertility around the farm within a rotation, grazing animals have the drawback of uneven dispersal of manure and urine and manure storage is liable to poor management and loss of nutrients. Green manures are fundamental to stockless systems, both as one or two year crops which are either mulched or incorporated or grown as short term catch crops or undersown crops. With appropriate selection and management of green manures there is potential for enhanced fertility building over that which is possible with grazed leys. The practical commercial experience of farmers using stockless rotations is stronger than the research would suggest in terms of supporting its technical success and viability. Weed control remains a serious problem for arable farms which requires very high standards of management. The demand for organic livestock products is increasing and the area of organic land producing feed grains is insufficient to support the required expansion. World demand for organic grains is increasing. The introduction of livestock on to specialist conventional cereal producing farms in many instances requires prohibitively expensive infrastructure costs. Stockless rotations utilising green manures to fix nitrogen as part of the rotation provide a technically feasible and profitable alternative. Stockless horticultural systems operated with or without the use of imported manure or compost offer potential for technically and financially viable systems provided that there is an appropriate balance of fertility building green manures and cash crops.}

Traditional organic systems of mixed farming with alternate husbandry rely on fertility building leys and livestock manures to provide break crops and fertility building. However, the trend within agriculture has been a move away from mixed farming systems to specialist units. Stockless organic farming involves the use of green manures and green waste compost to replace livestock and animal manures.

The infrastructure costs (fencing, water and buildings) of introducing livestock into an all arable farm are often prohibitively expensive and preclude conversion to a mixed organic farming system.

A stockless organic system allows conversion to organic farming without the requirement to introduce livestock and their associated infrastructure costs. Totally stockless systems do not import livestock manures but some utilize green wastes.

The review looks at the challenges of stockless organic systems such as Conversion planning, Rotation design maintaining soil nutrient status, weed control, pest control and economic return.

The aim of this review is to address these issues and the main problems faced by producers. The study includes a review of the available research results from Defra and other research programmes, summarises the findings and provides analysis of the results together with a summary of the practical implications for organic farming.

The vision of organic farming systems, independent of fossil energy resources, with significantly lower nutrient losses, and no net contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions might be fulfilled via the integration of biogas production. This is an important hypothesis investigated in the www.bioconcens.elr.dk?uk? research project.

This poster illustrates preliminary results from a model for the fossil energy balance, Nitrogen losses, and greenhouse gas emissions in a 1000 ha energy catchment with organic dairy farming and integrated biogas production in Denmark. The model will draw on results from previous models (e.g the farmGHG model), and includes a number of organic dairy farm type components, including information on livestock production, housing, manure storage, manure and fodder import?export, crop rotations, yield levels, and soil types. In addition, a biogas plant model component evaluates effects of the inclusion of variable amounts of manures and crop residues from the specified farm types, into the biogas energy production. 

The model is intended to result in an overall catchment balance for the following three types of indicators: 1) the fossil energy use ? i.e. the net fossil energy use minus the bioenergy production, 2) losses of Nitrogen in the form of nitrates, ammonia and nitrous oxide, and 3) the emission of the three main greenhouse gasses from agriculture: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents. Moreover, these indicator values are specified for each of the farm types included in the model, and for the biogas plant component. Finally, selected model results are discussed in relation to the overall hypothesis of the research project, and it is discussed how the integration of biogas production in organic farming, can help to improve the self-sufficiency in Nitrogen, and thereby reduce the import of nutrients to the organic farming systems.

In a third group of trials, compost was used alone or enriched with microorganism of the fungal genus Trichoderma and the suppressiveness in open field towards Phytophthora capsici on pepper has been evaluated. Organic certified compost quality was comparable to peat quality. Organic certified compost showed to have a disease suppressive activity in greenhouse, compared to peat amendment, against Phytophthora spp..

Karst areas, encompassing about 50\% of Croatian territory, are the natural habitat to eight of nine indigenous sheep breeds. These areas are nearly free from pollution, which makes them ideal for organic production. These facts were the foundations for the onset of the projects ?Organic lamb production in Croatia? and ?Standardisation of some health parameters of Croatian indigenous sheep breeds?. Their goal is to promote and support the development of organic sheep production in Croatian karst areas. In the course of two years, we monitored housing conditions, feeding regime and general health status of animals from five organic flocks. We took blood and faeces samples to determine normal ranges of key physiological and biochemical parameters, since no such previous data existed. They will provide the basis for health monitoring as an aid to veterinarians and sheep breeders in organic production.

        abstract = {{\"U}ber zwei Jahre (2006 ? 2008) wurde der  Gesundheitsstatus von Legehennen auf 20 {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftenden Betrieben evaluiert, um betriebsspezifische Tiergesundheitspl{\"a}ne 
zu erstellen. Gesucht wurden Gesundheitsindikatoren, die zuverl{\"a}ssig zu erheben sind und das Tiergesundheitsmanagement unterst{\"u}tzen. Weiterhin sollten sie das Benchmarking verschiedener Legehennenherden erm{\"o}glichen. Als sehr relevante Gesundheitsparameter wurden der Befiederungszustand, Verletzungen am K{\"o}rper und Fussballenabszesse herangezogen. Analysen auf Endoparasiten wurden f{\"u}r jede Herde durchgef{\"u}hrt sowie der Vogelmilbenbefall ermittelt. In einem Interviewgespr{\"a}ch wurden die gesundheitsrelevanten Haltungsdaten abgefragt. Aufbauend auf diesen Ergebnissen wurden betriebsindividuelle Tiergesundheitspl{\"a}ne implementiert, in denen Ma{\ss}nahmen und Ziele mit den Betriebsleitern zusammen erarbeitet wurden. 
Ziel war es, mit regelm{\"a}{\ss}igen Kontrollen und deren nachvollziehbaren Dokumentation die H{\"a}ufigkeit der auftretenden Probleme zu minimieren. Hier zeigten die Tiergesundheitspl{\"a}ne den Betriebsleitern umsetzbare Ans{\"a}tze. Im Bereich von Futteraufnahme-, Tiergewichts-, Befallskontrolle Endo- und Ektoparasiten und daraus abgeleitete Umsetzungen gab es wichtige Felder der Optimierung. Es zeigte sich, dass ein nachhaltiger Erfolg zur Verbesserung der Tiergesundheit auf betrieblicher Ebene nur durch einen fortlaufenden, intensiven Austausch zwischen Betriebsleitern und Tiergesundheitsberatern erreicht werden kann. Gemeinsam sind praxistaugliche Ma{\ss}nahmen mit Erfolgskontrollen weiterzuentwickeln, da laufend wechselnde Rahmenbedingungen und damit verbundene Problemfelder auftreten. F{\"u}r die Akzeptanz von Tiergesundheitspl{\"a}nen auf den Betrieben w{\"a}re es von Bedeutung, die {\"o}konomischen Auswirkungen durch die erreichten Tiergesundheitsziele aufzuzeigen.}

The model steps include a good knowledge of the vegetable crop, market, soil?substrate, irrigation water, climate, microclimate, companion crops and the current and indigenous horticultural technologies. Also, the proposal recognizes the distinction between agriculture and horticulture in tropical environments. Growth and yield results indicate that the onion cultivars Americana, Cimarron and H10020 were the top performers for leaf area, bulb diameter and yield. Furthermore, the red shallot 10026 showed the highest total soluble solids and dry matter content, and also a good relative yield. Shallots (from true seed) and other local and exotic vegetables have a great potential in tropical environments.}

Information on twenty-four locally available plants having pesticidal value, have been collected from the Tharu communities of Dibya Nagar and Meghauli VDCs, Chitwan. Out of them four of the most promising plants were selected to test their efficacy in farmers? field conditions. In order to assess the effectiveness of plant materials on insect pests of vegetables, a farmers? field experiment was conducted in Dibya Nagar during the summer of 2006. The plants selected to test efficacy against insect pests of Zucchini are Azadiracta indica, Justicia adhatoda, Persicaria barbata, and Artemisia indica. Plant extracts made from fresh green leaves of the selected plants at a concentration of 1:5 were applied at seven days intervals. It was found that A. indica had most promising effect on the pests, followed by P. barbata. However, all other treatments had positive effect. Similarly, the research result indicated possibility of using plant materials towards development of organic pest management methods. }

The leaching of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as measured in pore water sampled by suction cups, increased during the autumn and winter, whereas the leaching of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was fairly constant during this period. Leaching of 15N from the sward indicated that ryegrass was the direct source of less than 1-2 percent of the total N leaching measured, whereas N dynamics pointed to clover as an important contributor to N leaching. Sampling of roots indicates that the dynamics in smaller roots were responsible for N and C build-up in the sward, and that N became available for transfer among species and leaching from the root zone. The bi-directional transfer of N between ryegrass and clover could however not be explained only by root turnover. Other processes like direct uptake of organic N compounds, may have contributed.}

Based on the hypothesis that four different plant materials would degrade differently, a 16 months field experiment was conducted to determine (i) the source strength of labelled plant residues in dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and dissolved organic N (DON) in pore water from the plough layer, and (ii) the plant uptake of organically bound N. Litterbags containing 14C- and 15N-labelled ryegrass or clover roots or leaves were inserted into the sward of a ryegrass-clover mixture in early spring. The fate of the released 14C and 15N was monitored in harvested biomass, roots, soil, and pore water percolating from the plough layer. No evidence of plant uptake of dual-labelled organic compounds from the dual-labelled residues could be observed. N in pore water from the plough layer during autumn and winter had a constant content of dissolved organic N (DON) and an increasing content of dissolved inorganic N (DIN). A positive correlation between aboveground clover biomass harvested in the growth season and total N in pore water indicated that decaying roots from the living clover could be a major source of the 10 kg N ha-1 being lost with pore water during autumn and winter. The presence of 15N in pore water shifted from the DON fraction in autumn to the DIN fraction in late winter, with strong indications that 15N originated from the living ryegrass. However, 15N in pore water originating from plant residues only constituted 1.5\% of the total dissolved N from the plough layer.}

Selectivity was defined as the relationship between crop burial in soil immediately after treatment and weed control. To estimate crop burial, digital image analysis was used in order to make the estimations objective. The study showed that narrow row spacing decreased selectivity in a late growth stage (21) whereas row spacing in the range of 5.3 cm to 24 cm had no effects in an early growth stage (12). Harrowing across rows decreased selectivity in one out of two experiments. Whether repeated passes with the harrowing were carried out in the same orientation along the rows or in alternative orientations forth and back was unimportant. There were indications that high driving speed decreases selectivity and that repeated passes with low driving speed are better than single treatments with high driving speed. Impacts on selectivity, however, were small and only significant at high degrees of weed control. Timing had no significant impact on selectivity.

This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i.e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with spring tine harrows, rotary hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity is defined as the ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80\% weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25\% crop-soil cover are calculated with 95\%-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new digital image analysis tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development.}

It is structured in six parts. In the first part, we investigate the agricultural economic contributions from different Danish theoretical approaches. These concepts are used as heuristic frameworks. We argue for a deductive study and a long-term approach. Using Denmark as example, the postulate is that agriculture has experienced three transformations since the end of the 18th century. This is why the theoretical concept of transformation is included. These considerations lead us to formulate the research question, How is it possible to understand the evolution of the phenomenon of organic agriculture from an economic theoretical perspective and within the framework of long-term agricultural structural change and transformation?}

Furthermore, the objective was to study how differences in digestibility might be related to growth and feed utilisation at various growth rates.  When comparing the results from the experiments it appeared that particularly protein digestibility was closely related to specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio at high growth rates. As a tool to visualise the relationship between protein digestibility and growth of rainbow trout a growth model was developed based on the specific intake of digestible protein, and general assumptions on protein content and protein retention efficiency in rainbow trout. The model indicated that increased protein digestibility only partly explained growth increase and that additional factors were important for growth increment.}

The aim of the present study was to optimize the effectiveness, on zinc availability in maize, of natural organic substances by enriching them with zinc sulfate. For this purpose pod of Phaseolus vulgaris and inner rice husk, as abundant organic wastes in the north of Iran, were incubated with increasing quantities of zinc sulphate. The effect of these zinc-enriched composts, zinc sulphate, and zinc 14\% chelate on zinc availability in maize in a calcareous soil was studied in a greenhouse experiment. DTPA-extractable zinc of the soil, total zinc concentration, and chlorophyll of plant leaves were measured. Soil applications of all treatments, especially zinc-enriched composts, increased DTPA-extractable zinc more than control treatment, but this increase is not significant for zinc chelate. The plant analysis indicated that zinc-enriched composts of both organic matters significantly increased total zinc concentration in plant leaves more than control treatment, and their effects increased by increasing the level of enrichment until toxic level, even over that of zinc chelate.  Non-enriched of both organic matters and zinc chelate had the most effect on leaf chlorophyll and significantly increased the amount of chlorophyll more than control treatment. }

Der Ertrag nach Minerald{\"u}ngung lag zwischen den beiden anderen D{\"u}ngerarten, kam aber der Mistvariante meist n{\"a}her als der Ackerbohnenvariante.

Auch hier lag die pflanzliche organische D{\"u}ngung mit 0,74 \% Corg statistisch auf dem Niveau der Minerald{\"u}ngung.}

The amount of water available in June was a relevant yield determining factor (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) only for minerally fertilized wheat. During 13 years the manure fertilized wheat yielded between 30 and 50 dt ha-1, irrespective to water availability. Manure fertilization gave lower maximum yields but higher minimum yields showing a better yield stability. With manure fertilization the wheat plants realized a better harvest index of 45\% compared to mineral fertilization (41\%; p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). Other studies in this experiment revealed an enhanced root growth with better root distribution, even in the sub-soil, with manure fertilization and biodynamic preparations. This may have enabled the organically fertilized cropping system to compensate better for restricted growth conditions.}

The yield of the CLA rich olein fraction was 44.5\% of the total amount of olein and stearin. There were significant increases during the first fractionation step of highland butter for the concentration of the CLA isomer cis-9, trans-11 (P {\pounds} 0.05) and during the second fractionation step for the concentration of CLA isomers cis-9, trans-11; trans-11, cis-13 (P {\pounds} 0.05) and trans-7, cis- 9 (P {\pounds} 0.01). Experiments carried out demonstrate that the selected physical separation process enables CLA enrichment but the increase is too minor to achieve any decisive positive impact on human health and therefore too costly as an industrial CLA enrichment process.}

The phenomenon ?parent?s dealing with changed food preferences of juvenile children?, which is presented here, provides an insight into juveniles? demands regarding organic food products and parents? strategies and actions to deal with these. Thereby sweets, salty food snacks and chocolate spreads turn out to be organic food products mainly rejected by juveniles. As main reason for rejection the criteria of taste can be identified. Dealing with their children?s preferences, parents follow the two strategies ?making concessions? and ?not making concessions?. Product type, product attributes, consumption situation and price emerge as subjectively meaningful conditions for the interviewed parents.

Influences of ley age, soil properties, and geographical location on the herbage production of red clover-grass leys were determined under practical conditions on 27 organic farms located in the southern and in the northwestern coastal regions of Finland. Averaged over one-, two-, and three-year-old leys the accumulated first and second cuts produced 7.12 t dry matter herbage ha-1 year-1, with a clover proportion of 34.8\%. Herbage production declined with increasing ley age. The average proportion of clover increased from 26.4\% in the first to 43.7\% in the second cut but decreased with ley age. Within- and between-field variations of clover proportions markedly decreased from the first to the second cut and strongly increased with ley age, while changes in the variations of herbage production were less pronounced. Within-field variations of clover proportions in the first and in the second cuts were higher at lower proportions of clover. Herbage production was positively related with clover proportion. Soil properties had a major impact on clover proportion and herbage production, largely explaining also regional differences in ley growth. Amelioration of fields and, not at least, of less fertile sites within the same field seems to be a crucial requirement for higher and more even clover proportions and herbage yields. }

In order to assess long-term effects on productivity, environmental impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared since 1989 on a loam soil. 

A decline in soil structure quality was found in a conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring, organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. 

There were overall increases in earthworm density (84\%), earthworm biomass (80\%) and the density of earthworm channels (132\%) in the topsoil between 1994 and 2004. Most of these increases were found in systems with 1?3 years of ley in the 4-year rotation. Low values of all earthworm parameters, and only minor changes over the period studied, were found in two non-organic arable systems without ley, indicating high pressure on soil fauna. Lower earthworm activity was found in the non-organic arable system with reduced tillage as compared to the non-organic arable system with annual ploughing. Thus, 50\% leys in the rotation appeared desirable for the maintenance of satisfactory soil structure and earthworm activity. Though the deterioration of soil structure in the conventional arable system was not extreme, as the soil was well structured initially, the results may have implications for the sustainability of stockless arable systems on soils with a less favourable initial structure.}

Environmental impact was assessed according to agricultural land use and numbers of production animals, both of which depend on food consumption. The results were quantified in terms of nutrient balances, greenhouse gas and acid emissions and the diversity of crop cultivation, which indicate eutrophication of watersheds, climate change and landscape changes, respectively.

The study region was able to satisfy its own needs for all farming and food consumption scenarios. Dietary choice had a marked impact on agricultural land use and on the environmental parameters considered. Organic farming for local food production resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with mixed diets, the vegetarian diet was associated with lower emissions and nutrient surpluses, but also with reduced crop diversity. The arable areas allocated to leys and pastures were also smaller.

The study area represents a predominantly rural region and is a net exporter of agricultural produce. Therefore, only part of the environmental impact of food production results from local needs. Both the differences among the dietary options and the overall environmental benefit of localised primary food production were greatly reduced when considering total agricultural production of the region. Much of the negative impact of agriculture is due to food consumption in the densely populated urban areas, but the consequences are mainly felt in the production areas. The environmental impacts of localisation of primary food production for the rural areas are small and inconsistent. The results indicate the importance of defining ?local? on a regional basis and including the urban food sinks in impact assessment. }

This paper describes an electronic compendium of information relevant to animal health and welfare in organic farming, the main aim of which is to provide resource material and a training tool for those working with organic livestock farmers. The approach involved an extensive and detailed literature search, synthesis to provide advisory material and the development of a website. The compendium is divided into species specific sub-sections covering Disease Management, Veterinary Management and Health and Welfare and includes over 2500 references and web-site links. The compendium covers 45 cattle, 44 sheep, 32 poultry and 27 pig diseases and conditions as well as extensive sections pertaining to each species? behavioural requirements. Throughout there are links to relevant elements of organic farming legislation.
By providing information on new research and practical solutions to treating and avoiding disease it is expected that the compendium will contribute to improved knowledge amongst farmers, veterinarians and advisors and thereby enabling the development of animal health plans that promote high standards of animal health and welfare in organic farming.

The effect of colostrum on the activity of the complement system in neonatal calves was also studied.

It was possible to increase substantially complement and opsonization activities of serum by feeding colostral whey concentrate to neonatal calves. A colostral immune preparation (IP) containing specific antibodies against Helicobacter felis prevented but did not eradicate an experimental Helicobacter felis infection in mice. However, the IP combined with amoxicillin lowered the level of inflammation and colonization more than amoxicillin alone. The specific anti-cariogenic antibodies of IP remained active and functional when added to UHT milk or fermented with LGG and stored for an extended time. Further, the combination of IP and LGG prevented the adherence of Streptococcus mutans effectively.

Lactobacillus plantarum MLBPL1 isolated from sauerkraut showed anti-Helicobacter activity mainly associated with cell wall, from where it can be extracted into the culture supernatant. Colostral preparations, and acidifying microbes (L. plantarum MLBPL1 and LGG) reduced the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori on human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. They also reduced the IL-8 production of the infected cells. IL-8 secretion is a primary response to Helicobacter pylori infection.

Supplementation of an antibiotic treatment with a food product containing probiotic lactobacilli and?or IP could offer a potential complementary means to suppress gastrointestinal infections.}

The aim of the study is to define important agronomic characteristics of cultivar adapted to organic farming. Despite some relation with agronomical performances in low input system, weeds competitiveness, productivity and baking quality are specific in organic farming. Productivity and baking quality are linked to nutrient acquisition ability: nitrogen uptake and nitrogen-use-efficiency. The selection of new lines based on weed competition and N efficiency is necessary. Thus, we define an index selection method.

Monitoring panel performance is then crucial for optimal sensory evaluations. The
quality of the results is strongly dependent on the performance of each assessor and
of the panel as a whole. The present work proposes to analyze the panel performance
within single sensory evaluations and between consecutive evaluations. The
basic idea is to use multi-way models to handle the three-way nature of the sensory
data. Specifically, a PARAFAC model is used to investigate the panel performance
in the single experiment. N-PLS model is used to test the predictive ability of the
panel on each experiment. A PARAFAC model is also used for monitoring panel
performance over different experiments.}

In organic irrigated soils the use of legumes and the application of moderate amounts of manures resulted in higher amounts of soil organic C and potentially mineralisable N. In contrast, in organic rain-fed soils that did not incorporate legumes in their rotation and used low amounts of manures, soil organic C and potential mineralisable N were lower. In organic irrigated soils changes in organic matter quality resulted in a lower potential net N mineralisation per unit of SOC than in conventional irrigated soils. }

This preliminary results show that averaged weed species richness per edge (alpha-diversity) and floristic homogeneity among edges are higher in organic than conventional fields. Only in conventionally managed fields, elevated landscape intensification is associated to higher weed alpha-diversities and floristic homogeneity among crop edges.
The expression of high-quality weed flora is higher in organic than in conventional crop edges but, conversely, it is only sensitive to landscape intensification in organic fields, being clearly favoured in low-intensified landscapes.

The knowledge of the pollination system is a prerequisite of efficiently designing future breeding programmes. The cross pollination rate between and within plots was investigated in G{\"o}ttingen (Latitude: 51? 32' North and Longitude: 9? 57' East ) in 2004 and 2005. A plot of 10 m2 of non-spiny plants was surrounded by plots of spiny plants. Ten nonspiny plants each of the border rows and of the core were harvested individually. The rate of cross pollination was calculated as the ratio of spiny to non-spiny offsprings. The average cross pollination was 6.5\% (core), 9.7\% (border no.1) and 18.1\% (border no. 2). In a second experiment the rate of cross pollination within plots was estimated from non-spiny plants grown in mixture with spiny plants. The outcrossing rate was about 63\% in 2004, but about 30\% in 2005. Isolating or covering flowers by bags or cloth should be considered in pedigree breeding.}

Potential measures for improving the competitive positioning of smaller organic shops were identified. Although to date not many smaller organic shops have been driven from the market, experts and market players expect the structure of the market to change to the detriment of organic shops because organic supermarkets have better competitive advantages in many areas including communication policy, pricing policy, sales floor layout, etc.. However, small organic shops have still not yet totally exploited their full marketing potential, particularly with respect to the sales mix policy and communication policy. For small shops to compete on the market, they need to have a distinct profile, strengthen their function as a local supplier and systematically increase the already high level of customer satisfaction.}

Pasture N utilization is ineffective compared to silage cutting especially when high amounts of concentrates or protein supplementation is used. Transformations and immobilisation?mineralization turnover of N are high due to short term ley conditions. When the management changes almost yearly, the soil N is in constant state of change and equilibrium is never achieved. Nitrogen is accumulated in soil during grass cover years and mineralized during the renewal year. Thus, N fertilization for newly sown sward and cover crop after pasture renewal is not needed. In winter microbial activity in soil slows down, but still continues even in temperatures below zero. Freezing prevents most water movement in soil and nitrate therefore accumulates.}

In this study we developed a mobile organic piggery (MOP) without electric fencing that can be moved to a new grazing area each day. The aims were to distribute plant nutrients evenly, provide the pigs with continuous access to fresh herbage, and improve productivity and the working environment. Initially, 25 fattening piglets were installed in the MOP on a clover?grass ley. Nitrogen, P and K flows to and from the MOP were monitored during 87 days. The purchased feed included 80\% of the energy norm for pigs in indoor systems and the pigs were automatically fed. The MOP was moved 65 times. Behavioural studies including excretion behaviour were conducted during a two-week period. Net nutrient accumulation was 88 kg N, 31 kg P and 10 kg K ha-1 for the total grazing area (4212 m2). Average liveweight gain was 675 g day-1. Average feed conversion rate was 2.7 kg feed kg-1 liveweight gain. The pigs grazed, on average, almost half the day. With the MOP system it was possible to use a lower quality concentrate feed in terms of energy and protein supply in combination with regular access to fresh herbage. The MOP system also allowed a more even distribution of animal manure within the total grazing area, compared with permanent pens. Avoiding harmful point loads of nutrients decrease the risk of nutrient losses.}

        abstract = {Although a number of policies measures have been implemented since the 1990s with the aim to improve the competitiveness of the farming sector, Swiss farms still produce at much higher costs than their colleagues in neighbouring countries. For this reason, future liberalisation policies such as the WTO Doha Round are a major challenge for agriculture in Switzerland. Against this background, the potential impact of current WTO trade talks has been analysed on land use, livestock husbandry and the financial performance of organic and non-organic farms in Switzerland using the sector-based farm group model CH-FARMIS. 

According to the model results, land use and the number of farm animals change in line with projected commodity prices. Due to considerable cost disadvantages, agricultural liberalisation affects arable and pig production in particular. At the same time the amount of grassland as a proportion of total farmland is expected to increase. Furthermore, the model results suggest that organic farms would respond to a potential WTO trade agreement in a similar way than non-organic farms. However, changes in land use and livestock husbandry are expected to be somewhat more pronounced on non-organic farms than on organic farms. 

Due to falling commodity prices, it is expected that revenues from agricultural production will decrease and cause a significant reduction in agricultural incomes. It is anticipated that organic and non-organic farms are only partially able to compensate for lower commodity prices by lower production costs, higher direct payments or changes in farm management. In line with anticipated producer prices, the highest income losses are expected for farms located in the valley region with large arable or pig production. The lowest income losses are expected for grassland farms in the mountain region. In addition, the results indicate that, on average, organic farms are less severely affected by the WTO liberalisation than non-organic farms. Accordingly, the relative profitability of organic farms is likely to improve with increased liberalisation. In view of the prospect that organic farms are likely to be less severely affected financially by liberalisation policies, it can be assumed that the number of organic farms will increase.

-- Loss of control over supply chains due to dominant position of retailers and concentration in retailing \& processing
-- Increased production ? processing standards
-- Growing differentiation of rural areas, evolving urbanrural relations, and changes in EU rural policy frameworks new opportunities
-- New markets for distinctive food qualities, services \& public goods
- Collective organic farmers? marketing initiatives apply a diversity of strategies ? sometimes in combination ? that are crucial to understand their functioning and (potential) impacts}

In situ green manuring, especially with legumes, had the most beneficial impact on soil properties, while with ex situ methods, the use of leaves alone improved soil properties. Yields were increased to a greater extent by green manuring in the minor season, and the in situ system proved to be more beneficial.

        abstract = {Crop production is a conversion process of sun energy into biomass. Consequently, both the cultivation area and the insolation stroking this area limit the agroenergy output of the globe. Cultivation measures support the photosynthetic conversion process. Although organic cultivation measures require less energy than mainstream agriculture, the overall efficiency remains below 1\%. Nevertheless, agroenergy production is captivating with many win-win situations: environmentally neutral bio-fuels replace polluting fossil fuels, farmers get better prices for energy crops, and turnover of power industry grows due to increasing energy consumption to process biomass into fuel. As a following, the state tax income improves too. However, better prices for energy crops may trigger export of environmental pollution because higher conversion efficiency in tropical countries favours the intensification of energy crop production at the expense of food production. The overall efficiency of fuel from energy crops will never be competitive with solar techniques. E.g. solar collectors replace fossil fuels for heat production much more efficiently. Yet, high process efficiencies of technical processes to convert biomass into fuel justify the production of fuel from organic waste and residues. Thus, organic farming should not focus on energy crop production but produce high quality food environment-friendly. As a measure for sustainability of fuel production from biomass, the energy surplus of energy conversion from insolation to fuel per resident and square meter is proposed.}

Interesting features of the plant are amongst others the recycling of a second-hand smokestack as reactor material, the inclined first reactor for mixing the solid manure by gravity force, the bottomless drawer technique for discharging, the fixed film technique for rapid methane generation, and a manure compost produced with low nitrogen losses. The recently developed technology is in the process of testing and refinement.

The local association of farms, horticulture enterprises, food processing units, food stores, and consumers in J{\"a}rna aims to recycle organic waste. The goal is reduced use of non-renewable energy and use of the best-known ecological techniques in each part of the system, to reduce consumption of limited resources and minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere, soil, and water. The biogas plant served as reference plant for nutrient recycling solutions within the BERAS-project of "The Baltic Sea Region INTERREG III B Neighbourhood Programme 2000-2006" of the European Union. Presently the biogas plant digests dairy cattle manure, organic residues, and food remains originating from the farm and the surrounding food processing units.

We studied the soil mineral nitrogen contents of one cash crop and two livestock farms, specialised in dairy cows and goats?oilseeds resp., with the hypothesis that the livestock farms show a more even course of Nmin in the rotation and a higher rotation mean. The rotation average of Nmin in the cash crop farm was not lower than the ones in the livestock farms. But in the course of the rotations differences became evident: compared to the livestock farms the cash crop farm showed higher Nmin-values after the first rotation year (mulched vs. cut grass clover) but lower values in the fourth and fifth year of the rotation. As a precise nitrogen supply via manure as in the livestock farms is impossible in a self-sustaining cash crop farm, the excess of nitrogen at the beginning and the lack of it towards the end of the rotation could not be balanced. A way to improve this might be the use of green manure crops for biogas production and the application of the residues as manure. But as no full rotation period has yet passed, a longer study period is necessary to confirm the results. }

the appropriate pheromone, which acts on the pheromone receptive sensors on the male
so that they cannot locate calling females. Standard mating disruption techniques usually
rely on the introduction of amounts of pheromone emitted by natural populations of pest
species into the atmosphere. Exosex CM significantly reduces deployment time and labour
costs in the orchards, additionally the flexibility to fit in with IPM programmes was tested.
The assessments were done visually on windfall fruits, fruits on the tree and on all fruits at
harvest followed by statistical evaluation. Among the fruits sprayed with the IPM system
there was an infestation rate of the first (Cydia pomonella) generation at the variety Idared
of 0,8\%, the second generation treated with Exosex showed an infestation of 13\%. In the
biological trial however the infestation by the first generation was about 4\% and the
infestation of the second generation about 31\%.}

These were based on the analysis of national Organic Action Plans as well as stakeholder and expert consultation. The analysis showed that several EU member states have emphasised the need to balance supply-push policies with more market-focused demand-pull policies. An integrated approach is required and this has been to differing degrees through the formulation of multi-functional Organic Action Plans (OAPs), which also adress the dual roles of organic farming (from a policy perspective) to provide public goods and satisfy consumer demand. Eight Organic Action Plans, reviewed in the ORGAP project, vary with regard to the elaboration process, targets, objectives and the emphasis of measures on certain areas (e.g. market versus environment orientation). This variation is due to quite different political and socio-economic framework conditions for organic farming in these countries. It revealed that the weaknesses identified in the status quo analysis of the organic sector have only partly been translated to the targets and measures included in the action plan documents. Definition of the priorities for development of organic agriculture must be agreed by all relevant stakeholders. The priorities, and hence the programmes, will depend on correct analysis of the issues (and conflicts) that need to be addressed and clear objectives with measurable outcomes (for effective evaluation).

In order to communicate the results of this project as widely as possible, a practical manual for initiating and evaluating Organic Action Plans has been produced.

This manual has been created to inspire the people, organisations and institutions involved, or with an interest, in the organic food and farming sector to engage in the initiation, review, revision and renewal of regional, national and European Organic Action Plans.

The objectives of the manual are to provide:
? a tool for stakeholder involvement in future Action Plan development and implementation processes at EU, national and regional level
? a guide to the use of the Organic Action Plan Evaluation Toolbox (ORGAPET) developed through the project

The manual summarises the key lessons learnt from more than 10 years experience of development, implementation and evaluation of Organic Action Plans throughout Europe.
The Organic Action Plan Evaluation Toolbox (ORGAPET), which includes comprehensive
information to support the Organic Action Plan development and evaluation process is included with the manual as a CD-ROM, and is also accessible on-line at www.orgap.org?orgapet.
The ORGAP website www.orgap.org provides a further information on the project
and the European and national organic action plans.

La Commission europ{\'e}enne a publi{\'e} en juin 2004 le Plan d?action europ{\'e}en pour l?alimentation et l?agriculture biologiques. Avec ce plan, la Commission visait {\`a} {\'e}valuer la situation de l?agriculture biologique et {\`a} fonder les bases de d{\'e}veloppement de sa politique future. Au niveau national, de nombreux gouvernements ont {\'e}galement d{\'e}velopp{\'e} des plans d?action pour promouvoir l?agriculture biologique. Il est donc apparu n{\'e}cessaire de consid{\'e}rer comment de tels plans d?action pouvaient {\^e}tre {\'e}valu{\'e}s avec succ{\`e}s. 

Le plan d?action europ{\'e}en a {\'e}t{\'e} la motivation principale pour la DG Recherche de la Commission europ{\'e}enne de financer un projet de soutien sp{\'e}cifique, l?ORGAP, Projet No. CT-2005-006591 au sein du 6{\`e}me programme-cadre de recherche. Ce projet, intitul{\'e} ?Plan d?action europ{\'e}en pour l?alimentation et l?agriculture biologiques ? d{\'e}veloppement de crit{\`e}res et de proc{\'e}dures d?{\'e}valuation du Plan d?action UE pour l?agriculture biologique?, a d{\'e}but{\'e} en mai 2005 et s?est termin{\'e} en avril 2008.  

Des outils ont {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e}s au sein du projet pour {\'e}valuer et surveiller la mise en {\oe}uvre du Plan d?action europ{\'e}en dans les domaines suivants : information, formation et p{\'e}dagogie, recherche, production, traitement, d{\'e}veloppement du march{\'e}, certification et d{\'e}penses publiques. Ces outils ont {\'e}t{\'e} test{\'e}s sur un {\'e}chantillon de Plans d?action nationaux existants, et pour partie aussi sur le Plan d?action europ{\'e}en, en pla{\cc}ant principalement l?accent sur les processus de mise en {\oe}uvre. En outre, des recommandations politiques de la Commission europ{\'e}enne, des autorit{\'e}s nationales et autres acteurs ont {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}mises.

Afin de communiquer les recommandations relatives {\`a} ce projet aussi largement que possible, ce manuel pratique d?initiation et d?{\'e}valuation des plans d?action a {\'e}t{\'e} cr{\'e}{\'e}. La fonction de ce manuel est double :
a)	Outil de participation des acteurs dans le d{\'e}veloppement de futurs plans et mise en {\oe}uvre au niveau UE, national et r{\'e}gional ; 
b)	Guide d?utilisation d?ORGAPET, des outils d?{\'e}valuation du projet ORGAP (fourni sur CD-ROM avec le manuel et disponible en ligne sur le site www.orgap.org).

Le manuel, cr{\'e}{\'e} dans le cadre du projet ORGAP, est largement bas{\'e} sur les documents inclus dans l?Organic Action Plan {\'E}valuation Toolbox (Outils d?{\'e}valuation du plan d?action biologique) (ORGAPET).

Many differences have specific justifications, influenced by specific national or regional circumstances or policy framework. The variations between the EU Regulation, governmental and private-sector standards do not concern basic requirements; i.e. there is a general agreement on the main general principles of organic agriculture within the EU. A certain regional flexibility can be justified. }

This project started in May 2005 and was completed in April 2008. The overall objective of this project was to give scientific support to the implementation of the EU Organic Action Plan (EUOAP) by the development of an evaluation toolbox. In the project 10 partners from 9 countries (CH, UK, DE, IT, DK, SI, CZ, NL, ES) participated, as well as the European umbrella organisation of the Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM EU Regional group), ensuring a broad stakeholder consultation process and dissemination all over Europe.
Chapter 1 describes the background and the objectives, structure and the outcome of the ORGAP Project. It shows that since the late 1980s, organic farming development in the European Union (EU) has been stimulated mainly by two factors, one related to strong consumer demand, supported by the EU regulation defining organic food, and the other to policy support for the provision of public goods. Responding to concerns that area payments as ?supply-push? measures can impact negatively on the markets for organic products, policy-makers have started to take a more integrated approach to policy using the ?action plan? mechanism.
Action plans can be found in most EU member states. At national level, action plans provide a mechanism to ensure a balanced policy mix, reflecting different aims and the various supply-push and demand-pull policy instruments available, tailored to local conditions.
In 2004 the European Commission launched the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. The plan contained 21 action points, which relate to the following areas:
? Consumer information and promotion campaigns;
? Improved research, market intelligence and statistical data collection;
? Full utilisation of the rural development programme and other existing options to support organic farming;
? Improving the transparency, scope and implementation of the regulation defining organic farming
In the meantime, the European Commission has started to implemented most of the actions.
In chapter 2 a brief history about organic action plan development is given, in particular about the European as well as national organic action plan for organic food and farming.
The European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming (EC 2004) is the result of a three-year process of developing the Action Plan, starting in 2001. This process led to: a Commission staff paper exploring the options for an action plan in 2001; the establishment of an independent expert working group in 2002, a public internet consultation on specific options in February 2003; a European Parliament hearing on the action plan options in June 2003; and a public hearing on the action plan options in January 2004. In June 2004 the action plan was decided by the EU Council in June 2004, following significant internal debate within the Commission and the EU Parliament.
The involvement of stakeholders in the development of the EUOAP was mainly in the explorative phases involving identification of organic sector development needs and possible solution 
phase. The actual action plan was prepared after the public hearing in January 2004, so that stakeholders were not able to comment on the action plan document or the balance of individual actual action points.
During the subsequent implementation phase, primary responsibility also rests with the EU Commission, with input from the EU Council, EU Parliament and member-state government representatives, with only limited input from other stakeholder groups.
The European Commission has started to implement the actions of the European Organic Action Plan, many of which have been achieved or are at an advanced stage of completion. The most significant initiatives are the publication of the new Council regulation (EC) 834?2004 on organic production and labelling of organic products and the consumer information campaign.
The development of national organic action plans started in Europe in 1995 when Denmark introduced its first organic action plan. Denmark thus acted as a forerunner and pioneer in this field. Nowadays, most EU Member States have organic action plans for organic food and farming. Of those that don?t, some have plans in preparation.
Under the framework of the ORGAP Project, six national (CZ, DK, DE, IT, NL, SI) and two regional (Andalucia (AND), England (ENG) action plans for organic food and farming were com-pared. As a consequence of the very different situation in the eight case-study countries, the action plans studied vary in their scope. The English and the Dutch action plans represent market-driven and demand-led approaches with a clear focus on market development measures. The German Federal Organic Farming Scheme on the other hand puts a distinct emphasis on informational policy instruments to strengthen the organic sector through consumer information as well as through research and development. Finally, the Andalusian, Czech, Danish, Italian and the Slovenian action plans represent quite broad approaches integrating a broad portfolio of measures targeted to supply and market development as well as to information and research.
Apart from the Andalusian Action Plan, all other action plans studied include quantitative tar-gets. Most typically targets for organic adoption are set (CZ, DK, NL, SI and DE). However, the Dutch and Slovenian action plans include a combination of targets addressing the share of nationally produced organic products, the domestic organic market share in general, organic sales per capita and the development of tourist farms. The English action plan target was defined in terms of the proportion of the organic market for indigenous products supplied by domestic producers.
To conclude, the case study action plans vary with regard to the development process, targets, objectives and the emphasis of measures on certain areas. This is due to quite different political and socio-economic framework conditions for organic farming in these countries. The comparison revealed that the weaknesses identified in the status quo analyses have only partly been translated to the targets and measures included in the action plan documents. This is on the one side a result of the national priority and budget setting and on the other side on the interdependency between EU policies and national policies. However, as all action plans were developed together with stakeholders, the composition of the stakeholder groups and the power of the initiating actor are crucial to the target and priority setting.
In chapter 3 the authors write about organic action plans ? what we know and do not know. This includes success factors, stakeholder involvement, coherence and consistency issues and the how to evaluate organic action plans with ORGAPET.
What makes a successful action plan? This question is much more difficult to answer than it looks at first sight. Many other economic, social and policy developments influence the organic sector and often instances occur which have not been foreseen when a certain action plan was devised. Because of this a simple measurement of the state of a specific objective might be too simplistic. Under certain circumstances an organic action plan could already be regarded as a success if the measures contribute substantially to a development in the right direction. The point of reference would be here: What would have happened if the organic action plan would have not been in place?
The second point to keep in mind in judging the success of an organic action plan is to be aware of the fact that such action plans are often not complete in a sense that they fully include all political measures directly relevant for organic farming. In such cases it is important to keep in mind and to analyse the broader policy and market environment relevant to organic farming in order to judge success of the action plan.
Organic farming policies can of course only be successful if they are successfully implemented and need sufficient care and knowledge with respect to the often numerously legal conditions outside the specific organic farming area that influence implementation. It also means that a clear mission of implementation agencies and qualified and motivated personal involved are a key to successful organic policies and to successful organic action plans.
Is the concept of an organic action plan an outdate concept? Some policy makers believe that it has been a fashion and its time is over. The authors of this report are convinced that any at-tempt to unify elements that influence organic farming and organic farming policies and to bring policies into an integrated, coherent framework will still be necessary and welcome in the future. Whether such attempts in the future will be called organic action plans is a different issue.
Currently some key challenges include the question whether the general trend in agricultural prices has actually been reversed. If agricultural prices which tended to decrease in real terms throughout the 20th century are actually moving upwards due to factors such as increased demand for agricultural products, climate change and a possible slowdown of technological progress. Such general developments will also influence the development of organic farming and the development of suitable measures to support it. Some of the implications of a higher price level for conventional agriculture and a higher volatility of prices both in the conventional and organic markets might challenge the continuation of the traditional per hectare organic support policies. If climate change is actually perceived as the key challenge for decades to come then effects with respect to mitigate climate change of organic farming and with respect to the adaptive capacity of organic farming are quite important for any policy justification in support of organic farming. And finally, there is the productivity issue. If the actually demand for food stuff is increasing rapidly throughout the world then the obvious limitations of organic farming in this respect reported from industrial countries become more serious. In that context research and development supporting increasing productivity in organic farming might become much more important than in the past.
It is clear that just looking at the originally envisaged targets and objectives might not be sufficient to judge whether or not an action plan has been successful. One key argument going be-yond clear targets and well balanced measures is that embedding action plan development in the wider policy area seems to be absolutely essential to be successful. However, there are a number of other issues to be dealt with which are also quite important prerequisites for successful organic action plans such as stakeholder involvement, coherence and consistency of action plans and an evaluation monitoring capacity.
Stakeholder involvement may be understood and carried out in quite different ways including the provision of information, providing opportunities to comment on proposals, and empowering stakeholders to make their own choices.
When preparing the toolbox aimed for evaluating the European Organic Action Plan in the OR-GAP project, attempts were made to involve both organic and mixed stakeholders in various steps in eight different national?regional settings and with different methods. These experiences form the background for recommending stakeholders with a purely organic and?or mixed portfolio to involve through group discussions in order to increase and optimize their analytical capacities and thereby their delivery of relevant information regarding the preconditions for implementing the EUOAP and for assessing its policy impacts. Parallel to this, relevant non-organic stake-holders could be involved on the basis of individual interviews or small group interviews.
When deciding on which stakeholders to involve in any stage it is thus necessary to identify all stakeholders considered relevant to the issue and to clarify for each of them which perspective they represent in first priority. Therefore a general model for analysing stakeholder involvement in public policy on organic food and farming has been developed in the project. It includes a distinction of expertise involved in the three main perspectives of organic action plans realised in Europe up to now: the specific values defining organic food and farming; the market perspective as organic food in most plans is expected to develop in response to consumer demand; and a political recognition of the public goods delivered as a consequence of performing organic farming practices. With regard to each of these three perspectives, it is possible to specify expertise of stakeholders acting in the core or periphery of the perspective and to distinguish expertise of purely organic stakeholders and other stakeholders with a mixed or even non-organic expertise relevant for the development of policies in support of organic food and farming.
The degree to which participatory methods realise their potential contribution depends critically on how carefully they are used and in what context. There is no one set of techniques to be mechanically applied in all contexts for all participants, but a diverse range of possible techniques which need to be flexibly adapted to particular situations and needs.
Stakeholder involvement helps improving the information basis and the legitimacy of public policies. This is especially important on complex issues such as organic action plans, which involves actors with stakes in issues as different as the values of organic food and farming, the food market and the public goods of organic food and farming at one and the same time.
Successful stakeholder involvement thus demands: careful preparations of which stakeholders to include at any stage of the policy process and of the methods used to promote participation; sufficient time for the stakeholder to react; this means at least 8-12 weeks of time for allowing substantial and broad participation, in particular in the case of involvement of farmers organisations, and good communication and transparency in each of the five stages of the policy process. Although this results in higher costs and more resources for those administrating the process, the outcome of such a process will improve the legitimacy and acceptability of the decisions and will facilitate very much the implementation (e.g. through public private partnerships). Such a more participative, transparent and time-balanced process helps to avoid unnecessary discussions and misunderstandings, which at the end might be more effective and cost-efficient. Project Synthesis 
For an evaluation of the internal and external coherence of the EU Organic Action Plan (OAP), the ORGAP project team generally made use of empirical methods and techniques suggested for analysing the synergy of programmes as well as their cross-impacts.
A policy analysis of key synergies (positive and negative) was performed by means of a matrix of cross impacts as specified in the MEANS framework (EC, 1999). Two separate matrices were constructed: to appraise the internal coherence between the various measures of the EU Organic Action Plan; and to appraise the external coherence between the EUOAP and some national organic action plans. Experts involved in this evaluation process (Evaluation team) identified any synergy which may exist between pairs of measures or categories of measures. The effects of synergies or conflicts have been rated with the help of 2 electronic consultation rounds. After validation of these ratings, the calculation of the ?synthetic? coefficient of synergy was performed, in order to evaluate the overall level of synergy?conflict within the European Organic Action Plan. The analysis suggests that Actions 9 (ensure integrity) and 10 (harmonisation of standards) are essential for the success of the EUOAP, given their synergetic effects. They in addition enter into synergy with many other actions. Interesting is also Action 13 (risked based-inspections) with}

It is important to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and decrease green house gas emission in organic agriculture (OA). Both biogas and bioethanol can be produced in OA and significantly contribute to the sustainability of organic farms. The presented study is part of the BioConcens project (http:??www.bioconcens.elr.dk?uk?). This study is focused on characterization of relevant feedstock for co-production of biogas and bioethanol within organic farming.
Clover grass silage, dry clover grass and dried grass from meadows were selected. Biogas potential batch tests were performed for each substrate individually. The strong acid hydrolysis was performed to determine the total content of sugars in lignocellulosic biomass. The three main sugars (glucan, xylan and arabinan) were measured by HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) and finally theoretical ethanol yield was calculated based on the total glucose content.
The most important was the polymer of glucose ? glucan. In typical yeast based ethanol fermentation only glucose is converted into ethanol. The theoretical ethanol yield was calculated and it was found to be 14.9 and 13.4 ?g?100TS? for dry and silage clover grass, respectively. The lower ethanol yield is due to that the sugars are converted to lactic acid during ensilaging. The rest of the sugars remaining from the yeast based ethanol production will be present in the process effluent and can be either used as an animal feed or further fermented to methane through anaerobic digestion process.
The biogas potential for the dry grass, dry clover grass and clover grass silage was 304 {$\pm$} 21, 269 {$\pm$} 14 and 352 {$\pm$} 5 mLCH4?gVS, respectively. Clover grass silage seems to be the most promising feedstock from the presented ones. Energy crop in form of silage might be more effective for the biogas production than dry lignocellulosic material, due to easier access for microorganisms to the valuable biodegradable organic compounds.
It is expected that the on-farm production of the bioenergy would improve not only sustainability of such a farm but as well economics. Further investigations will be carried out.

- Die Anspr{\"u}che an die Sorten sind im {\"O}kolandbau h{\"o}her als in der konventionellen Landwirtschaft:
-- Die Sorten m{\"u}ssen eine exzellente Keimf{\"a}higkeit und Triebkraft besitzen, da nicht gebeizt wird
-- Da auch kein Mesurol als Repellents eingesetzt werden kann, m{\"u}ssen die Sorten mit einer deutlich tieferen Saatgutablage zurechtkommen
-- Die Sorten m{\"u}ssen eine viel bessere Konkurrenzkraft gegen{\"u}ber dem Unkraut aufweisen, da keine Herbizide eingesetzt werden
-- Sie m{\"u}ssen auch (tempor{\"a}ren) Stickstoffstress abpuffern k{\"o}nnen, da der Stickstoff erst sp{\"a}t zur Verf{\"u}gung steht, weil keine, schnell wirksamen mineralischen D{\"u}nger eingesetzt werden d{\"u}rfen

Zusammenfassung 2
- Aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Anspr{\"u}che an die Sorten ist die Rangierung der Sorten in der Ertragsleistung im {\"O}kolandbau eine andere als auf konventionell bewirtschafteten Fl{\"a}chen
- Dies macht eine Sortenpr{\"u}fung unter {\"O}kobedingungen erforderlich
- Verf{\"u}gt ein {\"O}koz{\"u}chter auch {\"u}ber ein umfangreiches konventionelles Zuchtprogramm, dann ist es sinnvoll, dies f{\"u}r die {\"O}koz{\"u}chtung mit zu nutzen
- Aufgrund der schwachen Konkurrenzf{\"a}higkeit von Inzuchtlinien gegen{\"u}ber dem Unkraut ist eine Linienentwicklung auf {\"O}kofl{\"a}chen nur schwer m{\"o}glich
- Deshalb bietet es sich an, die Linienselektion konventionell durchzuf{\"u}hren und die {\"O}kopr{\"u}fungen erst auf dem Hybridniveau beginnen zu lassen

Zusammenfassung 3 
- Es ist sicher ideal, wenn bereits w{\"a}hrend des Tests auf Allgemeine Kombinationsf{\"a}higkeit (GCA-Test) {\"O}kostandorte in das Pr{\"u}fnetz integriert werden, weil zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch auf ann{\"a}hernd die volle GCA-Varianz zugegriffen werden kann
- Dies setzt allerdings voraus, dass die {\"O}kopr{\"u}fungen risikolos und mit gro{\ss}er Perfektion durchgef{\"u}hrt werden k{\"o}nnen
- KWS 5133 ECO ist in dieser Testphase entdeckt worden
- Wenn in einem Zuchtprogramm jedoch noch zu wenig Erfahrungen in der Durchf{\"u}hrung von {\"O}kopr{\"u}fungen vorliegen, ist es sinnvoller, die {\"O}kopr{\"u}fungen ein oder zwei Jahre sp{\"a}ter einsetzen zu lassen, um Ausf{\"a}lle von Pr{\"u}forten vorzubeugen

fluorescens Bk3 to the phyllosphere of M. domestica cv. Holsteiner Cox we observed
dramatic changes in the protein composition of the apoplast of the host plant. Sequencing
of the induced proteins by ESI-Q-ToF mass spectrometry and homology search identified
these additional proteins as pathogenesis related proteins (PR) like {\ss}-1,3- glucanase,
thaumatin-like protein, chitinase and hevein-like protein. To confirm these findings, a
suppressive subtractive hybridization with total RNA from leaves before and after
inoculation of P. fluorescens Bk3 to the leaves of the host plant was performed. It revealed
an increased expression level of many PR and stress related genes.
The induction of PR proteins and plant defence genes in host plants after application of
non-pathogenic bacterial antagonists to the plant phylloshere can presumably prevent or
reduce successful infections by plant pathogens.}

Including energy use for fertility building and reducing yields in proportion to the fertility area brings CO2-emissions per unit yield level with conventional. It is concluded that in order to improve their ecological footprint organic farming needs to improve yield levels and make better use of the fertility area by using it as biogas for energy production, growing main crop legumes or using only short-term fertility building.}

Modelling results show that the annual leaching in different horticultural rotations and UK regions, using median weather, is within the range of 13-88 kg N?ha?year for organic and 54-130 kg N ?ha?year for conventional. The weighted annual average figures are 39 kg N?ha?year for organic and 81 kg N?ha?year for conventional, respectively. It is concluded that organic horticultural rotations, with a current share of 6.1\% already contribute to lower overall N losses from agriculture. However, on a UK national scale, only a large share of organic land use (e.g. {\ensuremath{>}}50\%) has a large effect on reducing N losses. Similar reductions are also predicted by substantial cuts in conventional N inputs, giving a policy choice if pollution from agriculture steps up further on the political agenda.}

The paddocks of the rotational pasture were split in a way that the low stocking rate group (SRL) had 15\% more pasture area than the high stocking rate group (SRH). Post grazing sward height for SRH, was decisive for the simultaneous change of the sub-paddocks. Annual stocking rates for SRH were 2.0, 2.3 and 2.3 cows per hectare (ha). In the offered herbage mass for SRL significant lower ash-, CP-, APDE- and APDN values as well as higher NDF values were detected. Sugar- and NEL values were unaffected. No significant differences were found for milk production per cow, but milk production per ha was significantly higher for SRH. Apart from two exceptions (lactose 2005 and urea 2006), no significant differences were identified for milk composition. The attribution of more pasture area without topping leads to a lower pasture quality. Increasing the stocking rate, within limits, slightly reduces the milk yield per cow, but clearly improves the utilization of grown herbage.}

We compared treatments of raised (ridged) seed beds, dairy and vermicompost troughs, transplanting, and a biocontrol soil drench. Of the methods tested, transplanting provided the most reliable and best crop stands for both seasons (p=0.05) Since this method relies on the biological resistance the plants develop naturally with age, this method could prove applicable across many climates and other crops which are threatened by root rot.}

even vital plants from 8 fields and classified by PCR-fingerprints. For strawberries, the
genotypes can be classified as apathogenic, weakly and highly pathogenic according to
the results of climate chamber experiments on strawberry transplants.
At landscape scale, similarity analysis of the PCR fingerprints of 432 genotypes resulted in
13 genetic subtypes. Several of these subtypes occurred at all fields, whereas 1 subtype
was found in one location only. At field scale, 2 to 11 different subtypes per field were
observed. Vital plants were colonised by up to 9 subtypes, wilted plants by up to 11
subtypes. Population structure of Verticillium subtypes is different between vital and wilted
plants, the same subtypes can occur in either plant group. In our plot experiments, wilt
symptoms could be reduced by changing the Verticillium population structure in the plant.
Inoculation of plants with a mixture of three Verticillium genotypes sustained plant vitality

In 8 out of the 10 experiments there was a significant positive correlation between the amino-N input and soil total N content. This correlation was much stronger than the one of total N input and soil N content, indicating that amino-N was more important for soil N accumulation than total N input.

It can be concluded that organic stockless farming without ley affects cash crop yields and demands special attention with regard to a sustainable humus management. Stockless farming with rotational ley on the other hand up to now showed a satisfactory performance when compared to a mixed farm type with livestock. As for the yields, reduced tillage systems could cope with the regularly ploughed reference system if at least a shallow turning of the soil was carried out. An increase of humus contents was not induced by reduced tillage systems. }

Vielmehr muss es eine wissenschaftlich fundierte Weiterentwicklung der Produktionsverfahren mit der Praxis - frei von einengenden Dogmen - geben. Die ?100 \% Bio-Perspektive? erfordert die ausschlie{\ss}liche Orientierung an {\"o}kologischen Entwicklungen auf der Welt. Auch wenn das Konzept {\"O}kolandbau nur langsam Verbreitung findet, so kann nur diese Leitbildorientierung dazu beitragen, dass die globale Lebensmittelerzeugung perspektivisch die Bed{\"u}rfnisse aller Menschen erf{\"u}llt, ohne die nat{\"u}rlichen Grundlagen zu zerst{\"o}ren.
Demgegen{\"u}ber zeigt sich im Biohandel ein anderer Trend: Viele Produkte auf der letzten Biofach ? der wichtigsten Messe f{\"u}r den Lifestyle Bio ? wurden von der taz als ?Bioquatsch? tituliert (21. Februar 2008, S. 13). Es l{\"a}sst sich der Eindruck eines elit{\"a}ren First-world-Bio-Lebensmittelmarktes nicht leugnen. Auf der letzten wichtigsten Veranstaltung der weltweiten {\"O}kolandbau- Bewegung ? der IFOAM-World Conference 2008 im Juni in Modena (Italien) ? wurde ein Essen ohne Stil geboten. Ein Unterschied zu konventioneller ?Fast-Food-Ern{\"a}hrung? war nicht mehr zu erkennen.

        abstract = {Organic farming growth is to a considerable extent fostered by state intervention, in particular in Europe. As an example of successful state involvement in ?green? infant industries, it forms a new research field for policy analysts interested in studying the relationship between public policy and industrial development. 
Denmark was the first country to form a distinct law on organic farming in 1987. The Danish organic sector has been regulated ever since. The major role of the Danish organic farming policy, in particular conversion subsidies, is to enable market creation which require that there are both suppliers of organic products and consumers of organic products. In that connection the Danish state granted financial support for initiatives related to the development of the organic market, in addition to conversion and production subsidies scheme. In spite of the high growth in the Danish organic market the literature is silent about the connection between the Danish organic policy and organic market growth. This dissertation takes the view that the connection between policy and growth can be made by investigating the process of implementation. 
While the Danish state has developed capacities to govern supply through administration of subsidies scheme, it is unlikely that it has maintained capacities for implementation of market development activities. On the other hand the organic groups had been involved in activities related to developing the organic market, and as such might posses such capacities. In light of that, this dissertation forms an explorative study on the role of the Danish organic interest groups in implementation of the organic farming policy in Denmark .  The aim of the dissertation is to contribute new knowledge about the role of the organic interest groups in developing the organic sector in Denmark. The second objective of this dissertation is to establish the basis for a future analysis that will examine whether the activities of interest groups can be linked to growth in organic market. 
Theoretically the dissertation seeks to contribute to the literature by creating a new analytical model for linking state-interest group relations to industrial and economic development. The Dissertation criticizes the existing literature, which seeks to explain industrial development through state-interest group relations, for focusing mainly on policy formulation processes and processes inside state sphere. On the contrary the dissertation seeks to construct a theoretical model for analyzing industrial development through examining state and interest group activities during the implementation of industrial?economic policy. 
This dissertation uses the Dutch Schools policy network approach to connect state and interest group activities to the development of the organic market. The dissertation shows that the implementation of the organic farming policy happens inside policy networks between the state and the organic interest groups. The state is responsible for financing market development activities. On the other hand the organic interest groups have built capacities for carrying out such activities, and are responsible for converting public resource to market development activities. 
The dissertations shows that an interest group can play a role in governing a specific market and by that can be a central factor in the development of a specific industrial sector. By using the Dutch Schools notion of network management, the dissertation shows that the organic interest groups used public financed activities to govern the organic market agent and their mutual relations. Furthermore the dissertation shows that the public financed market-managing activities performed by the organic interest groups, have occurred in synergy with other independent market-management activities that the organic interest groups have been performing. By that the dissertation shows that the activities performed by interest organizations outside the state arena pose an important variable, in analyzing the role played by interest organizations in the process of policy implementation.

Agriculture is among the five sectors which will have to substantially contribute to the stabiliza-tion of global greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10-15 years. This is one of the messages from the IPCC?s 4th Assessment Report to the Bali Conference and its roadmap adopted in De-cember 2007. Organic farming reduces embedded energy demand on the input side, stores more carbon in soils and creates a soil structure that retains water more effectively. Most proc-esses face strong site-specific variability so that cultivation practices are too complex to be certi-fied under the Kyoto Mechanism CDM. The voluntary carbon market as well as the increasing attention given to climate change adaptation offers opportunities for promoting best practices of organic farming in a carbon constrained world.

2. The future perspectives in trade with carbon offsets (CERs?VERs)
The Bali roadmap adopted in December 2007 and the recent plans by the European Commis-sion to cap greenhouse gas emissions through the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in the period 2013-2020 leave carbon markets and in particular the CDM with significant uncertainty on its post-Kyoto future, though there is confidence that there will be a CDM under the post-2012 climate change agreement to be adopted in Copenhagen. As the US, the largest buyer of voluntary carbon market offsets (VERs), is preparing for the in-troduction of cap and trade regimes, the increasing market prospects for VERs may change in the mid term. One key innovation of the Bali roadmap is the proposed scheme to halt deforesta-tion, which may or may not take the shape of trading with carbon certificates. There is signifi-cant uncertainty about the extent to which carbon trading could support the spread of organic agriculture on the output side (sale of certificates as co-products). Organic farming practices however will benefit from increasing prices of oil dependent inputs (fertilizer, agrochemicals), increasing commodity prices and scarce resources such as fertile land and water resources. 

3. Sustainable development: Energy for the poor from Gold Standard CDM projects committed to sustainable use of biomass
Energy poverty (costly fossil fuel, short supply of electricity if any) is increasingly constraining rural development and contributing to unsustainable urbanization. Increased supply of biomass energy from sustainable sources is eligible under the CDM and can boost organic agriculture, if projects are certified under the Gold Standard.

The obtained results showed that the farmers carried out production on a 3-4-year rotation basis. The cropping plan was strongly driven by market demands. Compromises with design and structure of the rotation were compensated with additional crop management or organic fertilizers.

The results showed that farmers under non-profit NGOs received the highest level of profit, followed by farmers under the private firm and finally the for-profit NGO.

Using an endogenous switching regression model to assess the profitability of organic contract farms and conventional farms in Lao PDR, it was found that organic farmers under contract earn significantly higher profit than conventional farms. The findings also showed that organic contract farming tends to provide the greatest increase in income to farmers with below average performance. These findings suggest that contract farming can be an effective mechanism to facilitate the development of organic agriculture and an effective tool to improve the profitability and raise incomes of small farmers, thereby reducing poverty in rural areas with limited market development.}

Above-ground interactions were determined by measuring air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar energy and shade length and behaviour. Groundnut and sesame were evaluated for growth and yield by laying out sample plots at southern, central and northern part of the alleys and at control plots. Due to microclimatic modifications in the alleys, the yield of both crops in the alleys significantly (p=0.01) exceeded that of the sole crop. Yield reduction at the northern alley was fully compensated by high yield increase at southern and central alleys. The yield of groundnut increased by 37.7 and 19.6 \% in the A.stenophylla and A.ampliceps alleys, respectively. On the other hand, the yield of sesame increased with the stenophylla-alley (?40.3\%), while it decreased with ampliceps-alley (-51.5\%).

        abstract = {Organic farming depends on the promotion of biodiversity and the corresponding functions. No tools are known for the obtention of farm-specific information explaining the influence of farm management on biodiversity. The paper describes an approach that allows estimating such effects. It has been applied in an experimental farm with an organic and a conventional farm section. The results distinguish between both sections. The investigations made so far allow concluding that multiple-structured low-input systems achieve better marks than specialized high-input systems. For further development and validation additional studies are required. It is planned to test the indicator model in numerous farms, in order to disclose bottlenecks and deficiencies.}

The experiment was set up as a randomized complete block design, a factorial 2 x 2, with four replications. Taro was cultivated in monoculture or intercropped with Crotalaria juncea under two irrigation frequencies: every 3.5 days for 30 minutes and every 15 days for 2 hours. The intercropping increased taro petiole length but did not increase leaf area. The same effects were observed for irrigation frequency on the leaf area and petiole, length at the 30th and 60th days after C. juncea cutting. The amount of taro yield and offshoot number of class 1 (category up to 40g) were affected negatively by the intercropping. However the total number, total yield and average weight of the offshoot were not affected by the intercropping. The irrigation frequency promoted positive effects in the number and weight of offshoot (category of 80g weight or higher), as well as in the total taro yield and average offshoot weight. The conclusion was that the short frequency irrigation contributed for the development and productivity of taro offshoots and the intercropping with C. juncea did not decreased  the total productivity of taro cropping.}

Simultaneously, reduced tillage practices have become popular due to energy saving and environmental concerns, as they may strengthen and improve the functioning of structured soil pore system. Soil aeration is affected by both compaction and reduced tillage through changes in soil structure and in the distribution of easily decomposable organic matter. We investigated whether a single wheeling by a 35 000 kg sugar-beet harvester in a Stagnic Luvisol derived from loess near G{\"o}ttingen, Germany, influenced the gas transport properties (air permeability, gaseous macro- and microdiffusivities, oxygen diffusion rate) in the topsoil and subsoil samples, and whether the effects were different between long-term reduced tillage and mouldboard ploughing. Poor structure in the topsoil resulted in slow macro- and microscale gas transport at moisture contents near field capacity. The macrodiffusivities in the topsoil under conventional tillage were slower compared with those under conservation treatment, and soil compaction reduced the diffusivities by about half at the soil depths studied. This shows that even one pass with heavy machinery near field capacity impairs soil structure deep into the profile, and supports the view that reduced tillage improves soil structure and aeration compared with ploughing, especially in the topsoil. }

More precisely, do consumers prefer local products because they want to support local producers or do environment and  the question of food miles matter in their choice ? Besides, very little is known about organic consumers in developing countries, since most surveys are conducted in most developed countries. Our purpose is to fill this double gap, by conducing qualitative surveys based on individual interviews in four developing countries (Brazil, Egypt, Uganda and China) and two European countries, France and Denmark,  in order to study consumers choice for organic products from supermarkets, farmers markets or local organic food network. Products were selected to cover examples of imported organic products that compete with comparable products of local origin. 
First results from Brazil and France show that French consumers are more concerned by environment than Brazilian consumers, but that  most consumers in both samples are not concerned by food miles and their subsequent environmental impacts. Results also shed light on different patterns related to commitment to supporting small or local farmers, and suggest implications for policy makers.

High yields obtained when green manure in rotation and high biol concentrations were used,  justifies its wide and common use, especially with small farmers, improving the spinach organic production efficiency even when an OP cultivar was used.  }

Only 14 percent of all cows did not have any damage, 34 percent had only hairless patches and 24 percent of the cows did have at least one swelling. Correlations of the mean farm score for the left and right hand side are high for the outer hock and low for the body.

Two years of inventories show greater native plant diversity in non-cropped areas. While nematode diversity did not differ between habitats, functional groups were clearly associated with particular habitats as were soil microbial communities (phospholipid fatty acid analysis). Earthworm diversity did not differ between habitats, but biomass was higher in non-cropped areas. Habitats with woody vegetation stored 20\% of the farmscape?s total carbon (C), despite their relatively small size (only 5\% of the total farm). Two years of monitoring data of farmscape C and nitrogen (N) through emissions, run-off and leaching showed distinct tradeoffs in function associated with each habitat.  Clearly habitat restoration in field margins will increase both landscape biodiversity and the multifunctionality of the farmscape as a whole. }

        abstract = {Seit Januar 2005 ist die als Erzeuger-fair Milch deklarierte Milch der Upl{\"a}nder Bauernmolkerei im regionalen Naturkostfachhandel erh{\"a}ltlich. Wer sie kauft, zahlt f{\"u}r die regionalen Bauern einen Mehrpreis von 5 Cent pro Liter. Die Verk{\"a}ufe haben sich seitdem deutlich erh{\"o}ht, und das Projekt hat eine hohe Verbraucherakzeptanz erfahren. Die Entwicklung des Absatzes ist in den einzelnen Gesch{\"a}ften des Naturkosteinzelhandels dabei unterschiedlich verlaufen, was mit verschiedenen Faktoren zusammenh{\"a}ngt wie der Ladengr{\"o}{\ss}e, Kundenstruktur, Lage des Gesch{\"a}fts, Pr{\"a}sentation des Projektes am K{\"u}hlregal und im Laden sowie Informationen zu dem Projekt.
Auch im klassischen LEH unterst{\"u}tzen die Verbraucher dieses Pilotprojekt in hohem Ma{\ss}e. In den {\"u}ber 6 Monaten Projektlaufzeit wurde in den Testm{\"a}rkten deutlich mehr Milch des Hamfelder Hofes verkauft als vor Einf{\"u}hrung des 5 Cent-Siegels. Auch wurden hiermit die Ergebnisse der Befragungen in der ersten Projektphase best{\"a}tigt, die ergeben hatten, dass die Umsetzung der Marketingstrategie mit einem Preisaufschlag von 5 Cent im LEH von mehr Kunden als im Naturkosthandel unterst{\"u}tzt werden w{\"u}rde.
Die Vermarktung von Erzeuger-fair Schmand im Naturkosthandel war insgesamt schwieriger umzusetzen als bei der Erzeuger-fair Milch. Es ist schwieriger den Verbrauchern die Problematik des niedrigen Milchpreises {\"u}ber das Produkt Schmand zu verdeutlichen. Bei Milch ist den Verbrauchern dagegen sofort klar, dass 5 Cent Preisaufschlag pro Liter Milch den Milchpreis direkt um 5 Cent erh{\"o}hen. Diese Problematik ergibt sich auch bei allen anderen Milchprodukten bzw. insgesamt betrachtet bei Verarbeitungsprodukten. Dennoch hat sich der Absatz insgesamt und im Zeitablauf betrachtet in der Projektphase insofern positiv entwickelt als dass sich der Absatz in den teilnehmenden Gesch{\"a}ften auf stabilem Niveau gehalten hat.
Die Hauptmotive der K{\"a}ufer der regionalen Erzeuger-fair Milch wurden im Rahmen einer nachtr{\"a}glichen Erhebung bei tats{\"a}chlichen K{\"a}ufern der Erzeuger-fair Milch am Point Of Sale (POS) in den Testm{\"a}rkten des Naturkosthandels und des Lebensmitteleinzelhandels erfasst. Als wichtigster Grund f{\"u}r den Kauf der regionalen Erzeuger-fair Milch wurde der Geschmack genannt, gefolgt von der l{\"a}ngeren Haltbarkeit bzw. der h{\"o}heren Frische der regionalen Erzeuger-fair Milch . Die eigentlichen spezi?schen Merkmale einer regionalen Milch, wie kurze Transportwege oder Erhalt der Landwirtschaft, wurden nur von sehr wenigen der befragten K{\"a}ufer als Hauptgrund f{\"u}r den Kauf der Erzeuger-fair Milch genannt. Noch weniger der befragten K{\"a}ufer gaben an, dass der Preis f{\"u}r Sie als ein Hauptmotiv f{\"u}r den Kauf der regionalen Erzeuger-fair Milch gilt, so dass die Preiserh{\"o}hung durch den Regionalaufschlag zur direkten Unterst{\"u}tzung der Landwirte somit f{\"u}r nahezu alle K{\"a}ufer der regionalen Erzeuger-fair Milch kein Problem darstellt.
Es zeigte sich zudem, dass die Begr{\"u}ndung f{\"u}r den Preisaufschlag sehr deutlich, eindeutig und klar kommuniziert werden sollte, um steigende Abverkaufszahlen zu realisieren. Begleitende Marketingma{\ss}nahmen f{\"u}r das Regionalprodukt auf dem Produkt, am POS und in den Medien sollten durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Ein elementarer Baustein in diesem Vermarktungskonzept ist die Logistik. Wichtig ist zudem eine fortlaufende Kontrolle des korrekten Transfers des Preisaufschlages vom Lebensmitteleinzelhandel an die Erzeuger (in diesem Fall die Milcherzeuger), um die Transparenz des Konzeptes zu erh{\"o}hen.
Die seit Sommer 2007 weiter entwickelte Marketingstrategie sieht f{\"u}r alle Produkte inkl. der verarbeiteten Produkte einen Fair-Preis ohne direkten Aufschlag vor. Die Entscheidung seitens der Upl{\"a}nder Bauernmolkerei sollte ein neues Verst{\"a}ndnis zwischen Konsumenten, Lebensmittelhandel, Molkereien und Bauern, ein solidarisches Handeln und Fairness, bringen.
Eine wesentliche Voraussetzung zur Umsetzung dieser Strategie stellt die Unterst{\"u}tzung des Lebensmittelhandels dar. Ohne eine Unterst{\"u}tzung des Handels w{\"a}re ein solcher Schritt nicht m{\"o}glich gewesen. Ebenso gelang es die Konsumenten ins Boot zu holen. F{\"u}r die K{\"a}ufer der Produkte war es eine logische Konsequenz, dass nicht nur f{\"u}r ausgew{\"a}hlte Produkte ein fairer Preis galt sondern f{\"u}r alle.
Die Initiative des Vereins ?Bestes Bio ? Fair f{\"u}r alle? zeigt, dass Fairness {\"u}ber faire Preise hinausgeht. Ein ?Fair-Siegel? f{\"u}r alle Produkte und Branchen wurde entwickelt. {\"U}ber die De?nition von ?Fairness?, Regionalit{\"a}t und der eigenen Grunds{\"a}tze werden Pr{\"u}fkriterien entwickelt, die sich mit folgenden Oberbegriffen zusammenfassen lassen: Faire Wirtschafts- und Handelsbeziehungen, Sozial- und Umweltengagement, Regionalit{\"a}t.
Erste zerti?zierte Produkte sind seit Sommer 2008 auf dem Markt.}

Urine additions immediately increased soil pH and MRPw, but no such response was observed in PAc extraction due to the low pH (4.65) of the extractant enhancing the resorption of P. The PAc responded to the dunginduced increase in soil total P similarly as did Pw, which suggests that both tests can serve to detect areas of high P concentration. However, water extraction was a more sensitive method for estimating short-term changes in P solubility. In pasture soils, the risk of P loss increases as a result of the interaction of urination and high P concentration in the topsoil resulting from continuous dung excretion. }

With few exceptions, there are no organic production standards relating specifically to the use of nanoparticles. The Soil Association excludes all uses of nanoparticles, and Austria Bio Garantie excludes nanoparticles from organic cosmetics. In a discussion at BioFach 2008, most participants felt that more information is needed in order to make a decision.
Nanotechnology is an up-and-coming technology with a wide array of potential future uses. It is not yet clear exactly how beneficial these uses might be for organic farming, nor are the exact risks to human health and the environment known at the moment. In this situation, the organic sector should take a precautionary position, but it seems unwise to close the door to all potential uses of nanoparticles at this stage.}

diseases and tree losses were observed. After four years the in vitro self rooted trees were
significantly more vigorous in growth than those grafted on quince A. The self rooted long
cuttings were comparable in growth with grafts on quince, but showed high tree losses
probably due to frost damages in the first winter one year after planting. However no
infections with Erwinia amylovora could be observed so far. In a field trial with more

significant effects are expected in the next years.}

serve as alternative to the highly susceptible cultivar ?Elsanta?, regarding soil-borne

In addition, following parameters were assessed on 2 organically managed sites in 2006
and 2007: marketable yield, percentage of different categories of unmarketable fruits and
incidence of the blossom weevil. In 2006 fruit characteristics and consumer acceptance
were studied.
?Elsanta? showed the highest infestation with V. dahliae whereas ?Salsa?, ?Daroyal? and
?Alice? were most tolerant. ?Dora?, ?Eva?, ?Queen Elisa? and ?Daroyal? recorded significantly
higher losses by the blossom weevil than ?Alice?. ?Alba? and ?Divine? were the earliest
cultivars in ripening time. Highest marketable yield per plant had the late ripening cultivars,
particularly ?Salsa? and ?Sonata?. Of all early ripening cultivars tested, ?Elsanta? showed the
highest productivity, followed by 'Alba', ?Darselect?, ?Daroyal? and ?Eva?. Regarding fruit
firmness, content of ascorbic acid, shelf life and appearance, ?Alba?, ?Clery?, ?Eva? and
?Queen Elisa? were most convincing. The best tasting cultivars were ?Clery?, ?Daroyal? and
?Divine?.
Summing up all the results, ?Alba?, ?Alice? and ?Salsa? can be recommended for organic
production, whereas ?Clery?, ?Daroyal?, ?Darselect?, ?Elsanta?, ?Eva?, ?Queen Elisa? and
?Sonata? are classified as suitable for only a limited extent. ?Elsanta?, ?Divine?, ?Dora? and
?Sonata? are particularly unsuitable for growing in Verticillium infested soils. ?Divine?, ?Dora?,

The research was conducted in 2005 and 2006. Average for 2 years grain yield of winter wheat for all cultivars amounted to 3.0 t?ha. In both years the largest yields were noted for modern winter wheat cultivars. Old cultivars of wheat reacted better on water deficiency than modern ones. The yield decrease for all cultivars was mainly affected by low level of resistance on fungal pathogens responsible for leaf diseases.

Cmic and Nmic, enzyme activities, bacterial community composition (PCR-DGGE) and total numbers of fungi and bacteria (soil dilution plating) were determined. Results suggested that organic farming practices did not have a clear positive effect on soil microbial biomass and activity; distinct differences in bacterial community composition were detected by PCR-DGGE but not by soil dilution plating. Findings indicate that practices commonly associated with conventional farming (application of mineral fertilisers or pesticides) have a less pronounced effect on the soil microbial community than other management techniques (e.g. manure application and crop rotation).}

Selenium is part of the antioxidant defence system in animals and humans. The available selenium concentration in soil is low in many regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic versus inorganic selenium supplementation on selenium status of ewes, their lambs, and slaughter lambs.

Methods
Ewes on four organic farms were allocated five or six to 18 pens. The ewes were given either 20 mg?kg inorganic selenium as sodium selenite or organic selenium as selenized nonviable yeast supplementation for the two last months of pregnancy. Stipulated selenium concentrations in the rations were below 0.40 mg?kg dry matter. In addition 20 male lambs were given supplements from November until they were slaughtered in March. Silage, hay, concentrates, and individual ewe blood samples were taken before and after the mineral supplementation period, and blood samples were taken from the newborn lambs. Blood samples from ewes and lambs in the same pens were pooled. Muscle samples were taken from slaughter lambs in March. Selenium concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with a hydride generator system. In the ANOVA model, selenium concentration was the continuous response variable, and selenium source and farm were the nominal effect variables. Two-sample t-test was used to compare selenium concentrations in muscle samples from the slaughtered lambs that received either organic or inorganic selenium supplements.

Results
In all ewe pens the whole blood selenium concentrations increased during the experimental period. In addition, ewe pens that received organic selenium had significantly higher whole blood selenium concentrations (mean 0.28 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?g) than ewe pens that received inorganic selenium (mean 0.24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?g). Most prominent, however, was the difference in their lambs; whole blood mean selenium concentration in lambs from mothers that received organic selenium (mean 0.27 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?g) was 30\% higher than in lambs from mothers that received inorganic selenium (mean 0.21 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g?g). Slaughter lambs that received organic selenium had 50\% higher meat selenium concentrations (mean 0.12 mg?kg wet weight) than lambs that received inorganic selenium (mean 0.08 mg?kg wet weight).

Conclusion
Organic selenium supplementation gave higher selenium concentration in ewe and newborn lamb blood and slaughter lamb meat than inorganic selenium supplementation.

The first of these was the Brodowin Nature Conservation Farm project. Conflicts between nature conservation and modern, large-scale OF, focusing on arable land use systems, were identified, evaluated and solved. Suggestions for adequate financial reward for ecological performance were worked out. The tested optimisation strategies were implemented in a second project: preparing a whole farm management plan based on maps marked with fields having a high potential for specific target species. The aim was to achieve the highest benefit for nature conservation issues with the least expenditure by the farm. A manual is being produced as a third project, with a series of examples for the integration of nature conservation measures, based on the results of our own projects and data sourced in literature, along with different experts. The manual will allow the user to see immediately either how target species?groups can be directly promoted or how measures can be se-lected, and what effects these have on the business.}

New research has reviled new properties of red clover that may affect animal performance and product quality significantly. Red clover containing diets have increased the production of milk and meat (compared with grasses) and the content of beneficial fatty acids in milk and meat (compared with grasses and other legumes), improved the efficiency of feed N utilization (compared with Medicago sativa L.), and increased the milk content of isoflavones (compared with grass and white clover). Red clover contains high levels of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase that might reduce the extent of lipolysis and proteolysis.

The cows were offered either RCS or WCS for 88 d (period 1) and thereafter a mixed red clover-white clover-grass silage for 48 d (period 2). Total dry matter intake and milk yield were not affected by forage type but increased with concentrate supplementation. Intake of isoflavones was several times greater in RCS than in WCS, whereas intake of lignans was
greater in WCS. Concentrate supplementation reduced the intake of most phytoestrogens. Compared with WCS, RCS diets yielded milk with a greater content of flavonoids, whereas milk from WCS diets had greater contents of the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone. The content of the isoflavan equol was particularly high in RCS diets. There was no apparent carryover effect of clover type on milk phytoestrogen content because there was no difference in content between the silage treatments 3 wk after the cows were transferred to the same silage diet (period 2). Concentrate supplementation reduced the milk contents of the flavonoids equol, biochanin A, and daidzein and increased
the content of mammalian lignans. The effects of silage type and concentrate supplementation on milk contents of the individual phytoestrogens were related to the intake of the compound or its precursor, except for the effect of concentrate on mammalian lignans, for which the intake of the known precursors was also reduced. Overall, this study shows that feeding cows with silage containing red clover increases the milk content of flavonoids at both low and high concentrate supplementation levels, and decreases the content of nonflavonoids such as mammalian lignans, when compared with silage containing white clover. The increased content of phytoestrogens in milk may be important when the health benefits of milk are studied. }

        abstract = {A common practice in stockless organic farming systems is to leave the biomass from clover?grass-ley and crop residues in the field for their residual fertility effect. No farmyard manures for transfer of nutrients within the system are available. Clover?grass-ley biomass and crop residues represents an unexploited energy potential that could be harnessed by the digestion in biogas plants for production of methane, thus replacing ruminants by the biogas digester. In field trials by implementing a whole crop rotation comprehending six crops were carried out in 2002-2005 to evaluate whether the use of N could be improved by processing biomass described above in a biogas digester and using the effluents as a fertilizer, compared to general practice.
Results indicate that digestion of crop residues resulted in more efficient manuring systems, not only by the implementation of an additional ?product? (power energy), but also by getting more efficient cropping systems with higher DM and N yields of most of the non-legume crops, combined with a reduction of N losses due to denitrification and a reduction of the nitrate leaching risk. The causes were a better and more evenly allocation of nutrients within the whole crop rotation, a higher N input via N2 fixation, lower N losses and probably a higher N availability of digested in comparison to the same amounts of nutrients in undigested organic manures.

In an ecological and agricultural context bio-diversity would ideally include the diversity of livestock breeds and crop species and varieties, their effect on wildlife habitats, and their role in supporting natural habitats and landscapes.  However this subject area is outside the scope of this review and although the presence of such diversity on organic farms will have impacted on the research findings studied, little specific research has been conducted.

The objective of this review is to provide information to advisors, based on peer reviewed research, to increase the scope and abundance of wildlife and bio-diversity on organic farms, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of the organic farming system ? practical and beneficial integration of wildlife, bio-diversity and organic farming.

By 2008 the majority of organic farms in the UK were relatively new to organic farming, having been encouraged to register as organic because of either beneficial market opportunities or agri environment programmes encouraging conversion.  Clearly a proportion of farmers have entered organic farming with a good understanding of the farming system but many are still operating relatively conventional systems organically without in depth understanding of the principles and foundations of organic farming.  The agri-environment schemes that encourage and support organic farming have been developed from schemes designed largely to encourage intensive chemical based farming to adopt some beneficial practices.   The organic schemes tend to adopt similar prescriptive practices rather than encourage a completely holistic approach and the result is that farmers often fulfil environmental prescriptions to gain points rather than understanding how habitat management can work in harmony with, and improve the farming system.

First steps to decrease AA focused on changes in the technological food production process. However, these possibilities are limited due to occurring taste anomalies and consumer tolerance. Therefore, it might be an alternative to influence the precursors of AA. Up to now, multiple studies considering the influence of fertilisation, species, and cultivars on the content of asparagine (Asn) and reducing sugars have been carried out. But there is still a lack of information about the influence of the production system on the AA level. It can be expected that the amount of AA is different and might be lower in organic production systems, because of the difference in nitrogen management (amount and type). The aim of this study was to check organically and conventionally grown wheat samples of different cultivars for the level of the precursor Asn and the AA-formation-potential. The samples were obtained from locations in Switzerland and Germany. Partial significant differences in the amount of Asn and in the AA-formation-potential suggested an influence of the production system and thus a further chance to intervene.}

In all case study countries, organic wine has a positive image regarding grape production and wine processing. Furthermore, organic wine is perceived as being healthier compared to conventional wine. However, regarding the sensorial quality, organic wine still faces image problems, although the taste image has improved. Consumers expect that organic wine is healthy, pure and naturally produced. A majority are sceptical of using sulphites and other additives and processing aids in organic wine processing. 
If organic wine processing is regulated on EU-level, consumers will expect that these rules governing organic wine fit with the image and expectations of organic wine being a ?natural? and healthy product, which obtains as much as possible the original attributes and quality.}

The Review will provide organic advisers with a better understanding of the differences between organic and conventional food quality so that they can support the development of organic farming systems and supply chains that deliver better quality organic food. The Review takes a broad definition of food quality and on the appropriate methods for determining food quality. However, the focus is on the factors that are more or less within the control of the farmer and the rest of the supply chain, and that directly impact on the appreciation or the intrinsic quality of the food as presented to, and eaten by the consumer. 

The specific issues addressed by the Review include:
?	Consumer perceptions of organic food qualities and the market for organic food
?	Organic supply chains and their impact on quality, in the broadest sense
?	Environmental quality of systems  ? although not an intrinsic quality (in the same way as, for example, the vitamin content of food), it is an important quality parameter for organic food
?	Food safety
?	Crop products ? production systems and quality 
?	Livestock products ? production systems and quality

Twenty three Defra funded research projects are reviewed and a total of 355 papers selected from the Orgprints archive (www.orgprints.org) using the search term ?organic food quality? have been scanned. Thirty one have been selected for review. Several additional sources have also been identified. In total, 75 sources have been reviewed.

Furthermore, a human intervention study was conducted to compare bioavailability, plasma antioxidant capacity, endogenous DNA strand breaks and immune parameters in healthy men ingesting carrots from different agricultural systems. Thirty-six volunteers consumed either organically or conventionally produced blanched carrots (200 g?d; 2 weeks) or no carrots in a double-blind, randomised intervention study. No statistically significant differences were observed in the total carotenoid contents (121 (sd 7) mug?g organic v. 116 (sd 13) mug?g conventional) and the antioxidant capacities (0.43 (sd 0.08) mumol Trolox equivalents?g organic v. 0.32 (sd 0.07) mumol Trolox equivalents?g conventional) of the carrots administered to the volunteers. Intake of organically or conventionally produced carrots significantly increased (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) plasma alpha- and beta-carotene concentrations in both intervention groups without differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations. Consumption of carrots did not lead to significant changes in the plasma antioxidant status, endogenous DNA strand breaks and parameters of the immune system in all groups. Therefore, these results indicate that the agricultural system has neither an effect on the carotenoid content, the antioxidant capacity of carrots, nor on the bioavailability of carotenoids and on antioxidant, antigenotoxic and immunological effects as assessed in a human intervention study.

        abstract = {The authors studied 180 organic farmers, randomly selected out of 4459 organic farmers registered with Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board (UOCB), in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand (770 34? and 810 02?E longitude and 280 43? to 310 27? latitude). These farmers were interviewed during 2006-07, using semi-structured Interview schedule, so as to know their Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) in context of their livestock production activities in particular. All the farmers had maintained some animals under crop livestock subsistence mixed farming system, mainly to meet household requirements of milk and more importantly cow dung for use in crop field. These farmers were mostly focussed on organic crop production activities, with active technical and marketing support from UOCB. The animal husbandry practices were mostly traditional but very close to organic livestock production systems when contrasted with the organic livestock standards. It was concluded in the study that conversions to organic livestock production systems would be much easier for these organic farmers, if technical and marketing support is extended beyond crops to cover livestock.

Since pesticide application for direct control is not allowed in organic farming, reliable methods for quantifying wireworm infestation levels and forecasting damage are urgently needed for any control strategy. In the present work, the assessment of the range of attractiveness of pheromone traps to male A. lineatus and A. obscurus beetles was investigated in 2006 and 2007. The results indicated that the trap recovery rate of released beetles was more dependent on release distance than on time. Recovery rates greater than 40\% were only noted for short release distances (up to 10 m), while less than 10\% of the beetles released at a distance of 60 m returned to the traps. Recovery rates of click beetles were also negatively affected by cold and wet weather conditions. Most of the beetles were recovered within the first 3 days.}

Results show that both organic and conventional management resulted in a decrease of the pool of organic carbon in the soil. The average decrease for the conventional management was 401 kg ha-1 year-1 and for the organic management 261 kg ha-1 year-1. The input of effective organic matter in the soil was significantly higher in organic than in conventional farms. Animal manure was the main contributor to this difference. }

Patterns are emerging where smallholder farmers are being socially and economically linked to larger farmers who may do some processing before the raw materials are handed over to the contracting company. Where transactions costs are high, local communities may develop and contract out the land directly to exporting companies who farm using employees. Four organisational patterns are identified which each leads to different types of livelihood benefits for the producers; preliminary results indicate that income and a reliable market access is the dominant benefits.}

        abstract = {Self-sufficiency in food production can be guaranteed when agriculture is practiced on the basis of reasonable policy and optimal system. In doing so, the possibility of
securing food production becomes possible in sub-SaharanAfrica. In this regard cooperatives have played a significant role. The present food production system in many
sub-Saharan African countries is such that much of the food supply is produced by the small-scale farmers owning less than 5 hectares of arable land and with 75 percent or moreowning less than one hectare. Obviously this is a strong reason for the creation of poverty to which attention should be drawn to. Farmer controlled cooperatives can assist poor farmers in strengthening their position in the food chain.
In addition to the present agricultural crisis prevalent and the foreseeable danger of undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa, from where the small-scale farmers suffer the most the other major problem is the fact that sub-Saharan African economies still exhibit economic characteristics inherited from the colonial era which still continues to influence the lives of the small-scale farmers. This situation might take time to shift the whole economic structure.
One way to explain further the above issue is by looking into the two main agricultural production lines; 1) food crop production and 2) cash crop production. In general,
food crops are produced by the small-scale farmers on little land in remote areas for home consumption and marketing purposes. On the other hand, cash crops are export
commodities, which through trading fetch earnings more than the food crops. Thus,income distribution of the cash crops among the small-scale farmers is minimal, even
if they are engaged in producing them as portfolio entrepreneurs. Instead, since the cash crops earn export revenues, they are the backbone of state budgets for the
producing countries. Another problem related to cash crops is that the prices are low in real terms in world market which can be the cause of economic crisis at the state
level. Certainly, this is one of the determinant factors of the future of the small-scale farmers in sub-Saharan and the challenge to the problem of food security in sub-
Saharan Africa. Agriculture and rural development become sustainable when they are economically viable and evenly distributed.
Thus, co-operatives can play a significant role in the promotion of food security policy in sub-Saharan Africa if they are rooted in communities and respond to their members
and the interests of those communities (Tenaw, 2008).

The a huge variability with respect to this issue between organic farms indicate profound discrepancies between claim and reality of organic livestock farming. Thus, the hypothesis that the implementation of minimum standards will automatically provide benefits for the issue of animal health and welfare has been refuted by farm practice. As a consequence, organic farmers and retailers can no longer stick to the claim that organic products of animal origin are of higher value with respect to the issue of animal health and welfare. Reasons for the limited effects of the organic standards are multi-factorial and assumed to be farm specific in the fist place. On the other hand, limited availability of resources such as nutrients, labour time and investments within organic farm systems together with a high pressure on the production costs by retailers make any improvments very difficult. In order to preserve the credibility of organic agriculture and the confidence of the consumers in organic products there is a need for more transparency and for a change in the paradigm from a standard-oriented to an output-oriented approach. Credible information about the specific level of product and process qualities emerged by each farm has to be provided. Simultaneously, a high level of animal health and welfare has to be honoured by premium prices to cover the additional costs and efforts that are needed to improve the current situation. }

it will probably benefit the individual organic farmer significantly in the form of more restrictive objectives at the EU level for organic products.}

The last decades the old fashioned way to hold cows have been questioned and the number of dairy cows in loose housing has been increasing. Last year (2004) 19 percent in total of all farms with milk production in Sweden had their cows in loose housing. Because of EU-legislation concerning all organic production no farms are allowed to build tie stalls any more and after 2010 all organic dairy cows are supposed to live in loose-housing systems. 
The aim of the thesis was mainly to find out the number of farms with tethered organic dairy cows. Furthermore the purpose was to study if there are any regional differences regarding the building system for organic dairy herds. There are important differences between buildings made for conventional dairy cows and organic ones. Some examples from organic rules are that calf and cow are allowed to go together during the whole colostrums period and the area per animal in some cases is bigger. That often makes organic buildings for dairy cows more expensive to build than conventional ones.
In the end of 2004 60 percent of the organically kept dairy cows, which is equivalent to 40 percent of the farms in Sweden, were already in loose-housing systems depending on that decision. There are big regional differences.

This information gives some reasonable indications of the levels required by dairy and beef animals to maintain good health though there is much less information available for sheep. There is also a wealth of information available on the role played by trace elements in the major diseases of ruminants, particularly mastitis and the problem of high somatic cell counts. There is also information available on the effects of trace mineral supplementation on fertility and production. This information should be used by organic farmers and their advisors to assess trace mineral status of animals under their care and to design strategies to help ensure that the trace element requirements of the ruminant are met and that good health status can be established and maintained. This should enable them to better resist the every day challenges by pathogenic organisms responsible for many of the current infections such as mastitis. However, currently we only have enough information to be able to do this with any degree of certainty by using dietary supplementation with appropriate trace elements which is a conventional approach and does not sit well with organic philosophy. There are indications from a very small number of studies that there may be a more ?sustainable, organic? way to achieve the same objective by increasing the diversity of the pastures used as the major food source for ruminant livestock. However, much more information is needed on the levels of trace elements present in these plants, how the level varies with soil trace element content and health status of the soil and how the level varies with stage of growth through the season. Only when we have this more detailed information can we design pastures that provide for the animal?s requirements. An additional benefit of such pastures is that they may result in a much greater diversity of wildlife. Attention also needs to be paid to the management and nutrition of the livestock in order to reduce both physical and nutritional stress to a minimum. }

Based on the result, the study has concluded that the measures that lower the self-evaluation of farmers? performance can make the farmers more cooperative with the aims of the chain.  }

Specifically, to determine the effects of feeding different strains of probiotics on the growth performance of broiler and utilizing broiler chicks, An all mash ration with 21\% CP was formulated. Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used and Least Significant Differences (LSD) when comparing treatments; T1-Control (0 Probiotics), T2- 2 kg Lactobacillus sp.?MT of feeds, T3- 2 kg Bacillus sp.?MT of feeds, and T4-2 kg Pediococcus sp.?MT of feeds. Statistical analysis revealed highly significant differences among treatments on the final body weight of broilers given diets with different strains of probiotics. Based from the result of the study, the inclusion of 2 kg Lactobacillus sp.?MT of feeds in the diet of broilers had improved the growth of the experimental birds in terms of body weight, gain in weight, feed conversion and its economic  returns  due to the lactic acid content of Lactobacillus sp. The result obtained from this study suggest that inclusion of 2 kg of Lactobacillus sp. per metric tons of feeds can safely be used in the diet of broilers to produce an organically grown chicken for table meat as it produced the highest gain in weight, feed conversion and return above feed cost.

However, reduced-tillage organic systems present challenges for weed control, particularly with simple rotations typical of conventional grain cropping systems.  Organic systems that employ more complex rotations including a hay crop have demonstrated greater potential for improved weed control, increased nitrogen availability, and increased yields.}

Die Datenerfassung zur Beurteilung von Risikolagen erfolgte in Erbsenanbaugebieten in Hessen und Sachsen, beide mit Schwerpunkt auf {\"o}kologischen Landbau. Die Risikobewertung umfasste die Absch{\"a}tzung der Schlaggef{\"a}hrdung durch den Erbsenwickler innerhalb der Anbaugebiete mittels zeitlich-r{\"a}umlicher Analysen und die Ber{\"u}cksichtigung ph{\"a}nologischer Daten zum Erscheinen, Flugaktivit{\"a}t und Entwicklung des Erbsenwicklers in Abh{\"a}ngigkeit von Temperatur und Photoperiode. Basierend auf der Risikobewertung sollten Entscheidungen zum Einsatz {\"o}kologischer Regulierungsverfahren getroffen werden k{\"o}nnen, die in einem zweiten Projektteil bearbeitet wurden. Die Regulierung des Erbsenwicklers wurde in einem Parzellenversuch {\"u}ber die pr{\"a}ventiven Ma{\ss}nahmen Sortenwahl und Aussaatzeitpunkt und eine bedarfsgerechte Direktbek{\"a}mpfung untersucht. 
Als Ergebnis konnten die wesentlichen Faktoren, die f{\"u}r eine Risikobewertung zum Erbsenwicklerbefall notwendig sind, definiert werden:
a) ein zeitlich-r{\"a}umlicher Zusammenhang zwischen den vorj{\"a}hrigen Erbsenfl{\"a}chen und dem Erbsenwicklerauftreten im Folgejahr
b) ein Einfluss von Photoperiode und Temperatur auf die Entwicklung der {\"U}berwinterungsstadien von C. nigricana, sowie Erscheinen und Flugaktivit{\"a}t der adulten Erbsenwickler
c) eine Steuerung der zeitlichen Koinzidenzvermeidung von empfindlichen Entwicklungsstadien der Erbsenpflanze und dem Erbsenwicklerauftreten durch Sortenwahl und Aussaatzeitpunkt.
Der Einsatz einer Pyrethrin-Raps{\"o}l Formulierung hat eine variable Wirkung in der Regulierung des Erbsenwicklers gezeigt. Der Befall konnte nur bei geringem Befallsdruck unterhalb der sehr niedrigen Schadtoleranzgrenze von 0,5\% gesch{\"a}digter Ernteerbsen gehalten werden; bei einer starken Sch{\"a}dlingsdichte konnte keine ausreichende Befallsreduktion erreicht werden.}

Intercropping strategies are known to maximize growth and productivity by including more than one species in the crop stand, very often with legumes as one of the components. In the present study clover-grass is undersown in a traditional wheat crop. Thereby, it is possible to increase input of symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into the cropping systems and reduce the need for fertilizer applications. Furthermore, when using such wheat and clover-grass mixtures as raw material, addition of urea and other fermentation nutrients produced from fossil fuels can be reduced in the whole ethanol manufacturing chain. Using second generation ethanol technology mixtures of relative proportions of wheat straw and clover-grass (15:85, 50:50, and 85:15) were pretreated by wet oxidation. The results showed that supplementing wheat straw with clover-grass had a positive effect on the ethanol yield in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation experiments, and the effect was more pronounced in inhibitory substrates. The highest ethanol yield (80\% of theoretical) was obtained in the experiment with high fraction (85\%) of clover-grass. In order to improve the sugar recovery of clover-grass, it should be separated into a green juice (containing free sugars, fructan, amino acids, vitamins and soluble minerals) for direct fermentation and a fibre pulp for pretreatment together with wheat straw. Based on the obtained results a decentralized biorefinery concept for production of biofuel is suggested emphasizing sustainability, localness, and recycling principles}

Simulation models can be used in various ways to give specific advice for growers on fertilization.

wettable sulphur shortly before rain or during infection development, was the core of the
strategy. It was concluded that the control of apple scab with the potassium bicarbonate
strategy was as effective as the standard spray plan, provided lime sulphur was available

leafs or fruits. Potassium bicarbonate tank mixed with a Mn leaf fertilizer however resulted
in severe leaf drop, and necrotic spots on the remaining leafs.

deposition period was predicted when in the field about 10\% of the eggs was still to be
laid. There was no consistency in the relation between cumulated pheromone trap catches
and the cumulative egg deposition as calculated from the field data.}

        abstract = {The relative importance of diseases on apple is varying with cultivar, management, time,
and climate. Many aspects of the cropping system influence the development of diseases.
The choice of the variety determines the disease management during the lifetime of the
orchard. Cultural practices improve the growth and nutrial status of the tree, and therewith
influence the susceptibility of the plant and fruits to diseases directly. Prolonged growth
can also have an indirect effect by causing a microclimate and growing pattern that
favours infection of tree, leafs and fruits by various diseases. Sanitation measures are
common practise for most organic fruit growers and help to make other measures more
effective by reducing infection inoculums. Despite all preventive measures, disease control
in organic orchards at an economically feasible level still largely depends on the
application of fungicides. Measures that allow reduction of fungicidal applications on key
diseases, lead to the development of a secondary disease complex that can cause severe
losses when not managed effectively and make a well thought-out control strategy
necessary.
In research, advisory and practical decision making, disease management in organic
orchards should always be seen in the perspective of the management of the total growing
system. With all factors that contribute to disease management in organic orchards
optimized, we are able to successfully implement new materials and methods that may not
be as effective as common fungicides in themselves, but add to the effectiveness of the
disease management system as a whole.
This total system approach makes organic fruit growing what it is.}

black lesions in immature fruits gave rise to a rapidly spreading firm brown rot upon fruit
ripening. Isolation experiments from both stages consistently yielded a single species of
fungus identified as Diplodia seriata, formerly known under the teleomorph name
Botryosphaeria obtusa. Lesions of D. seriata were also seen on leaves as necrotic light
brown spots surrounded by a purple halo, and occasionally on small twigs as cankers.
Fruit mummies on apple twigs were heavily colonised by D. seriata and are thus likely to
carry inoculum for fruit infections during late summer or in the following growing season.}

The benefits of the system in terms of the economics of establishment and the improvement in soil quality make the system attractive, but it is a system that will take some time to get established and is one that will require the farmer to ?hold his nerve? as grass weed, perennial weed burdens and slug predation may increase in the early years of implementation. 
In conventional systems and the POB work yields have reported to drop when implementing an NI system. This is before some of the benefits of a better quality soil are seen, but in the work done by Dr Michael Brandt in an organic system no yield drop was experienced. This was also the case for Danish work done by Per Schonning. Phosphate (P) and Nitrate (N) losses can be reduced as soil structure improves and becomes more stable. Better water ingress into the soil will reduce run-off and sediment and P loss and better water retention in the soil structure will reduce leaching potential. This is perhaps particularly the case at the time that the ley phase of a rotation is broken when greatest risks of N leaching occurs particularly if this coincides with significant rainfall.}

The study compared energy and GHG balances of transport biofuels produced in Finnish conditions. Energy and GHG balances were calculated from a life cycle perspective for biogas when timothy-clover and reed canary grass silages and green manure of an organic farm were used as a raw material. The results were compared with published data on barley-based ethanol, rape methyl ester (biodiesel) and biowaste-based biogas. The energy input for biogas was 22?37\% of the output depending on the raw material. The GHG emissions from field-based biogas were 21?36\% of emissions from fossil-based fuels. The largest energy input was used in the processing of the biofuels while most of the greenhouse gases were emitted during farming. The GHG emissions of the field-based biogas were emitted mainly from fuels of farming machinery, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of the soil and the production of ensiling additives. The energy efficiency was most sensitive to the methane yield, and GHG emissions to the N2O emissions. Biogas had clearly lower energy input and GHG emissions per unit energy output than domestic barley-based ethanol and biodiesel. }

Grain yields of the regular leaf type in mixed stands during the first three years varied because of varying N supply (preceding crops and weather conditions). When availability of N was relatively low, pea grain yield ranged between 2.5 and 4.0 t ha-1 in Frankenhausen and 1.5 and 2.5 t ha-1 in Waldhof, and were at levels comparable to spring pea yield, which varied from 2.0-3.4 to 1.5 t ha-1, respectively. In addition, mixtures contribute rye yield. At a relatively high N supply, pea yields were relatively low, but rye yields relatively high. Crude protein concentration and concentration of some amino acids (lysine, tryptophan and arginine) partially were significantly (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) higher in the regular leaf types than in the semi-leafless types.

A goal in organic livestock farming is to minimise the use of veterinary medicines to improve food quality and protect the environment, and to do this by improving livestock living conditions rather than using alternative medical treatments. Key values influencing organic livestock production are naturalness, harmony at all levels of production, use and recirculation of local resources and adoption of the precautionary principle.  The concepts of "positive health and welfare" are incorporated in EU Regulation 2092?91 on organic production. The farmer must ensure that farm animals can perform natural behaviours and live natural lives, but at the same time he?she must intervene when necessary and at first signs of disharmony in the herd. 

Based on various project experiences and results and research questions from different European countries, a research project entitled ?Minimising medicine use in organic dairy herds through animal health and welfare planning? was initiated in mid-2007 with the aim as indicated in the title. This paper introduces the project. The first project meeting and workshop was held in Hellevad in Denmark on the 9th-12th October 2007. A summary of the outputs from the workshop is provided here.

        abstract = {The project ?Minimising medicine use in organic dairy herds through animal health and welfare promotion? is focused on animal welfare assessment and its role in the active use of animal health plans in order to improve animal health and welfare on organic farms. To be active, a health plan requires dialogue between the farmer and those who are able to view the farm from the outside e.g. vets and advisors. The importance of this communication is the focus of this paper. 

Across Europe we see highly diverse farming systems and similarly diversity in advisory systems and their approaches to communicating with farmers. One of the objectives of the AniPlan project is to develop approaches to health planning that are robust yet sufficiently adaptable to be applied across these various conditions. This will involve utilising knowledge of current approaches to communication between farmer and advisor, but also the opportunity for new  ways of communication that contribute to the process of animal health and welfare promotion. Relevance to the farmer is paramount. 

In this paper, three current approaches are summarised, focusing on the dialogue between farmer and ?external persons?. These are the Danish Stable Schools, the Dutch farmer study groups (where farmers participate in doing animal welfare assessment in a fellow-farmer?s herd) and the Swiss pro-Q project, where there is a very active dialogue between advisors and farmers in a continuous feed-back system. Further to these descriptions, the paper summarises the results of discussions between participants at the first AniPlan workshop in Hellevad, Denmark on the subject of communication in the animal health planning process.}

        abstract = {?Minimising medicine use in organic dairy herds through animal health and welfare planning?, ANIPLAN, is a CORE-Organic project which was initiated in June 2007. The main aim of the project is to investigate active and well planned animal health and welfare promotion and disease prevention as a means of minimising medicine use in organic dairy herds. This aim will be met through the development of animal health and welfare planning principles for organic dairy farms under diverse conditions based on an evaluation of current experiences. This also includes application of animal health and welfare assessment across Europe. In order to bring this into practice the project also aims at developing guidelines for communication about animal health and welfare promotion in different settings, for example, as part of existing animal health advisory services or farmer groups such as the Danish Stable School system and the Dutch network programme. The project is divided into the following five work packages, four of which comprise research activities with the other focused on coordination and knowledge transfer, through meetings, workshops and publications. These proceedings represent our first results in terms of presented papers and discussions at our first project workshop in Hellevad Vandm{\o}lle as well as a review of Animal Health Planning in UK. 

The content of the workshop proceedings reflect the aim and starting points of all work packages, both in terms of analyses prior to the workshop, and developments during the workshop emanating from group work. Besides a general introduction to the project and the ideas of the project, Christoph Winckler provides an overview of the use of animal based parameters based on the results of the WelfareQuality project. Christopher Atkinson and Madeleine Neale presented concepts, principles and the practicalities of Animal Health Planning and Animal Health Plans based on UK experiences. Pip Nicholas from The University of Wales, Aberystwyth produced a report reviewing the current use of animal health and welfare planning. The entire document is included in these workshop proceedings. This was supplemented through presentations from all countries regarding animal health and welfare planning processes and research. These are summarised together with the concepts developed through dialogue at the workshop in the paper by Nicholas, Vaarst and Roderick. Finally, the Danish Stable School principles were presented by Mette Vaarst followed by discussion on different approaches of communication in farmer groups and at the individual level between farmers and advisors. 

One important outcome from this workshop is a set of preliminary principles for a good health planning process. We concluded through group discussions followed by a plenary session that a health planning process should aim at continuous development and improvement, and should incorporate health promotion and disease handling, based on a strategy where the current situation is evaluated and form basis for action, which is then reviewed in a new evaluation. It is important that any health plan is farm specific and based on farmer ownership, although an external person(s) should be involved, as well as external knowledge. The organic principles should form the framework for any action (meaning that a systems approach is needed), and the plan should be written. The good and positive aspects on each farm ? things that other farmers potentially can learn from. The work and studies in dairy farms within the project will be based on these principles and comprise evaluation and review using animal based parameters as well as finding ways of communication with farmers about animal health and welfare.

Intelligent weeders are now being developed which offer more advanced ways to control weeds, including larger ones and to leave the crop plants unharmed. One of the first commercially available intelligent weeders, the Sarl Radis from France, has a simple crop detection system based on light interception, which guides a hoe in and out of the crop row, around the crop plants. The inclusion of innovative technologies, including advanced sensing and robotics, in combination with new cropping systems, might lead to a breakthrough in physical weed control in row crops leading to significant reductions, or even elimination, of the need for hand weeding. }

were thoroughly cleaned at that time. Affected livers and egg counts in the manure had to
show if this cleaning protocol keeps the non infected animals free of Ascaris s. The results
show no effect of the cleaning protocol on the non infected pigs. These pigs had 57\% damaged

Such problems might be solved by using a more effective hoeing which needs wider row spaces. On the other hand, there is a risk of low competi-tiveness in wide crop stands, particularly if mechanical control effects are unsatisfying.
Therefore, a new approach has been investigated by using a crop design with alternating crop bands and crop-free bands. Using hoes in the crop-free band as well as a higher crop competitiveness within the crop band are two possible effects in order to make weed control more effective.

Aim of the study is to compile and compare the different animal welfare approaches found across the literature and examine implications of the organic approach to welfare for the rearing of organic dairy calves. Three main approaches to animal welfare have been identified in the literature. According to the biological functioning approach, welfare is accomplished when the animals are healthy and productive. In the subjective feelings approach welfare is accomplished when the animals are feeling good. In the natural living approach a natural life is considered as a life of welfare, during which the animal is fulfilling its life by experiencing its inherent nature. The different approaches result from different underlying values and concerns about how animals ought to be treated reflecting how science based arguments are connected to ethical guidelines. In organic farming the concept of naturalness is of major importance. In the organic philosophy, animal welfare is interpreted in terms of natural living (natural behaviour, environment and feed), but in the organic regulations the naturalness related requirements in dairy calf rearing are limited. Furthermore, a case study was conducted in 12 dairy farms in Norway and Sweden, in order to examine how the concept of naturalness can be best implemented in organic dairy calf rearing. The results show that implementation of naturalness in dairy calf rearing depends on regulation, on the farmer?s perception of welfare and on economic restrictions. Elements of naturalness that could be further implemented in organic dairy calf rearing, include natural suckling, feeding milk ad libitum, space allowance, outdoor access and socializing possibilities. To determine the extent to which these elements of naturalness should be implemented in an organic dairy system, it is suggested that a definition of animal welfare and of naturalness is needed, in order to overcome the dilemmas existing between organic theory and practice.}

Male, female and total fly activity was significantly related to sampling period, maximum temperature and relative humidity but the pattern of catches was not consistent. Activity increased from February until July but declined in August and was very low in September, October and November. The low activity in the last three months was reflected in low fruit infestation levels, with a maximum of 3.6\% in October which contrasts with infestation levels usually around 30\%. Olive fly mortality is high above 31oC and the average mean maximum temperature in the four months June-September was above 34oC. High summer temperatures, with low humidities, appear to have considerably limited olive fly activity and fruit infestation and pest control measures may have to be adapted to these conditions.}

including strengthening of the commodity?s natural defence mechanisms, thermotherapy,

NEX0101 is a promising antagonistic biocontrol agent containing the yeast Candida
oleophila as the active ingredient. NEX0101 was developed by Bionext, a spin-off from the
laboratory of Dr. H. Jijakli, and is currently evaluated for commercial use. The product
contains a yeast strain isolated from apple fruit and was originally developed for the control
of post-harvest diseases on apple. The antifungal effectiveness of this antagonist can be
increased by addition of calcium salts. As the mode of action of this yeast is based on the
colonisation of wounds, the mean targets of NEX0101 are blue mould, caused by
Penicillium expansum, and grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea. Facing possible latent
infections, thermotherapy by using hot water treatments could provide an advanced control
towards lenticelrot (Gloeosporium spp.). A combination of both physical and biological
treatment techniques could broaden the spectrum to all key pathogens on apple and pear.
The use of NEX0101 for the control of P. expansum was examined in combination with
calcium gluconate. According to the results the combination NEX0101 with calcium
gluconate provides an advanced mould control towards P. expansum The best results
were achieved using NEX0101 in combination with post-harvest dipping by thermotherapy.
The hot water treatment alone was clearly inefficient towards wound parasite P.
expansum, on the contrary thermotherapy stimulates the decay caused by this postharvest
pathogen. For the future a combination of biological and physical treatments could offer a
worthy non-chemical alternative for organic and integrated fruit growers towards fruit rot
decay, although more research is necessary to implement these methods in practice.}

Mastitis incidence and milk quality were focal points of the data collection. In this paper the results of a group of farms which rear dairy calves in suckling systems (n=11) are presented. It was found that compared to other farms in the study (n=88), suckling systems in calf rearing had no clear adverse effects on mastitis incidence and milk quality. In 2006 average clinical mastitis incidence on suckling farms was 14\%, on other farms 20\%. The percentage of cows with a somatic cell count less than 250,000 at drying-off was lower (60 vs. 66\%) at suckling farms. Also immediately after calving the percentage of cows with a somatic cell count less than 250,000 was lower (65 vs. 75\%) on suckling farms. Between other farms and suckling farms, but also within suckling farms, distinctively different attitudes to disease management prevailed. Most suckling farms recently introduced suckling systems in calf rearing. Only 1 or 2 generations of suckled heifers had been introduced into the herds up to now. In order to judge whether suckling systems have a potential to improve udder health in future dairy herds, evaluation should be carried out again once suckled heifers constitute the majority of the herd.}

In parity two and four the sows farrowed indoors (October to March) in individual pens and were moved to family pens with deep straw bedding two weeks pp. High backfat and weight loss during lactation was related to low piglet mortality and the relationship was stronger outdoors than indoors. Large litters had lower piglet growth than small litters and the relationship was stronger indoors than outdoors. Sows with larger litters were thinner and lighter at weaning than sows with smaller litters and the relationships were stronger outdoors than indoors. Our interpretation is that the outdoor environment stimulates sows to mobilise their energy reserves and produce milk, to a larger extent than the indoor environment does. }

From 2002 to 2005 a great many safflower accessions from a worldwide safflower collection were screened at several locations in Germany and Switzerland. More than 75 \% of the accessions tested failed under the humid conditions of the first year because they did not set seed. During 2004 and 2005, seed yield per row and oil content from 486 tested accessions varied between 0 and 428 g and between 0 and 21 \%, respectively. Twenty selected accessions showed seed yields between 1.4 and 2.1 t ha-1 and oil contents ranging between 21 and 23 \%. Although yield potential of given accessions was strongly dependent upon climatic factors, well adapted safflower accessions for more humid conditions were identified. For future research there are several agronomic challenges to be solved for cultivating safflower in organic farming systems, such as increasing oil content and optimizing weed and disease control.}

        abstract = {The aim of our study was to find new thinning methods for organic apple production able to fulfil the standards of Bio Suisse, the main label organisation of the organic food sector in Switzerland. 
The 17 trials reported were carried out during flowering period in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 on the cultivars ?Pinova?, ?Gala?, ?Maigold?, ?Elstar?, ?Breaburn?, ?Golden Delicious? and ?Otava? at different sites. The results confirm the good efficiency of mechanical thinning with the rope thinner and the thinning potential of vinasse, a by product of molasses. Different vinasse products were tested (K-Vinasse, light-vinasse, N Vinasse; NK-Vinasse) and it was observed that those containing less nitrogen had a minor thinning effect. To avoid phytotoxicity on leaves, the concentration of N-Vinasse should not exceed 10\%. It seems that for ?Gala? higher concentrations are needed, 7.5-10\%, whereas with ?Maigold? the efficacy of N-Vinasse was the same with the 2.5\% concentration as with 5\% and 10\%. On the other hand, partly good results were obtained when N-Vinasse was over-concentrated to 12 or 15\%, applied at warm weather and rinsed with clear water 4-6 hours later to avoid the phytotoxic effect (?burn \& rinse? method). Corn Oil (5\%), a commercial product from New Zealand, gave encouraging results. Lime sulphur (2\%) did not effectuate a significantly better thinning effect. The best method tested with a fruit set reduction by 62\% and 3,05 times higher flower bud set next year was achieved with a combination of rope thinner and N-Vinasse: rope thinner to thin the peripheral branches and to exert a physiological stress; and N-Vinasse to thin the inner parts of the canopy that the ropes can?t reach. Other tested products did not show satisfying effects. Trials also confirmed the importance of applying these thinning agents at least two times, at the appropriate phenological stage of flowering period mainly at F2 (full bloom) and G (= F2 of the one-year old shoots) and in case at F (king flower open). Hitting also the flowers of the one-year old shoots is important to break bi-annual bearing. Pollen tube growth was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Almost complete inhibition of pollen tube germination was observed with Lime Sulphur and over concentrated N-Vinasse (12\%\%) whereas with N-Vinasse at 5\%\% inhibition was 50\%\% less compared to untreated styles.. Overlooking all trials, combining N-Vinasse and rope thinner was the most efficient strategy for flower thinning. However, after our trials, its efficacy seems to depend strongly on climatic conditions and phenological stages:  treatments with N-Vinasse should be carried out at warm and sunny days above 16, better 18-20 deg. C. to maximize desiccation on the styles; whereas the rope thinner should be applied during periods of cold and clouded weather to maximize the thinning effect due to physiological stress and shortage of assimilates to the fruitlets. }

In several efficacy trials conducted during five field seasons, quassia pro?ducts proved to be effective control agents for P. humuli in organically grown aroma cultivars. A systemic variant developed by painting a suspension of quassia extract to the bines was the best method of application. This method proved not only to be very effective, but was also best from an environmental point of view. The optimal systemic application rate was determined as 24 g?ha of the active ingredient quassin. In order to generate the data necessary for registration of quassin in Annex I of the EU Council Directive 91?414?EEC, further efficacy trials were conducted during 2007. The results emphasize the importance of this compound as currently the only suitable aphid control agent in organic hop growing, especially when applied systemically.}

In comparison to harvesting, grazing is less cost intensive. For economical reasons a maximum duration of grazing period is required. Grazing over winter can cause pasture damages. This problem is of minor relevance for grass clover grown on arable land in the last production year, which is ploughed in the following spring. This study compares different grass clover mixtures concerning yield, forage quality and suitability for winter grazing.With this background, tall fescue exerted more significant effect on the dry matter yield than perennial ryegrass. White clover showed significant superiority over all the other tested species, with regard to protein and energy contents. Otherwise, swards with red clover and alfalfa had a significantly higher legume contents and produced higher dry matter and N yields than the other swards. Plots grazed in different periods over winter showed a clear significant loss of grazable matter. The highest loss of dry matter which also was accompanied by a decrease in crude protein and energy content was observed in mixtures with Lucerne. Under mulching systems and early grazing high nitrate losses were measured. After ploughing, the early grazing systems resulted in lower spring wheat yields than grazing in January or cutting systems. }

cultivars Golden Delicious and Elstar in 2006. Trees were either covered 25 days after full
bloom (DAFB) with a net during three days, or until the peak of fruit fall, observed after
seven days shading. Ideal time length for optimal crop yield was seven days shading for
Elstar and three days shading for Golden Delicious. Alternate bearing could be decreased
as flower initiation counts the following year showed. In both experiments, inner quality of
fruit such as sugar and firmness showed good values at optimal shading duration
compared with chemical ? hand thinning. In 2007, a second field trial was conducted with
cultivars Golden Delicious and Topaz to study the time period for shading in further detail.
Shading was done for three days at 19, 26 and 33 DAFB using two net types (three- and
two-meter-net width, covering the trees entirely or only down to 50 cm above ground). For
Golden Delicious, shading after 19 and 26 days reduced fruits per 100 flower cluster to the
same extent as with chemical ? hand thinning. There was no difference between the two
net types. For Topaz, shading after 19 days showed the best results. Regarding inner
quality of both cultivars, only sugar content for Golden Delicious could be significantly
improved after 19 and 26 days shading. Further analyses are still under way (e.g. for
acidity).
This study is part of an effort for increasing European consumption with fruit from
sustainable production systems, the ISAFRUIT-EU-project.}

The fertilization treatments are on-farm prepared compost, applied as a single dose and a double dose, farmyard manure, slurry and slurry combined with composted municipal waste. This paper concerns the experimental results of the potato crop in 2006 and 2007. The nitrate content of the plant juice was monitored and the potato yield and nitrate content in the soil profile at the end of the growing season were determined. In 2006 the potato yields were significantly higher for both farm compost treatments while the nitrate residues in soil were significantly lower. The early, high and constant leaf blight disease pressure in 2007 resulted in lower yields and less marked treatment effects. This investigation demonstrated that application of mature compost can result in a faster development of the potato crop in the first weeks of the growing season, which is important for sufficient yields in organic potato growing. }

In this paper some current data on organic farming are presented, based on the global survey on organic farming carried out 2007?2008 by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements IFOAM and Foundation Ecology \& Agriculture (SOEL).  
Organic agriculture is developing rapidly and is now practiced in more than 130 countries of the world. Its share of agricultural land and farms continues to grow in many countries. According to the latest survey on global organic farming, 30.4 million hectares of agricultural land were managed organically at the end of 2006, constituting a growth of 1.8 million hectares compared to 2005. Additionally, according to this survey, there are more than thirty million hectares of wild collection areas.
Oceania has the largest share of organic agricultural land, followed by Europe and Latin America. Currently, the country with the largest organic area is Australia (more than 12 million hectares). The proportion of organically compared to conventionally managed land, is highest in Oceania and in Europe. In the European Union (EU 27) 4\% of the land is under organic management. Most producers are in Latin America.
Global demand for organic products remains robust, with sales increasing by over five billion US Dollars a year. Organic Monitor estimates international sales to have reached 38.6 billion US Dollars in 2006, double that of 2000, when sales were at 18 billion US Dollars. 
The analysis of the global organic data for the countries on the list of recipients of Official Development Assistance (DAC List) shows, that more than one quarter of the world?s organic agricultural land (8.8 million hectares) is in countries on this list. Most of this land is Latin America followed by Asia and Africa. The leading countries in terms of organic land are China, Argentina and Uruguay. Compared to the developed countries, organic farming is lagging behind.
From the data gained through the global organic survey it is clear that in many developing and transition countries organic farming plays an increasingly important role and it is now increasingly supported by governments. In the light of booming organic markets it can be assumed that the market?export potential for organic products continues to be high. However, to assure supply with organic products not only in industrialised countries but also in countries in the south, more effort should be made to in develop local markets.

The first activities in organic viticulture date back to the 1950s when in Switzerland and Germany the first pioneers made great efforts to apply the basic principles of organic agriculture to viticulture. Since then, organic viticulture has developed dynamically in many countries. 
The international organic viticulture congresses evolved in Germany. The first congress of was held in 1985 in Geisenheim, organised by the German organic wine growers' association ECOVIN. The 6th congress was held in Basel, Switzerland, 2000 and for the first time in conjunction with an IFOAM Conference (IFOAM 2000). The ?Organic wine and viticulture conference? in the frame of the 16th IFOAM Organic World Congress in Modena, Italy, in June 2008 constitutes the 9th international congress on organic viticulture. 
According to a survey  of the Swiss Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL, at the end of 2006 in Europe more than 95?000 hectares of vineyards were managed organically, corresponding to around 2.3 \% of all vineyards. In the European Union almost 85?000 hectares of vineyards were managed organically (2.5 \%). The biggest producers are Italy, France and Spain.
Compared to other regions, Europe is by far the biggest producer. In total, globally at least 107?000 hectares are used for grape production. Outside Europe, the US and Chile are major producers (data are, however missing, for important producers like Australia or New Zealand). 
After a period of stagnation, 2001 to 2004, mainly due to a slow development in Italy and even decreases of organic vineyards, the organic grape area is currently growing.  The share of organic vineyards of all vineyards is still small. The percentage of organic vineyards is, in many cases, smaller than the percentage of organic land of all agricultural land in the respective countries. This is particularly striking for Austria and Switzerland where only little more than 3 \% of the vineyards are organic whereas the total organic land is around ten per cent of all agricultural land. However, particularly in the classical wine growing countries of the Mediterranean substantial shares are reached (more than 5 \% in Italy).

It is planned to expand the data collection to other variables. The data are published annually in the yearbook ?The World of organic Agriculture? of which both IFOAM and FiBL are the publishers.  The 2008 edition is also published by Earthscan, London, as a hardcover book.  
Even though in many countries the data availability has improved considerably since 2000, when the data collection was started, there are still major problems associated to data collection in many countries, particularly in countries which do not have a legislation on organic farming and where there is little public interest in such data. In these countries, data collection is carried out by the private sector who does not always have access to the full data and not always the resources to process the data. 
This workshop aims to 
-	Present existing models of data collection based on activities of the private sector
-	A) Data based on information inspection bodies: Opportunities and problems
-	B) Data based in information of the operators (exporters): Opportunities and problems
-	Data classification: Land use data, production data, market data
-	Outlook

The data collectors who support the global organic survey will be invited to this workshop, but it will be open to all participants of the IFOAM Organic World Congress. 

Speakers will be invited from a) inspection bodies and b) private sector representatives who collate data either from inspection bodies or operators. The workshop organisers will present their experiences with global data collection and processing.

Some of the important goals for organic production systems are naturalness, harmony on all levels of production, local recycling of resources, and the principle of precaution (Anonymous, 2002). For organic herds, good animal welfare is an explicit goal, and this includes that the overall goal for the organic farming systems regarding naturalness and harmony in the herd are met by giving the animals possibilities to perform natural behavior and achieve harmony within the group. Freedom for the animals to make as many choices as possible should be respected (Vaarst et al., 2004; Verhoog et al., 2002 \& 2004). The production system is not sustainable if animals show evidence of pain, disease, or distress as a result of an inadequate system or disharmony between the animals and the system. Therefore it is of crucial importance to be able to assess and evaluate the animals? response to the system. 

This need is not only relevant for organic systems. Public concern about farm animal welfare has steadily grown during recent years. In this context, welfare assessment has many roles such as identifying current welfare problems, checking farm assurance and legislative requirements have been met, indicating risk factors leading to a welfare problem, testing the efficacy of interventions, formulating a product information?labelling system, or research tool for evaluating and comparing production systems, environments, management systems, animal genotype etc. (Whay, 2007).
Improvements in animal welfare may be achieved through (1) assessment of animal welfare, (2) identification of risk factors potentially leading to welfare problems and (3), interventions in response to the risk factors. In order to see whether the improvements have worked, it is furthermore important to be able to measure or assess the improvements and see if it has worked. In this process the animal based parameters help us to identify the animal?s response to the system, and therefore also the potential problems in this system. 

It is the aim of this presentation to give an overview over concepts of welfare assessments, and animal based parameters, and present the ideas in the project Welfare Quality in order to create a background for understanding and discussing the use of animal based parameters in the current ANIPLAN project.}

Raw plant materials were produced according to four different agricultural systems: organic farming (without synthetic pesticides and mineral fertilizers), low-input 1 (organic plant protection was used in combination with mineral fertilizers), low input 2 (conventional pest management and organic fertilizers were used) and conventional farming (synthetic pesticides and mineral fertilizers were used). The results indicate that rat feed prepared from the organically produced plants contained more antioxidant compounds, especially total polyphenols, flavonols and lutein. Rat feed produced for feeding experiments varied significantly in a series of key phytochemicals and therefore have the potential to produce different health effects in the subsequent feeding trials.}

The wide range of environments within OA and between years, underlines the need to try to select for specific adaptation in target environments. The difficulty of doing so can be helped by decentralised breeding with farmer participation and the use of crops buffered by variety mixtures or populations. Varieties for OA need efficient nutrient uptake and use and weed competition. These and other characters need to be considered in relation to the OA cropping system over the whole rotation. Positive interactions are needed, such as early crop vigour for nutrient uptake, weedcompetition and disease resistance. Incorporation of all characteristics into the crop can be helped by diversification within the crop, allowing complementation and compensation among plants. Although the problems of breeding cereals for organic farming systems are large, there is encouraging progress. This lies in applications of ecology to organic crop production, innovations in plant sciences, and the realisation that such progress is central to both OA and CA, because of climate change and the increasing costs of fossil fuels.}

The use of biochar as a soil additive has been proposed as a means  to simultaneously mitigate anthropogenic climate change whilst improving agricultural soil fertility.

Similarly, basic organic standards were intended to provide a common language for cross-cultural agreement on the production of organic products. In practice, however, the widespread promotion of organic export trade has created a situation whereby organic agriculture continues to be perceived by many in the development sector as a western, industrialised concept and one which is not compatible with the realities of many of the exporter, less-industrialised countries. This paper argues that to reverse this trend and perception, attention must be paid to encourage debate and tease out local and national concepts of organic agriculture and of healthy food - concepts which do exist within every nation, and to demonstrate their compatibility, or resonance, with internationally agreed principles. A case study from Afghanistan is provided, which highlights the measures taken to encourage this and the specific challenges encountered. The paper concludes by suggesting that much may be gained by sharing lessons with organic export initiatives from other countries and regions, and developing ?best practice? guidelines for linking local values with organic principles within organic export initiatives. }

The extra expenses of medicines, and funerals, means that rural farming families are forced to sell their capital assets, such as livestock, and land. The new farming workforce shifts to increasingly comprise children and the elderly, and traditional knowledge is lost. Through a review of literature and compilation of case studies, this research aims to deepen understanding and bring fresh perspectives and clarity on the role of organic agriculture and its relation to nutrition and food security, in preventing and mitigating the impacts of people living with HIV and AIDS in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). It explores the notion that whilst there is no cure for HIV?AIDS, a locally-grown, nutritious diet is just as effective in mitigating the impacts as more expensive and hard-to-access pharmaceutical products. It goes on to identify the policies and practices required to support the widespread production of healthy foodstuffs for people living with HIV?AIDS. }

Providing a theoretical framework able to define the characteristics of PGS influencing its role in promoting local market development and communities social cohesion, as well as the access to export markets, is the aim of this paper. The level of formalism in the relationship among the stakeholders involved in the PGS, its interaction with the flexibility and the scope of their relationship, social control as a  substitute for a third party certification body, are considered as influencing factors. A case study is provided: a survey among organic farmers involved in the participatory certification, members of the Rede Ecovida (Brasil), has been carried out, as well as interviews to the different stakeholders. The positive effect of the participatory approach on local organic market development and its still very low chances to access the export market emerged. An interesting finding regards the role of the farmers network (Rede Ecovida) in promoting trust on PGS certified organic products beyond the boundaries of the local communities.}

Based on a quantitative and qualitative survey of 40 farms, the results show that the decision to either diversify or specialise is usually a multi-dimensional issue. Only the analyses of the interactions between many different factors may help to understand the decision processes on farms. One central result of the study is that the personality of the farmer is the key driving factor in the decision on specialisation or diversification. The study also reveals that, whereas cost reduction is observed to be a valuable strategy in conventional farming, it seems to be of very limited relevance in organic farming in Germany}

        abstract = {Organic farming in the European Union has been supported widely since 1994. Against the background of discussions concerning the design and level of organic farming support, and the relevance of organic payments for the economic success of organic farms, the question emerges as to the impact of support payments on the sustainable development of organic farming in Europe. Different databases and methodological approaches have been chosen to demonstrate the role of organic farming payments for the viability of organic farms for selected Western and Eastern European study countries. Economic analyses are based on national farm accountancy data (FADN) in the Western European countries and on ?typical farms? in the Eastern European group. As a supplement to the modelling analyses, a detailed survey of 50 organic farms was carried out in each of the study countries. Organic farming payments were assessed to be ?important? or ?very important? to the economic situation on farms by the majority of the farmers surveyed. The outcome of the economic analyses shows that organic farming payments contribute on average 4-6\% of gross output in Western European countries and 4-19\% in the Eastern European countries studied. The results put the level of specific support for organic farming into perspective, as other support payments and market returns contribute larger shares of total farm revenue in all the countries analysed. Organic farming payments account for 10-30\% of family farm income plus wages in Western European study countries and - after EU accession - up to three-quarters in some of the Eastern European countries, thus highlighting the considerable vulnerability of organic farms to changes in organic farming policy. As a general trend in both the West and the East, it can be observed that the policy dependency of farms has increased over recent years. Changes in organic area support, which are actually under discussion in some countries, must be carried out with a sense of proportion, since support payments will continue to play an important role in the profitability of organic farms. Nevertheless, in order to reduce dependency on area payments, organic farming support should follow an integrated approach, using a mix of support measures including, e.g., the improvement of processing and marketing facilities, support for farm cooperation and activities designed to enhance demand.}

Theoretically, farmers are faced with two main options when looking for a viable farm strategy: diversification or specialisation. Based on a quantitative and qualitative survey of 40 farms, the results show that the decision to either diversify or specialise is usually a multi-dimensional issue. Only the analyses of the interactions between many different factors may help to understand the decision processes on farms. One central result of the study is that the personality of the farmer is the key driving factor in the decision on specialisation or diversification. The study also reveals that, whereas cost reduction is observed to be a valuable strategy in conventional farming, it seems to be of very limited relevance in organic farming in Germany.}

In addition, perceptions of organic food shoppers were diverse, often conflicting, and sometimes quite negative.}

As a first step in approximating the amount of these costs, this paper uses the concept of Transaction Costs in order to identify and structure the relevant cost types. The quantification of this concept needs data which will soon become available.}

Nevertheless, the local organic market is still a very small niche market and completely unregulated, but there is potential for growth if the implementation of the law is accompanied by a broad publicity campaign aimed at the consumers and support and education for farmers.}

The Research Institute of Organic Farming (FiBL), together with its partners, is presently establishing long-term comparisons of farming systems in various agro-ecological and agro-economic contexts to study the different parameters that are essential for sustainable development. To date, three study areas have been selected: (a) a sub-humid area in Kenya where farming is subsistence-oriented; (b) a semi-arid area in India where cotton is produced for the export market; and (c) a humid area in Bolivia where perennial fruits and cacao are produced for the domestic and export markets. The key elements in these comparisons are replicated long-term field trials. These are complemented by farm surveys and short-term trials under on-farm conditions. This network of comparison of farming systems in the tropics is expected to (1) put the discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of organic agriculture on a rational footing; (2) help to identify challenges for organic agriculture that can then be addressed systematically; (3) provide physical reference points for stakeholders in agricultural research and development and thus support agricultural policy dialogue at different levels.}

This analysis aims at developing a framework for analyzing grain yield using external varietal information about disease resistance, weed competitiveness and yield potential and quantifying the impact of susceptibility grouping and straw length scores (as a measure for weed competitiveness) for predicting spring barley grain yield under variable biotic stress levels. The study 
comprised 52 spring barley varieties and 17 environments, i.e., combinations of location, growing system and year. Individual varieties and their interactions with environments were analysed by factorial regression of grain yield on external variety information combined with observed environmental disease loads and weed pressure. The external information was based on the official Danish VCU testing. The most parsimonious models explained about 50\% of the yield variation among varieties including genotypeenvironment interactions. Disease resistance characteristics of varieties, weighted with disease loads of powdery mildew, leaf rust and net blotch, respectively, had a highly significant influence on grain yield. The extend to which increased susceptibility resulted in increased yield losses in environments with high disease loads of the respective diseases was predicted. The effect of externally determined straw length scores, weighted with weed pressure, was weaker although significant for weeds with creeping growth habit. Higher grain yield was thus predicted for taller plants under weed pressure. The results are discussed in relation to the model ramework, impact of the considered traits and use of information from conventional variety testing in organic cropping systems. }

        abstract = {Seven discussion documents were made during the SUSVAR Visions workshop ?Sustainable cereal production beyond 2020: Visions from the SUSVAR1 network?, Karreb{\ae}ksminde, Denmark, 14-16 April 2008. At the workshop, one discussion documents was written for each of the topics mentioned below. In total 55 persons from 21 European countries participated in the process. The participants came from different disciplines: genetics, plant breeding, genetic resources, agronomy, plant pathology, soil science, biometry and system analysis, all specialised in the area of cereal production.
The approach taken at the workshop was to focus on envisioning the future of sustainable agriculture, especially cereal production. This was done by scientific creative thinking on the basis of possibilities in breeding, management and seed production and not on the basis of traditional problem solving. We followed a strategy commonly used in industrial management based on the premise ?imagining the future is shaping the future?. The method ?appreciative inquiry? was applied supported by a professional facilitator. Experience shows that this way of working sparks engagement and creativity and that progress and results can be reached within a short time. Focus was on the following topics of relevance to cereal production:
- Competition between food and bioenergy,
- Soil fertility management,
- Economical and legal conditions for variety improvement,
- Participation of stakeholders,
- Plant breeding strategies,
- Food and feed processing improvements,
- Sustainable land use.
The initial process was to visualise the most desirable future scenario for the seven essential topics in food and agriculture systems. This process was unhindered by no requirement for a market-driven goal. Each topic was discussed in relation to a broader socio-ecological system with a focus on the means to reach the desired and more sustainable outcomes. The next step at the workshop was to produce the discussion documents.
The final stage of the process is to connect the topics in a completed vision of cereal production within a future sustainable socio-ecological system. This is in progress by a group of key persons within the network, e.g. the working group leaders (in preparation for publication in a scientific journal).}
