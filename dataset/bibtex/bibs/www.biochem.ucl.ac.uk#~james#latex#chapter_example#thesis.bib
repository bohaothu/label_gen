  abstract       = {MOTIVATION: A new hidden Markov model method (SAM-T98)
                   for finding remote homologs of protein sequences is
                   described and evaluated. The method begins with a
                   single target sequence and iteratively builds a hidden
                   Markov model (HMM) from the sequence and homologs found
                   using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is also used
                   to construct model libraries automatically from
                   sequences in structural databases. METHODS: We evaluate
                   the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three of the
                   test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct
                   answers are determined by structural similarity. The
                   fourth uses a curated database. The method is compared
                   against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST, a two-step
                   method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of
                   FASTA. RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all
                   tests-dramatically so for the fold-recognition tests.
                   At the minimum-error point on the SCOP (Structural
                   Classification of Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98 got
                   880 true positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST
                   got 533 true positives with 71 false positives, and
                   WU-BLASTP got 353 true positives with 24 false
                   positives. The method is optimized to recognize
                   superfamilies, and would require parameter adjustment
                   to be used to find family or fold relationships. One
                   key to the performance of the HMM method is a new
                   score-normalization technique that compares the score
                   to the score with a reversed model rather than to a
                   uniform null model. AVAILABILITY: A World Wide Web
                   server, as well as information on obtaining the
                   Sequence Alignment and Modeling (SAM) software suite,

  abstract       = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the
                   problems of statistical modeling, database searching
                   and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and
                   protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the
                   globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and
                   the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the
                   parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set
                   of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is
                   used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training
                   sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22
                   database for other sequences that are members of the
                   given protein family, or contain the given domain. The
                   HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that
                   agree closely with the alignments produced by programs
                   that incorporate three-dimensional structural
                   information. When employed in discrimination tests (by
                   examining how closely the sequences in a database fit
                   the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able
                   to distinguish members of these families from
                   non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the
                   HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for
                   relationships between a protein sequence and multiply
                   aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than
                   PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in
                   proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage
                   over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false
                   negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is
                   trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas
                   PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our
                   results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium
                   binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary
                   preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues
                   in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which
                   play an important role in excitation-contraction
                   coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the
                   functional domains that are typical or essential for
                   all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they
                   couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.},
