%X Allowing pilots to directly perceive the functional properties of flight may
improve piloting performance. This study examines differences in piloting
performance between a flight display (OZ) that displays a functional
relationship between power and airspeed and a conventional Cessna display.
Eight pilots performed flight maneuvers on a fixed base flight simulator over
six trials per display. Pilots' performance with the functional display (OZ)
showed greater control of power and reduced individual differences. The role of
functional information and its implementation in future aviation displays are
discussed.

%X A flight simulation study was conducted to examine the effect of a visual
display of flight time and distance added to a pathway prediction symbology on
pilot's flight time management. Twelve participants flew a standard flight path
with a time-constrained landing task. Some conditions such as flight under
various wind and visibility levels, or instrumentation failures were also
applied to the flight tests to measure performance in more challenging
conditions. We measured flight's time error as our measure in this study. The
results showed that participants flew more accurate flights and landed closer
to the required landing time with the visual display particularly under
challenging conditions. We concluded that the enhancements made to the pathway
prediction display by adding the time-distance gauge supported improved flight
time management and flight control.

%X The operational community has assumed that using a head-up display (HUD)
rather than conventional head-down displays will increase safety margins in
approach and landing operations. This paper discusses a pair of experiments
that test that hypothesis. Using a Boeing 737-700 full-motion simulator and
commercial airline pilots as subjects, we explored the effects of (1) HUD use,
(2) ambient visibility, and (3) length of approach lighting on the size and
location of the touchdown footprint. HUD use reduced the width of the touchdown
footprint in all tested visibility and lighting conditions including visibility
below the minimum allowed. HUD use had no effect on the length of the touchdown
footprint. These are empirical data that could inform the writing of
regulations regarding HUD-supported commercial aviation operations.

%X Air Battle Managers in the United States Air Force must continually monitor
a situation display (SD) in addition to performing a number of secondary tasks,
which typically occlude part or all of the SD. The purpose of the present
investigation was to determine whether the use of a multi-layer display, on
which visual information is presented at two different depths, with varying
degrees of transparency, would reduce the performance decrement associated with
concurrent task performance by eliminating the effects of occlusion. A
multi-element tracking task was employed as an analogy to the SD, while a
cognitive vigilance task was used to represent the additional visual task.
Analyses suggest that transparency effects may play a role in reducing the
deficits introduced by occlusion, and may also reduce perceived mental
workload. However, despite the findings of previous research, there was no
significant effect of depth.

understanding, manifested in estimation accuracy of three continuous variables:
miss distance, time to closest point of approach, and orientation at the
closest point of approach. Results indicated (a) increased difficulty of
understanding with conflicts that occurred with slower speeds, a longer time
into the future, and a longer distance into the future; (b) a tendency for
pilots' judgments often to be conservative, judging that conflicts were both
more risky and would occur sooner than was actually the case; and (c) a
"distance-over-speed" bias, such that two aircraft viewed farther apart and
converging rapidly were perceived as less risky than two aircraft that were
closer to each other and converging at a slower rate, even though the time
until a conflict occurred was identical.

%X The Federal Aviation Administration is making a concerted effort to reduce
runway incursions. A 5-day operational evaluation conducted in October 2000
assessed pilot use of varying types of CDTI devices. Structured and
unstructured taxi routes examined how well pilots navigated their aircraft
using electronic surface-map displays (north-up, track-up) or a paper surface
map. An analysis was performed of 15 hours of communication data to determine
how the use of these displays might aid situation awareness and influence
operational communications. A Type-of-Route x Type-of-Map ANOVA revealed that
more problems occurred, and more messages were exchanged for structured taxi
routes. Most problems occurred for the north-up group during structured taxi
routes, and the number of problems encountered was comparable for the other map
groups when pilots navigated unstructured taxi routes. The format in which a
map is presented appears to affect some aspects of pilot performance during
airport surface navigation.

%X Inferring the future intentions and courses of aircraft or ships at various
points in time can be problematic for traffic controllers. In this paper, a new
graphical display concept is presented, comprising predictive information about
the times, locations, and probabilities of potential traffic conflicts. Twelve
participants engaged in a ship control conflict avoidance task. Results
indicate that during the first block of experimental trials participants used
significantly fewer manoeuvres to resolve potential conflicts and did so with
better overall scores when using the new graphical display, as compared to the
conventional format. However, during the second and third blocks of trials,
performance did not significantly differ as a function of display condition.
Nevertheless, subjective ratings strongly indicated participants' preferences
for the new graphical format, suggesting that the new display format offers
potential performance benefits for controllers of air and ship traffic.

decrease surface gridlock, which are goals consistent with the Federal Aviation
Administration's (FAA) National Airspace System Operational Evolution Plan
(FAA, 2002). An operational trial was conducted to evaluate the initial design
of the SMS traffic management tools. Although the dataset was small,
participant responses were positive on four dimensions (usefulness, frequency
of use, perceived accuracy, and ease of use) for nearly all of the six traffic
management tools. Participant debriefs highlighted additional issues including
the effects of SMS on coordination between Air Traffic Management facilities.
This paper outlines the conduct of the operational trials and explores two of
the major issues raised by the observations made during the trials.

The design team included Human Factors specialists, hardware and software
engineers, and ATC domain experts. The design challenges faced by the team
included addressing the unique needs of the various ATC domains while providing
a usable human-computer interface. The application of the iterative design

%X This study was an initial examination of controllers' ability to manage
Global Positioning System outage situations caused by intentional/unintentional
radio frequency interference. Twenty-seven certified professional air traffic
controllers staffed their on-the-job sectors that were emulated on a high
fidelity platform. Three navigational system outage conditions were simulated:
no outage, partial outage, and full outage. Three operational environments were
also simulated: a current environment, a future avionics equipage environment,
and a future avionics equipage environment with ground based navigation aid
reductions. The research team collected coordination, task effectiveness
measures, and real-time subjective workload ratings. Results indicated the
controllers had significant increases in workload and coordination activities
due to outages; however, no differences in task effectiveness measures emerged.
The overall conclusion made in this study is that although there was a
significant effect of outage on workload, controllers were generally able to
compensate for the increase. The operational environment was inconsequential.

%X The potential of dynamic message signs to update pilots' expectations about
airport surface characteristics was investigated in a simulation experiment.
Signs were placed at simulated high-hazard airport intersections to inform
pilots about uncommon surface characteristics and it was investigated if and
how general aviation pilots could use such signs to update their expectations
during taxiing. The results of the simulation study indicate that about two
thirds of the pilots without prior experience with dynamic message signs
noticed and processed the sign information. About two thirds of those pilots
adjusted their taxiing according to the sign information. On average, pilots
who were more likely to notice the message sign also reported higher levels of
situation awareness (Taylor 1990) than pilots who were less likely to notice
the sign. It was found that dynamic message signs did not reduce the risk of
violating hold-short instructions if pilots were not familiar with the dynamic
message signs. Specific procedural and standardization recommendations are
given to improve sign benefits.

as an effective method for controlling multiple unmanned vehicles (UVs). To
better understand the benefits provided by a flexible Playbook interface,
participants controlled either four or eight robots in a simulated UV mission
with different forms of restricted or flexible Playbook interfaces in the
Roboflag environment. Level of abstraction (robot behavior) and level of
aggregation (unit of robot selection) were manipulated to yield different
restricted or flexible interfaces. The results confirmed the benefits provided
by a flexible Playbook interface in which operators are empowered to delegate
(or not) tasks to automated agents, compared to less flexible interfaces which
are susceptible to negative effects due to suboptimal automation or unexpected
events.

%X International Space Station operations require onboard crewmembers to
perform numerous robotic assembly, maintenance, and inspection activities.
Ground-based control of the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), in particular the
Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), has been identified as one
potential solution to alleviate disproportionate robotic maintenance and
inspection timelines that potentially exceed crew availability and duty times.
Challenges to operator performance and safety of ground-based control of these
manipulators include significant data and telemetry latency. Recent trends of
transmissions between the International Space Station and NASA's Mission
Control Center have determined the round-trip time delay can range from 6-8
seconds. The purpose of this study was to examine operator performance when
subjects performed representative dexterous robotic tasks with anticipated
command and telemetry time delays. Results from this study may determine
whether augmentations to existing operator tools and procedures are required in
order to manually control the SPDM from ground-based workstations.

%X NASA now has a focused mission for space exploration. We will continue to
use ground based analogs and simulators, the Space Shuttle and the
International Space Station as research and development platforms, but the
challenges of time, distance and very hostile environments raise the challenges
to human factors engineering designers to an even greater level. We will have a
new generation of vehicles, equipment, habitats and space suits; operations and
activity management will present novel scheduling, training and task allocation
opportunities. The safety stakes will also be higher and the cold euphemisms of
risk management will require some humanization, both for the crew and the
public.
   Space vehicle launch, docking, navigation and landing will require complex
interactions between automation and human operators. Commanders and pilots will
require considerable simulator training and will be expected to perform
flawlessly despite the debilitating exposure to extended time in space.
Physical tasks on planetary surfaces will require protective suits that allow
explorers to function effectively without the risk of excessive fatigue.
Deviations from our familiar 24 hour day night cycle will demand innovative
countermeasures if crew members are not to succumb to performance decrements
due to cumulative sleep deprivation. Operation of complex life support,
transportation, emergency response and scientific systems will require the
development of effective and efficient job aids and procedures. Planetary
surface habitats will be designed with the life support systems and home
comforts necessary for long duration tenure. Finally, the safety of the human
crew will be paramount and will require robust hybrid human-robotic systems,
activity schedules and operations management.
   The NASA space human factors community is addressing these challenges by
observing the performance of crew members in analogs, simulators and real
missions and supporting this activity by basic and applied research in NASA
laboratories and in collaboration with external scientists. The presentations
in this panel will describe some of the current efforts to support this focused

%X Aviation has been witness to rapid advancement in technologies that have
significantly improved aviation safety. The development of attitude indicators,
flight management systems, radio navigation aids, and instrument landing
systems (ILS) have extended aircraft operations into weather conditions with
reduced forward visibility. However, as Brooks (1997) has noted, "...while
standard instrumentation has served us well, enabling aviation as we see it
today, literally thousands of dead souls, victims of aviation catastrophe,
offer mute and poignant testimony to its imperfections. The simple, elegant
dream of soaring aloft visually, intuitively -- bird-like -- remain elusive"
(p. 17). Using conventional displays, pilots must integrate information from
many separate sources to achieve situation awareness. This integration process
can lead to errors, which in some cases can have deadly consequences.

and diagnosticity of psychophysiological measures to subjective mental workload
and time-on-task. Thirty participants performed the Multi-Attribute Test

augmentation of &Theta; in conjunction with a suppression of &alpha; activity
from parietal sites in response to high workload. In addition, heart rate,
vagal tone and blink duration were sensitive to mental workload. The
implications for the selection of psychophysiological variables for
biocybernetic control are discussed.

by the operator's physiology. The identification of real-time
psychophysiological variables capable of detecting and predicting operator
subjective states is an important requisite for biocybernetic control. The
present study investigated how psychophysiology may index negative subjective
states, namely, task-disengagement, distress and worry.
   To encourage negative states, 35 participants performed the (high demand)
Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), for 100 minutes in total. Subjective state
was assessed using the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ). The
psychophysiological measures recorded included: GSR, EOG, EEG, ECG, and
respiration. Analysis of the data revealed performance was sustained throughout
the task although subjective states became more negative over time. This was
accompanied by various psychophysiological changes, e.g. increased respiration
rate. Regression analyses indicated that psychophysiological changes were
predictive of changes in subjective states. The results and implications for
biocybernetic systems are discussed.

taskload of the PF and PNF were varied. The models were further tested by
implementing interruptions through Air Traffic Control (ATC) calls. The results
showed that both expertise and taskload affected performance. Further, ATC
interruptions produced crew miscommunication, differential situation awareness,

%X Aircraft flight deck synthetic vision systems (SVS) always provide a "clear
day" view and hence have the potential to improve safety in commercial
aviation. Approach, landing, and taxi operations will most readily profit from
the SVS capabilities. A part-task simulation study provided data on pilot
performance using a baseline and an SVS-equipped flight deck. One effect of
adding the separate SVS to the flight deck was that pilot scan patterns changed
significantly -- more time was devoted to the attitude displays and less to the
navigation display. Concern over the change in well-established scan patterns
lead to the suggestion that the SVS, an attitude display, be combined with the
primary flight display as a single Enhanced-SVS attitude display rather than
augment it as a separate display. A human performance model study was used to
reproduce the results of the part-task study and then establish that the
Enhanced-SVS attitude instrument would restore the original pilot scan pattern.

function analysis of inspection to show its characteristics, and then proposing
a four-level classification of temporal effects to help future applications.
This classification divides the temporal effects into four components: weekly,
daily, hourly, and minute time scales. The analysis presented here will form
the basis for the design of future experimental studies of temporal factors in

%X The Federal Aviation Administration has raised many issues concerning the
outsourcing of maintenance to foreign repair stations and recommends
establishing a method for determining whether language barriers result in
maintenance deficiencies. This work addresses concerns that non-native English
speakers may be prone to an increased error rate that could potentially affect
airworthiness. This paper presents Year 2 of the project. We used the seven
scenarios of language error developed in Year 1 as the basis for our data
collection effort to quantify the frequency of error. An intervention
experiment has been designed and tested on two groups of participants:
English-speaking maintenance personnel and Chinese speaking engineering
graduate students. Neither is the final target group, but the methodology
needed to be verified before on-site data collection. The analysis of the data
from these two experiments is presented here.

%X This research investigated whether there was equal improvement for
instrument pilot skill trained under an immersive virtual environment (IVE)
versus a nonimmersive virtual environment (NIVE). In the IVE, sensory input to
the human from external world is provided by head mounted displays, while NIVEs
are represented by desktop displays. Subjects were tested in IVE and NIVE
flight scenarios using three flying tasks -- normal crosswind approach and
landing (NCAL), go-around (GA) and constant speed during climbing and
descending (CSCD). Error rate data were analyzed for four pilot control tasks.
The results show that NIVE provides error rate reduction for training altitude
control under NCAL and GA tasks, and vertical speed control for CSCD. No
significant differences were observed for both NIVE and IVE for vertical speed
control. IVE showed error rate decrements for the rest of the tasks.

older systems are lacking. This study compared two speech synthesizers, DECtalk
'Perfect Paul,' one of the most popular 'older' synthesizers, and a 'newer'
synthesizer, AT&amp;T's Natural Voices 'Mike,' for intelligibility utilizing
the Modified Rhyme Test (MRT). Each system was evaluated at three
speech-to-noise (S/N) ratios: -5 dB, -8 dB, and -11 dB, in a within-subjects
design. Aircraft engine noise at 85 dB(A), produced by a Cessna 172R flight
simulator, served as background noise. Normal hearing non-pilots served as
subjects. Results indicated differences in intelligibility between the two
speech synthesizers at each speech-to-noise ratio, with the AT&amp;T product
showing significantly better intelligibility than the DECtalk product.
Potential applications of this research include guidance for the integration of
automated voice technologies in the cockpit and in similar systems that present
elevated levels of background noise during normal communications and auditory
display operations.

recovery tasks to determine the effect of the addition of audio symbology to
visual symbology on performance. Two audio symbology sets were tested including
a non-localized set of recovery commands, and a set of localized "fly-to" cues.
Results showed that there was no significant difference in performance among
the visual only condition, the visual plus non-localized audio commands, and
the visual plus localized cues. There were, however, significant differences in
performance based on the initial climb/dive angle condition of the unusual

%X In complex UAV control stations, it is important to alert operators to
actionable information in a timely manner. Tactile displays may alleviate
visual workload by transmitting information through the skin, cueing operators
to high priority, unexpected events. The utility of tactile alerts (vibration
on wrists) in substitution for aural alerts, as a redundant cue to visual
alerts, was examined. Participants responded to critical events alerted with
aural or tactile redundant cues, while performing multiple tasks in a simulated
UAV control station. Results showed that there were no significant performance
differences between the conditions employing unique aural and tactile cues.
These data suggest that the non-visual alerts may be equally compelling and the
tactile alerts can substitute for aural alerts as a redundant cue to visual
cues. Also, there was not a strong indication that tactile alerts were
advantageous in a high noise environment. However, subjective comments and
trends in the data suggest that tactile alerts may be especially advantageous
in noisy task environments requiring long periods of vigilance.

%X The National Research Council of Canada and Defence Research and Development
Canada flight-tested the U.S. Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory's
Tactile Situational Awareness System (TSAS) in a dynamic task. The TSAS vest
uses small pneumatic actuators or 'tactors' to transmit information to the
pilot. Eleven pilots used the TSAS to cue horizontal axis performance in a
land-based deck landing task flown in the NRC Bell 205 helicopter. Pilots
tracked a vertically moving target with and without the TSAS in good and
degraded visual conditions. The TSAS effectively cued longitudinal fore/aft
drifts and reduced RMS error. It had less effect on lateral positioning error,
possibly due to the presence of strong visual cues. Pilot situational awareness
during degraded visual environment conditions in high sea states was
significantly improved by the TSAS, as measured by the China Lake situational
awareness rating scale. No change in workload, as measured by Modified Cooper
Harper Workload Scale, was attributable to the TSAS use. The improvements in
situational awareness and the reduction in longitudinal error suggest that the
TSAS would be beneficial for helicopter ship deck landing.

%X Eight military pilots completed a study of human-interaction with reliable
and unreliable automation in a complex air-to-ground search and destroy
mission. Each mission consisted of four distinct stages. Automation was
available in three of the four stages to aid the pilot in completing the
required tasks. Automation reliability level was manipulated and combined
factorially with two levels of workload, resulting in sixteen mission
scenarios. Subjective measures of mental workload, situation awareness, trust,
confidence, and judgments of the automation reliability were recorded after
each mission. An analysis of the subjective measure ratings by mission workload
level and the reliability of the first stage automation was performed. The
results indicated that pilot trust in the automation was higher when the
workload level was low and that there was a significant difference in
confidence ratings between high and low workload levels, but only when the
automation was unreliable. Design implications are discussed.

%X Thirty-two undergraduate pilots from the University of Illinois School of
Aviation performed simulated military reconnaissance missions with an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV). Pilots were required to: a) navigate the UAV through a
series of mission legs, b) search for possible targets of opportunity, and c)
monitor system health. They performed the missions under three types of
auditory auto-alert aids (a 100% reliable system, a 67% reliable system with
automation false alarms, and a 67% reliable system with automation misses), as
well as a non-automated baseline condition. Results indicate that while
reliable automation can benefit performance relative to baseline in the
automated task, the unreliable automation aids reduced performance to that of
baseline or worse. The automation false alarms and misses harmed performance in
qualitatively different ways, with false alarm prone automation appearing to
cause more damage than miss prone automation to both the automated task and the
concurrent target search task.

%X This study reports the development and evaluation of time series based
objective pilot performance metrics. From a previously developed array of
autocorrelation and Fourier analysis based metrics, five Fourier-based metrics
that employed a threshold value were chosen to investigate their effectiveness
in separating pilots who, based on instructor pilot (IP) evaluations, had
either passed or failed a particular segment of an instrument proficiency check
flight. An instrument landing system (ILS) approach was chosen for analysis
based on IP feedback of what flight segments were most difficult to evaluate,
had greatest sensitivity to overall pilot performance, and greatest criticality
to the flying task. Further analysis showed that an optimal value for the
criterion value could be found that most effectively separated those pilots
that had passed the ILS segment from those who had failed. Criterion setting
methods without external criteria using multidimensional scaling and cluster
analysis techniques are also discussed.

%X The progression towards the implementation of Free Flight has raised
concerns over lapses in a controller's ability to detect the presence of
conflicts amongst multiple aircraft pairs. These concerns have been supported
through numerous empirical studies. An issue that has not received much
attention is the impact of controller experience on conflict detection ability
under Free flight. In the present study, fourteen controllers performed a
conflict detection task. Variables manipulated included experience level and
traffic load and controller performance was assessed using response time and
accuracy as measures. Results from the study surprisingly suggest that
controllers with more experience take longer to ascertain conflict likelihood
under free flight conditions compared to their novice counterparts, even when
the age factor is accounted for. We attribute the presence of the effect to the
greater reliance on conventional cues, such as a route structure, and postulate
that the absence of such cues produce the observed effects. The implications of
these findings are discussed.

%X The navigation reference system (NRS) was designed to provide increased
routing flexibility to aircraft operators and air traffic controllers. The NRS
is a grid of points that employs a shorthand naming convention to specify
waypoints independent of ground-based navigation aids. This study assessed
usability of the NRS in simulated en route air traffic control (ATC). Scenarios
were designed to exercise the NRS by varying factors such as traffic level and
weather conditions. Twenty-four controllers representing four ATC facilities
participated. Controllers completed six 45-minute simulation runs and completed
questionnaires and debriefing sessions after each run. Controllers found the
use of the NRS to be generally acceptable and usable even when traffic counts
were high. The NRS was reported to provide significant added flexibility in
performing important ATC rerouting procedures. Although several usability
issues were identified, none were considered significant enough to outweigh the
advantages of the NRS.

then estimated the outside world locations of queried traffic represented in
one of three display types (2D coplanar, 3D exocentric, and split-screen) and
in one of four conditions (display present/blank crossed with outside world
present/blank). Overall, the 2D coplanar display best supported both vertical
(compared to 3D) and lateral (compared to split-screen) traffic position
estimation performance. Furthermore, although pilots were faster in estimating
traffic locations when the display was blank, accuracy was greatest when both
the display and outside world were available.

combining quantitative and qualitative measures, it was established that by
integrating NOTAMs in the displays pilots' situation awareness and performance
improved, whereas mental workload decreased. Pilots rated the desirability of

%X This paper investigates competing influences of display content and clutter
on pilot performance during flight guidance and target acquisition phases of
air-to-ground targeting missions. Based on interviews with F/A-18 pilots, a
cognitive process model is presented to help understand how pilots use and
transition between internal and external sources of information to support
decision-making and aircraft control. Experiments were conducted in which
subjects flew targeting missions using a flight simulator connected to the
Navy's FalconView moving-map. In one experiment, subjects referred to three
versions of the display: 1) a detailed map overlaid with critical mission
symbology, 2) the map only, and 3) mission overlays only. Flight guidance and
target acquisition performances were best with the overlays-only display.
Performance was comparable or worse with the combination display and
significantly worse with the map only, suggesting that the distraction of map
clutter countered the benefits of map content.

whose command of the English language was questioned when repeated descent
instructions from ATC were not immediately responded to. The second individual
was the controller on duty, who was accused of not exercising the abilities
needed in order to detect the presence of a conflict between aircraft and
resolve them. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the event, highlighting
fundamental human and system errors that occurred that night: errors that

inspection and maintenance errors that occur in the aircraft maintenance
system. Efforts have been invested to track maintenance errors. These efforts
are reactive in nature: they analyze maintenance errors after their occurrence.
There is a lack of standardization in the assessment of maintenance errors
across the maintenance industry. Surveillance and auditing of maintenance
activities are two important functions which help ensure airworthiness of an
aircraft. A system that will document the processes and outcomes of these
maintenance activities and will make this documentation more accessible will
accomplish the goal of this research to reduce maintenance error. Such a system
would then support robust and safer aircraft maintenance operations. Our
research is developing a web-based surveillance and auditing tool (WebSAT) that
promotes a standardized format for maintenance data collection, reduction and
analysis to proactively identify the factors contributing to improper
maintenance.

%X Inspection is an important step in ensuring product quality especially in
aircraft industry where safety is the highest priority. Since safety is
involved, effective strategies need to be set to improve quality and
reliability of aircraft inspection/maintenance and for reducing errors. Humans
play a critical role in visual inspection of airframe structures. Major
advancements have been made in aircraft inspection, but General Aviation (GA)
lags behind. Strategies that lead to improvement in inspection processes with
GA environment will ensure reliability of the overall air transportation
system. Training is one such strategy where advanced technology can be used for
inspection training and reducing errors. A hierarchical task analytic (HTA)
approach was used to systematically record and analyze the aircraft
inspection/maintenance systems in geographically dispersed GA facilities. Using
the task analytic approach a computer based training system (GAITS: General
Aviation Inspection Training System) was developed for aircraft inspection that
is anticipated to standardize and systematize the inspection process in GA.

%X Spatial disorientation induced by inadvertent flight into instrument
meteorological conditions (IMC) continues to be a leading cause of fatal
accidents in general aviation. The Synthetic Vision Systems -- General Aviation
(SVS-GA) research element, an integral part of NASA's Aviation Safety and
Security Program (AvSSP), is investigating a revolutionary display technology
designed to mitigate low visibility events such as controlled flight into
terrain (CFIT) and low-visibility loss of control (LVLOC). The integrated SVS
Primary Flight Display (SVS-PFD) utilizes computer generated 3-dimensional
imagery of the surrounding terrain augmented with flight path guidance
symbology. This unique combination will provide GA pilots with an accurate
representation of their environment and projection of their flight path,
regardless of time of day or out-the-window (OTW) visibility. The initial
Symbology Development for Head-Down Displays (SD-HDD) simulation experiment
examined 16 display configurations on a centrally located high-resolution PFD
installed in NASA's General Aviation Work Station (GAWS) flight simulator. The
results of the experiment indicate that situation awareness (SA) can be
enhanced without having a negative impact on task performance, by providing a
general aviation pilot with an integrated SVS display to use when OTW
visibility is obscured.

%X The present paper summarizes the results of a study investigating task
management and task prioritization processes in aviation. Forty instrument
rated pilots flew three curved approaches in a high fidelity simulation using a
Synthetic Vision System (SVS) display. In addition to the primary task of
flying, during the last approach they were required to select the approach path
on the basis of environmental information concerning weather. The level of
immersion in the task, the nature and saliency of the cues signaling the need
to divert attention to the path selection task and the cost of not performing
the secondary task were manipulated to investigate their influence on task
prioritization. Our results indicate that cue saliency affected the frequency
of the switch to the secondary task, while task compellingness did not show any
reliable effect on task prioritization.

%X Fourteen pilots flew a synthetic vision system (SVS) display, through a
terrain and traffic-rich environment in a high fidelity flight simulator.
Traffic information was hosted on the SVS display. In a 2x2 factorial design,
the SVS display hosted a highway-in-the-sky in half the conditions, and hosted
an instrument panel overlay in the other half. We examined the effects of the
resulting clutter from overlay (but reduced scanning) on routine flight
performance, SVS traffic detection, and response to off-normal events, as these
were mediated by visual scanning measures of attention allocation. The tunnel
greatly improved flight path tracking and traffic detection, but slightly
disrupted the detection of unexpected outside world traffic. The instrument
panel overlay provided no benefits to tracking and a clutter-related time cost
to SVS traffic detection. Visual attention was focused on the SVS display over
half the time, and rarely on the outside world, even in visual meteorological
conditions (VMC), a source of possible cognitive tunneling.

%X Eye-tracking data were collected on eight pilots who flew a high fidelity
flight simulator with a synthetic vision system (SVS) display, which included a
tunnel-in-the-sky in half of the experimental conditions. In this paper, we
examined the individual pilots' detection and response to two unexpected
events, where the true information was inaccurately (or not) represented on the
SVS display. The results indicate that the pilots who failed to detect these
unexpected events spent most of their time scanning the SVS display, which
included the tunnel, and rarely scanned the outside world. The pilot who
detected the unexpected events showed scan patterns with a more even
distribution of scans to the SVS, the outside world, and other displays even
when the tunnel was present. This suggests that detection of unexpected
in-the-world events depends on the individual pilot's vigilance in maintaining
a regular scan pattern and resistance to "cognitively tunneling" into only one
display.

task. Expert and novice pilots read at their own pace brief scenarios that
described simpler or more complex flight situations, then in a standard
interview discussed the problem in the scenario and how they would respond if
they were pilot-in-command. Decision making was measured by coding the
protocols for correctly identifying the problems and solutions to problems.
Scenario comprehension was measured by reading time and the accuracy of
answering questions about the scenarios. All groups accurately identified the
problems, but experts elaborated problem descriptions more than novices did.
Older experts elaborated more, and older novices elaborated less, than their
younger counterparts. Older experts also identified more appropriate solutions
to problems while older novices identified less appropriate solutions compared
to their younger counterparts. Reading time findings suggested that experts
maintained decision-making accuracy by spending more time on critical
information when reading more complex scenarios.

%X Prior research indicates that older individuals have greater difficulty in
understanding warning symbols. However, research is inconclusive regarding
age-related differences in understanding warning symbols and few studies have
compared specific symbols. The current study examined 31 warning symbols for
comprehension by younger (18-35) and older (50-65) individuals before and after
training. Significant age-related differences were observed for 15 of the 31
symbols -- in every instance, the older group demonstrated poorer comprehension
than the younger group. Training improved comprehension by both younger and
older groups, but did not eliminate the effect of age. While rated familiarity
was significantly correlated with comprehension performance, familiarity with
the symbols did not explain the age effect. Rather, it is suggested that older
adults's performance hinges to a greater extent on the effectiveness of symbols
as cues to knowledge.

%X A cognitive task analysis was conducted to better understand strategies that
sighted and sightless users rely on to navigate the web and make sense of
information encountered. Across participant groups, analyses revealed that
users engaged in three primary cognitive modes: orienting themselves to the
page, engaging in a goal-directed search, and completing the task by finding
the results. Decision flow diagrams highlighted similarities and differences
between user groups. While the sighted users consistently progressed in a
linear fashion through the three modes, two distinct groups emerged within the
sightless participants. Highly experienced sightless users exhibited actions
much like those taken by the sighted users in their interaction with a weather
website; however, interview data indicate that more complex cognitive processes
were required during this portion of the task for the sightless user.
Intermediate sightless users exhibited a more recursive flow that involved
re-orienting themselves several times to complete the tasks.

acuity and reflected-glare associated with daytime and nighttime driving
conditions. Fifty-six participants (28 young, 28 old) recruited from Virginia
Tech student population and Blacksburg Community were tested in the study.
Landolt's Circle Method was adopted to assess visual acuity under simulated
daytime and nighttime conditions. Although, the age and distance main effects
were found to be significant, no differences were reported among all the
distances within the young group. The study also examined the effects of
reflected headlamp glare on age and mirror types on the basis of angle of
incidence, illumination-front-of-eyes and rating scores. The results indicated
that with the same glare level (as measured by angle and illumination in front
of the eye), elderly adults reported lower glare rating scores (i.e. worse
feelings of glare). Furthermore, the young and elderly both reported lower De
Boer's rating scores for planar driver-side mirrors than non-planar driver-side
mirrors. This result can have practical implications in reducing nighttime
discomfort glare for both young and elderly.

Useful-Field-of-View (UFOV) Test. In addition, each driver completed a Driving
Habits Questionnaire (DHQ). Although older drivers tended to have fewer
collisions and exhibited better adherence to speed limits in a simulated
driving task than did younger, drivers, older drivers appear to be at a greater
risk of having a collision, resulting from degraded divided and selective
attention compared to the younger drivers.

cognitive tests, each participant's PDA skill acquisition was assessed over
time (i.e., during training, immediately following training, and after a
delay). Consistent with previous research, older adults required longer to
learn to use the PDA and committed more errors compared to younger adults. Over
time, age differences in PDA performance were reduced suggesting that older
adults might benefit from the use of PDAs as prospective memory aids.

%X Older individuals in particular might benefit from an aware domestic
environment. Yet, fear of intrusion is a potential barrier that might keep
older adults from adopting smart technologies in the home. In this study, 44
participants (aged 65-75) were given a tour of the Georgia Tech Aware Home and
shown five prototype smart home devices. The structured interviews after the
tour yielded 2136 quotes containing the participants' opinions about living in
a technology-rich home environment. A subset addressing technology
intrusiveness of five devices is presented in this paper. The results show
three domains of potential technology intrusion in the home as perceived by the
older adults: physical obtrusiveness, invasion of privacy, and security risk.
Technology intrusiveness represented 19% of the total technology judgments, but
accounted for almost half of the negative judgments in general. The
distribution of the participants' conditional statements (e.g., I wouldn't mind
privacy intrusion if) suggested a careful weighing of potential intrusiveness
against benefits such as prolonged independence for some of the devices in
particular.

mixed-initiative control system that generated plans for single operator
supervision of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) missions. The objectives
of the evaluation were to assess to what extent human operators were able to
understand the plans generated by the automated controllers as well as to point
to additional support requirements to drive further development of
mixed-initiative planning systems. Six former fighter pilots served as test
participants. Multiple convergent measures were utilized to evaluate the
ability of users to understand and evaluate the plans generated by the
automated controller. While test participants were able to understand the
plans, the results provided compelling evidence for the need to communicate
more effectively the rationale behind plan elements proposed by the automated
controller and to provide 'levers'to enable the user to modify the plan. These
results point to important challenges for design of
'mixed-initiative'controllers to enable the human and automated controller to
function as effective 'partners'.

interviews of 18 participants, with 13 Critical Decision Methods in-depth
interviews, we found, among other things, that EMD work can be classified as
routine operations, start of a major incident, and when an incident is
established. Higher levels of SA were exhibited by dispatchers for non-routine
or major incidents, than for routine events. Senior dispatchers, or allocators,
developed a "picture in the head" of the situation, and used that to plan ahead
and to evaluate their plans. They were also found to use an information hub
strategy to develop and maintain their SA. Using a combined Wickens (2000) and
Endsley (1995) framework, we see allocators interleaving their attention and
information handling between routine and major incidents.

alongside an interruption-based Situation Awareness (SA) probe to investigate
the effects of interruption and reorienting the operator to the task. Content
of the SA probe was manipulated in four conditions: No queries, SA queries,
orienting queries, and irrelevant queries. The findings were firstly that the
HPT scores correlated with the SA probe scores in the SA queries condition.
Secondly, there was a negative effect of interruption on HPT scores. Finally,
HPT scores increased during SA queries and orienting queries but not during
irrelevant queries. The results imply that previous research showing no
interruption effects from SA probe methods may be due to the orienting effects
of the queries compensating for a decrease in scores caused by interruption.

%X Recent interruptions research suggests that the timing of interruptions can
play a critical role in the level of task primary disruption. An unanswered
question regarding interruption timing is whether greater task disruption in
terms of primary task resumption time is experienced with more frequent
interruptions. The present study used a VCR programming task with a
pursuit-tracking interruption task to measure how quickly people resume the
primary task after an interruption. The results showed that primary task
resumption times were faster for more frequent interruptions, which was
contrary to the predicted outcome. In addition, frequent interruptions did not
result in the more resumption errors or longer time-on-task results as
predicted. These results are discussed as evidence that more frequent
interruptions may compel people to adopt aggressive goal maintenance strategies
when dealing with interruptions, but further research is required to fully test
this hypothesis.

Dynamic Function Scheduling, an extension of Dynamic Function Allocation
approaches, highlights the role of temporal information and temporal reasoning
in supervisory control decisions. The microworld experiment presented 30
participants with a supervisory control task where they had to monitor
production in a simulated paint station, make strategic decisions about
automatic or manual production, and handle faults. Independent variables were
event rate, the knowledge of event rate information, the availability of an
online progress indicator, and the cost of fault servicing. Results showed that
knowledge of event rate information improved performance, but availability of
an online progress indicator had no additional effect. Implications for the
investigation of temporal control behavior are discussed.

%X Meteorological forecasting is an important area of study from both a
theoretical and applied perspective. It provides a paradigmatic example of a
complex decision-making task that requires integration of (and projection from)
multiple, diverse sources that can be incomplete, ambiguous and uncertain.
Further, it is a collaborative task that involves understanding and adapting to
the goals and information needs of the forecast consumer (e.g., a military
pilot, a fisherman, a commuter). This symposium showcases diverse cognitive
engineering approaches that have been successfully applied to the analysis of
weather forecasting and design of human-centered support systems. Topics
include skills, strategies and mental models that underlie weather forecasting
expertise; alternative cognitive analysis methods for uncovering the basis of
expertise; human-centered approaches that 'bridge-the-gap'between analysis of
expertise and design of support systems; and the use of controlled studies to
explore the benefits of human-centered systems for weather forecasting. A
practicing Navy meteorologist from the Ocean and Atmospheric Science and
Technology Directorate at the Naval Research Laboratory will serve as
discussant.

%X Northern hemisphere weather forecasters from the United States Navy (USN)
and their Southern hemisphere counterparts in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN)
were observed while making forecasts for air operations. A Comparative
Cognitive Task Analysis showed that both groups employed the cognitive task of
Comparing information to select among, validate, or modify the output of
numerical models when making forecasts. This process was interpreted as key to
the forecaster adding value to the automatic output of weather models.

%X There are many definitions, descriptions, and usages of the term "mental
model." Frequently, the definition of mental model is not described, leaving
what the author means as an exercise for the reader. I propose a very explicit
definition for a dynamic mental model and then show how that definition can be
applied in the domain of meteorological forecasting. Specifically, I suggest
that a dynamic mental model is a mix of images and propositions, relies on
qualitative and spatial relationships, allows dynamic, runnable results to be
inspected, and results in an inference. Finally, I offer suggestions on how to
improve the usefulness of the term mental model.

complex cognitive systems that were manifested in a recent project on weather
forecasting (Hoffman, et al., 2000). One focus here is on how technologies and
workspaces can facilitate or interfere with knowledge-sharing. A second focus
is the notion of methodological opportunism. This is illustrated by a
discussion of a new knowledge elicitation method, the Cognitive Modeling
Procedure, which is intended to support the rapid refinement and behavioral
validation (in the field setting) of macrocognitive models of practitioner
reasoning.

%X A project called Environmental Visualization (EVIS) conducted and completed
testing of a capability to improve the air strike forecasting workflow. The
capability was tested in a yoked experimental paradigm that had pairs of fleet
forecasters generating an air strike forecast, one forecaster using the EMES
capability and one using the current web-based tools. Three pairs of
forecasters were tested, and within each pair, the EMES capability supported
substantially faster (~40%) forecast completion time. Feedback from the fleet
users and personnel was positive about the approach we are taking and the
capability that was tested. The team received substantial constructive feedback
on the initial capability and will incorporate this into the next development
phase.

%X Humans traditionally experience a vigilance decrement over extended periods
of time on reliable systems. One possible solution to aiding operators in
monitoring is to use polar-star displays that will show deviations from normal
in a more salient manner. The primary objectives of this experiment were to
determine if polar-star displays aid in monitoring and preliminary diagnosis of
the aircraft state. This experiment indicated that the polar-star display does
indeed aid operators in detecting and diagnosing system events. Subjects were
able to notice system events earlier and they subjectively reported the
polar-star display helped them in monitoring, noticing an event, and diagnosing
an event. Therefore, these results indicate that the polar-star display used
for monitoring and preliminary diagnosis improves performance in these areas
for system related events.

%X Errors are a fundamental aspect of human adaptation in complex systems.
Efforts to reduce and/or eliminate errors through training and design have met
with only limited success. Therefore, it is critical to invest also in
effective support for error management (the detection, explanation, and
recovery from errors) to mitigate their negative consequences. To date, most
research on error management has focused on the first step in this process --
error detection. Instead, this paper presents a subset of results from a recent
simulator study that examined the role of error explanation and the nature and
effectiveness of error recovery strategies. Process tracing was used to analyze
error management activities of pilots on highly automated flight decks. Our
findings suggest that incomplete mental models of automation function limit
error explanation and often lead to recovery strategies that rely on either
"resetting" the system or serendipitous error evasion prior to negative
consequences, or reverting to lower levels of automation when immediate
corrective actions become necessary. These findings will be discussed in terms
of their implications for training and design.

situations pilots consider surprising or unexpected. The purpose of the
investigation was to determine if natural categories of events emerge from the
existing accident, incident, and event reporting data commensurate with the
current operational and research focus concerned with unexpected events and
aviation safety. The underlying question was whether the involvement of
surprise or unexpectedness in events may be a precursor to a loss of attention,
increased workload, or other interruptions of ongoing processes, which may then
contribute to an unwanted outcome of a maneuver, or an entire flight as
revealed in these database reports. The study was also conducted to facilitate
the development of a conceptual framework for the study of unexpected events in
aviation.

%X This study investigated the types of strategies experienced navigators use
to make cardinal direction judgments. While these judgments are important and
necessary in navigation, people are generally poor at this task. Verbal
protocol analysis revealed the strategies used by pilots in making cardinal
direction judgments. These strategies were then compared to those previously
identified using less experienced, non-pilot navigators (Gugerty &amp; Brooks,
2001). Prior research on navigation tasks has pointed to mental rotation as the
most common primary strategy. Our protocol analysis revealed a strategy not
previously identified for other navigational tasks, heading referencing,
suggesting that people often use a strategy involving little mental rotation
for cardinal direction judgments. Individual participants used one of three
patterns of primary strategies: mental rotation only, heading referencing only,
or a combination of mental rotation and heading referencing. The novices relied
equally on mental rotation and heading referencing while the pilots' primary
strategy was heading referencing.

%X As we develop new ways of looking at decision making in applied contexts,
such as those outlined in naturalistic decision models, it is easy to assume
that these new models should be used in place of 'old'theories in
investigations of human decision making -- and in many cases it may be
appropriate to do so. In substituting the new for the old, however, it is
important not to lose sight of the potential contributions that theoretically
sound and empirically tested models can make to our understanding of judgment
and decision making in modern environments. The purpose of this panel is to
highlight a classic theoretical and methodological approach to the judgment
process, Egon Brunswik's probabilistic functionalism and associated Lens Model
framework (e.g., 1943; 1956; Hammond &amp; Stewart, 2001), to present its basic
tenets, and to discuss its viability and applicability in the context of modern
human factors investigations (Kirlik, 2001). In particular, defining facets of
Brunswikian theory and the Lens Model make this approach ideal for explorations
of human judgment in high-technology environments.

creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in information
technologies. One program aims to develop methods for supporting intelligence
analysts in discovering "novel intelligence from massive data" (NIMD). An
important feature of this program is the role it gave to cognitive factors. The
call-for-proposals said, "Thus, NIMD is about human interaction with
information in a way that permits intelligence analysts to spot the telltale
signs of strategic surprise in massive data sources -- building tools that
capitalize on human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses to enhance
and extend analytic capabilities." This symposium brings together
representatives of five of the NIMD teams. While the approaches and projects
are diverse, all are focused at improving analysts' ability to extract hidden
patterns from massive sources of data.

%X Technology-based enhancement of information analysis requires a detailed
understanding of the cognitive tasks involved in the process. The information
search and report production tasks of the information analysis process were
investigated through evaluation of time-stamped workstation data gathered with
custom software. Model tasks simulated the search and production activities,
and a sample of actual analyst data were also evaluated. Task event durations
were calculated on the basis of millisecond-level time stamps, and
distributions were plotted for analysis. The data indicate that task event time
shows a cyclic pattern of variation, with shorter event durations (&lt; 2 sec)
reflecting information search and filtering, and longer event durations (&gt;
10 sec) reflecting information evaluation. Application of cognitive principles
to the interpretation of task event time data provides a basis for developing
"cognitive signatures" of complex activities, and can facilitate the
development of technology aids for information intensive tasks.

cannot be allowed to ignore the hard won lessons from cognitive science and
human-computer interaction -- that human cognition is embodied cognition and
that interface design has a large role to play in increasing productivity and
reducing human error. We propose an approach to the cognitive engineering of
integrated task environments by the use of simulated cyborgs (simBorgs) that
combine computational embodied-cognitive models of interactive behavior with
artificial intelligence based reasoning components in a simulated task
environment. Our goal is the creation of intelligent agents, simBorgs, that
will work tirelessly to perform usability testing on various combinations of
tasks and interfaces.

%X Because of the huge volumes of data that open source intelligence analysts
must search, effective information gathering on the web, is a complex activity
requiring planning, text processing, and interpretation of extracted data to
find information relevant to a major intelligence task or subtask (Knoblock,
1995), (Lesser, 1998) and (Nodine, Fowler et al., 2000). This paper describes
our use of analysts' plans to build a case library of reusable automated plans.
This process involves analyzing analysts' approaches to identify the important
characteristics of a knowledge discovery plan for case indexing and retrieval
and devising techniques for representing plans so that they can be
automatically adapted and executed. For this research, we are not building a
"complete" case library, but are developing approaches and guidance for getting
maximum usage out of the cases that are represented and providing processes for
identifying further areas for case development. The knowledge discovery plan
categories that we have identified thus far correspond to different contextual
domains that may be indicators of terrorist activities. When a plan is selected
from one of these categories, it is adapted, and the resulting plan is
executed, relevant information is extracted from unstructured documents, and
the extracted information is used to make further inferences and launch
additional searches.

%X Gathering information and making decisions based on retrieved information
are the important tasks that every intelligence analyst is doing. User modeling
techniques have been exploited to help analysts to search for information
effectively. To justify the effects of any user modeling technique on helping
analysts retrieve quality documents relevant to their tasks, we need to have a
comprehensive evaluation method, which assesses the improvement of retrieval
performance and user performance. In this paper, we describe our evaluation of
a cognitive user model for information retrieval with regards to retrieval
performance. Our user model captures user intent dynamically by analyzing
behavioral information from retrieved relevant documents for improving the
retrieval performance and user's performance. In this evaluation, we assess the
user model's short-term effects on a single query, and the user model's
long-term effects on the whole search session. We compare our approach with the
best traditional approach for relevance feedback in information retrieval, the
Ide dechi, which is the approach of modifying queries using term frequency from
relevant/non-relevant documents. We use the oldest collection of information
retrieval on aerodynamics called CRANFIELD. The results of this evaluation show
that by exploring user intent, we achieve competitive performance in the
feedback run compared to Ide dec-hi. At the same time, our user model approach
offers the advantages of retrieving more quality documents at the initial run
compared to the term frequency inverted document frequency (TFIDF) approach.
Our results have shown that our user modeling approach can be used to improve
efficiency, learnability and interactivity of an information retrieval system.

a system of automated "associates" to actively support and participate in the

a human analyst and automated reasoning. The interface between the two agents
is a key element in achieving this goal. The KANI interface seeks to support a
visual dialogue with mixed-initiative manipulation of information and reasoning
components. The interface must achieve mutual understanding between the analyst
and KANI of the other's actions. Toward this mutual understanding, KANI allows
the analyst to work at multiple levels of abstraction over the reasoning
process, links the information presented across these levels to make use of
interaction context, and provides querying facilities to allow exploration and

%X Typing is one of the basic and prevalent activities in human machine
interaction. John (1988, 1996) proposed a PERT
(Project-Evaluation-Research-Technique)-based model called TYPIST, which
modeled 21 of the 31 behavioral phenomena in transcription typing (Salthouse,
1986, 1987; Gentner, 1983). However, TYPIST can only analyze the typing
phenomena along the time dimension; it can not model error and eye movement of
typing. Based on the queuing network theory of human performance (Liu, 1996,
1997) and current discoveries in brain and cognitive sciences, this paper
proposes a queuing network model of typing which successfully modeled not only
all the 21 phenomena modeled by TYPIST, but also 13 additional phenomena in
transcription typing including 5 typing error phenomena, 3 eye movement
phenomena and 2 brain imaging phenomena. Further developments of the queuing
network model in modeling typing and other tasks, and its value in proactive
ergonomic design of typing interfaces are discussed.

management capacity may be realized via multimodal interaction. The possibility
of leveraging multiple sensory systems to maximize working memory (WM)
throughput becomes essential as the information age conveys volumes of data
that would overburden the visual channel alone. The current study proposes an
expansion of the current bi-modal (verbal, visual/spatial) model of WM to a
multimodal WM system, which includes verbal, visual, spatial, kinesthetic,
tactile, and tonal component subsystems. Single modality capacity was measured
for each proposed subsystem. In addition, multimodal capacity was calculated
for combined modalities. Results demonstrated that multimodal WM capacity
surpasses that of single modality capacity. Most notably, multimodal WM
capacity averaged nearly three times the 'magic number'seven.

of item repetition on reaction times and false alarm rates during training, and

%X Many computer network defenders do not know how malicious hackers think and
act during a network (McCloskey &amp; Chrenka, 2001). To study attacker
cognition, experienced hackers were recruited to attack a Windows 2000 network
and pursue three goals: Deface the website, steal (faux) credit card numbers,
and read email. Participants wrote a report of what they did, and a post-attack
cognitive task analysis interview was conducted. Logs were also captured on the
network including firewall, snort IDS, and Microsoft applications (IIS, SQL,
Exchange). An Attacker Cognition Model based on data collected from five
participants was created. The model has two basic properties: It describes the
cognitive steps followed by an attacker, and describes several passes through
these steps that the attacker follows as s/he penetrates several layers deep
into a network. Future research using smaller sample sizes and multiple studies
using the same participants is encouraged.

%X Intelligence analysis is a prototypical example of a situation that can be
described by the phrase "coping with complexity," given a variety of
complicating factors including (but certainly not limited to) massive amounts
of data, inherent uncertainty in the data, dynamism in the underlying world,
and the risks associated with the conclusions drawn from the data. Given this
complex nature of intelligence analysis, a wide variety of advanced
visualization tools are continually being developed in hopes of designing
support for the analysis process. In addition, a number of different cognitive
analysis activities are ongoing in hopes of deriving requirements for future
support tools. The goal of this panel is to present a sample from both areas in
hopes of providing an integration of efforts and thus more effective support
tools for intelligence analysts. We have four speakers presenting an analytic
perspective, one from a tool development perspective, and one from a support
function (the medium between analysis and design) perspective. This should
provide an interesting set of complementary discussions into this topic area.

%X This paper presents a study to investigate the applicability of two display
design principles toward the development of interfaces for engineering design.
The first principle, called the Proximity Compatibility Principle, specifies
that displays relevant to a common task or mental operation should be rendered
close together in perceptual space. The second principle, called the
Control-Display Compatibility Principle, stipulates that the spatial
arrangement and manipulation of controls should be easily distinguishable. We
conducted an experiment comparing the ability of subjects to search for
effective designs using a separable versus two configural interfaces in a
multiple-objective engineering design task. Results suggest that the Proximity
Compatibility Principle is an effective indicator of task performance.
Moreover, we found that the Control-Display Compatibility Principle can be used
as an indicator of performance efficiency.

%X Tactical displays can quickly become cluttered with large numbers of symbols
that can compromise effective monitoring. Here, we studied how heuristic
automation can aid users by intelligently "decluttering" the display. In a
naval air defense task, users monitored a cluttered airspace and executed
defensive responses against significant threats. An algorithm continuously
evaluated aircraft for their levels of threat and decluttered the less
threatening ones by dimming their symbols. As expected, 27 Navy experts
appropriately distrusted and spot-checked the automation's assessments, and
decluttering did not affect which aircraft were judged significantly
threatening. Nonetheless, decluttering improved response timeliness to
threatening aircraft 25% compared with a baseline display with no decluttering,
it increased attention to threats, and 25 of 27 participants preferred
decluttering. Heuristic automation, when properly designed to guide users'
attention by decluttering less important objects, should prove valuable in many
cluttered monitoring situations.

%X Advances in technology are enabling multiple sensory channels to be utilized
in presenting information. Nevertheless, the human operator can become easily
overwhelmed if an overabundance of information is presented in a non-systematic
manner. Current design guidelines are primarily tailored towards unimodal or at
most bimodal systems. Thus, the question becomes how to coordinate multiple
sources of information in multimodal multitasking environments, and what design
guidelines are needed to direct development of such interactive systems. The
current study builds on a previous study and seeks to extend unimodal design
theories to multimodal principles; it identifies some interesting differences
in unimodal vs. multimodal multitask interaction.

%X Increasingly, operators in complex event-driven domains, such as the
military, need to coordinate their goals and activities with numerous
co-located and distributed human and machine agents. One promising way to
support this requirement is the introduction of multimodal interfaces that
afford functions such as increased bandwidth, complementarity, redundancy, and
substitution. To inform the design of a robust multimodal system, the present
study explored natural tendencies for, and the role of context in, modality
usage in the context of simulated battlefield operations. Three groups of three
ROTC cadets/officers each completed a set of 30-minute scenarios. The
within-subject variables included participant location, the availability of
radio communication, the amount of coordination required by the scenario, and
the tempo of operations. Our findings show that participants were highly
selective in their use of multiple modalities. Multimodal interaction was
observed primarily in the context of spatial tasks and for the purpose of
supporting grounding, complementarity, and disambiguation. Joint modality usage
patterns evolved over time within groups and varied as a function of factors
such as scenario and interface management demands. The findings from this study
provide important guidance for the design of multimodal combined HCI and CSCW
interfaces and show that multimodal information exchange is a highly effective
means of coordination.

asynchronous communication and to understand the impact of such communications
on understanding and recall in a military context. The goal was to explore how
the design of a multimedia asynchronous communication tool influenced the
understanding and recall of information. 46 ROTC cadets each received a company
Operations Order, and based on that were required to write a platoon OPORD
followed by two recall questions. Half of the cadets received the company OPORD
in a conventional text format that included a static map overlay. The other
half received the OPORD with 4 subsections presented with a multimedia
presentation tool that included synchronized animation and voice narration.
Overall, our findings show that the group that viewed the multimedia
presentation recalled mission critical information 26-47% more often.

%X Aided-adversarial decision-making (AADM) refers to military command and
control decisions in environments in which computerized aids are available to
groups of colocated and distributed decision-makers, and in which there is a
potential for adversarial forces to tamper with and disrupt such aids. It is
therefore necessary to understand the extent to which decision-makers rely on
or use these decision aid systems, and factors affecting that reliance.
Researchers have suggested that trust can affect how much people accept and
rely on increasingly automated systems. Ongoing research and experimentation in
the Center for Multi-source Information Fusion at the University at Buffalo has
been addressing these concerns.

%X Computerized systems are often employed to support control and
decision-making tasks in complex and dynamic environments. Trust or mistrust in
these systems has been demonstrated to significantly affect operator
performance. Consequently, errors of trust or mistrust may compromise system
performance, with potentially disastrous results. Accordingly, trust should be
considered in both the design and operation of human/machine systems. In order
to do so, metrics and methods for the measurement of trust must be developed
along with models of human performance that incorporate trust and related
system variables. Current approaches to trust measurement rely solely on
subjective metrics, which are based on different theoretical concepts of trust
between humans that may not necessarily be as relevant to machines. Although
researchers have been able to establish a relationship between trust and
behavior, these models lack an analytic foundation. Therefore, the purpose of
this research is to develop a quantitative approach that relates trust to
changes in system parameters and severity of errors.

taxonomies exist for classifying human errors, but recent doubts have been
raised as to whether these are actually errors or simply processes involved in
both correct and incorrect decisions. A field test was designed to address some
of these issues. During the field test, three geologists made assessments about
the recent and past environment based on robotically collected data. The
decisions were classified based on previous error taxonomy. Each conclusion was
then checked for accuracy. From this data, the error rate for specific
behaviors could be calculated. The results indicate many of the behaviors
describe earlier as erroneous actually produce correct decisions most of the
time. One behavior is singled out as producing a majority of the errors and
further research is needed to better understand its causes.

%X The development of automated decision support systems requires a real-time
metric of decision quality. Historical links between decision quality and
mission effectiveness suggest that the former is predictive of the latter, and
thus the outcome is what needs to be measured. The purpose of the present paper
is to describe an experiment designed to separate the measurement of decision
quality from that of mission effectiveness. Mission effectiveness and decision
quality were examined using the RoboFlag simulation environment. Environmental
uncertainty and knowledge of the opponent's strategies were manipulated
factorially. Measures of mission effectiveness and decision quality were
obtained along with subjective assessments of situation awareness and workload.
Results are discussed in terms of decision quality as expressed by the tactics
assigned to the operator's robots, and with respect to the mission outcome for
each trial. Further, the number and appropriateness of re-tasking orders and
the effects of unreliable information are addressed.

%X Landmines pose a major military threat as well as a serious humanitarian
problem. The difficulty of detecting buried landmines, especially modern
landmines with minimal metallic content, contributes heavily to the problem.
The two projects described here took a cognitive engineering approach to
improve detection capability via development and implementation of
scientifically principled operator training. Each analyzed and modeled the
landmine detection skills of expert users of two different handheld detection
systems, the PSS-12, the U.S. Army standard equipment, and the PSS-14, an
advanced technology system under development at the time of this work.
Model-based training programs were developed and tested. Both proved highly
effective for developing detection skills, producing the greatest increases in
detection rates against the most challenging targets. The US Army has adopted
and now uses both programs. Results demonstrate the practical utility of
information-processing models of expertise for designing instruction and
developing important human skills.

positive impact on student achievement. However, there is still a great
divergence between what enthusiastic advocates think technology will do for
education and what is actually being accomplished. The primary objective of
this study was to identify the concepts and knowledge that teachers who are
experts in technology integration consider to be essential for successful
technology integration, and to examine how these teachers characterize this
conceptualization in their design and practice of instruction. The conceptual
knowledge of these expert teachers was compared to the knowledge of teachers
who are not technology experts to identify knowledge that should be highlighted
in technology training sessions. Study findings indicate a significant
difference in the knowledge organization of technology experts and novices with
the experts focusing on conceptual issues such as challenges; technology as a
stimulant to change in the learning environment; new opportunities; and effects
of technology integration on the learning environment while novices tended to
focus on lower level procedural skills required to use the technology.

%X Macrocognition is an emerging theoretical and methodological framework for
describing cognitive work as it naturally occurs (Klein, Ross et al., 2003). It
can form the basis for the design of complex cognitive systems that augment,
rather than degrade, proficient performance. This paper presents a method for
using macrocognition during design to anticipate how a complex cognitive system
will impact cognition. We have developed a suite of metrics we call "Cognitive
Impact Metrics" (CIM). Because they highlight the necessary features of and
potential barriers to proficient cognitive performance, these metrics and their
associated measures provide us with a framework in which we can generate
predictions about where and how our system will enhance or hinder our
performance. Application of CIM may be particularly useful in the design of
systems where many potential applications must be culled down to a more
manageable set of candidates.

the constraints so as to bring the system into the goal state and/or prevent it
from entering dangerous states.
   Rasmussen (1995)
   The process of translating the products of cognitive analyses into an
effective interface between workers and a work system has not been articulated
as well as the analytic methods themselves. One can get the impression that the
purpose of a cognitive analysis is to inform the designer about the nature of
the work but that there are no design specifications that flow from the
analysis. Nevertheless, cognitive analysis in general and Cognitive Work
Analysis in particular, is promoted as a design process. Thus, we might inquire
about the design principles that can be used to translate products of a
Cognitive Work Analysis into artifacts that can support human-system
integration. The papers of this session address this issue in different domains
and for different types of applications. The diversity of domains and
applications discussed in this session speaks to the generality of the design
principles that can be used to transition from analytic product to design
artifact.

%X Creating effective graphic displays using Ecological Interface Design (EID)
can be a challenging endeavor. Thus far, there has been little guidance in the
literature to decrease the gap that exists between EID analysis and design.
This paper presents strategies to help bridge this gap. First, a visual
thesaurus provides alternative graphic objects and display formats for showing
single variables, single-variable constraints, multivariate constraints, and
structural constraints (i.e., means-ends, part-whole, and causal/topological
relationships). Second, a number of lessons learned have been identified to
improve efficiency in the process and provide further refinements to the
display design. These strategies can decrease the effort involved in creating
EID displays, but do not completely remove creativity from the design process.
Future research includes further developing generic and industry-specific
graphic forms for the visual thesaurus, while embedding effective design
practices.

deregulated energy markets, providing new layers of uncertainty for human
controllers and new challenges for analysts wishing to understand and support
cognitive work. In this paper we outline some of the challenges encountered
when attempting to describe the work domain of hydroelectric power generation
in a dynamic deregulated electricity market. The market component of the work
domain analysis appears not to be readily amendable to breakdown as a familiar
functional structure. Control task analysis is complicated by the fact that the
human operator is the frontline, real-time, manager of business risk. Different
epochs of planning may require separate functional structures.

provides a structured representation of a physical system under human
supervisory control, and it aids in understanding complex human-machine
interactions. The means-end relationships represented in the abstraction
hierarchy provides a framework for highlighting areas that require
knowledge-based reasoning through mapping processes and functions. These same
abstract mappings can provide tangible insight into interface design
relationships. We provide an example of using the abstraction hierarchy for
this purpose in the development of a decision support tool for a military
command and control interface. Allowing the abstraction hierarchy to inform
interface design provides both an abstract and physical representation of
system functional properties, which is especially critical in conceptualizing
and designing an interface for a complex, time-pressured command and control
domain.

guidance as to the nature of information required by decision makers, which
could be computed through fusion capabilities. This ongoing work thus presents
an example of an integrated cognitive engineering/multisensor fusion
methodology.

%X Thirty-six infantry soldiers executed a series of exercises in a study of
cognitive processes that influence combat tactical performance in urban
terrain. Participants with varied levels of experience conducted nighttime
missions to retrieve a hostage or valuable equipment. Teams were led by a
Platoon Leader and Platoon Sergeant against a defending squad. Data were
obtained from interviews, overhead videos, and questionnaires. Case-based
evidence was collected on impact of site familiarity, military experience, and
use of night-optical devices on performance. Comparisons with previous study
show the effect of a number of variables on perceptions, planning, and tactical
movement. Theoretical frameworks for interpreting data include theories of
Control, Recognition Primed Decision Making, and Multiple Resources. Each of
these account for some aspect of actions observed and the impact of prior
experience, sensory-perceptual clarity, focus of attention, and time pressure
on individual and unit performance.

%X Models developed to study and evaluate innovative organizational structures
predict organizations with an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) coordinator will be superior in performance to organizations without such
a coordinator, especially when information load is high. We examined the effect
of the presence or absence of an ISR coordinator and information load on
mission performance employing a moderate fidelity man-in-the-loop simulation.
Counter to the modeling predictions the organization with an ISR coordinator
was not superior in performance to an organization without an ISR coordinator.
However, analysis of the Email/Intel message traffic showed organizations with
an ISR coordinator to be superior in situation assessment and awareness. When
these latter results are coupled with results showing a steep and significant
improvement curve between trials 1 and 2 for the organization with an ISR
coordinator, we surmise that if teams are given more practice and
familiarization with novel organizations, empirical results will confirm the
model predictions.

%X This paper presents an investigation on the relationship between social
network distances and shared mental models in military command and control
organizations. Previous research has shown that physical distance is the gold
standard for high performance (Olson &amp; Olson, 2000). However, social
network distance may be equally or more important, as social network graphs
inherently take into account the group's context and environment (Krackhart,
1994). We conducted this research on a new 56-member command and control
organization using computer-based collaborative tools as they engaged in a five
day simulation exercise. As military command and control organizations are
difficult to evaluate based on outcome and performance, we chose shared mental
models as a proxy. We hypothesized that in a command and control organization,
social network distance and physical distance are independent of one another.
Further we hypothesized that social network distance would be a predictor of
mental model congruence. We found that there is a very weak positive
correlation between social network distance and physical distance. Further, we
found that, controlling for physical distance, social network distance is a
predictor of mental model congruence. This research validates that high
frequency of communication, mediated by computer based collaborative tools, can
effectively generate shared mental models.

%X This project examines command and control (C2) from a system level viewpoint
to study the way Tactical Operations Centers (TOC's) operate and then
translates those observations into validated computer simulations using a
methodological framework. This approach provides the ability to model TOC
operations in a way that not only includes the individuals, work groups and
teams in it, but also all of the other hardware and software systems and
subsystems and human-system interfaces that comprise it as well as the
facilities and environmental conditions that surround it. Datamining
procedures, including neural network simulation, are used to screen raw data
from naturalistic observation of TOC operations to identify significant
relationships for follow-on analysis. Discrete event simulations then utilize
mathematical relationships from the neural network analysis to describe TOC
operations in a way that can be used for evaluations of new and proposed TOC
Systems. The intent of this project is to develop a framework of techniques and
procedures that are based upon empirical methods but are usable in real world,
uncontrolled environments which can only be approached with naturalistic
observation methods.

exploration and surveillance in variety of environments that are inaccessible
or dangerous for humans. The operation of such vehicles is currently labor
intensive, however, with multiple operators typically required for each vehicle
employed. This panel reports on progress being made in the control of teams of
robotic vehicles by much smaller teams of human operators through the
combination of sophisticated automated control algorithms and human
supervision. The goal is mixed initiative control -- flexible and dynamic
shifting of responsibility between humans and automation as required over the
course of a mission. The panel will discuss cognitive engineering approaches to
the design of a mixed initiative system for multi-vehicle robotic control
including development and experimental testing of prototype interface designs,
workload modeling, and optimal team design. The strengths, limitations, and
potential complementarity of these approaches will be discussed.

%X Many operators within the battlefield find themselves unable to process all
the data presented to them in the limited time available. Data fusion provides
a means of reducing their workload, but can also reduce system transparency.
Thus, either too much or too little fusion can lead to reduced operator
situation awareness. A framework is proposed that incorporates a role for more
sophisticated psychological theory when attempting to understand the
consequences of data fusion technologies on SA. Four key questions are
identified: How should the level of certainty in fused information be
presented? How much does it cost the operator to "drill-down"? To what extent
does data fusion inhibit representation change? Does data fusion ameliorate or
exacerbate the consequences of interruption?

%X Terrain information supplies an important context for ground operations. The
layout of terrain is a determining factor in arraying of forces, both friendly
and enemy, and the structuring of Courses of Action (COAs). For example, key
terrain, such as a bridge over an unfordable river, or terrain that allows
observation of the opposing forces line of advance, is likely to give a big
military advantage to the force that holds it. Combining information about
terrain features with hypotheses about enemy assets can lead to inferences
about possible avenues of approach, areas that provide cover and concealment,
areas that are vulnerable to enemy observation, or choke points. Currently,
intelligence officers manually combine terrain-based information, information
about the tactical significance of certain terrain features as well as
information regarding enemy assets and doctrine to form hypotheses about the
disposition of enemy forces and enemy intent. In this paper, we present a set
of algorithms and tools for automating terrain analysis and compare their
results with those of experienced intelligence analysts.

%X We studied the impact of sensor noise on operators' control performance
using an Ecological Interface Design (EID) display with a representative
thermal-hydraulic process simulation. A number of studies have shown that EID
improves the performance of operators. However, no studies have assessed the
effects of the presence and magnitude of sensor noise on interfaces based on
EID. We hypothesized that as the magnitude of sensor noise would increase,
performance would worsen for both EID and non-EID operators, although
performance of the EID group would not be worse than that of the non-EID group.
Our results show that EID participants performed significantly better than
non-EID participants when dealing with industry representative sensor noise.
When the magnitude of sensor noise was randomly increased, no differences were
observed between the two groups. These results have important consequences for
the applicability of the EID framework in industrial settings.

%X Ecological Interface Design (EID) has been shown to be an effective design
approach for building single-operator interfaces for complex systems. However,
in such systems, operators typically are also a part of a team. An experiment
was conducted to examine the effect of EID on collaboration. Teams of two
operated a feed water simulator, DURESSj, through a series of scenarios given
either the EID interface or the Non-EID interface. It was found that there was
no penalty to using EID, as scenario completion times with the EID interface
were equivalent to the Non-EID interface. Indeed, EID operators demonstrated
evidence of more robust control and reported significantly lower mental
workload especially when dealing with system faults.

%X Interpersonal tensions during long-duration space missions can endanger
mission success by preventing crew cooperation or by inducing errors. Crew
friction in past U.S.-Russian missions drives home the need to understand how
interpersonal stresses precipitate crew breakdowns. Most team research of the
past decade has focused on the cognitive and communication aspects of team
performance. The present study addressed the interpersonal aspects as well. A
computer-based laboratory was created to study team problem solving under
stressful conditions. Twelve teams of four males (aged 25-45) participated in
six 75-minute search and rescue "missions." A path model showed that level of
mission success reflected degree of team collaboration, which was driven by
both group level and individual factors. High levels of team cohesion, a
helpful base-station leader, feelings of acceptance, and provision of
interpersonal support were associated with high levels of collaboration.
Implications of these findings for team composition and training will be
discussed.

%X Because of their intrinsic nature, it is fundamental to consider the
temporal dimension when studying control in dynamic situations. However, the
temporal aspect is often taken for granted and not accounted for in cognitive
or control models. The present study aims to understand the role of temporal
estimation in the control of a dynamic task, within the Contextual Control
Model (COCOM). Particularly, the main objective is to evaluate how time
pressure influences the estimation of available and required time. A dynamic
situation, which includes two sub-tasks, the pursuit of a target and the
avoidance of hostile contacts, is used. Results show that both available and
required estimated times, as well as performance, decrease with increased time
pressure. These findings suggest that when faced with a high level of time
pressure, people adapt their strategies by giving up an offensive mode of
control, in favor of a more defensive one, earlier in the game.

Interactions among four performance dimensions reveal individual differences in
management of cognitive loading. Results also show a clear dynamic balancing
the total load managed by each of 10 dyads, defining opponents as a system,
pushing each other toward cognitive overload and failure. The task's
dimensionality and self-organization generates individualized training. This
research offers points of interest to situation awareness and cognitive

performance under time pressure. Participants were presented with four
simultaneous number-entry tasks. Entry could occur only within a discrete
window of opportunity, represented visually by a target range within a
variable-speed progress bar. Participants could view only one task at a time,
thus performance required scanning and sampling of all four tasks. Sampling
behavior (mouse movements to the vicinity of one of the four tasks) was
manipulated via access effort; blocks of trials presented either a half or full
second lag before a target task would become visible. Participants' performance
was evaluated by the proportion of responses completed within the required
window of opportunity as well as the proportion of a window of opportunity that
elapsed before the onset of a response. Results indicate a decrease in such
performance as a result of display lag manipulation. The potential for the use
of this paradigm in developing predictive measures of performance is discussed.

performance. In this study, the game of Diplomacy was used as a testbed for
applying Brunswik's Lens Model to dynamic environments containing multiple
agents. The game of Diplomacy is based on the diplomatic relationships between
the seven Great Powers of Europe just prior to the start of World War I. In
contrast to many two-player strategic games, the game of Diplomacy includes
seven independent players moving simultaneously, players creating and breaking
alliances, and an historically-based playing board; yet one game can be
completed in a few hours. This study, which was based on archival data,
compares the judgmental policies of seven decision makers from two completed
games. Limitations of this study and possibilities for using Diplomacy variants
for future research are discussed.

demand for "better" coordination (human-system, human-human and system-system)
and the demand for "faster" execution. Driven by these demands, we performed a

improve Systems Engineering efforts. This paper outlines our three challenges
(smaller, better, faster) and reviews three successful applications by other
Cognitive/Systems engineers faced with similar challenges. The applications
employ Computational Cognitive Modeling (to address a demand for smaller),
Cognitive Work Analysis (to address a demand for better) and Goal-Directed Task

practical roadmap for using Cognitive Engineering methods to address Systems

%X The trust placed in automated diagnostic aids by the human operator is one
of the most critical psychological factors that influences operator reliance on
decision support systems. Studies examining the nature of human interaction
with automation have revealed that users have a propensity to apply norms of
human-human interpersonal interaction to their interaction with 'intelligent
machines'. Nevertheless, there exist subtle differences in the manner in which
humans perceive and react to automated aids compared to human teammates. The
present review is focused on comparing the process of trust development in
human-automation teams with that of human-human partnerships, specifically in
the context of dyads that constitute a primary decision maker and either a
human 'advisor'or an intelligent automated decision support system. A
conceptual framework that synthesizes and contrasts the process of trust
development in humans versus automation is proposed. Potential implications of
this research include the improved design of decision support systems by
incorporating features into automated aids that elicit operator responses that
mirror responses in human-human interpersonal interaction.

%X Trust has been identified by previous research as a key determinant of
automation reliance and usage (Lee &amp; Moray, 1992). One factor that may
affect trust and reliance on automation is the reliability of the automation
(Parasuraman 1993; Riley, 1996). The effects of automation reliability and age
on perceived reliability, trust, and reliance were investigated. A driving-like
task was created and the reliability of the automation was manipulated by
generating three levels (100%, 80% and 60%). Automation was present in the form
of a decision support system that indicated the state of the gauges. Results
indicated that high levels of automation reliability lead to increased reliance
and higher subjective levels of trust. There were age-related effects on the
ability to perceive the reliability of the automation and levels of trust where
older adults were more sensitive to the change between 80% and 60% reliability
than the younger adults.

%X This paper describes an adaptive system that "closes the loop" by utilizing
a real-time, directly sensed measure of cognitive state of the human operator.
The Honeywell Augmented Cognition team has developed a Closed Loop Integrated
Prototype (CLIP) of a Communications Scheduler, for application to the U.S.
Army's Future Force Warrior (FFW) program. It is expected that in a highly
networked environment the sheer magnitude of communication traffic could
overwhelm the individual soldier. The CLIP exploits real-time
neurophysiological and physiological measurements of the human operator in
order to create a cognitive state profile, which is used to augment the work
environment to improve human-automation joint performance. An experiment showed
that the Communications Scheduler enabled higher situation awareness and
message comprehension in high workload conditions. Based solely on cognitive
state, the system inferred a subject's message comprehension and repeated
unattended messages in the majority of cases, without yielding an unacceptably
high false alarm rate.

%X Principles of cognitive work analysis were directly applied to the
conceptualization and design of a web-based software tool for investment
analysis. The investment philosophy known as fundamental analysis is concerned
with the intrinsic value of a company compared with its stock price. The
means-end abstraction hierarchy was critical in characterizing the work domain
of the fundamental analyst and allowed an ecological interface on the domain to
be constructed. This resulted in a patentable software product which is now on
the market.

%X When analyzing field trials to examine command and control, there is a great
need for means of presenting, coordinating, exploring and analyzing large
amounts of data captured from multiple sources. The products of this analysis
include insights, reflections, questions, and hypotheses. From an
epistemological point of view, it is crucial to maintain a solid chain of
reasoning from the data captured in the field, through the presentation formats
used in the analysis process, and to the results of the analysis delivered to
the clients. To this end, we present the Metadata Workbench, which manages
metadata in command and control analysis. This analysis tool embeds metadata in
contextual information, coordinates them in time, and links them to the
supporting data. Using the tool, multiple analysts, experts, and researchers
can exchange comments on both data and metadata in a collaborative and
explorative investigation of a complex scenario. The tool is implemented as a
component in the Mind framework and is demonstrated using data from distributed
tactical operations.

%X This study evaluates the differences in user information acquired from
scenario-based versus non scenario-based knowledge elicitation for the design
of 911 dispatch simulations. During the non-scenario condition, participants
answered probe questions concerning their work activities and emergency
response procedures. During the scenario-based condition, participants were
presented with an emergency scenario and described the necessary steps required
to respond to the situation. Preliminary analysis implies that information
derived from non scenario-based knowledge elicitation may focus more upon the
defined protocols of workgroups whereas information gathered from
scenario-based knowledge elicitation may be more concerned with procedures and
interactions that are unique to a certain workgroup. Results suggest that the
use of scenario-based knowledge elicitation is more likely to allow designers
to tailor simulations that conform to the unique culture of an emergency
dispatch center workgroup than non scenario-based knowledge elicitation.

%X This paper reports on an experiment conducted to measure collaboration tool
usage and shared mental models in Army Command and Control. Several teams of
soldiers participated in a two-week simulation experiment. During the
simulation, the run was stopped and participants completed a 5-minuted on-line
questionnaire in which they were asked to rate their workload and other
teammates workload as well as provide information on the collaboration tools
used during the last hour of the exercise. Shared mental models was measured
using congruency between each person's rating of their own workload and their
teammates perception of their workload. Overall, using the same collaboration
tool, irrespective of the tool type, to communicate between team members lead
to higher shared mental models.

%X The research reported here was conducted to explore the efficacy of using
the military After Action Review (AAR) process as a data collection
methodology. During a weeklong U.S. Army experiment, we investigated, by means
of a periodically administered questionnaire and an end-of-day log, the
interactions participants reported having with other team members. When
comparing the results of these tools, we found strong tendencies of the primacy
and recency effects. These findings are important to researchers working in
military command and control experimentation settings where the AAR is a
commonly used data collection mechanism. This paper identifies data collection
practices that can help avoid potential difficulties when using end-of-day
retrospective reports as an experimental methodology.

%X Observations are frequently used to examine naturally occurring behavior.
The researchers used this tool to determine what types of behaviors crowds
exhibited and the degree of aggression expressed by the crowds. Footage of the
1999 WTO protest in Seattle was examined and coded for 55 behaviors. Of the
observed behaviors standing on an elevated platform, chanting, yelling and
shouting, and raising flags were the most frequent behaviors. Overall, most of
the action was moderately aggressive. Highly aggressive behaviors such as
fighting and attacking police officers composed only 1% of the observed
behaviors. A similar observation was conducted of an anti-war protest in New
York. This observation found comparable results of prevalent nonviolent
behaviors. The findings from these studies along with those obtained from
interviews of returning military officers will be used to develop a model for
simulation of crowd behaviors.

examined. 13 participants were asked to detect a handgun which was shown
embedded in an x-ray image similar to what a baggage screener would see. The
weapon was shown to the participant in 8 different rotations for 2 different
perspectives (facing right or left for each rotation). The results of the
experiment produced the classic inverted V response time function curve. The
data suggest that mental rotation can be applied to complex stimuli found in
detection task such as the airport security domain.

insight into the unique domain of intelligence analysts, how intelligence
analysts view this domain, and how this domain can be replicated in a
controlled simulation environment in which innovative tools and procedures can
be empirically tested. Details of two comprehensive knowledge elicitation
sessions involving intelligence analysts are provided as an example of using
the Advanced Knowledge Acquisition and Design (AKADAM) methodology to obtain
contextually relevant information for use in developing a homeland
defense-oriented simulation/experimental task. Several distinctive
characteristics of intelligence analyst functionality were discovered,
including the multi-source integration of relevant information, complex
cognitive analysis, and team collaboration in decision-making. Additional
themes such as social interaction and the limitations of current analysis tools
were identified.

%X This paper describes a scaled-world simulation developed to conduct
empirical research on team cognition, communication, and decision-making within
a distributed environment. The NeoCITIES simulation is an advancement of the
CITIES task, which was designed to study group decision-making within a
command, control, and communications (C) setting (Wellens &amp; Ergener, 1988).
Studying group decision-making is a two-fold problem involving team cognition
and team communication. According to McNeese (2003), team cognition is
constructed through distributed and emerging activities via several sources. A
majority of studies examining distributed decision-making have involved
militaristic, battlefield engagement, or urban warfare settings. In that same
spirit, NeoCITIES was designed for emergency crisis management teams undergoing
terrorist attacks within a college-town. Thus, NeoCITIES is a new and
operationally relevant scaled world that emulates the complexities and emergent
decision-making attributes resident in a 9/11-type of terrorist scenario.
Through the use of NeoCITIES, we anticipate the assessment of a number of
cognitive tools to support distributed cognition (e.g., problem-based
decomposition) as well as advancing adaptive intelligent interfaces.

%X Detecting deception is an important skill, yet reviews of the psychological
literature on the detection of deception typically find accuracy rates between
45 and 60% (cf., DePaulo &amp; Friedman, 1998). A computerized text analysis,
the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), offers one technological solution.
Newman et al. (2003) used the LIWC to detect deception in five studies.
Deceptive communications were characterized by fewer first person singular
pronouns, third person pronouns, and more negative emotion words. In this
study, 49 students delivered a deceitful and a truthful communication regarding
their preference for music. Results from the 2 (importance of music in
participants' life: high or low) x 3 (communication medium: type, write, or
talk) x 2 (communication type: lie or truth) design indicated that
technological tools may be useful in detecting deception; however,
communication medium and topic importance mediate the relationship.

%X It has been previously shown that there is a relationship between level of
metacognitive ability and estimation of ability for largely verbally-based
tasks; those with lessened facility for the task tend to overestimate their
aptitude relative to their peers (Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999). This study
examines this effect for a task of mechanical ability, where subjects (n = 69)
were given an abbreviated Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test (BMCT) to
establish a level of competency. Participants were then asked to estimate a
grade for their performance, as well as the relationship between their
hypothetical grade, and the grades of others. Participants then explained the
solution to one of the problems, and their explanations were coded for degree
of bias towards confirmation versus disconfirmation. Females on the high and
low ends of skill were more likely to use a confirmatory approach when there
was a discrepancy between Perceived Relative Competence, and Actual Competence.

%X This study continues research from McNeese (2000) and was designed to
examine the effects of hidden knowledge profiles on perceptually anchored team
cognition and knowledge transfer in distributed teams. Previous work showed
that individuals in perceptually anchored distributed teams were able to
quickly access applicable knowledge, then transfer that knowledge to answer
similarly situated problems. Perceptual anchors provide the basis for
formulating team mental models, which can be used to assess situations and
resolve differences in individual, unique knowledge. In the present experiment,
it was again hypothesized that individuals working in perceptually anchored
distributed teams would be better able to transfer knowledge, than teams
without anchors. It was also hypothesized that perceptually anchored
distributed teams would be better able to share uniquely held information, make
better decisions, identify information discrepancies, and overcome the presence
of hidden knowledge profiles better than non-perceptually anchored teams.
Preliminary findings are discussed.

requirements, the application of SA-oriented design principles, and the
measurement of SA during design evaluation. The Designer's Situation Awareness
Toolkit (DeSAT) provides support to the designer for each phase of this process
through both tutorials and application specific tools. The tutorials cover the
Goal Directed Task Analysis (GDTA) methodology for delineating SA requirements,
SA oriented design principles, and the Situation Awareness Global Assessment
Technique (SAGAT) methodology. The application specific tools include a tool
for documenting GDTAs, a Checklist tool to assist designers in evaluating how
well a design concept has met the relevant SA requirements, a Design Guidance
application, and a tool for creating and administering SAGAT queries (Super
SAGAT). Through these tools, DeSAT provides a comprehensive approach for
improving the designer's ability to create designs based on sound SA oriented
design principles.

%X Technologists and human factors practitioners tend to approach the
measurement of situation awareness from different perspectives. Technologists
compare the difference between the data available in the environment with what
has been detected by the sensors built into a system. Human factors
practitioners focus on perception and cognition to the exclusion of the
technological parts of the system. The authors propose a Dynamic Model of
Situated Cognition and use it as a framework for analyzing both the
technological and human aspects of a complex system. They employ a process
tracing method in the analysis of a high fidelity military command and control
(C2) simulation. Their results indicate that the model and the process tracing
method are effective ways in which to investigate the development of situated
cognition in complex systems. In addition, their results have important
implications for designers of software, hardware, and training systems.

%X This paper concerns human factors that might impact the success of future
maritime defense operations. In such operations, extensive networking is likely
to allow large amounts of information to be shared between headquarters, ships,
submarines and aircraft. Military planners anticipate that this will enhance
situation awareness for their forces. Researchers at Australia's Defence
Science and Technology Organisation are studying this issue using a synthetic
environment (a game play simulation involving a manned virtual submarine
operating within a computer generated scenario). The initial focus of this work
has been to identify appropriate metrics with which to monitor performance.
Here we present an attempt to employ objective situation awareness metrics.
Despite some technical problems, a number of interesting findings suggest that
there may be a trade off between the accuracy of operator understanding and the
size of the field of view of networked sensors.

%X It is widely recognized that Situation Awareness, SA, provides the
foundation for decision making and action in numerous domains. As such, this
research focused on developing a PC-based tool for training SA in Infantry
Platoon Leaders. This Infantry Situation Awareness Training (ISAT) program
developed two modules targeted at enhancing SA in Infantry Platoon Leaders. The
SA Planner teaches time management and task prioritization skills, while the SA
Trainer focuses more globally on developing knowledge bases and understanding
the information requirements necessary to develop SA. Validation testing was
conducted by giving the SA Trainer to a group of Royal Norwegian Naval cadets
prior to combat fatigue exercises. Results suggested possible performance
differences between cadets trained with the tool and those who were not.
Additionally, trained cadets indicated that they expended more mental effort
predicting what would happen next (level 3 SA) and determining how to best meet
their mission goals.

the concept of team cognition. Important postulates based on this perspective
include a division of labor based on the elements of information involved in
performing a team task, as well as the notion of coordination among information
elements occurring through elemental couplings via a coupling medium. These
features of our perspective are outlined, with the important notion of
mediational means receiving the most attention. The dynamics of discourse-based
mediation are considered in light of empirical data involving changes in the
content of discourse over time in an uninhabited air vehicle reconnaissance
task.

%X As part of a cognitive task analysis performed in the initial design stage
of developing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations center, we used
Pathfinder to generate communication networks based on four subject matter
experts' (SMEs') understanding of the typical communications that occur in
different task scenarios (i.e., a strike operation versus a non-strike
operation). SMEs provided ratings on three dimensions of communication for each
pair of ten team members. Dimensions were 1) importance, 2) volume, and 3)
diversity of communications. We developed two methods for merging the ratings
of importance and volume into a single network in order to simultaneously
represent both dimensions. This application of Pathfinder has allowed us to 1)
quantify the extent to which the SMEs conceptualize communications in the same
way and 2) generate surrogate communication networks when it is impossible to
monitor actual communications.

%X Team cognition can be observed in the flow of communications among team
members. This is shown in the context of a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle
ground control station. Automatic measures of low-level team communication flow
were used to assess high-level constructs of team cognition. Measures show
support for the expected results of manipulations in this task. Co-location and
channel degradation effects were successfully predicted by CHUMS, ProNet, and a
cross-correlation function-based Dominance measure. Results grant concurrent
validity to the measures, and highlight substantive effects of the
manipulations. In particular, in geographically distributed teams,
communication patterns are less stable, and the route planner exerts less
communicative influence. Some co-location effects drop with task experience.
During a mission containing a five-minute one-way communication channel cut,
all teams communicate more like distributed teams, and team members do create
alternate pathways to retain information flow.

%X Studies of a single operator controlling multiple robots were designed (1)
to identify problems caused by perceptual and cognitive factors and (2) to
propose interface concepts to reduce the problems. The studies used innovative
techniques at extremely low cost. Existing artifacts, i.e.,
commercially-available video games played over local area networks, provided a
rich source of data on control of one or multiple semi-autonomous entities with
a minimum of development. Psychological theories regarding various attributes
of robotic operation, including perception, navigation, motion control, and
information display are embedded in such artifacts. Custom scenarios involving
multiple robots controlled by a single operator were developed to facilitate
switching between tasks and, in some cases, cooperative use of the multiple
robots. Findings include data on navigation difficulty, task switching
strategies, mode errors, and perceptual confusion regarding multiple
viewpoints.

%X Robots are gaining acceptance as team members in complex task completion,
though they must be directed or closely supervised by human operators.
Effective interaction between operators and robots is dependent upon the
operator's ability to develop situation awareness on the robot and environment.
In teleoperation this requires the effective distribution of attention between
remote activities and the local controls and interfaces. Limitations in
attentional resources can limit SA on one or the other place, resulting in
overall decreased system performance. We present observations made at a
robot-assisted search and rescue exercise to describe common SA problems in
vehicle control. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction and the role of
SA in search operations. Key SA concerns observed and discussed include
difficulties in robot localization, inadequate support for team operations and
shared SA, workload in the visually demanding task, and poor integration of
data at the interface.

approaches that may inform and support the design of temporal aspects of
interactive systems. Time Design is an emerging research and development domain
that emphasizes the functional, causal role of time in human control behavior.
It draws on a diverse literature on time in cognitive psychology,
psychophysics, sociology, computer science, engineering, Human Factors and HCI.
Relevant research domains include heuristics and biases in temporal decisions,
temporal aspects of human-automation interaction, planning and scheduling,
visualisation of temporal information, and the timing of alarms and

%X Natural language understanding technology has reached a level of
sophistication where it can be profitably employed in interactive voice
response systems in telephony. This paper describes a call routing application,
where callers state a request in unconstrained, natural speech. The system then
routes the call to the correct destination system or attendant. If there is a
problem in understanding, then the caller must be re-prompted. This paper looks
at two cases of re-prompting in the second turn of dialog based on the caller's
response in the first turn: (a) when a caller's initial request is to speak to
a real person instead of stating the reason for their call, and (b) when
callers are too vague in their initial response. A strategy of conversational
re-prompting is introduced which fits into the greater naturalness of the
dialog, and, we show, increases the performance of the system in terms of
successful fulfillment of user requests.

the company; 3) Selecting voices for evaluation in the research study; 4)
Designing and carrying out the research; and 5) Determining the preferred voice
based on results of the study. Of five voices that were evaluated, a number of
independent sources of data pointed to one of the voices as the preferred

size of the control interface. Two studies examined whether tactile cues might
facilitate dialing on small cellular phone keypads. The first study, a
questionnaire administered to 289 individuals, suggested that people believe
that tactile cues can benefit users of cellular phones. The second study, an
experiment comparing dialing performance with vision precluded between two
keypad-types (textured keys and smooth-keys), showed that performance in the
former condition was better than that latter. Implications for cellular phone
keypad designs are offered.

%X Navigating through menu structures to access functions and search for
information on small displays in cellular phones and other handheld devices is
difficult. Visual momentum is a display technique that may help users integrate
information across successive displays, and thus improve navigation performance
for devices with small screens. This study investigated the effects of visual
momentum and menu structure on the learnability of menus on small displays.
Learnability was assessed using a trials-to-mastery measure. Mastery criteria
regarding search time and errors were set during a pilot study and the number
of trials it took for participants to meet these criteria during the Main
Experiment were recorded. It was found that providing preview information in
the display did not help users learn to navigate through hierarchical menus,
while providing motion in the display did help.

%X This paper illustrates how MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Technique) can be
used to assess the potential utility of communication media for end-users.
Using ordinary telephony and face-to-face communication as reference media the
utility of videoconferencing was assessed in three different communication
tasks. The results showed that videoconferencing was generally more useful than
telephony and less useful than face-to-face communication, and also that these
differences depend on the specific nature of the communication activity. For
instance, telephony was the best medium when it was necessary to lie. Such
findings can be used as a basis for recommending which media are best suited
for which aims and activities. A significant strength of the method is that it
can quantify and combine not only how suitable a communication medium is for a
particular purpose or activity, but also how important that purpose or activity
is for the end-user.

will undoubtedly be affected by the shift toward network-centric warfare (NCW),
a concept of operations that relies upon a sophisticated information technology
infrastructure comprising sensor, information, and engagement grids. It will be
achieved through heightened shared situation awareness and real-time
collaboration, which will require effective communication between coalition
forces throughout the command chain. The present study provides an initial
evaluation of communication effectiveness of persons from English-speaking
countries with different dialects. In addition, an evaluation of collaborative
interface technology for future ABM operations is presented. Together, these
data provide an initial step in the characterization of communication
challenges in future coalition operations and an assessment of the technologies
that may be required to effectively share information and situation awareness
in future ABM operations.

%X Speech-enabled interfaces are proving to be an effective option for
service-center call routing applications. However, the effectiveness of a call
routing application is dependent upon the speech recognizer correctly
interpreting the caller's utterance. One approach to increase the clarity and
routability of callers' initial requests is to provide examples within an
open-ended prompt to provide context and guide caller's speaking behavior. Two
experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of including examples in
the opening prompt for a natural language call routing application. In both
experiments, callers were asked to say the purpose of their call with an
open-ended prompt. Half of the caller's were presented a prompt that contained
examples, and half of the callers were presented with a prompt that did not
contain examples. The results showed an advantage for the use of examples in
terms of the percentage of routable caller utterances. The design implications
for natural language prompts are discussed.

%X An experiment explored the effect of Music Choice and Announcement Duration
on the subjective wait time for a call center hold queue. Participants placed
calls to a simulated call center and were placed "on hold." When participants
were allowed to choose the type of music they listened to while on hold, they
reported higher satisfaction with the wait time compared to a condition in
which the callers had no control over the music type. There was also a
significant effect for the hold queue announcement duration. The hold queue
announcement is a brief message that informs caller that they are being placed
on hold. The 'long' announcement resulted in more accurate estimations of
on-hold wait time compared to the 'short' announcement which resulted in
significant overestimation. These findings demonstrate potentially useful
design methods for call centers to manage customer dissatisfaction due to hold
queue delays.

%X The present display technology transition in computing from CRT to LCD
monitors poses many human factors research questions. In this study, computer
monitor technologies were compared, using two CRT and two active-matrix LCD
monitors under four lighting levels. Ten participants took part in a 4x4
within-subjects experimental design where they performed word processing, data
entry, and web-browsing tasks. Results show that one of the LCD monitors was
associated with poorer performance on the word processing task than an
equivalent grouping of the other three monitors. Thus, it is concluded that
active-matrix LCD monitors are capable of equitable performance with the
traditional CRT technology, but it is uncertain whether the technologies
themselves are equivalent. Lighting was another significant effect, with the
dark (0 lux) and very bright (1200 lux) conditions causing poorer performance.
There was no interactive effect between monitors and lighting. The battery of
tasks used in this study, representative of office work, is also discussed.

%X This study explored the effect of displaying sideways navigation and content
in graphical applications for handheld devices. Because these devices can be
easily rotated during use, alternate orientations for screen elements may be
acceptable. Participants performed tasks on prototypes emulating a wireless
brokerage application presented on a Pocket PC handheld device. The prototypes
differed in the orientation of the main navigation bar (top, sideways-left,
sideways-right). Within each navigation condition, two prototypes displayed
charts and tables in either a standard or sideways orientation. Results
indicated that, as a function of navigation or chart and table orientation,
there were no significant differences in task completion, time on task, number
of screens navigated during tasks, or mean responses to a subjective evaluation
questionnaire. These findings suggest that alternate presentations of
navigation and content elements do not have a detrimental effect on the
usability of handheld applications.

%X The MOS-X is a recently-developed questionnaire used to evaluate the quality
of artificial speech. In this experiment, participants listened to audio files
produced by concatenative text-to-speech voices for the purpose of assessing
the effect of Speaker and Sampling Rate on MOS-X ratings. The concatenative
voices were developed from recordings of three different human speakers (code
named AF, AM, and B) and produced using two different sampling rates (8 kHz and
22 kHz). Six independent groups of raters participated, one group for each
combination of speaker and sampling rate. Analyses of variance indicated a
significant main effect of Voice, but no significant main effect of Sampling
Rate and no significant Voice by Sampling Rate interaction. The results
indicate that independent groups of raters are sensitive to speaker differences
in concatenative text-to-speech (TTS) voices, but not to differences in these
sampling rates.

audio-visual displays. Audio is powerful in a peripheral display due to its
unobtrusive and omni-directional nature. This study examined the creation and
usability of peripheral auditory displays or 'soundscapes' composed of
ecological sounds. A system was created for dynamically generating soundscapes
from a data source according to a threshold-based model. In this model, a
percentage change in the data is mapped to an ecological sound that is played
whenever that threshold has been met or exceeded. The system allows for the
creation of soundscapes of arbitrary complexity, providing mechanisms for
fading, relative gain, and random timing. With the system, a reference
soundscape was developed for sonifying the stock market. This display was then
presented to stock trader test participants as part of a usability evaluation.

%X Past studies have shown that touchscreen display angles other than those
that perpendicularly bisect the operator's line of sight cause the operator to
touch slightly below the target. The amount of bias created from this
misjudgment fluctuates according to the target's position on the screen.
Additionally, the percentage of touches that activate a specific target varies
according to the size of the tactual recognition field. This study sought to
match three square tactual recognition field sizes with the amount of touch
bias occurring in each location. The results showed that although bias differed
according to location, the tactual recognition fields did not vary enough in
size, nor were they large enough to find a significant difference between them
in the number of touches captured according to the location of the target. The
tactual recognition field that optimally captures responses varies in size over
display position and is non-square in shape.

efficiency for 20 experienced users of force- (trackpoint) and motion-input
(touchpad) devices in clicking and dragging tasks. Beyond task difficulty the
impact of input modality, practice, and task type was investigated. On the one
hand, the results support Fitts' law since performance data of both input
devices fitted satisfyingly with Fitts' predictions. Motion-input was found to
be very robust towards task difficulty, especially in dragging tasks. On the
other hand, the results were incompatible to Fitts' assumptions as target size
and distance did not equally contribute to task difficulty but rather target
size was a stronger contributor. Thus, the effective task difficulty in small
targets was notably underestimated. For user-friendly interfaces, button widths
of over 0.5 cm should be provided, especially when distances farther than 7.5
cm are inevitable.

text, and that Fitts' Law methods do not accurately account for or predict
values including cognitive load or skill transfer.

notebook name, indicated 100% selection accuracy. In a second experiment, the
results indicated that with as little as 1.1 mm per notebook name, users could
select notebook names with 100% accuracy. A third experiment evaluated page
selection accuracy for 55- and 99-page slots using a 73 mm slot (0.74 mm per
page for 99 pages). Participants in the 55-page condition used a single-page
advance control to reach target pages greater than 55. Considering all targets,
participants were slightly but consistently less accurate with the 99-page
slots, but their within-slot selection accuracies were equal. All participants
preferred the 99-page slot due to the inconvenience of acquiring pages greater
than 55 with the single-page advance control.

develop text-entry methods that can accommodate a variety of devices, cultures,

device developed for mobile text-entry in Chinese. The device is a chorded
keyboard system on which text is entered in Chinese using the pinyin system.
Participants trained with the device for 10, 1-hour sessions. Their text-entry
rates and their rate of input for individual chords were measured after each
session. The Power Law of Practice was used to predict input rates after 100
hours of training. Predicted input rates approximate 16 characters per minute,
approaching pinyin input rates on conventional keyboards. Input rates for
individual chords were also measured in order that future iterations of the
software may associate the most commonly used characters with the
fastest-to-execute chords. The study also suggests several potential future
improvements to the OHAI system, such as augmenting the software with an
autocompletion system.

with occlusion of specific nodes. Eye tracking confirmed that concentric rings
are used while searching nodes within the same level. Subjective assessments
were quite positive, compared with presently-used enterprise sales network

%X Traditional usability metrics (accuracy and reaction time) were combined
with eye movement patterns to study button placement and highlighting in dialog
boxes. Participants made button-click responses based on the contents of the
dialog box text. Traditional measures and eye movement patterns yielded
different results: Reaction time analyses suggested placing the correct button
to the left; eye movement patterns suggested placing the correct button on the
right. This study demonstrated that eye movements are a rich source of
information for usability research, provided theoretical guidelines for future
research, and showed the strengths and weaknesses of eye tracking in comparison
to more traditional usability metrics. In addition, it provided empirical
support for eye movement heuristics that are often implemented in visual
interface design, showing that the search patterns for dialog boxes follow a
reading pattern.

%X Previous research (Lane, Napier, Peres, &amp; Sandor, in press) has shown
that despite the fact that it typically takes half as much time to issue a
command to a computer application using that command's keyboard shortcut, most
people issue a particular command by clicking an icon on a toolbar or by
selecting the command from a pull-down menu. This study examined reasons why
that might be the case with a web survey that focused on demographic
characteristics of people who do and do not use keyboard shortcuts, as well as
social factors of computer use that might influence use of keyboard shortcuts.
Participants' shortcut usage was influenced by social factors, such as working
in an environment with other shortcut users and experiential factors, primarily
the hours spent using a computer per week.

%X The purpose of this research was to develop a new approach to symbol
development that used an interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) algorithm
to expand end-user participation in the design process. IEC iteratively employs
subjective assessment and parameter recombination to create a population of
anthropomorphic symbols that "evolve" based on user input. Three design groups,
comprised of both student and industrial subjects, used the IEC algorithm to
develop 60 symbols for awkward posture, an risk factor for work-related
musculoskeletal disorders. Factor analysis was used to reduce the nine design
parameters (i.e., limb angles) to a three-factor structure. Analysis of
variance revealed that student generated symbols differed significantly from
those created by industrial participants in terms of two of the three factor
scores. Actual or potential applications of this research include a new
approach to creating symbols that encourages end-user input into their design.

%X Search engines have the potential to assist users in a variety of
information retrieval tasks. Unfortunately, field studies show that they
consistently fail to meet the usability goals of effective and efficient
performance. Two of the primary drawbacks are that users do not apply correct
semantic logic and syntax in their queries. This study investigates the use of
targeted search hints, a form of in-line help, to improve query construction.
The results show that search hints can improve performance, but with
interactions that designers must consider. Some hints increase the time
required to construct queries. Compound hints can also lead to reduced
performance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

%X Two pen mouse designs were compared with a conventional mouse design in a
laboratory experiment. Sixteen Ss (8 men; 8 women) used each of the mice to
perform a series of tasks. Wrist posture was measured while holding each mouse.
Results show the pen mice decreased ulnar deviation and wrist pronation, the
latter being more reduced for women. However, wrist extension was lowest for
the conventional mouse. No significant differences in task performance were
found between the 3 designs that were tested. Ss reported that the conventional
mouse was easier to use than the pen mice and just over half of the Ss
preferred this design. A longer-term study is warranted.

%X Over the past decade, indirect pointing with a mouse has become a
fundamental part of the GUI environment. In that regard research has used
Fitts' law to measure speed and accuracy of the human-motor system when using
input devices. Other studies have found that angle of approach also affects
performance. However, most such analyses have not considered control-display
gain as a factor. The present study found that gain interacted with angle of
approach, amplitude, and target size on movement time. Fitts' law remained an
effective predictor of movement time across all conditions; however, less
variance was accounted for in the higher control-display gain conditions. Based
on these results, recommendations are given for GUI design.

feedback would improve their performance on the Web. The study examined the
effects on performance of older users completing tasks on a prototype website
using both a normal mouse and a mouse that provides haptic, or tactile,
feedback. A total of 18 participants with low and high web experience took part
in this experiment. These participants varied in age from 55 to 77 years. There
was no correlation between age and level of experience with the Web.
Performance was measured using task duration and task success. Results indicate
an improvement in performance for users with less Web experience using the

%X A systematic evaluation of child and adult anthropometry was carried out in
order to determine anthropometric differences that may impact the design of
computer input devices. Hand strength and the anthropometric measurements of
shoulder breadth, hand length, hand breadth and finger width were compared
among adults and 5, 10 and 14-year-old children. On average, children were 60%
the size of adults at age 5 and 86% the size by age 14. The proportional size
difference was relatively constant across the anthropometric measurements
analyzed. At age 5, there was virtually no overlap in the size distribution
between adults and children; by age 10, about 20% of the adult and child
population were the same size, and by age 14, about 60% of the adult and child
population were similar in size. When comparing hand strength, on average
adults were five times stronger than 5-year-old children. The 5-fold strength
difference and lack of overlap in the size distributions between young children
and adults may have some bearing on the appropriateness of children using adult
size devices when they start to use computers in schools.

%X Placing menus against the edge of the screen reduces selection times because
it creates an impenetrable border between the menu and the edge of the screen
that the mouse cursor cannot penetrate (Walker, Smelcer, &amp; Nilsen, 1991).
The presence of the impenetrable border changes how users move the mouse, so
that selection times quicken compared to menus with a penetrable border.
However, it is not readily apparent whether or not GUI users could realize the
advantages of impenetrable borders without instruction. The purpose of this
experiment was to assess whether or not users would discover the benefits of
impenetrable borders spontaneously. Results suggest that only 50% of
participants who were unaware of the presence of the impenetrable border
actually detected it. Additionally, with practice participants who were
successful at detecting the impenetrable border selected the targets as quickly
as participants who received full instruction concerning the benefits of
impenetrable borders.

%X This paper compares the strategies used by experts and novices in
troubleshooting complex systems. As an example, we consider the case of
establishing an Internet connection. The complexity of modern systems, such as
the Internet, makes troubleshooting a very difficult task. Because many users
experiencing trouble turn to the call-center, traffic loads are always heavy.
This loads cost the company dearly to maintain adequate user support quality.
We need to incorporate effective approaches to tackling the problems into
self-service systems. Moreover, such knowledge is useful for FAQ design and
creating response methods for call-center agents that can well support the
troubleshooting process. Both are expected to greatly reduce call-center loads.
To elucidate effective troubleshooting techniques, we compare the
troubleshooting strategies of novices to those of experts. As a result, we
showed that given an initial goal constraint, the experts try to eliminate
modules unambiguously and so find the fault while novices remain stuck with
their first guess.

%X Computers are increasingly becoming a part of society's everyday life and
can cause a wide variety of impacts when they fail. For example, during a
military exercise, Expeditionary Force Experiment (EFX) 98, it was found that
operators were losing hours of work and data because they were unaware that
essential systems had failed. This illustrated the need for a system that
provided system situation awareness (SA) to the operator that rapidly
disseminated information and responded quickly to connectivity and system
failures. To fulfill this need, we created the Advanced Technology Master
Caution Panel (ATMCP); analogous to an aircraft master caution panel. This
system offers a unique approach to providing system SA that allows the
operators to workaround system failures by mapping information technology (IT)
resources to crew tasks as a method of monitoring task status. ATMCP offers
unlimited flexibility and can be applied to multiple domain areas.

of multiple vehicle teams with humans in the loop. This work analyzed the
RoboFlag version 2.0 interface to identify existing issues with the users'
Situational Awareness (SA). The existing interface for RoboFlag was modified to
create two new interfaces. The first interface focused on improved Situation
Awareness. A user evaluation was conducted to determine if the new interfaces
improved the users' SA over the original interface. Twenty-four participants
completed the evaluation. This paper reports the design of the task
environment, the evaluation method, and the statistical analysis. The results
indicate that both new interfaces provide improved SA over the RoboFlag version

%X Previous research demonstrated that interface elements could be selected
faster when placed against the edge of the screen. Doing so creates an
impenetrable border between the element and the edge of the screen that the
mouse cursor cannot penetrate. This changes how users move the mouse, so that
selection quickens. This study investigated the effect of practice on the
acquisition of targets with and without impenetrable borders. Ten participants
selected targets that varied in Target Type (with or without impenetrable
borders), and Distance (.5, 3.5, 6.5, 9.5, and 12.5 cm) across five Practice
Sessions. The results confirmed that targets with impenetrable borders were
selected faster than targets without impenetrable borders and that participants
demonstrated consistent reductions in selection time over sessions, regardless
of the target type. In addition, excessive practice was not necessary to
demonstrate target type differences; thus the advantage of having impenetrable
borders seems to be relatively instantaneous.

the functionality of a keyboard and a mouse into one device. The CombiMouse
consists of two units, much like a split-keyboard, in which the left hand unit
(LHU) is a stationary device with keys that are typically used by the left
hand, while the right hand unit (RHU) contains keys typically used by the right
hand, but is mobile and serves as a mouse. Preliminary results of first-time
usage indicate the device to be very promising. Performance was shown to be
just as efficient as the traditional mouse and significantly more efficient
than the track ball. Typing performance was not as fast as the traditional
keyboard; however, the participants showed improvement with more usage of the

society, from cellular phones and personal digital assistants to automated
teller machines to highly advanced systems in aviation and industrial
operations. Still, the fundamental element for the successful operation of
these products and systems is a well designed interface between humans and
technology. To address this issue, this paper seeks to highlight how Ebert's
(1994) four approaches to HCI design (ethnographic/anthropomorphic, cognitive,
predictive modeling, empirical) can be effectively integrated to develop better
interfaces between humans and society's complex systems. First, a brief
overview of these approaches will be presented, emphasizing how the outcomes of
one approach can inform the implementation of the next approach. Then, a
step-by-step analysis of a hypothetical task performed using an automated
postal machine will serve to illustrate the process of applying these
approaches to evaluating an automated system interface.

data, need to be properly stored in data warehouses and analyzed to benefit
health care. From a multidisciplinary perspective, Bioinformatics addresses
research, development and application of computational tools and approaches for
analyzing and thus expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral and

bioinformatics researchers at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. Two of the
Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA) techniques, "Task Diagram Interview" and
"Knowledge Audit Interview," were integrated with questionnaire surveys and

%X Learning curves for e-commerce data management tasks were computed to assess
UI efficiency. Participants were asked to update product information using an
e-commerce data management tool. Mean time on task over 20 trials of the same
task was fit using a power function. Learning curves of 92.7% to 97.6% were
found for two product update tasks. The results obtained indicate that making
efficiency judgments based on the first few trials will produce higher learning
coefficients that actually exist, and suggest that practitioners should not
assume that time on task will always decrease significantly with increased
practice. It also shows how properties of learning curves can help in the
analysis of UI efficiency.

%X The usability profession has seen success in industry and academia, as well
as recognition in the popular press. However, inconsistent measurement,
unreliable problem identification, inappropriate high-level goals, and a lack
of valid metrics highlight recent usability literature. Rather than support or
refute these findings, we offer a research introspection that we hope
contributes to all of these issues by improving our basic understanding of the
construct of usability. A Usability Concept Survey (UCS) containing 64
potential usability characteristics was created and administered to 46 users
who rated how integral each characteristic was to usability. Multivariate
analyses of these user perceptions were used to construct: 1) a taxonomy of
usability to classify usability characteristics, 2) data-driven general
dimensions of usability, 3) a map of usability space showing specific usability
characteristics within the general dimensions; and, 4) a definition of
usability. We believe this better understanding of the construct of usability
can contribute directly to improving usability objectives, measures, and
practice.

%X Usability measures typically focus on actual user experiences while largely
ignoring the impact of user expectations. User expectations provide insight
into overall usability, user satisfaction, and priority of usability problems.
Beyond test results, communicating user expectations can offset the negative
connotation many development teams have of usability by showing examples where
expectations are exceeded. This paper describes the expected Usability
Magnitude Estimation (UME) method to assess user expectations in usability
tests. The method is more valid, robust, and theoretically based than existing
methods. It allows measurement of expectations that is easy to administer,
simple to analyze, and provides actual and expected usability ratings along the
same ratio scale of usability. Expectation data is used to classify tasks into
empirically derived design strategy groupings based on refined theory. Overall,
the method positively contributes to usability results and development team
relationships.

%X Enterprise server systems, such as e-mail servers, database servers, and
e-commerce servers, are the heart and soul of businesses throughout the world.
They are complex back-end systems that typically fall under the realm of system
administrators and developers, and drive many of the front-end client
applications used by the billions of end-users in businesses on a regular
basis. It is critical that these complex systems be easy to learn, install,
use, troubleshoot, maintain, and upgrade. This paper describes our experience
using a persona-based approach to develop complex e-business server systems. It
provides an overview of personas and their benefits, the approach we took to
create them and enable their adoption, and the lessons we learned that may be
adapted by human factors professionals in different industries. The personas we
created increased the product team's awareness of our target server audience,
as well as their needs, skill levels and goals. The adoption of our personas
has been fairly widespread, influencing everything from feature-based
user-interface design decisions to far-reaching strategic planning for our next
major product release.

%X The purpose of this research was to investigate the perceptual and cognitive
processes involved in equation reading to apply that knowledge to the
development of assistive technology for blind equation readers. The research
used a process tracing observational study, three experiments, and an
eye-tracking study to examine several hypotheses about equation reading: people
(1) read equations from left to right, one element at a time, (2) back scan
when reading equations, (3) substitute the outcome of a parenthetical
expression for the initial elements, and (4) scan the entire equation before
element by element reading to create a schematic structure. The process tracing
study provided evidence for all of the hypotheses, with the experiments
supporting the first three hypotheses, but not the fourth. These results have
been implemented in assistive software for visually-impaired users, the Math
Genie -- an auditory browser.

%X This paper describes a cognitive usability analysis of a home stereo as well
as an experiment that tests the predictions borne out of that analysis using
the RAFIV method of cognitive usability analysis (Sherry, Polson, Fennell,
&amp; Feary, 2002). At the heart of this method is a five-stage model that
describes a user's cognitive steps as they perform a task. This model provides
a framework for analyzing an interface by asking whether or not each stage can
be accomplished purely through label-following. The results suggest that the
RAFIV technique can be used to predict which tasks might prove difficult for
users. Furthermore, it suggests that the number of recall steps within a task
can play a negative role in a user's ability to complete that task.

Consumer-Directed Broadcast Advertisements (CDBA). Information processing
capabilities of average consumers may be exceeded by broadcast advertisements
that present too much information. The purpose of this study was to examine
usability problems encountered by viewers of broadcast advertisements and to
isolate "best practices" that facilitated information transfer. Two age groups,
older and younger viewers, evaluated different prescription drug advertisements
based on usability and provided verbal reports to open-ended questions in a
focus group. Avoiding information overload, eliminating or reducing distracting
stimuli, and slowing the rate at which information is presented are important
usability guidelines that should be applied to content specifications.

with cognitive disabilities. This study evaluated the ability of persons with
moderate to severe cognitive impairments to use mainstream cellular phones
programmed with experimental interface features that allowed operation with
minimum cognitive ability. Two modes were tested. The first allowed an
individual to place calls by simply opening a flip phone. The second displayed
four pictures on the touchscreen and allowed a call to be made by touching one
of the pictures. Sixteen individuals with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
scores from 6 to 19 participated. There was a 100% success rate using the flip
mode in both Instruction and Carryover conditions and a 100% success rate in
Instruction and 81.3% success in Carryover for the picture mode. This was
compared to standard 'touchtone' dialing mode success rate of 12.5% in the
Instruction condition and 6.3% in Carryover condition.

The study reported here evaluated these rules. Four groups of novice users
cleared paper jams in a laser printer using one of four different diagrammatic
instructions. Diagrams presented to the first two groups all followed the rules
but differed in the number of actions per diagram (one verses 3-4). The
remaining groups' instructions contained diagrams that violated one or more
rules. Instructions that followed the diagram design rules resulted in no
errors. Diagrams that prevented users from correctly identifying the location
of a subtask resulted in the most severe errors. Other rule violations resulted
in fewer errors of lesser severity so if users were shown the general location
of the problem they could perform a subtask. Times to complete each subtask
were similar unless the location rule was violated.

%X Although the small size of handheld computers increases portability and
mobility, it causes difficulty reading information displayed on a small screen.
In an attempt to improve text readability of handheld computers, this study
investigated the effects of screen orientation and margin on reading speed,
comprehension, and subjective ease of reading with a handheld computer. A 2x2
within-subject factorial design was conducted with 16 participants reading text
from a PDA. In addition, users' preference for the two factors and their
experiences with reading with the PDA were elicited in a post-experiment
questionnaire. Finally, usability problems encountered were discussed in the
interview. The results of this study indicated that neither screen orientation
nor margin had a significant influence on reading performance. No prevailing
preferences for screen orientation and margin were found. Invaluable
qualitative information regarding usability problems was identified, which, in
turn, supports several recommendations to improve reading from small screens of
handheld computers.

%X A group of digital human models with various sizes which properly represents
a population under consideration is needed in the design process of an
ergonomic product in virtual environment. The present study proposes a two-step
method which produces a representative group of human models in terms of
stature and weight. The proposed method first generates a designated number of
pairs of stature and weight within an accommodation range from the bivariate
normal distribution of stature and weight of the target population. Then, from
each pair of stature and weight, the method determines the sizes of body
segments by using 'hierarchical' regression models and corresponding prediction
distributions of individual values. The suggested method was applied to the
1988 US Army anthropometric survey data and implemented to a web-based system
which generates a representative group of human models for the following
parameters: nationality, gender, accommodation percentage, and number of human
models.

magnitude estimation (FMME). Silk and synthetic fabrics showed similar shapes
of octave band spectra. Silk fabrics were found as sounding much more pleasant
than synthetic ones. In relationship between objective measurements and
subjective sensation, subjective clearness for silk fabrics was explained
significantly by &Delta;L{sub:oct} and VL{sub:oct}, whereas subjective softness

%X Most regression models of anthropometric variables use stature and/or weight
as regressors; however, these 'flat' regression models result in large errors
for anthropometric variables having low correlations with the regressors. For
better accuracy in estimating anthropometric variables, this study proposed a
method to estimate anthropometric variables in a hierarchical manner based on
the geometric and statistical relationships among the variables. By applying
the proposed approach to 60 anthropometric variables selected for the design of
an occupant package layout in a passenger car, hierarchical estimation
structures were constructed and then based on the estimation structures
hierarchical regression models were developed with the 1988 US Army
anthropometric survey data. The hierarchical regression models were compared
with the corresponding flat regression models in terms of adjusted R{sup:2} and
SE, resulting in on average a 55% increase in adjusted R{sup:2} and a 31%
decrease in SE when compared to the corresponding flat models.

%X An analytical approach to the user-centered design of a wall clock utilizing
an engineering model, a cost model, and a marketing model is demonstrated. An
engineering model is used to optimize the design with respect to material use
and functionality. A cost model considers fixed and variable costs for the
producer. The marketing model utilizes preference data collected from a
discrete choice conjoint analysis survey and analyzed with the logit model to
represent user preferences quantitatively in the form of demand curves. The
survey explores tradeoffs among four product characteristics (face diameter,
frame width, font style, and font size) and price. The engineering, cost, and
marketing models are integrated and the design is optimized to maximize profit
by considering tradeoffs among design requirements, cost, price, and product
characteristics. Cluster analysis defines three market segments within the
survey preference data and solutions are optimized for each of the three market
segments.

perception of overall product quality. Manufactures are increasingly interested
in the affective evaluation as the perception of quality is heavily related to
customer's feeling toward the product. Surface material quality is
characterized by complex touch-feel sensations. In this study, 30 participants
rated their affective reactions (how pleasant I feel) to surface materials of
30 different automobile interiors. Four categories of the material
characteristics are used in the evaluation; crash pad plastic, steering wheel
plastic, wood grain and metal grain. Consistent with previous research, it was
found that both the visual quality and touch/feel quality influenced customer's
perception of the material quality. Variables related to touch/feel quality is
structured as 'an affective quality checklist' for automobile interiors to be
used by a trim engineering team of an automobile manufacturer.

%X The purpose of this research is to minimize the negative effects and
maximize the benefits of the introduction of new technology to consumers. This
paper examines the effect of user processing and product change on the
acceptance of product upgrades. User processing is defined as the type of
cognitive processing a user employs to complete a task, and is identified as
either controlled or automated. Three types of product changes are examined:
omission (removing a task step), commission (adding a task step), and sequence
(changing the order of task steps). Both the short term and long term effects
of these changes on user performance are examined. The platform utilized was an
inventory management computer program. Task completion time was collected from
31 subjects. The results indicate a difference in user performance based on
processing type: subjects adapted to changes in the program more readily when
using controlled processing as opposed to automated processing. Users have
difficulty recovering from a task change when they are using automated
processing. When they are using controlled processing, the change is more
readily accepted. The variability of their performance was greater when using
controlled processing. Task changes were most readily adapted to when the
change was that of sequence. Changes of omission and commission caused a
greater negative effect on the subjects' performance.

opportunity to select among several design features and order a unique product.
In this experiment four web sites were created where users could specify the
design features of a mobile phone. Two web sites were designed to build a
mobile phone from scratch: One used a rating agent of design features, and the
other had no rating agent. The two other web sites used an existing phone as a
basis for design -- one used a rating agent and the other had no rating agent.
Forty test persons participated in an experiment to evaluate the web sites.
Half of them were male and half of them female. The use of the rating agent
produced more consistent and better design. The model for mass customization --
whether building from scratch or modifying an existing phone -- had no impact
on the results. There were no differences in results between males and females.

text is a critical element of effective writing. This paper provides guidance
for presenting data in papers, theses, and dissertations. It focuses primarily
on graphs -- the most powerful form of inscription -- and describes advantages
and disadvantages of various graphical formats. Factors related to the
effective design of graphs such as: size of data sets, type of data, usability,
and human perception are considered.

prototypes. This paper describes how PowerPoint can easily be used to create
dynamic displays that are interactive and provide animation, when resources do
not permit the purchase of computer-based prototyping software and the design
requires more than a pencil-and-paper prototype. With PowerPoint, designers can
create interactive displays by hyperlinking objects to connect multiple slides.
Additionally, animations can be created by using the same principles that
govern children's "flip books".

%X The state funded workers' compensation insurance in Washington State
receives more than 50,000 claims a year (40% of all claims) from work-related
musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). The annual direct cost of those claims is
410 million, and with additional indirect costs, the economic losses total over
1 billion dollars. The hazards that cause WMSDs must be controlled and reduced
in workplaces. Business and labor working together need to decide on the
implementation of ergonomics principles to reduce hazardous exposures. A survey
of Washington State employers revealed that their biggest difficulty in
implementing ergonomics was finding solutions. This presentation describes the
Washington State Ergonomics Ideas Bank (EIB), a web-based service that can be
accessed by employers and employees to search for ideas to help reduce WMSD
hazards. Preliminary data indicate that the Bank is being used and user
feedback is positive. It continues to grow as the public deposits ideas.

students to collect work sampling data (with QuikSamp) and conduct time studies
(with QuikTS) on the least expensive PDAs available, so that multiple units can
be purchased at relatively low cost. In addition to the data collection
capabilities, the students can also examine the tradeoffs between sample size
and the accuracy of the study and other basic work measurement principles.

%X The present research focuses on the development of an intelligent,
computer-based tutoring model for selecting problems in domains where multiple
skills are needed to solve a problem and the reasons for errors are not easily
diagnosed. In this paper we report on the development and evaluation of the
Mental Rotation Tutors and the intelligent models driving the problem selection
engine or "domain reasoner". The domain reasoner evaluated each student based
upon seven different core skills and chose the next problem based upon the
student's level of proficiency in all seven areas. Two versions of the tutor
were developed. The first versions targeted improving the student's ability to
infer what combination of rotations were required to go from one view to
another. The second version targeted improving the student's ability to apply a
provided set of rotations to an object and report the final orientation. The
results of two successive experiments demonstrated that students with low
spatial ability derived the most measurable benefit from interacting with the
tutors. The tutors also successfully diagnosed students' skill levels and
provided problems that were appropriate to each student's current level of
proficiency.

methods, principles, and guidelines? Will laypersons be able to actually start
applying HFE principles and guidelines without learning the underlying theory?
Will they have the experience and pragmatics to properly apply guidelines? When
we simplify our knowledge and skills to teach them to others, do we run the

%X Human Factors and Systems Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
(ERAU) focuses on both traditional and emerging areas of Human Factors and
Systems in Aviation and Aerospace. The majority of students will pursue a
career in aviation after s/he graduates. So it is crucial to provide the proper
curriculum for those students at the very beginning, in order to equip them
with sufficient knowledge and skills. The ERAU model of Human Factors education
starts with the analysis of the student needs and integrates relevant
disciplines into a single program. Courses are designed to expose students to
the general human factors theory, as well as the technical applications in
aviation/aerospace. The transition between semesters follows a continuous and
systematic pattern and a complete knowledge network will be built after four
years in the program. This paper illustrated the structure of ERAU's model and
uses four Human Factors courses as a case study.

%X Successful learning outcomes in learner-controlled, computer-based training
environments are inherently dependent upon learners' possession of
well-developed metacognitive skills, that is, how well learners are able to
accurately monitor and regulate their knowledge acquisition process. The
present study explored the effectiveness of embedding a guided
learner-generated instructional strategy (query method), designed to support
learners' cognitive and metacognitive processes, within the context of
computer-based complex task training. In terms of cognitive processes, results
showed that incorporating the query method into the training resulted in
improved integration and application of task-relevant knowledge, as indicated
by greater similarity to an expert model of the domain and better performance
on an integrative transfer task. With regard to metacognitive processes, the
query method may have also assisted participants in more accurately monitoring
their comprehension, as indicated by their significantly lower bias scores.
Results are discussed in the context of designing adaptive learning systems.

satisfaction in other industries is suggestive of application to higher
education, which is increasingly regarded as an industry. An initial step in a
human factors approach to higher education is to furnish a reliable measure of
undergraduate customer satisfaction. The present study outlines two studies
exploring the Cynical Attitudes Toward College Scale (CATCS; Brockway et al.,
2002) as a measure of higher education customer satisfaction. The first study
demonstrates the usefulness of the CATCS as a measure of costumer satisfaction
by demonstrating differences between two user groups, traditional and
nontraditional students. The second study demonstrates its relationship to an
environmental design variable, personalization of living space in college
dormitories. The CATCS may prove useful in investigating and improving the
design of higher education.

asked to re-do the first origami task from memory. The results indicated a
general advantage for the dynamic modality in both time for task completion and
accuracy. However, complexity of the third origami task and video resolution
mitigated the effectiveness of the dynamic modality. No significant difference
was seen in instructional modality preference or in memory retention for the
task.

%X Target detection and legibility prediction problems are generally considered
complex as they require a good understanding of knowledge in photometry,
geometry, human visual functions and visual performance measurement. Therefore,
only simple geometric or photometric models are generally provided in human
factors text books in the forms such as equations, graphs, or nomograms. This
paper presents an easy to use but a more comprehensive model developed for a
human factors engineering class to understand the variables, photometric
measurements and use of human visual threshold data. The model can be easily
down-loaded and exercised by a PC user to quickly estimate visibility and
legibility in a number of situations. The model serves as a great tool to
analyze a number of "what if" scenarios and learn the basics of human visual
performance. The model will be an excellent candidate for including in a
practicing human factors engineer's tool box.

%X Geometric models of normal working area have been derived from analyses of
theoretically possible, but contrived and restrictive arm and hand movements
(Farley, 1955; Squire, 1959; Wang et al., 1999). It is unclear whether the
resulting boundaries delimit a safe, comfortable and effective reach area. The
goal of the current investigation was to obtain data that can establish reach
boundaries that reflect actions that are both comfortable and efficient. Adults
reached for objects placed in various directions and distances in front of
them. The type of reach action used to pick up the object was categorized in an
effort to demarcate reach envelopes for different reach actions and identify
the directional location in the workspace at which people change from reaching
with their right hand to using their left hand. These data showed that people's
reach actions violated important characteristics of the geometric models,
including the spatial symmetry in the use of the right and left hands. From
these data we are able to construct "performance-based" models of workspace
area.

%X Studies of office workers' postures indicate that reclined postures are less
common than upright or forward-leaning postures. Laboratory studies have shown
that back extensor activity and internal pressure in the lumbar intervertebral
disks are lower in reclined postures. Given these advantages, why don't workers
recline more often? Postural constraints imposed by their work, particularly
vision and hand-reach requirements, may preclude more upright postures. In a
study at a large office facility, side-view photographs were used to measure
the postures that 80 men and women chose when sitting in an office chair
without a work task. All sitters chose substantially reclined postures, with
backrest angles averaging 25 degrees from vertical. The findings provide
evidence that office work should be designed such that workers can sit more
frequently with the reclined torso postures that they would choose if they were
not working.

process was used to develop and evaluate an office ergonomics training program.
It was hypothesized that the training and workplace intervention would allow
the worker to more effectively use their workplace through increased office
ergonomics knowledge and skills. Following the intervention, there was a
significant increase in workers' office ergonomics knowledge and awareness.
Self-reported work-related musculoskeletal disorders significantly decreased
for the group who had a workplace change and received ergonomic training
relative to a workplace change-only group and a no intervention control group.
Environmental satisfaction increased for both the workplace change and training
groups as compared to the control group.

effects on work of environmental design. Results are based on pre-occupancy
evaluations of 2 different office workplaces, with many parallels in occupancy
design. Methods entailed: (1) measurement of noise, lighting, and thermal
conditions at selected work stations; and (2) administration of an occupancy
quality perceptual response survey questionnaire. A 2-step, least-squares
(2SLS) multiple regression method was used for sources of variance analysis of
responses to occupancy quality items on the questionnaire. The major result is
that observed variance in major indicators of occupancy quality is not
explained by responses to the same questionnaire items for the 2 sites. The
findings support the conclusion that, across different occupancy design
settings, observed variability in work behavior is not likely attributable to a
universal set of design factors.

subjective and objective indicators of environments' usability. These measures
were then applied in case studies of buildings currently in use that varied in
their design features' acknowledgment of the seven Principles of Universal
Design.

%X A study was conducted to explore the use of universal design principles in
the redesign of a grocery store self-checkout system -- focusing on the
accessibility for wheelchair users. Two checkout stations were built: one was a
dimensionally accurate model of an existing system and the other was a redesign
of this system, using universal design principles. Five wheelchair users and
ten non-wheelchair users performed simulated self-checkout activities, using
both checkout stations. The dependent variables were productivity, shoulder and
torso posture, and users' subjective assessment. Results indicated that
productivity was not significantly affected by checkout station type and
posture was significantly improved -- peak shoulder angle was reduced by 64% in
wheelchair users and by 69% in the non-wheelchair group, and peak sagittal
angle (forward lean) of the torso was reduced by 66.5% for wheelchair-users.
Subjective feedback from both user groups showed a preference for the
redesigned checkout station.

%X The development of a set of Universal Design Performance Measures based on
the Principles of Universal Design is presented. The performance measures can
be used to evaluate existing designs, guide the design process, and educate
consumers and design students. The Universal Design Performance Measures for
Products were developed to help optimize and measure the usability of product
designs for populations that are diverse in age and ability. Five distinct
versions of the Universal Design Performance Measures were drafted and reviewed
by consumers with disabilities, professional product designers, and marketing
managers. These were distilled into two working versions of the performance
measures, one for consumers and one for designers. The Universal Design
Performance Measures for Products were then tested with consumer households and
professional product designers and their households across the United States.
Considerations for using the performance measures are discussed.

suggests that the dimensions for "clear floor area" of wheeled mobility devices
as specified in U.S. standards are too small. Anthropometric research was
conducted to verify that findings in other countries are relevant for the U.S.
Findings support increasing the clear floor area dimensions. To provide
universal access to buildings, it is necessary to exceed the current
requirements of minimum standards until they are revised to reflect the
increased size of wheeled mobility devices.

%X Increased understanding of the stress and performance effects of gun range
drills with police officers is of importance for law enforcement trainers.
Seventy-one police officers participated in routine night shooting drills over
a two week period as part of regular training regimen. This paper examines the
effects of two shooting range tasks on police officer's time perception,
individual differences, and shooting performance. Theoretical considerations
led to the hypothesis that performance changes under stress may be related to
distortions in the perception of time. However, the results of this study do
not provide strong evidence for nomothetic effects of time distortion. Rather,
it is more likely a function of individual differences. Future studies will
examine potential individual differences variables that influence the relation
between time distortion under stress and task performance.

ranking. Subjects were then presented with two photographs (upright and fully
reclined) and asked which position had a reduced risk of serious injury to the
abdomen or neck that could be caused by sliding under the safety belts in a
frontal collision. In both the ranking and the forced-choice tasks, all but one
of the subjects reported it is safer to have the seat back in a more upright
position than in a fully-reclined position. Subjects in this study clearly
recognized that sitting upright is safer than sitting fully reclined.

participants read three trial scenarios in which the Defendant Manufacturer was
found responsible for the plaintiff's injuries and awarded either economic,
punitive, or pain and suffering damages. Interestingly, with the inclusion of
more moderate values, profit information was found to significantly influence
punitive, pain and suffering, as well as economic damage awards. The pain and

%X Military operators are often put into complex human-machine interactive
environments shown to fail when stressful situations are encountered. To
enhance warfighter readiness and operational capability, DARPA's efforts in
Augmented Cognition are developing a new generation of technologies to enable
computational systems to adapt to the human's cognitive state in real-time.
These augmented systems will be endowed with non-invasive sensors that provide
objective measures of the warfighter's neurophysiological responses to ongoing
events. Based on these measures, as well as cognitive and contextual models of
the user's intentions and objectives, these systems will invoke validated
mitigation strategies to enable maximal performance from the user, and to help
return them to an optimally functional state. This panel provided an overview
of the key components of an Augmented Cognition system, how its development and
validation will be carried out, and where these technologies could be
implemented both in military settings and beyond.

petrochemicals industries. Six petrochemical production facilities participated
in the study. We interviewed various stakeholders at these facilities on their
culture, business drivers, field operations, current use of mobile devices,
infrastructure and platforms in place, current applications, and potential
needs. Four general areas were identified as critical to the success of
deployment: 1) Organizations, Policies and Processes, 2) Applications, 3)

%X Effective implementation in Poland of occupational safety and health (OSH)
legislation based on European Union (EU) directives requires a promotion of OSH
management systems (OSH MS). To this end, a series of voluntary standards has
been adopted, setting forth OSH MS specifications and guidelines. However, the
number of enterprises implementing OSH MS has been increasing slowly, which
calls for a national policy on OSH MS promotion. In order to provide input data
for the development of this policy, a survey was conducted in a group of 40
enterprises with OSH MS. The survey was aimed at identification of motivational
factors underlying OSH MS implementation decisions. The results indicate the
required actions. The main ones include increasing workers' participation in
OSH activities and increasing the role of the National Labour Inspectorate in
OSH MS promotion.

SPAR-H method considers temporal factors in relation to a wide range of
performance shaping factors. It is the authors' intention to classify temporal
factors in a broad human performance context, ultimately describing a richer
data footing for estimating human error probabilities.

culminated in a joint design course where we bridged between design-build
courses in architecture and user-interaction engineering. In this paper we
cover lessons learned, based on our experience. Using the pedagogy developed
for the Bauhaus, we have identified five goals for design education. Primary
among these is education that combines designing artifacts with building them.
We report commonalities and differences between our professions that have a
significant impact on design education. Our work points to three
recommendations for cross-disciplinary design education. Primary among them is
to focus on design studios to keep within practical and manageable bounds.

%X A questionnaire survey of opinions and judgments about load carrying
techniques was distributed to soldiers operating in Afghanistan in 2003. The
soldiers completed the surveys between combat missions. One hundred fifty three
questionnaires were fully completed. The questionnaire was designed to
determine preferences and understanding of load carrying relative to
requirements for executing combat tasks. Questions were derived from statements
about the biomechanics and comfort of load carrying during military movement.
Results show that awareness of effective load carriage techniques is a function
of military experience. Knowledge about how to carry loads was not uniform
throughout those surveyed. Significantly different responses were obtained for
soldiers with less than 4 years experience as compared to soldiers with 4-7
years and to those with more than 7 years of military experience. Findings
suggest there may be a need for special training in load carriage early in the
career of infantrymen.

ecological interface design framework, continue to show substantial advantages
for supporting effective operator control (Vicente, 2002). However, prospective
industry users of these technologies have expressed a need to make a
quantitative economic case for designing and implementing advanced HMIs. To
date, no comprehensive cost justification study has been published on advanced
HMIs. The purpose of this paper is to report original work on a cost-benefit
framework for advanced HMI's. We first present a brief summary of findings from
a literature review of existing human factors cost justification studies and
present a working list of metrics. We then describe a general cost-benefit
framework derived from this list of metrics and discuss issues to be considered
in applying this model in practice.

%X Over fifty percent of the workforce utilize the computer and suffer health
problems that include musculoskeletal disorders and physical discomfort
(Newburger, 1999 and Work Loss Data Institute, 2001). Professionals from
disciplines of human factors and ergonomics address computer issues
independently. Usability and user interface issues are identified in the
software development stage focusing on the users ability to perceive and
understand the designed functions. Ergonomic professionals are involved in
usability after implementation and upon complaints and user injury. The focus
of ergonomics is to evaluate extreme postures, resulting from design that cause
stress to the body. By using motion analysis, usability studies are enriched by
identifying extreme movements in completing system tasks. In this paper we will
present a novel method that utilizes the kinematics of the user's hand and
wrist movements to simultaneously evaluate physical strain and usability.

%X The Engineering Equipment and Materials User Association (EEMUA) recently
published recommendations for average and peak alarm rates of 1 alarm per 10
minutes during normal operations and no more than 10 alarms per 10 minutes
following an upset condition, respectively. However, these recommendations have
been made in the absence of human performance studies or theory. This paper
presents two studies -- an analytical Keystroke-Level Modeling study and a
Markov modeling study -- that provide an initial human performance context for
the EEMUA recommendations. Results suggest that these EEMUA recommendations are
in line with human performance limits. Several limitations of the two studies
for generalizing from either the KLM or Markov modeling results are discussed.
Practical implications presented include the need for advanced alarm reduction
techniques and consideration of peak alarm rates for upset conditions during
the alarm rationalization process. Future research directions are also
discussed, such as establishing the duration for which the EEMUA recommendation
for peak alarm rates can be endured by a human operator.

%X As part of a larger project to identify and validate relevant quantitative
measures of robot arm operator proficiency, fifteen metrics of arm maneuvering
and hand controller performance were defined and measured for 3-DOF
translational movement tasks. Twelve freshly trained operators provided
performance data for seven target-acquisition task scenarios involving a
variety of distance combinations along the X, Y, and Z axes. Metrics included
indicators of task component times, distance traveled, inefficient (inverse)
motion, maximum velocities, amount of multi-axis control, and input control
onset times along the three axes. Pairwise correlations of all measures and
scatter plots of variables yielding strong intercorrelations were examined to
determine the potential underlying causes of the significant relationships. By
identifying subsets of metrics with explainable co-dependencies, the overall
metric set can be reduced to a limited number of key metrics that serve as
effective discriminators of operator performance.

%X Motor vehicle crash fatalities involving pedestrians result in 1.8 deaths
per 100,000 population annually in the US. Most of these fatalities are
attributed to the pedestrian not being seen in time for the driver to avoid a
collision, particularly under poor lighting conditions. Previous research shows
that reflective clothing worn at night significantly increases a pedestrian's
visual conspicuity to drivers, especially when worn on a part of the body that
moves. The purpose of the present research was to examine pedestrians'
willingness to pay an additional dollar amount for clothing providing increased
conspicuity at night. Two studies were conducted with sample sizes of n = 340
and 325, respectively, comprised of university students and non-students.
Findings from these two studies suggest that over 49 percent of respondents
would be willing to pay an additional amount (33 versus 30) for a sweat shirt
or jacket, and over 60 percent would pay the same additional amount for
athletic shoes. These findings suggest that a relatively large segment of the
population are interested in and would be willing to spend more for clothing
with reflective material. In both studies, significantly more women than men
selected the reflective material option. Respondents spending more time
outdoors at dusk or at night walking, running or jogging professed a
significantly greater willingness to purchase the reflective clothing than
respondents reporting spending less time outdoors at dusk or after dark.
Implications for product marketing and future research are discussed.

enable users to learn the skills needed to perform medical and surgical
procedures in much the same way that flight simulators facilitate pilot
training. These devices offer numerous training benefits to the user and also
have the potential to improve patient safety. Despite these advantages, the
medical community has been slow to embrace this technology. In fact, many of
the current systems appear to showcase what can be done from a technological
perspective instead of what should be done from the user's perspective. Thus,
the purpose of this panel is to bring together experts who use, evaluate, and

affect accuracy performance on the transfer session of the discrimination task.
Results suggest that individual differences in cognitive ability and cognitive
style are orthogonal constructs that interact to affect skill acquisition and
strategy development for visual-spatial tasks. Implications related to
discrimination training and computer interface design are discussed.

States Navy (USN) Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCSs). The Embedded Figures
Test (EFT) was used to assess the existence of the underlying ability of field
independence. This study investigated the hypothesis that active duty military
ATCSs, as a group, tend to be more field independent than a comparable group of
military personnel who were not controllers. This research effort showed that
the underlying ability of field independence was possessed by the military
ATCSs in the samples used.

%X The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between
Trait-based Individual differences (neuroticism and extraversion) on glare
subjective responses and contrast sensitivity performance when exposed to same
manipulated glare conditions. An attempt was made to explore the relationship
between the glare subjective responses and actual contrast sensitivity.
Thirty-six individuals (9 high neuroticism scorers, 9 low neuroticism scorers,
9 high extraversion scorers, and 9 low extraversion scorers) were tested on
subjective discomfort glare rating responses and visual contrast sensitivity.
The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) was used to assess trait-based
individual differences, while the subjective glare experience was examined
utilizing modified glare De Boer discomfort rating scale. The visual
performance was measured through the contrast sensitivity level using
adjustable contrast level of the Landolt's C target. Results indicated
significant effect of extraversion trait on rating response while insignificant
effect on visual related performance. The relationship between rating response
and visual performance was also found to be quite minimal. In conclusion, the
expected model was supported but only on the extraversion trait. Overall, the
research was directed towards improving our understanding of influencing
factors on the experience of discomfort glare, which may eventually have
practical implications in the design of glare measurement methods, training and
selection of drivers and workers who work under conditions of glare.

%X Researchers in human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) are encouraged to
consider two classes of predictor variables that typically are not included in
traditional performance research: worldview and acculturation. Worldviews are
sets of assumptions about life and the physical and social worlds.
Acculturation involves the degree of commitment made to a culture's set of
values and practices. Worldview and acculturation are highly relevant to
performance. Two worldview variables, Individualism -- Collectivism and Locus
of Control, have attracted research interest. At least four other dimensions
within Koltko-Rivera's (2004) collated model of worldview are likely to be
relevant to performance: mutability, time orientation, relation to authority,
and interaction. As industrialized societies become more diverse, acculturation
becomes more relevant to performance. Several areas are identified for future
research, such as worldview/acculturation -- task interactions, and team
cognition. Assessment instrumentation is briefly described.

%X 112 college students participated in a study of simulated driving. The aim
of the study was to investigate how coping related to both subjective stress
responses and objective indices of risk-taking behavior. Dispositional coping
(i.e., typical coping style) predicted task-induced stress responses, including
increased distress and loss of task engagement. Consistent with the
transactional model of driver stress, the effect of dispositional coping was
mediated by the situational strategies adopted in response to the specific
situation. Task-focused coping appeared to be more adaptive than
emotion-focused coping. Drivers were afforded opportunities to pass other
traffic in risky circumstances. Dispositional coping factors, especially a
confrontive coping dimension, predicted risk-taking behaviors, such as frequent
passing. These effects were not mediated by situational coping, suggesting that
emotions during driving may shape habitual behavioral styles that operate
irrespective of current mood and coping strategy. Implications of the findings
for countermeasures to driver stress are discussed.

%X In this study we tested the effect of individual differences in
dispositional optimism and pessimism on target detection. Following proximal
task dimensions set out by the Model of Maximal Adaptability, three tasks were
employed in the current study, varying in their spatial and temporal emphasis.
Performance as measured by self report of stress was examined in light of
individual differences in attentional narrowing across the three task levels.
Prior research indicates that optimism predicts increased Task-Engagement, but
in this study there was a novel finding that higher levels of optimism
predicted decreased Task-Engagement in spatial-dominant tasks. Optimism was
also found to predict increased levels of post-task Worry in temporal-dominant
tasks. However, expected relations between pessimism as post-task stress state
were not observed. Although the results of the current study did not confirm
the hypotheses regarding joint resource capacities for spatial and temporal
task components, results did indicate that dispositional optimism does impact
Task-Engagement, signifying a need for further research on the relation between
this trait and participant stress. The results extend prior findings that the
relationship between these traits and stress states may depend on the
psychophysical characteristics of the target detection task employed.

%X Stress is an important aspect of operational settings. This article presents
two studies providing initial psychometric and validation evidence of a short
multidimensional self-report measure of stress state, the Short Stress State
Questionnaire (SSSQ) based on the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ;
Matthews et al., 1999, 2002). The first study involved the construction and
exploration of the factor structure of the SSSQ using data pooled from three
samples. These factor analyses differentiated three aspects of subjective
stress similar to the DSSQ: Task Engagement, Distress, and Worry. The second
study aimed at providing validity information on the SSSQ in regards to its
sensitivity to task-stressors. Different task conditions elicited unique
patterns of stress state on the three factors of the SSSQ in line with
predictions. The 24-item SSSQ appears to be a useful measure of stress state
based on the substantially longer DSSQ from which it was derived.

of other age groups due to differences in the circadian rhythms of the
sleep-controlling hormone, melatonin. This study examined the sleep patterns of
cadets during their first year of training and study at the United States

2007 (n  1300) and a small group of upperclassmen (n=40). Actigraphy was
recorded on a sample of the class (n=80). Survey results compared sleep
patterns prior to reporting to USMA with sleep patterns during Cadet Basic
Training and during the Fall semester, 2003. This baseline data collection
effort sets the stage for follow-on interventions that will attempt to rectify
inadequacies in the sleep patterns of cadets.

to the question, "What is like a computer?" These responses were coded as one
of seven types ranging from being perceptually similar to sharing similar
functions to being cognitively similar. Computer trust scores were associated
with generating more responses, particularly of a functional nature. However,
further analyses showed that participant sex moderated this effect, with
computer trust associated with functional analogies for males, but perceptual
analogies for females. The results suggest that computer trust and mental
models may develop together and should be considered as important variables in
the design and training for future technology.

%X Two scales were constructed to assess anthropomorphism during human-machine
and human-animal interactions. Participants were asked about their tendencies
to self-engage in anthropomorphic behaviors and their attributions about
others' anthropomorphic behaviors. Results indicated that the tendency to
anthropomorphize pets is distinct from the tendency to anthropomorphize
artifacts such as cars and computers. Parallel results were obtained for the
attributions. Subsequent analyses showed a gender difference for the general
tendency to self-engage in anthropomorphic behaviors and the nature of the
attributions made for others' anthropomorphic behaviors. Females reported that
they anthropomorphized animals more than males. They also made more positive
attributions for others' anthropomorphic behaviors toward animals. No gender
differences were observed for anthropomorphism toward artifacts. Overall, the
results support a necessary distinction between anthropomorphism directed
toward animals versus artifacts. They also suggest that gender differences in
anthropomorphism need to be considered when designing "intelligent agents" that
can interact effectively with humans.

%X The purpose of this study was to examine if an individual's performance
could be improved by integrating physiological arousal data with a computer
task, specifically a video game, which increased or decreased in difficulty
based on the person's physiological status. Ninety-nine participants (80 males;
19 females) were included in the data analyses. The mean age of the included
participants was 21.9 years (SD = 2.6). Using cardiac inter-beat interval (IBI)
data each individual's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was derived and used
to objectively assess the parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous
system. The RSA data were continuously converted into a standardized arousal
score. In the condition of interest, Auto, the difficulty of the computer game
was continuously manipulated based on the real-time arousal score of the
participant. Subjective arousal data were also collected verbally throughout
each experimental session. It was hypothesized that manipulating the difficulty
of the computer game such that arousal was maintained at an optimal level would
result in better performance compared to yoked and manual control of game
difficulty. Results showed that automated task difficulty manipulation actually
resulted in lower performance scores compared to yoked assistance manipulation,
and tended to result in lower scores compared to manual assistance
manipulation.

%X The present study examined whether search times for the presence and absence
of features are moderated by the ability to perceive parts of the visual field
separate from their background (field dependence/independence) and spatial
ability. Participants were administered the WAIS and the GEFT and divided into
field dependent and independent groups. They then searched displays for targets
with and without a specific feature. It was expected that field independent
individuals would have faster search times for targets that lacked a feature
because of more efficient serial processing mechanisms. Although there was a
trend for faster response times to feature absent targets among field
independent individuals, it was not significant. Instead, spatial ability was
significantly correlated with feature absent search times. These findings
suggest that the WAIS may be a useful selection instrument for jobs that
require serial visual processing.

%X As a consequence of decreased defense budgets, the training time of
conscript combat boat 90 operators has recently been reduced. The effect has
been an increased number of drop-outs, detachments, and accidents during the
training. The need to improve this precarious situation is urgent. This
encouraged a study with the purpose of measuring abilities identified as
important for being successful in the training, and hence a high-performing and
safe combat boat 90 operator. The objective was to improve the selection
process in order to minimize drop-outs, detachments, and accidents during the
training. The test battery consisted of psychometric tests measuring spatial
and verbal working memory, problem solving ability, risk willingness, and
social capacity. The results of the psychometric tests were compared with
instructor ratings of performance during the training. The only test that
showed to reliably predict a successful combat boat 90 operator was the test
that measured verbal working memory.

and training must be provided to ensure success in situations where failure is
not an option. Performance within these environments occurs against a
background of threat which ensures that acute and chronic forms of stress are a
constant presence. However, there remain many questions to be answered
regarding the impact of stress on soldier performance. The proposed panel is
comprised of experts whom have generated work from disparate paradigmatic
perspectives to study the issues related to stress and human performance within
the laboratory as well as the field. The panel's goal is to present/discuss
critical issues that confront those who wish to understand soldier performance
under stress. Although we focus on the soldier, in principle, our work can
apply to any individual who finds themselves faced with decision uncertainty in
ambiguous situations in which flawed performance can have serious consequences.

male powered tool users operated pistol grip and right angle nutrunners in a
laboratory study. A full factorial experiment examined the effects of operator
experience, working height, distance, tool, and fastener joint hardness on
handle displacement and grip forces due to torque reactions. The results show
that in addition to working height and distance, experience significantly
affected tool handle displacement resulting from reaction torque. Experienced
users allowed an average of 7.9&deg;, while novice users allowed 11.5&deg; when
pistol grip tools were used on a horizontal surface. Experienced users allowed
less handle displacement for all working conditions, and exerted more force
than novice users when using right angle tools, but less force when using
pistol grip tools. Operator experience influences mechanical exposure during
power tool usage.

work. The purpose of this study was to evaluate muscular activity while masons
laid concrete block at various heights.
   Sixteen experienced male masons constructed a 2.4 m wide and 1.4 m high wall
using concrete block. Surface electromyography (EMG) was sampled from the
extensor and flexor forearm, and the upper and low back via telemetry. EMG
amplitude was determined for the first, third, and seventh courses of block.
Analyses of variance were used to test for significance.
   There were no significant differences in the courses for the forearm
extensors, forearm flexors, and right low back EMG. Significant differences
were found for the bilateral upper trapezius and left lower back, with higher
amplitudes at course 7. In this study, masons were exposed to more load in the

characteristics of surface myoelectrical activity of the biceps muscle during
four static postures observed on the assembly line. The results showed
significant differences in the largest Lyapunov exponents between four
postures. The surface EMG of the biceps brachii was more chaotic under the
maximum loading in MVC posture with elbow fully extended (180 degrees) and
static posture with 180 degrees shoulder flexion compared to two other static
postures. Based on the Kaplan-Yorke dimension, it was found that dimensional
complexity was higher for MVC posture than for posture with 135 degrees
shoulder flexion, posture with 180 degrees shoulder flexion, and posture with
90 degrees shoulder flexion and abduction. Interaction effects of posture and
trial with respect to the largest Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension
characteristics of the EMG signals showed higher levels of chaos and complexity
patterns in MVC postures compared to other static postures.

%X A simulated drywall plastering task was used in this study to evaluate the
potential health and safety benefits of using a pneumatic drywall finishing
system. The plastering task was performed in a controlled job setting. Muscular
exertion while performing the plastering task was measured using
electromyography (EMG). Usability questionnaires were given to all
participants. Mixed findings were observed for the EMG dependent variables.
Significant reduction in the number and duration of muscular rest and static
load level were observed for the left forearm flexor muscles when working with
the pneumatic tool. However, significant increase in the median and peak load
level were observed in the right forearm flexor muscle when working with the
Apla-Tech pneumatic tool. The usability questionnaire indicated that a majority
of the workers preferred the pneumatic tool. The use of ladders and rolling
scaffolds was reduced when working with the pneumatic tool because the tool
allowed all workers to reach higher corners and ceiling height. Based on the
EMG measures, tool preference and reduction of risk of traumatic slips and
falls indicate that the pneumatic tool is an effective tool for applying
compound onto drywall joints. Further studies in the field setting to verify
the effectiveness of the pneumatic tool should be conducted.

%X The effects of handle diameter (25~50mm) and handle orientation (horizontal
and vertical) on the subjective comfort, maximum torque performance, total
finger force, and efficiency of flexor and extensor muscle activity were
evaluated in this study. A force glove system containing 16 force sensors was
used to measure finger forces, and surface electromyography was used to
investigate muscle activities during torque tasks. Overall 35~45mm diameter
handles were rated as most comfortable. The average torque outputs were highest
with the 45 and 50mm diameter handles in both orientations. Torque output
exhibited a positive non-linear correlation with handle diameter, whereas total
finger force showed an inverse relationship with handle diameter. The positive
non-linear correlation between torque and handle diameter was explained by the
relationship between handle diameter, total finger force, and coefficient of
friction. Muscle activities and efficiencies of flexor and extensor muscles
were also investigated in this study.

%X Worker self-assessments are an important tool for assessing force and effort
in physical work. This study uses maximal grip exertions on a dynamometer to
calibrate the workers before rating various tasks' force requirements on a 0 to
10 visual analog scale. 78 workers were selected on 58 different jobs at an
automotive assembly plant and asked to rate the separate tasks and the job as a
whole. Their peak force ratings (6+2.5) were significantly higher than those
estimated by trained observers (4.7+1.1), however they used a larger range of
values on the force scale suggesting they were more sensitive to subtle
changes. Worker ratings were also sensitive to Hand Activity Level (HAL)
changes. Workers on the same job selected the same task to define peak force
86.4% of the time. In conclusion, worker self-ratings can be helpful tool in
identifying tasks with high force requirements.

%X Interrater reliability was assessed for a video-based, quantitative exposure
assessment method for estimation of hand forces and wrist postures for a short
duty-cycle job. Six raters analyzed a 25-second video of a worker packing a
case and rated bilateral hand forces and wrist postures at &frac14;-second
intervals. Consistency was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICC). Interrater reliability was high for hand forces (left: ICC=0.78; right:
ICC0.77), moderate for wrist flexion/extension (left: ICC=0.61; right:
ICC=0.59), and poor for wrist deviation (left: ICC=0.15; right: ICC=0.34). For
one subtask repeated six times per cycle, force variation was inadequate for
ICC calculation, but ICCs were similar for wrist postures (mean ICC=0.55 for
flexion/extension, mean ICC=0.39 for deviation). Results indicate raters were
consistent in estimating hand forces. Discrepancies in estimating wrist
postures were consistent with existing literature. ICCs work well in situations
with more variability (i.e. more activity), but not in static, unchanging
conditions.

%X Hand posture prediction is an important means of assessing specific task
designs prior to subject user trials or actual production. The objective of
this study was to estimate the effect of a set of task variables on the
observation of hand actions during hose installation tasks in automotive
assembly operations. From video recordings of 51 jobs, 124 hand actions were
identified. Of these, 50 grasping postures, 70 pinching postures and four
non-prehensile postures were observed as the dependent variables. Chi-Square
tests revealed significance (p&lt;0.0001) for posture by hose size and posture
by hand force (p=0.0007). The use of grasping postures increased significantly
when force levels exceeded 40% of maximum. The results support the idea that
hand posture is primarily influenced by the size of the object being handled
and the amount of force required for performing the task. The results are
necessary to further develop taxonomies of grip for predicting hand posture.

%X This study investigated the effect of a constant grip exertion on wrist
range-of-motion (ROM). Seven different levels of grip force were investigated,
including two levels of zero exertion, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% MVC. Both
hands were tested for each of three forearm positions (pronation, halfway
between pronation and supination (neutral), and supination). Twenty student
subjects (10 males and 10 females) were tested. Subjects held a particular grip
force level constant while simultaneously moving their wrist. The maximum
angles of flexion and extension were recorded to measure range-of-motion (ROM).
ANOVA analysis was performed for the dependent variables of flexion angle,
extension angle, and total ROM. Independent variables were gender, hand,
forearm position, and exertion level. Exertion level was a significant factor
for extension, flexion, and ROM. Forearm posture was a significant factor for
extension and ROM. Tukey-Kramer analysis revealed similar groupings of exertion
levels and forearm positions for flexion, extension, and ROM. The data show a
significant decrement in wrist ROM as grip force exertion level increased.

%X The goal of this symposium is to illustrate how research findings from
dynamic touch research (i.e., hefting and wielding of objects) within the
framework of ecological psychology can have direct and valuable contributions
to the field of HF/E. Ecological psychology, as developed by James J. Gibson,
shares with HF/E a critical focus on the mutual relationship between person and
environment, embodied in Gibson's concept of affordance (i.e., opportunity for
behavior). Research in dynamic touch has shown that perceived affordances of
hand-held objects are constrained by variables relevant to the task-specific
control of the hand-plus-object system. Work on perception of limb position and
properties of hand-held objects as well as perception by means of hand-held
objects has potential applications in areas such as the design of prosthetics
and hand-held tools, remote-controlled or virtual tool use,
navigational/perceptual aids for the visually or somatosensory impaired,
materials handling, and the design of interfaces.

%X The perception of actively manipulated objects via muscle sensitivity has
been referred to as 'dynamic touch.' Recent research has indicated that the
perception of various properties of occluded objects by dynamic touch is a
function of the object's resistances to angular rotation, as quantified by the
inertia tensor. Additional findings have generalized this hypothesis to the
proprioception of occluded limbs. It is suggested that the mechanisms
supporting the perception of intact limbs, prosthetic devices, and hand held
tools and implements via dynamic touch may be one and the same -- the detection
of movement-produced physical invariants such as the inertia tensor. Research
will also be presented showing that the kinesthetic perception of the length of
occluded objects remains unchanged when wielding occurs in air or water. This
demonstrates that the constancy of perception can be derived from the invariant
nature of physical stimulation available to the perceiver, as Gibson (1966)
hypothesized. Implications of this work for the design of hand-held tools and
attachments to the body are discussed.

%X About 10% of visually impaired Americans use canes to aid locomotion. Prior
research has found surprisingly little influence of mechanical variables of
these probes on judgments of walkway variables explored with them, and cane
users spontaneously report employing various cane substitutes with little
decrement. Cane users seem able to adapt to the mechanical variables of their
tools, which approach functional transparency to the qualities explored. New
research is discussed in which traditional-style aftereffects will be sought in
conditions in which participants wield the same probe for several consecutive
trials.

%X When a person grasps an object, they create a hand-plus-object system. In
perceiving properties of hand-held objects (including hand-held tools), people
seem to show sensitivity to inertial variables relevant to the control of that
object. Tool users demonstrate sensitivity to such variables in perceiving (1)
whether a hand-held object could be used as a striking implement, (2) where an
implement should be brought into contact with another object, and (3) where a
hand-held object should be grasped so that object would be most effective as a
striking implement. Importantly, tool users show task-specific sensitivity to
inertial variables in each case depending on the functional constraints of the
striking task (i.e., whether it emphasizes precision over power or vice versa).
These findings may be relevant not only to the design of hand-held tools but
also to the design of interfaces that allow the remote use of tools (e.g.,
telesurgery).

%X Student computer workstations have often been overlooked by ergonomists due
to their temporary nature of use. Since students usually work at these
facilities for a short period of time, ergonomic issues are often overlooked.
Four different labs in a university setting were observed for comparison of the
actual setup with the "ideal" setup. Placement of the monitor, keyboard, CPU,
mouse, and work papers were documented. Postures of students were also taken to
compare with the "ideal" posture while working at a computer. Students observed
rarely adjusted the setup of the workstation to fit the "ideal" standard.

%X Time pressure from deadlines, awkward body postures and long-duration,
continuous computer use are associated with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in
workers using computers. Few studies have examined computer-use-related MSDs in
college students. This study investigated computer use patterns of college
students, and made comparisons to a group of computer-using professionals. 234
students completed a web-based questionnaire on computer use habits and
discomfort students associated with computer use. As a group, students reported
their computer use to be at least 'Somewhat likely' 18 out of 24 h/day,
compared to 12 h for the professionals. Students reported more uninterrupted
work behaviours than the professionals. Younger graduate students reported 33.7
average weekly computing hours, similar to hours reported by younger
professionals. Students generally reported more frequent upper extremity
discomfort than the professionals. Frequent assumption of awkward postures was
associated with frequent discomfort. Results signal a need for intervention
prior to entry into the workforce.

%X A computer usage monitor (software odometer) was used to collect information
on computer input device usage (keystrikes, mouse clicks and movement, and
duration of input activity) from 27 professionals, for an average of 17 working
days, each. Data from an odometer provides a more extensive means of describing
and exploring computer use than more traditional methods, such as self-report
of average use in response to a survey question. Further, by collecting data
for an extended period of time, considerable day to day variation in computer
use was found within subjects. This confirmed the necessity for collecting such
data over an extended period of time, and illustrates one of the benefits of
the use of software odometers over, or in conjunction with, self-reported usage
information via surveys or diaries, or work sampling accomplished through
direct observation.

%X Removing excess concrete and leveling concrete to grade -- a.k.a. concrete
screeding -- can be accomplished using a number of different techniques. Five
concrete screeding techniques were evaluated to characterize construction
workers exposures to risk factors for developing work-related musculoskeletal
disorders (WMSD). Workers were videotaped using manual, vibratory, roller, and
laser screeding equipment on new construction sites. WMSD risk factors for the
five screeding techniques were analyzed using the following ergonomic
assessment methods: Posture, Activity, Tools, and Handling (PATH), ACGIH Hand
Activity Level TLV, Strain Index, Washington State Ergonomic Rule, Liberty
Mutual Manual Material Handling Tables and the NIOSH revised lifting equation.
The most serious risks for developing musculoskeletal injuries of the upper
extremity and back were observed during manual and roller screeding. Powered
screeding techniques generally presented less risk than manual screeding, but
these techniques can require brief periods of medium to high exertion for
lifting tasks. Vibratory screed operators are exposed to hand-arm vibration,
but vibration levels were not measured. Operating the walk-behind and the cab
operated laser screeds presented the least risk. Suggestions are provided to
limit the use of hand screeding, and to minimize potential exposure to risk
factors related to operating and handling the powered screeding equipment.

selected their preferred pivot range for opening and closing the handle.
Finally, each subject exerted his or her preferred force for the trackball and
trigger controls in the selected positions. Based on the data collected in this
experiment, the recommended handle diameter is in the range of 4.3 to 5.7 cm.
The recommended handle pivot is the range of 8.1 to 17.3 degrees for the open
and closed positions. The recommended trackball actuation force is 3.0 lbs and
the recommended ratchet actuation force is 0.6 lbs, on average.

%X Many problems have been associated with current laparoscopic surgical tools,
and work is being done to improve the design of many the tools and devices, but
little improvement has resulted. The IDEA Lab at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln, has designed a comfortable and intuitive tool with added
function as a result of questionnaire responses from student and expert
surgeons. Surgeons were asked to respond to a questionnaire asking about pain
and discomfort experienced from use of conventional laparoscopic grasper tools.
Analysis of the results shows that more than 25% of all respondents experience
problems during or after surgery in the following areas: neck pain and
stiffness, shoulder/arm pain and stiffness, hand/wrist pain and stiffness, back
pain and stiffness, mental fatigue, awkward manipulation of instruments, and
performing precise movements. Eleven out of eighteen surgeons reported
experiencing painful areas of the hand during or after laparoscopic surgery,
including but not limited to, numbness of the thumb and soreness of the
fingers. These results make it clear that the redesigns of the new laparoscopic
grasper tool were needed. Further testing will be conducted to compare the new
design to conventional tools and determine if all of the needs of surgeons have
been met.

was conducted. In this study, task observation, a sample survey, ergonomic

collected (n = 58), and served to identify the population and areas for
ergonomic improvement. The revised NIOSH lifting equation and University of
Michigan 3D Static Strength Prediction Program were then used to analyze manual
materials handling tasks. By redesigning the hand tools used for bridge
construction, the average NIOSH lifting index was decreased by 0.4 (-16%) and

%X Four lifting analysis methods (WA L&amp;I, NIOSH, ACGIH TLV, and 3DSSPP)
were used to assess milk case stocking of 4- and 6-gallon cases. The outputs of
each method were converted to a risk index similar to NIOSH's Lifting Index and
used to contrast and compare risk predictions. All instruments showed higher
risks associated with lifting the 6-gallon cases versus the 4-gallon cases. The
NIOSH and ACGIH TLV methods were virtually identical in their results and
predicted substantially higher risk when compared to the 3DSSPP. WA L&amp;I
showed risk only at the higher lifts, but its threshold for risk was designed
to be higher for regulatory purposes. NIOSH's multi-task analyses were also
performed. For the practitioner, the ACGIH TLV is a simpler tool to use and
yields results similar to the NIOSH single-task analysis for this type of
lifting, but NIOSH offers greater interpretive capabilities. All of the
instruments may underestimate the risk of this lifting task due to the presence
of factors unaccounted for in their calculations. The differences, strengths,
and limitations of each method are outlined.

%X Workstation design can have a profound effect on an individual's health.
Most product designs are based on a 5th percentile "reach" and a 95th
percentile "clearance". These designs quite often fail to match a person's body
measurements since the dimensions of each body link are not exactly the same
xth percentile. Even with an adjustable workstation, the user has a dilemma as
to what adjustment to make for each adjustable parameter as each adjustment
depends on the previous adjustment and the potential number of adjustments is
somewhat infinite. This paper focuses on a methodology to achieve a postural
fit for a given workstation with an adjustable table, chair, and footrest. The
least stressful and somewhat comfortable postures were first determined from
the literature. Thereafter, a Linear Programming model was developed to capture
these mappings as mathematical constraints and solved. The model was validated
with an adjustable workstation and a few participants.

%X Several issues must be addressed in experiments using psychophysical
estimations, including the potential effects of work conditioning, the
necessary adjustment period, and the validity of experimental results. To
address these, two experiments were conducted that simulated different manual
torquing tasks. In the first experiment, 16 participants provided their maximum
acceptable repetition rate (MARR) in a 2-hour adjustment period, and repeated
this for five consecutive days. No significant differences were found across
days (i.e. no work conditioning effect). Further analysis indicated that
results after 12 minutes were comparable to those at 2 hours. In the second
experiment, another set of 16 participants provided estimates of 2-hour MARRs
in a 12-minute adjustment period for two task conditions. On subsequent days
they worked for 2 hours at their self selected MARRs. Participants were able to
perform the tasks at their MARR with low to moderate average ratings of
perceived discomfort on these latter days, supporting the use of a short
(12-minute) adjustment period.

%X Abdominal belts are sometimes used as a low-cost, low back injury prevention
measure in industry. Claims for the effectiveness have suggested that such
belts may enhance proprioception and therefore improve low back stability. In
this study, this claim was examined by using a previously established low back
reposition sense protocol to assess the change in position sense with use of an
elastic back belt in both an upright and a flexed posture. The results of this
study demonstrate no overall improvement of position sense with back belt.
However, significant improvement was observed at a torso flexion angle of 45
degrees. While future studies in other conditions are suggested, this study
suggest that back belts may be useful only when highly flexed postures are
required for manual materials handling.

%X Observational methods have been widely used for identifying posture-related
risks in industry. In those methods, a single score of postural load for a
working posture is required for evaluating the level of corrective actions, on
the basis of each body-parts stressfulness evaluated. However, most existing
methods have transformed stressfulness for several joints into a postural load
based on subjective judgments of ergonomic experts, not on an objective basis.
In this study, the relationship between body-part postural load and whole-body
discomfort for working postures was investigated. A laboratory experiment was
conducted to evaluate static postures frequently assumed during the automobile
assembly tasks, based on perceived discomfort. The results showed that the
postural load was strongly associated with the combination of discomfort for
non-neutral joint postures. The more joints severely deviated from neutral
position were involved in a working posture, the higher level of the whole-body
postural discomfort was imposed. In a regression analysis, the relationship was
quite well fitted with a linear model, in which shoulder motion was found to be
the most affecting factor on the whole-body postural stresses. The linear
relationship is expected to be useful for better understanding adverse effect
of joint motions on a whole-body posture.

%X The most frequent and expensive cause category of compensable loss is manual
material handling (MMH). In an attempt to minimize these losses, refinement of
existing MMH guidelines is a component of redesigning high risk MMH jobs. In
the development of our present MMH guidelines (Snook &amp; Ciriello, 1991),
maximum acceptable forces (MAFs) of pulling were assumed to respond similarly
to pushing at longer distances for male and female industrial workers. The
purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of 7.6m and 15.2m
distances on both initial and sustained MAFs of pushing and pulling at a
frequency of 1 min{sup:-1}. A psychophysical methodology was used whereby the
subjects were asked to select a workload without "straining themselves or
without becoming unusually tired, weakened, overheated or out of breath." Ten
subjects worked 40 min at each push or pull task within a 4-hour test that
included other MMH tasks. The results revealed that initial and sustained MAFs
were not significantly different between pushing and pulling at both the 7.6m
and 15.2m distance. However, task time was significantly longer for pulling at
both distances. It was concluded that our existing guidelines present an
accurate estimate of MAFs at the longer pull distances for female industrial
workers.

%X One of the most interesting topics in occupational research for
musculoskeletal disorders is an investigation into why individuals respond
differently to pushing forces taking into account their strength. The study
reports the results of the strength of 12 subjects during one-handed pushing
and the geometries of their shoulder joints derived from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans. The measurements of mean force during pushing were
recorded when the upper right arm was abducted in the frontal plane from 5 to
30 degrees during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The three characteristic
shoulder types A, B and C were identified in the group: type A -- glenoid with
a radius that is larger than that of the humerus, type B, glenoid and humerus
with the same radius, and type C, glenoid with a radius that is smaller than
that of the humerus. The congruency of the shoulder joint is not a
straightforward related factor on the maximum acceptable load during pushing.
There may exist other geometric relationships between the anatomic variables
which have influence on the maximum load during pushing.

%X Internationally forestry is recognized as encompassing some of the most
physically demanding and hazardous jobs. While extensive research has been
conducted in many advanced forestry areas, very little has been done in South
Africa where a multi-ethnic manual work force has to operate in sub-optimal
working and climatic conditions. This paper will present the findings of a
preliminary investigation conducted on Chainsaw operators (Felling and
Cross-cutting) and Stackers working in the tropical north of the country where
ambient temperatures and humidity are high. The vast majority of these workers
come from meagre living conditions with a very low nutritional intake and
associated health problems all of which have a substantial negative impact on
worker efficiency. The results reveal that with mean working heart rates and
energy expenditures of 135 bt.min{sup:-1} (8.54 kcal.min{sup:-1}) and 137
bt.min{sup:-1} (9.21 kcal.min{sup:-1}) for the Chainsaw operators and Stackers
respectively, the job requirements fall into the categories of 'very heavy' to
'unduly heavy' placing extreme stress on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal
systems of these manual labourers, and showing a clear need for sound
ergonomics intervention.

%X The purpose of this study was to characterize the low back disorder (LBD)
risk in jobs found in automotive parts distribution centers. This descriptive
study analyzed 53 jobs at 7 automotive distribution facilities in the Northern
United States. Data were collected using the Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM) and
analyzed using the LMM LBD risk model. Historically, the LMM risk model, which
was developed primarily through an analysis of manufacturing jobs, has used the
peak load moment in the calculations. A secondary purpose of this study was to
compare the difference in LBD risk estimates obtained using the peak versus the
mean load moment in the analysis of these highly variable lifting jobs. Given
that each lifting task may be a different weight item from a different location
the sampling process was validated using split-test reliability coefficients.
These were found to be 0.90. Results indicate that, on average the jobs in
automotive parts distribution are moderately high risk (mean = 56%, s.d.= 11%),
however, nearly half the sample had LMM LBD risk probability values greater
than 60% mark that has been used by some as a cut point in defining "high" risk
(Marras et al., 2000). On average, use of the average moment instead of the
maximum moment reduced the LBD risk probability value by 7.4 percent (s.d.=
5.3%), however, the range included no difference up to 17 percent. Many of the
jobs contain trunk motions that are associated with high LBD risk, however,
many of these same jobs had relatively low lifting frequencies which moderated
the risk estimates. It should be noted that for many of the jobs the LBD risk
probability was at the medium level due to the travel time required between
lifts. This kept the frequency of lifting in many of these jobs relatively low
for distribution type work; for many jobs the liftrates were less than 60 lifts
per hour. The liftrate potentially contributes 20 percent to the overall risk
calculation in the model. This suggests that efforts to increase the pick rates
and efficiencies in these jobs will be accompanied by increased LBD risk if
done without accompanying ergonomic interventions.

%X Job rotation has been advocated as a business practice to increase the skill
of employees, as well as a suitable intervention for the control of
work-related musculoskeletal disorders. However, little is known regarding the
prevalence of job rotation, methods used to identify jobs to rotate to, or the
benefits or limitations of job rotation. A web-based questionnaire was
developed to survey job rotation practices in the Midwest U.S. manufacturing
sector. Results indicated that 42% of the companies contacted use job rotation,
and that companies appeared to be using job rotation on a permanent basis. Job
rotation was used mainly to reduce exposure to risk factors and reduce work
related injuries, whereas methods utilized to identify jobs to rotate to were
based mainly on supervisor decision and ergonomic job analysis. These findings
suggest further study is needed to determine if exposure to risk factors is
being reduced through current efforts.

%X Occupational groups with variable work tasks pose unique methodological
challenges to ergonomists who need valid measures of physical job demands for
occupational health research. In this study data on flight attendants' physical
job demands were collected during five round-trip commercial passenger flights
using direct observation and accelerometry. Thirty-five flight attendants (88%
participation) each were observed inflight and equipped with two accelerometers
(positioned on the leg and waist). Correlational analyses were performed to
examine concordance between measures obtained by each method. Agreement was
moderate to high between direct observation and accelerometry for measures of
standing, lifting (leg), and overall physical effort level. Agreement was poor
for back posture and push/pull activities. These findings suggest that
accelerometry may provide an acceptable alternative to the labor-intensive but
established observational approach when evaluating some physical job demands in
occupational groups with variable work. However, supplementation of
accelerometry with descriptive data from other methodologies (e.g., exposure
diary, questionnaire, focus groups) is warranted to provide important
information regarding the nature of workers' exposure to postural loading,
exertion demands and task activity.

%X An epidemiological study conducted by the NTOF surveillance system of the
National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH), analyzed 15 years of data
(1980-1994) to identify work settings in which fatal falls were likely to
occur, and the risk factors that contributed to those falls. Eight thousand one
hundred and two (8,102) workers were reported to have died as a result of falls
from elevations during the 15-year period. The construction industry accounted
for 4,044 of those deaths, or roughly 50% of all fatal falls from elevations.
Within the construction industry sub-group (NAICS 23611), the NTOF identified
general contracting and roofing as the work setting with the highest risk
factors for a fall from elevation, with 205 and 147 falls respectively. The
purpose of this study is to examine the effect that locomotion on an inclined
surface has on flat surface postural stability. All subjects who volunteered as
participants (n=20; males), were tested under two walking conditions: flat
surface and inclined walking on a 12 x 15' pitched roof segment to determine if
there was a difference in sway velocity following exposure. Data were collected
over four, ten-second trials, under eyes open and eyes closed conditions.
Performance was measured using the recordings made by the NeuroCom Balance
Master System. Balance was recorded in sway velocity (degrees/second), where
the value was representative of the change in center of gravity (COG) in the
anterior, posterior, medial, or lateral directions. The angular change of the
COG per unit time was summed and divided by ten-seconds to achieve an average
sway velocity of the COG. These data were evaluated using a 2 (pre/post) x 2
(eyes) x 2 (flat walking, inclined walking) within-subjects repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the dependent variable being sway velocity
(deg/sec). Paired sample t-tests served as post hoc analysis. The analysis
concluded that the average sway velocity of the COG resulted in a significant
main effect following the inclined walking task: p &le;.001. The findings have
practical implications when dealing with the construction industry. On a daily
basis, roofers ascend and conduct roofing related tasks for prolonged periods
of time. Following exposure to the pitched roof setting, roofers must move from
the roof to scaffolding or a ladder to descend. These findings suggest that
there is a significant decrement in postural stability due to exposure to
inclination. Postural stability is critical in ascending and descending ladders
and scaffolding on flat surfaces. Possible areas of future research that might
impact postural stability could potentially involve roof jacks, work boot
design, and work rest cycles.

%X Despite projections of a substantial increase of older adults in the working
population, studies addressing the effects of age on muscular performance are
still limited. The purpose of this study was to examine age-related differences
in muscular endurance, fatigue, and recovery during prolonged static exertions.
Groups of 24 younger and 16 older participants performed isometric arm
abductions until exhaustion at 30, 50 and 70% of individual strength. Recovery
was determined over 15-minutes following the end of the exercise.
Electromyographic signals obtained from the middle deltoid muscle were used to
evaluate fatigue progression during the exercise. Compared to the younger
participants, the older individuals exhibited lower muscular strength, longer
endurance time, slower fatigue progressions, less reduction in muscle strength,
and shorter recovery periods. This study suggests that fatigue-related
differences exist between age groups, and the results may be used to better
design task for older workers.

%X The study was conducted to evaluate relationships among walking velocity,
heel contact velocity, and friction demand. Particularly, the study attempted
to ask if two age groups (younger and older groups) differed in walking
velocity and heel contact velocity, and how these gait parameters influenced
friction demand characteristics in two age groups. 14 younger (7 females and 7
males, 18 to 30 years old) and 14 older (7 females and 7 males, over 65 years
old) adults participated in the study. Kinematic and kinetic data were measured
using 6 infrared cameras and 2 force plates mounted on the walking track. The
primary goal of the study was to evaluate if walking velocity (whole body COM
velocity) and heel contact velocity with advancing age influenced friction
demand characteristics. The results indicated that older adults walked slower,
exhibited lower heel contact velocity, and produced lower friction demand in
comparison to younger adults. The study suggested that walking velocity could
be a good indicator for predicting friction demand characteristics.

%X Understanding successful reactive-recovery is essential to further
exploration of slip induced fall event. The objective of the current study was
to characterize the net ankle joint moment pattern during reactive-recovery
process. Six out of fifteen healthy young adults were selected as input for the
current investigation. The three-dimensional (3D) inverse dynamics approach was
applied to calculate net ankle joint moments in all the three planes (frontal,
sagittal and transverse). Gait conditions (normal and reactive-recovery)
significantly affected the absolute ankle peak moment and time to peak at P
&le; 0.05 level. The time to peak in the ankle frontal plane was the only one
not affected. The ankle frontal and transverse joint moment was found to play
an important role during the reactive-recovery process. Consequently, the
necessity of a complete 3D joint moment analysis especially for slip and fall
incidents was justified.

%X Falls precipitated by slipping are listed among the leading causes of
occupational injuries. Several factors influence the risk of slips and falls,
including perception of surface conditions. A study was conducted to
investigate if perceptions of slipperiness and stability are related to slip
distance at heel strike during normal walking. The investigation compared
objective and subjective measures for thirty-one participants ranging in age
from 19-67 years old. Participants were evaluated while walking at three
velocities over three floor surfaces. The results indicated that there were
significant differences in slip distance caused by floor surfaces, but
perceptions did not reflect these changes. Correlations between slip distance
and subjective evaluations of slipperiness and stability were r = -0.18,
partially due to a large variability in perceptions between individuals. Small
slips were not generally perceived, but a uniform cutoff distance could not be
identified that would be appropriate for most individuals.

%X A mathematic prediction model based on numerical method is investigated for
human arm-reaching movement. Unlike the previous solutions that optimized
certain cost functions with global nonlinear multi-constraints of the
kinematics and kinetics, the model applies Listing's Law to reduce the degrees
of freedom. The rotation vectors, which describe arm positions as a rotation
relative to given reference positions, are confined to a flat range called
Listing's plane. The major benefit of this model is that it is biologically
plausible and supported by other experimental results and the model requires
little computation aim to find a feasible, not necessarily optimal path;
therefore, make it more applicable for biomechanical simulation. The anatomical
assumptions and the model development are detailed and a validating experiment
was conducted. The result of experiment shows that the proposed method
generated the motion trajectory with reduced calculation complexity.

%X An optimization-based three-dimensional (3D) model for power grip posture
prediction was proposed. The model was based on the premise that the hand
prehensile configuration in a power grip best conforms to the object shape.
This premise was embodied by an optimization procedure that minimized the sum
of distances from the finger joints to the object surface. The model was
evaluated against data from an experiment that measured the grip postures of 28
subjects having diverse anthropometry. The intra- and inter-person
variabilities in grip postures were empirically assessed and used as benchmark
values for model evaluation. The evaluation showed that the root-mean-square
(RMS) values of angle differences between the predicted and measured postures
had a 13.7&deg; grand mean (across all joints, subjects, and two cylindrical
handles grasped), whereas the RMS values of the inter-person and intra-person
variabilities in measured postures had grand means of 13.0&deg; and 4.4&deg;,
respectively. The model can be readily generalized to the prediction of
postures in power-grasping objects of different shapes, and adapted for testing
alternative prehensile strategies or performance criteria.

%X Laparoscopic surgery is a rapidly increasing field in healthcare today.
However, current laparoscopic tools have inadequate handle designs and have
been directly linked to post-surgery pain among surgeons. This study recruited
forty subjects (20 male, 20 female) to evaluate the effect of handle design as
well as target location on accuracy, precision, and wrist posture during an
aiming task. Two laparoscopic tools were used for this study: a commercially
available scissor-grip tool and a custom-designed ergo-grip tool. Each subject
was asked to aim through a trocar at the center of one of five targets using
one of the tools. The target was viewed by a laparoscopic camera and presented
on a television. The results of this study showed that accuracy and precision
were affected by both target position and tool; however, the differences were
small (&lt;2 mm). Wrist flexion and ulnar deviation angles were affected by
both target position and tool. Differences due to target position were expected
given different hand locations are required to hit each target. Flexion angle
was significantly smaller for the ergo-grip tool as opposed to the scissor-grip
tool. Ulnar deviation angle was significantly smaller for the scissor-grip tool
than for the ergo-grip tool. All but one subject preferred the ergogrip tool
when performing the task, suggesting that wrist flexion is a stronger predictor
of comfort than ulnar deviation though both should be considered when designing
ergonomic hand tools.

measured by extension, flexion, ulnar, and radial deviation, was compared
across three independent variables: repetition (repetitive or alternative),

were used during a graphical computer task, which was repeated or alternated
for two 30 minute test sessions. Neutral wrist range was defined within 15

significantly impact wrist extension, F (3,16) = 9.42, p&lt;.001 and ulnar
deviation, F (3, 16) = 3.23, p &lt;.05. When analyzing repetition while using

movement outside the defined neutral range for extension. A significant
repetition by session interaction effect for wrist flexion was revealed: F (1,

during the first session which was statistically different than the alternative
group; both groups were inside the neutral range.

%X Currently, voters must physically go to voting booths to participate in
civic elections. Among others, a busy lifestyle and inability to make it to the
voting booths has been cited as one of reasons for a low voter turnout. This
has prompted research concentrating on the use of Internet for voting. Internet
has its limitations in availability and mobility. We propose a cell-phone based
voting system that could potentially overcome these limitations. A
within-subject usability study compared a prototype cell phone based UI with a
PC based UI. Eight participants completed the task of casting a vote using the
two interfaces and rated them on various dimensions. Results indicate that the
concept although acceptable, has social and security concerns. With the
cellphone interface, limited information displayed and global navigation were
identified as prime drawbacks. Research on explicit CHI patterns for cell
interfaces may address the CHI issues identified.

%X Much of our personal information flows through the Internet as we receive
online services or make online transactions, making it essential to have
reliable security systems to protect against information theft, denial of
service, and fraud. The most commonly used method for authentication and
identification is entering the username-password combination. However, this
method is weak because users select passwords that are easy to remember and
easy to crack. We evaluated a sentence-generation method designed to improve
recall and security. The sentence-generation method produced crack-resistant
passwords when the users were instructed to embed a digit and special character
into the sentence (and password). However, the requirements of including a
digit and special character also resulted in a cost in the memorability of the
password. An analysis of errors identified three areas of research that may
develop techniques that promote better recall of passwords using this
sentence-generation method.

%X It is difficult to evaluate the usability of large-scale enterprise software
because it is customized to each company's business process when it is
implemented. Remote Contextual Inquiry is a research technique that allows
software teams to remotely view how software users interact with the system and
the types of software customizations that have been made. Understanding how
users interact with the software and the types of customizations made during
implementation can help designers and product managers prioritize existing
features for redesign and describe the need for new features.

%X The Web environment produces new challenges for Human Factor specialists who
are transitioning their development organizations and clients from traditional
software media to Web-based applications. While the Web offers new potential
for deployment, its technical capabilities often limit techniques for user
interaction and data manipulation PC-based GUIs offer. Conventions for
operation of web applications are still ill-formed; concepts for website design
rarely translate well to the design of task-based, enterprise-level
applications; and stakeholders often mistake their own, idiosyncratic operation
of websites as premises for effective design. This paper teaches practitioners
techniques for creating or migrating software applications from traditional
media to the Web, based on a case study of creating a web-access cargo
management system. Discussion includes dealing with unrealistic visions of an
application's operation in relation to the user population who will be
operating it, developing alternatives to traditional forms of personnel
training, and creating new controls and interaction schema.

Test was evaluated in two rounds of usability testing. Participants were
assigned to one of two conditions: Think-Aloud, in which they talked about what
they were doing; or Retrospective-Report, in which they completed the form and
then talked about their experience while viewing a recording. Participants also
completed follow-up tasks. Sessions were video taped and logged. Round 1
testing identified 28 usability issues. Round 2 testing found that 13 of the
issues had been resolved following design changes made to the interface. Round
2 testing identified 21 new and continuing usability issues. Results suggest
that changes made to the interface increased the likelihood that respondents
would be able to successfully complete the form. Task completion times in the
think-aloud condition were only slightly longer than they were in the
retrospective condition, while retrospective reports required a substantial
amount of added time.

%X In a growing number of domains, users are presented with huge volumes of
data that they are required to parse in order to accomplish their goals.
Interface designers are experimenting with a variety of design manipulations to
facilitate user's identification and analysis of these data. Many domains
present information in grids, such as the side-by-side comparison of products
prevalent at many e-commerce web sites. Further assistance can be provided by
using color-coding, ranking systems and other visualization techniques. This
study investigates the use of color-coding and ranking on tasks that require
either focused or integrative analysis of tabular data. The results show that
each provides some benefit, but color-coding is superior. The presence of both
manipulations degrades performance, suggesting some degree of information
overload. Furthermore, despite the prevalence of these techniques, instructions
that explained how they were relevant to the task were necessary to achieve the
performance improvement. The implications of these results are discussed.

%X Collaboration between human factors and marketing can have a significant
impact on the profitability of retail, particularly on the Internet where
comprehensive information systems can be used to model customer and product
relationships. This paper presents a case study through which the capabilities
of intelligent recommendation systems to achieve persuasive design are
demonstrated. A web site for a department store was created that provides
targeted recommendations to customers based on functional relationships between
products and customer profile information where available. The site was
designed to present only recommendations that closely match the needs of the
customer and establish a trusted relationship. An empirical study was conducted
to verify that the goals of the site were attained. Participants rated the
recommendations as relevant, unobtrusive, and reported an enhanced shopping
experience. Privacy requirements were also maintained. This case study
demonstrates that understanding and designing for the needs of the customer can
significantly enhance the opportunity to increase sales to online retail
customers.

%X Users often come to websites with a specific type of purpose or goal, which
defines how the user interacts with the site. Two types of task-goals addressed
in this study include general browsing and specific information seeking.
Likewise, the design and organization of different websites can facilitate
different user goals. User satisfaction and frustration from interacting with a
particular website depends on the compatibility between the website design and
the user's type of goal. This study applies simulation techniques to
investigate how the compatibility between user goals and website design impacts
user satisfaction and frustration levels. The simulation results show that
navigation tools that increase compatibility versus attractiveness (the
increased likelihood of use) have a greater impact on customer satisfaction and
could in turn maximize the effectiveness of website usage.

%X This research addresses the topic of three-level menu structures, now
commonly found in e-commerce web sites, by measuring the performance and
preference effects of different menu location combinations. Two studies were
conducted, each using 16 different participants. The first study compared
combinations of left and top menu positions across three menu levels. The
results indicated a benefit when the first (primary) menu level was located on
the left side of the screen, and when second and third menu levels were grouped
in the same plane, opposite from the primary menu. The second study included a
comparison of right-side menus. The results confirmed the benefit of grouping
the second and third menu levels in the same plane, and suggest the value of
locating the primary menu level on the right side. Finally, users preferred
primary menus that were located in the left or right planes rather than the top
plane. The results have important implications for the design of multi-level
web site menu structures and represent a first-step towards providing
empirical-based guidelines to site designers.

fully functional, information retrieval systems. The systems were identical in
all respects except that one offered automated assistance while the other did
not. The study used a client side automated assistance application, a 2G Text
REtrieval Conference document collection and six topics. Results from the
empirical evaluation indicate that automated assistance can statistically
improve searching performance; however, the improvement is not as dramatic as
one might expect, with an approximately 20% performance increase, as measured
by number of relevance documents retrieved. We discuss the implications for Web
systems and future research.

%X Because of the extensive use of search engines on the Internet, even small
improvements in usability can lead to huge benefits in productivity and
effectiveness. Unfortunately, Internet users have consistently shown that they
are unable or unwilling to use Boolean operators effectively. This paper
presents an investigation of the use of embedded Boolean search hints to
improve user search query construction. These hints consist of short, targeted
in-line messages that present task-focused instruction on the use of Boolean
operators. Three types of help content were studied: semantic, syntactic, and
exemplar. The results indicate that inline help can significantly improve
performance. However, the improvement was produced only when the content
specifically matched the users' needs. Furthermore, some unexpected results
suggest that users' experience with other Boolean interfaces can impair
performance. Implications for search interface design are discussed.

%X Intranet portals can provide a centralized source of company information,
web applications, and external links that are customized for the needs of each
employee, increasing employee productivity and effectiveness. However, they are
only effective when they support user needs in an effective and usable fashion.
In 2003, Florida International University (FIU) began the process of creating
an intranet portal for use by its 34,000 students. The portal would provide
web-based email functionality along with profile-driven University information
and preference-based external links. This is expected to increase student use
of the FIU email system, facilitate dissemination of FIU information to
students, improve achievement of educational goals, streamline university
processes such as registration, provide cost savings to the university, and
increase student satisfaction. This paper describes the user-centered design
process that was used to create the MyFIU portal and provides guidance for the
development of Intranet portals.

%X Since its inception, the World Wide Web has flourished. While advances have
been made in the general area of web usability, little attention has been paid
to developing theories of human-web interaction. Accordingly, Neisser's (1976)
perceptual cycle, which unifies research on action, perception, and cognition,
is used as a framework for a human-web interaction (HuWI) cycle. The HuWI cycle
assumes that while users interact with a website, in order to locate certain
pieces of information, they sample only goal-relevant information from the
website. Users then modify their knowledge of the system, based on the
goal-relevant information that was acquired. This newly modified system
knowledge then directs their interaction further.

%X Farris (2003) proposed the Human-Web Interaction (HuWI) cycle, which
predicts that 1) system knowledge (i.e., one's knowledge base) will direct
interaction with a website, 2) system knowledge will be modified by the user's
interaction with the website, and 3) only goal-relevant information should be
attended to during these interactions. This paper describes two experiments
that tested these three predictions. In Experiment 1, performance was worse
when participants' system knowledge was inconsistent with a website, which
suggests that system knowledge was directing interaction with the website. In
addition, participants tested for knowledge of the content before and after
interacting with the website demonstrated higher posttest scores than pretest
scores, which indicates that system knowledge was modified by interacting with
the website. In Experiment 2, participants attended primarily to goal-relevant
information, if the goal pertained to content. These findings generally support
the validity of the HuWI cycle.

%X How can distance educators format materials so that they maximize usability
and optimize learning? Several web-writing characteristics have been identified
that address these questions. "Objective" writing, most analogous to
educational text, presents information without exaggerations or boasting.
"Concise" and "scannable" writing omit superfluous information and support
visual scanning by highlighting key features, respectively. "Combined" writing
aggregates characteristics from the objective, concise, and scannable styles.
Previous research suggests that, in contrast to results from the commercial
domain, these writing styles do not influence memory of distance education
materials. This discrepancy is possibly due to measurement differences. To
address this issue, the present study employed recognition (i.e.,
multiple-choice) and guided recall (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) tasks in order to
assess the efficacy of the writing styles in a distance education context. The
results, however, confirmed the earlier findings, i.e., regardless of the
material's writing format, memory for web site content was unaffected.

participants received neither exposure nor instruction to use breadcrumb
navigation. Upon completing a list of search tasks, Condition I participants
spent less time, visited fewer web pages, and relied less on other methods of

design of new integrated management information systems, basic data capture
issues must not be ignored or minimized. If data is not captured, it will not
be available within the information system, regardless of whether it is a
paper-based or a digital system. This macroergonomic analysis evaluated the
medical data generated at the frontline as well as current and proposed data
capture procedures. Another key component was an evaluation of the healthcare
providers at that level of care. The results were compiled into three key
design strategies relevant for the next acquisition cycle of medical data
capture devices.

information technology (IT) jobs in five companies. The following QWL factors
were examined: job satisfaction, fatigue, tension, organizational involvement,
and burnout. The following predictors of QWL were studied: IT demands, role
ambiguity, decision control, challenge and demographics (age, marital status,
parental status, and education). Analysis shows that in our sample women in IT
jobs do not report poorer QWL than men in IT jobs. On the contrary, women
report greater organizational involvement than men.

%X The first Cambodian families arrived in Lowell (Massachusetts) in the early
80s, most of them as refugees, victims of a brutal regime. Since then, the city
has grown into the second largest Cambodian-American population in the U.S.,
behind only Long Beach, California. Cambodian workers are employed in
labor-intensive jobs as well as in the service industry in the Lowell area and
its surroundings. As many other immigrant groups in the U.S., they face several
work and non-work related problems above and beyond their various language and
culture barriers. In this paper the author presents results of a pilot study
aimed at exploring Cambodian workers' perceptions of their conditions of work
and the impact of such conditions in their quality of working life.

%X One reason for implementing a macroergonomic approach is the belief that it
will yield improvements sustained over time. Between January 2000 and June
2001, an injury prevention program was implemented with U.S. Army students
attending Advanced Individual Training (AIT) as Combat Medics. The highly
successful original intervention included a general (2000) and a targeted
(2001) program that reduced clinic visits for musculoskeletal complaints and
decreased limited duty days. Two and a half years later, there is a continued
decline in new profiles (limited duty assignments) among women (6.9% in 2000,
5.6% in 2001, and 3.1% per week in 2003), and slightly higher, but still low,
new profiles for men (3.2% in 2000, 1.4 in 2001, and 2.5% per week in 2003). In
addition, fewer soldiers are held over in AIT due to training related injuries
(3% vs. &lt; 1%). Although many factors can influence changes over time, AIT
leadership and the authors believe the two most significant factors are the
standard physical training program and the accountability process.

%X The role of supervisors to aid injured workers by accessing health care and
providing reasonable accommodations has been suggested as a means to prevent
prolonged disability among workers experiencing musculoskeletal pain and
discomfort. Based on a macroergonomic approach, a 4-hour supervisor training
workshop was designed to optimize supervisors' responses to work injuries
through improved communication and accommodation. Supervisors from two
industries provided high ratings of the workshop, and showed post-training
improvements in injury-related attitudes and perceived ability to communicate
with and accommodate injured workers effectively. Workers' compensation claims
data in the 7 months before and after the workshop showed a 47% reduction in
new claims and an 18% reduction in active lost-time claims versus 27% and 7%
respectively, in the control group. Improving the response of frontline
supervisors to employees' work-related health and safety concerns may produce
sustainable reduction in injury claims and disability costs.

%X In industrially developing countries where there are so many minor to major
problems across the broad spectrum of basic to sophisticated work sites, and
where there is little knowledge of ergonomics, the very limited number of
qualified Ergonomists are often 'forced' into taking a micro or macro approach
to deal with the immediate problem as soon and as effectively as possible. Two
recent requests for an investigation of the Human Operator-Task interaction
(micro level) reiterated the clear need for a micro-macro approach in the
analysis of any work site no matter what the reported problems are.

%X Organizations have come to rely on implementing new technology as a critical
component of their competitive strategy. Implementing new technology allows
companies to improve efficiency, productivity, quality, safety, working
conditions, and profitability. Much of this potential is never realized; as a
study found that 40% of companies had not achieved the intended benefits from
the new technology. The study further stated that 10% of these new technology
implementation problems were for technical reasons; whereas most problems
occurred for human and organizational reasons. Effective new technology
implementation requires considering all factors involved in the implementation
process as: new technology characteristics, organization structure, task
factors, environmental characteristics, and human factors. It is suggested to
utilize a cooperative approach implementing new technology, relying on employee
participation and teamwork. By taking a total systems view of the situation;
and being aware to the existing interactions; it is hoped that the new
technology can be implemented in the most effective way possible. A case study
is presented to illustrate this.

hour care subjects patients to multiple transitions in care. These transitions,
or turnovers, are potential points of failure but have not been intensively
studied. We observed care transitions in 5 EDs as part of a study on safety in
emergency care and found that very different sorts of handovers occur in
different settings. Based on these observations, we propose a conceptual
framework for characterizing turnover events. The ability to characterize
certain types of transitions may help clarify future studies and assist in
crafting interventions to the context of work.

%X Sleep deprivation, by impairing performance capacity, threatens health and
safety across both civilian and military sectors. The Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research (WRAIR) has developed a sleep management system (SMS)
which provides a sociotechnical template for research in this area. A
literature review was conducted to lay the groundwork for development of
additional empirical research studies relative to sleep deprivation in order to
further develop the sleep management system. Based on the existing body of
knowledge regarding sleep deprivation effects on cognitive performance, and
based on the ongoing development of the sleep management system, we suggest
that a macroergonomic or sociotechnical systems approach to intervention may be
useful in optimizing health and safety performance. This paper reviews the
pertinent sleep deprivation literature and outlines the important issues for a
macroergonomic research agenda.

to work in shifts. We observed shift transitions in 5 EDs as part of a study on
safety in emergency care. We found the observable characteristics of shift
transitions to be highly variable across institutions and dynamically variable
within shift change episodes. However, across all sites, turnovers were
interactional rather than transactional, and were highly tailored to the
immediate context. The high degree of situatedness in the turnovers suggest
they are not likely to be adapted to a standardized tool or protocol.

across various outpatient surgery centers and to address the relationship
between patient safety climate and job categories, individual outpatient
centers and the respondents' Quality of Working Life (QWL). Our results
indicate that four safety climate scales (1) Top management commitment to
patient safety, (2) General patent safety climate, (3) Employee commitment to
patient safety, and (4) Change in patient safety can be created from the
12-item questionnaire and they may be a useful measure of an outpatient surgery
center's patient safety climate. The four patient safety climate scales are
also significantly associated with the outpatient surgery centers employees'
QWL.

is discussed as a tool for understanding the work domain and for guiding the
development of new electronic patient record interfaces, in our case for use by
rheumatologists. In particular, CWA is discussed from the point of view of the
abstraction hierarchy (AH) framework, and an initial AH of the patient
information system work domain is presented.

medication labels. The primary goals of this system are to verify the
medications about to be given to a particular patient are those ordered and to
document the process. The PDA version is intended to meet the same goals
utilizing a scanner built into the PDA itself, but also offer the benefits of a
small, light-weight, mobile system. The evaluation involved usability
inspection, usability testing, and structured interviews. The results describe
(1) how the operating system's virtual keyboard display interacted with
critical data in the application; (2) how the application software developers
dealt with the challenge of a small screen size and the implications of those
decisions; and (3) how users adapted their workflow attempting to maximize the
benefits of greater mobility, while compensating for a loss in visibility.

%X There are many potential benefits associated with the use of computerized
clinical reminders for both health care providers and patients. Clinical
reminders are designed to reduce the likelihood that an aspect of care will
"fall though the cracks" during a busy exam, ensure that care is
well-documented so that the range of health care providers interacting with
each patient will have full access to the patient history, and increase
standardization across patient exams. While most agree that the concept of
clinical reminders is good, recent research indicates that some providers do
not use clinical reminders when available (Demakis et al, 2000). This paper
describes the qualitative portion of a survey study aimed at exploring the
perceived facilitators and barriers to clinical reminder use within Veterans
Administration health care facilities.

%X Imaging systems are used increasingly in surgical procedures such as
laparoscopy. Depth perception is degraded compared with open surgery because
the image provided by a laparoscopic camera is two-dimensional and represents a
single viewing perspective. One way to compensate for this loss of depth
information is with multiple cameras, each providing a different perspective.
We measured performance of a pick-and-place task when observers viewed the task
environment with three cameras concurrently (top, front, side views) or with
one camera. Performance was slower with camera viewing compared with direct
viewing and slowest with the side view. Although concurrent presentation of
three camera views did not improve performance, observers looked almost
exclusively at one of these views (top). Future research should determine
whether observers can be trained to use depth information provided by multiple
cameras. It is important to determine how to configure imaging systems so that
surgical procedures can be optimized.

%X The Veterans Health Administration uses a software application called Bar
Code Medication Administration (BCMA) to assist in medication administration.
The wireless application is typically operated on a desktop or laptop computer,
physically located on a mobile cart during med passes. It works with a handheld
bar code reader to scan patient wristbands and their medications to verify a
match between the patient identified and the medications scheduled at the time
of the scanning. Since replacing the paper-based system with this technology
the rate of medication errors has declined significantly. After a participatory
design process developing an overview display for BCMA, it was concluded such
an additional view on the patient and medication data has promising safety and
efficiency benefits by (1) integrating the current med pass view with a broader
summary of medications active in +/- 24 hours and the patient's condition, so
that relationships can more easily be seen; and a natural direct manipulation
mechanism to zoom in for more details would be provided; (2) including a
picture of the patient as an additional form of identification; (3) supporting
perceptual and mechanical filtering to separate medications by attributes (e.g.
time due and status) and facilitate efficient situation awareness and
prioritization of actions; (4) including status information for medication
orders in other nurses' med passes so they can more easily collaborate; (5) for
each medication showing both the last action and next action, so that status
information can be used to maintain awareness of what has happened and is going
to happen from a medication perspective.

%X Simulation-based training is a promising instructional approach for training
military and civilian medical first responders such as EMTs. There is a need
for first responder training in cognitively-based skills such as situation
assessment and decision making. We are developing a training program for first
responders that uses mannequin-based simulation technology effectively to fill
this training need for valid meaningful scenarios that can be integrated into
the curriculum and applicable for a variety of EMT skill levels. The program
will provide detailed scenarios, instructions for administering the program,
and measures for performance feedback. Each scenario will exercise a
combination of skills and the set of scenarios will span all of the
higher-level skills that have been identified as benefiting from targeted
training. We discuss here the iterative process of designing and developing the
first of these scenarios which has been shown to be capable of tapping into and

%X With the recent attention on patient safety, there is an increased interest
in standardized training for laparoscopic surgeons. Studies have shown that
laparoscopic simulators can be used to train surgical skills. A comparison of
two popular systems (a real physical model and a virtual model) was conducted
to determine the relative effectiveness of the systems for training purposes.
Twenty-two medical students and surgical residents were tested on both
simulators. Time to task completion and errors committed were recorded and
compared. Our results showed that the physical training system was more
sensitive to the experience levels of the subjects than the virtual system, and
may be more effective as a tool for standardized training. However, as virtual
reality technology becomes better developed, and surgeons become more familiar
with the technology, we may see a change.

%X Human Factors research on warning systems may have relevance beyond the
specific domain of operators receiving warnings about potential problems in
technological systems. We present an analysis of physicians' responses to
letters generated by an automated decision support system in terms of findings
in the human factors literature on warnings. The automated system mails
reminders to primary medical teams about patients requiring screening or
lipid-lowering drugs. The effectiveness of the system depends, among other
factors, on physicians' responses to the reminders. Some properties of the
reminder letter have parallels in warning systems. They should affect
physicians' responses as they affect the responses of operators of
technological systems. We report the results of preliminary analyses of data
after a 16 months follow-up of 6,571 patients. The compliance rate to
recommendations in the letters in the intervention group, in which physicians
receive reminder letters, was significantly higher than in the control group.
Physicians in the control group were found to be less compliant as the number
of their patients requiring the medical care grows. In contrast, physicians in
the intervention group, who received the reminder letters, maintained similar
levels of compliance irrespective of the number of patients who required their
care. Thus the letters appear to provide valuable information for physicians
who have to cope with more difficult patient populations.

%X To accommodate the increased number of patients receiving care at home, more
and more medical devices are being taken out of the controlled clinical setting
and are being used by lay caregivers in a home environment, thereby posing
risks for misuse, malfunction and error. It has therefore become critical to
examine the environment of medical devices being used in the home and to ensure
that products intended for home healthcare use are being designed so that lay
users can learn, operate, and maintain them with greater safety, satisfaction,
accuracy, and comfort. This panel brings together representatives of four
stakeholder groups associated with this issue -- regulatory agencies, human
factors professionals, the user population, and medical device developers.
Panelist presentations and the ensuing discussion will focus on the concerns,
issues, problems, and/or liabilities associated with medical devices migrating
into the home, from each of these groups' perspectives.

%X The purpose of this study was to characterize functional limitation in
seated manual transfer tasks for low back pain (LBP), spinal cord injury (SCI),
and control subjects. Seated subjects performed either two- or one-handed
transfer tasks to one of three targets 87cm above the hip-point at 0, 45, and
90&deg; azimuths. Three torso angles (flexion, lateral bending, and axial
rotation) were obtained from captured motions and modeled by combinations of
B-spline base functions. The results demonstrated that 1) the SCI and LBP
subjects exhibit smaller torso flexion than controls; 2) the SCI subjects tend
to move the torso (lateral bending and extension) away from the target; and 3)
these group differences are reduced in one-handed transfers and light load
conditions. The movement patterns suggest that SCI patients may have adapted
strategies to compensate for the limited control of upper body balance, while
LBPs may limit torso motion to avoid pain.

%X We examined performance on a maze-drawing task under conditions designed to
simulate hand-assisted laparoscopy (a form of minimally invasive surgery in
which the surgeon's non-dominant hand is inserted into the patient's abdominal
cavity through an enlarged incision). The task was completed without direct
vision, with participants relying solely on the image from a laparoscopic
camera to guide their movements. On half the trials, participants held their
non-dominant hand in view of the camera. We varied camera angle (offset in
azimuth by 0&deg;, 90&deg;, 180&deg;, or 270&deg;), and measured spatial
visualization ability. Both camera angle and spatial ability affected overall
performance, and these two factors interacted. At 90&deg;, having the hand in
view significantly improved performance for all participants, but at 270&deg;
it impaired low spatial participants. At 0&deg;, 90&deg;, and 180&deg;, the
performance of high and low spatial participants differed significantly only
when the hand was in view. Correlations supported the interpretation that
hand-in-view accentuated, rather than attenuated, the relationship between
spatial ability and performance. The findings have potential implications for
surgeons using hand-assisted laparoscopic techniques in minimally invasive
procedures.

%X Endoscopic surgery offers substantial advantages over traditional open
surgery, but endoscopic techniques require considerable practice and have been
reported to induce high levels of stress in the surgeon. Some of that stress is
believed to arise because of perceptual-motor distortions associated with the
endoscopic interface. Prominent among those distortions is the disruption of
normal eye-hand mapping in the endoscopic environment. The present study used
the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire to determine the stress profile
associated with performance in a simple endoscopic simulator under varying
degrees of distortion of eye-hand mapping. The results indicated distinct
stress profiles associated with different levels of hand-eye mapping
distortion.

%X Current endoscopic instrumentation cannot replicate the haptic feedback
available during open surgery. Distracting friction forces in the interface
make it difficult for surgeons to detect and differentiate between small-scale
surgical site forces. As a result, the visual channel is being used to process
information that should be available through the haptic sense. An experiment
was conducted to examine the effects of friction, when probing tissues of
dissimilar compliance. Results showed that the presence of friction in the
interface increased applied force by 45&deg;, contact time by 40&deg;, and
errors by a factor of 2 (100&deg;), while its absence increased human operator
confidence by 15&deg;. The effects of friction were generally more pronounced
in conditions with impaired visual cues but were also very strong when vision
was available. These results are applicable to the design of more effective
instrumentation for endoscopic surgery as well as robotic surgery.

%X The value of performing prospective analysis before technology
implementation is well known to the chemical, nuclear and aviation industries.
The performance of a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is now required
by healthcare organizations accredited by JCAHO as part of their patient safety
standards. However, most healthcare organizations have little experience with
applying human factors engineering techniques to process or technology
evaluation and the procedure of how and when healthcare organizations should
perform FMEA is not well described. This paper describes the method and
challenges of performing a process and design FMEA to prepare for the
implementation of a new intravenous infusion pump at a University Hospital.
Recommendations are made for the performance of a process and design FMEA for
new technology implementation in healthcare organizations.

%X While many advances have been made in surgical robotics technology, even for
surgeons with relatively high levels of robotic surgery experience, many tasks
take less time to perform manually. Although there are other benefits to
surgical robotics that may outweigh task completion time, relatively lower
efficiency will hinder the adoption of this technology. This study focused on
two interface parameters: Control-Display Gain (CDG, i.e., the amount of robot
movement resulting from a given robot controller movement) and the optical Zoom
level that defines the working field of view. Results from a study with 10
participants suggest that CDG is a promising interface parameter for optimizing
movement time in robot-assisted surgical tasks. The results have implications
for the development and implementation of intelligent surgeon-robot interface
technology and hold the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of
robotic-assisted surgery techniques.

%X A review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User
Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) was performed to identify medical
device incident trends relating to the type of device involved, incident
location, injury severity, the nature and/or cause of the event, and human
factors issues involved. A total of 317,931 medical device incident reports
submitted by manufacturers between the years 1997 and 2002 were reviewed. The
analysis revealed that 203,021 (64%) of these reports did not contain useful
event location information. Of the remaining reports, 102,303 (89%) incidents
occurred in hospitals, 6,153 (5%) incidents occurred in outpatient treatment
facilities, 2,511 (2%) incidents occurred in ambulatory surgical facilities,
and 3,157 (3%) incidents occurred at home. The majority of the incidents that
occurred at home involved blood glucose meters (42%), defibrillators (10%),
ventilators (8%), and wheelchairs (5%). Home incidents resulted in 108
fatalities and 776 injuries. The majority of the fatalities were associated
with defibrillators (32%), ventilators (19%), oximeters (8%), and hemodialysis
devices (6%). Seven of the 21 fatal home ventilator-related incidents were
attributed to low, delayed, or non-sounding alarms. Hospital incidents
comprised 102,303 records, with 2,046 incidents resulting in fatalities. A
large share of the fatal hospital incidents were related to defibrillators
(11%), catheters (11%), heart valves (10%), pacemakers (5%), and ventilators
(4%). Six fatal hospital ventilator-related incidents were attributed in part
to delayed, silenced, or non-sounding alarms.

%X To diagnose and treat vestibular disorders, physicians presently manipulate
the patient's head and neck, or whole body, through prescribed maneuvers. This
project developed a device to aid physicians in such maneuvers while
accommodating back and neck pain sufferers. An investigation was conducted into
the physiological and mechanical properties of the vestibular system and into
the current medical procedures through literature review, observational task
analysis, and other analyses. The problems faced by practitioners when engaging
patients with current practices and medical devices were identified and a set
of recommendations and design implications were created. In questioning the
medical procedure, a theory was developed to provide diagnosis and treatment in
a more innovative and effective manner. The project considers human factors,
safety, functionality and the needs of both doctors and patients.

%X Telemedicine systems have been found to increase access to patient care and
decrease healthcare costs. However, the widespread adoption and use of
telemedicine technologies has been low. The purpose of the present study was to
evaluate an existing store-and-forward teledermatology system used by the U.S.
military. The human factors issues that emerge in the evaluation of a
telemedicine system include user characteristics (e.g., motivation to use the
telemedicine system), macro-organizational issues (e.g., workload distribution,
communication between team members), and technology issues (e.g., comfort using
digital cameras or the World Wide Web). Users of the teledermatology system
completed a questionnaire and an interview session. The detailed data from the
structured interviews provided insight into the nature of these
macro-organizational, user characteristics, and technology issues. The goal of
this project was to illustrate how human factors methods can be used to
understand the factors that contribute to the success or failure of this
system, identify issues/potential problems, and provide recommendations for the
current system and guidance for the design of future systems.

%X In this study the working conditions of six spinal cord injured (SCI) and
one meningomyelocele (MMC) subject were evaluated with regard to risk factors
for neck and shoulder disorders. Each subject was visited by an ergonomist at
the workplace where the working conditions were documented by means of video
recordings, questionnaires and the ergonomist's evaluation of the workplace.
From situations identified, including the subject's own reporting of
problematic situations and layout of the workplace, possible changes were
discussed and implemented if feasible.
   A specific aim of the study was to see if a myofeedback method to be used
during work at the regular workplace was applicable and of use to promote a
more favourable activation of the neck- and shoulder muscles in this group of
subjects.
   The experiences from this study are that the employer had usually not
optimised the participating subjects' workplaces and that several easily
implemented changes could be made that improved the working conditions.
Regarding the myofeedback intervention, all of the subjects taking part
increased the amount of time where the trapezius muscle was in a rest-like
condition, which should be considered a change in a positive direction.

%X Many Americans have turned to dietary supplements for help in losing weight
despite the significant health risks associated with their use. This study
examines what people know and believe about dietary supplements. Results showed
that participants were generally knowledgeable about dietary supplements,
including their purpose, where they are sold, and the possibility that some
dietary supplements can have unhealthy side effects. However, participants'
knowledge and beliefs differed significantly as a function of gender,
educational status, and whether they had ever taken dietary supplements. Users
tended to perceive dietary supplements as less risky than participants who had
never used them. Both male and student participants held more optimistic
perceptions about the expected benefits and risks of dietary supplements, but
were less likely to read the labels on these products. These results indicate
that individual differences need to be taken into account when developing risk
communications to accompany dietary supplements. Future research should address
how knowledge gaps about dietary supplements can be addressed by educational
and warning materials to influence knowledge and beliefs with the goal of
providing needed information to make informed healthful decisions.

%X This paper describes a task analysis approach to usability engineering a
digital Emergency Medical Services system. In a hierarchical task analysis, we
decomposed user's workflow into major tasks and examined the compatibility
between software functionality and user's work process. In a cognitive task
analysis, we built an expanded GOMS model to account for user interaction at
the procedural level. The analyses revealed that the system's physical setup
made it difficult to be integrated into user's primary patient care tasks and
that the interface design put high demand on users' information processing
resources at both the cognitive and perceptual-motor levels. These results
complemented our previous work of heuristic evaluation of the same system but
allowed us to examine software usability issues in a broader context as well as
at a more fundamental level. The expanded GOMS analysis technique we introduced
here is also useful in the revision of the software's user interface.

%X This study used Pathfinder, a psychological scaling technique, to assess
underlying cognitive structure associated with mastery of relevant knowledge
necessary for anesthesiology decision-making. Our study revealed this approach
to be a valid method to assess the tacit knowledge that underlies clinical
expertise. A set of concepts associated with a decision-to-extubate scenario
was derived from expert interviews. Participants included nine attending
anesthesiologists, seven first-year anesthesiology residents, and eight
second-year anesthesiology residents. Pathfinder was applied to participants'
pairwise relatedness judgments of the clinical concepts in the context of the
scenario. Experts' data were aggregated to form an expert referent structure.
Student anesthesiologists were assessed based on comparison of their structures
to this referent. These comparisons yielded a knowledge score that was highly
correlated with residents' exam grades. This finding supports our position that
Pathfinder is a valid knowledge assessment method and, as a complement to
current exams, can be applied to assess a student's deep understanding of
anesthesiology concepts.

Twelve subjects were tested using three interface designs: 1) LCD menu
separated from operative site, 2) menu overlay on the operative site, and 3)
voice control. Results showed that voice control was the fastest in delivering
a command to the robot. Error rates and confidence levels were not
significantly affected by the interfaces. This research has implications for
designing future surgical robots to enhance the efficiency and safety of

%X A deficient safety culture has been implicated in industrial accidents. More
recently, patient safety problems in hospital care have revealed a weak safety
culture as a causal factor. As in the other industrial sectors, the level of
safety for hospital patients and staff is likely to be determined largely by
the hospital's safety culture.
   Measuring safety culture is a risk management technique widely used in
high-reliability industries to identify safety problems before they become
realised as accidents and near misses. The most common approach to measuring
safety culture is to conduct a safety climate survey of the workforce. A safety
climate survey typically assesses the workforce's attitudes and perceptions
about work pressure, communication, reporting and safety systems, and
supervision and management commitment to safety. Thus, safety climate surveys
provide a range of leading indicators about an organisation's underlying safety
culture, which need to be understood when designing and implementing safety

the construct validity of 13 instruments that have been used to assess safety
climate in healthcare. An explanatory model linking safety climate and safety
behaviours is proposed in order to develop more valid measures of safety

%X What role will human factors professionals play in healthcare 2020? Health
systems throughout the world face a number of common pressures, related to
demography, epidemiology, science and technology developments, and medical
demand. In particular, while developments in technology do not just provide
health care with new possibilities for human factors engineering, medical
interventions and therapies. They also produce changes the in our understanding
of sickness and health, the possibilities and needs for managing the systems,
for innovation, for standardization, and the political and economic
relationships. The health care providers not only have to cope with these
technological developments but assure their successful implementation and
acceptance. The uncertainties and expectations linked to these innovations face
major issues within the research and health care system, such as policies for
managing scarcity of resources and changes in the relative frequency of
diseases because of factors like ageing, and mobile global population and the
like. A panel of both healthcare and human factors experts will discuss the
role that human factors will play in healthcare in 2020.

regularly used in the prehospital setting by emergency medical personnel. The
purpose of the study was to demonstrate that design attention is needed to make
manual defibrillators more error resistant and less hazardous to patient
safety. Fourteen paramedics performed four tasks in a "laboratory" environment
that included a computerized Laerdal SimMan patient simulator. Even without
environmental factors and the urgency of actual life-saving situations, more
than twenty user interaction problems were found. Ten of the more prominent or
consistent problems found are discussed here, and a design solution is proposed

safer/more effective using user-centered design principles. Medication errors
may result from improper operation, mechanical failure, and tampering. The
present study evaluated the effectiveness and advantages of three intravenous
infusion pumps. Five evaluators used heuristic evaluation to identify,
categorize, and prioritize usability problems. Positive and negative features
were classified according to usability and design principles. The most common
negative feature was difficulty setting up an infusion. The most common
positive feature was visual feedback regarding pump status. The methodology was
effective at identifying a number of problems. Ongoing research involves
testing domain-experts to validate the severity of the usability problems
identified and discover other safety-relevant errors.

%X The Evidence at the Point of Care (EPoCare) project (Takeshita, Davis,
Straus, 2002) is examining how to put clinical evidence on mobile devices to
meet physicians' information needs at the point of care. Forty-seven
physicians, including family physicians, general internists and medical
residents, participated in usability testing with prototypes implemented on two
different form factors (a tablet-style PC and a PDA-style handheld). During the
testing physicians were asked to describe their impression of the prototype and
to indicate their agreement with 20 statements concerning the prototype
implementations. The three user groups differed in how they valued device
portability and screen size. Family physicians wanted larger screen size and
were less concerned with portability, while internists wanted portability and
were less concerned with screen size. Residents wanted both portability and
large screen size. Cluster analysis was used to identify four clusters of
physicians, varying by age, amount of time in clinical practice, and frequency
of use of search engines and medical databases. Differences in preferences
about format of information were present amongst these clusters. This study
demonstrates how large sample usability testing can be used to develop
customization strategies for mobile applications, for designing both form
factor and content.

objective of this study was to quantify muscle activity while using an

females) participated. A laboratory study using a repeated measures design was
used to test the effects of bed rise condition (manual, assisted), device
(ABNOSTRAIN, Bed Pull-Up), device anchor height (7", 13" above bed surface),
and head elevation angle (0&deg;, 30&deg;) on mean and peak muscle activity of
the upper and lower rectus abdominus and external oblique. Results indicated
that the use of a device significantly reduced muscle activity at all three
muscle sites evaluated compared to unassisted bed rising. Also, having a higher
anchor height or bed elevation angle further significantly reduced muscle
activity.

topographic representations for solving different tasks. The tasks involved
answering questions that either did or did not require elevation information
and were either focused or integrative. Integrative questions required
understanding the relationship of three separate locations. 2D representations
(i.e., contour maps) only showed a clear advantage for focused, non-elevation
questions with 3D representations not showing a clear advantage for any other
task condition. There were interactions between task type, dimensionality and
elevation. In addition, the integrative, elevation questions were clearly more
difficult regardless of dimension. In addition, participants' visualization
ability, as measured by a paper-folding test, correlated with their task
performance. Further work is proposed to look at how experience interacts with
these tasks and topographic representations.

%X Visual span, or the region of the visual field from which information is
extracted during a fixation, may vary as a function display complexity. As
display technology evolves, military tactical displays show increasing
quantities of information, often across large areas. To quantify the breadth
with which an operator may process information presented in a tactical display,
we related search performance to the amount of the display processed without an
eye movement. The derived visual span measure was used to test the possibility
that task requirements have an impact on the spatial extent of "at a glance"
processing. We compared visual span on searches based on threat affiliation
(color) to those based on a combination of threat affiliation and heading
(color and orientation) for two naval tactical symbol sets. We found that the
task an operator engaged in while searching a complex tactical display affected
the portion of the display that was processed "at a glance".

%X Previous research has indicated that smooth rotation of geographic terrain
between two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) views aids task switching.
However, the time taken to show the smooth rotation may also provide a terrain
preview for a post-rotation judgment. To test this possibility, we examined a
situation where preview was provided but smooth transition violated.
Twenty-four participants made judgments about the properties of two points
placed on 2D or 3D displays of terrain. Participants performed the tasks in
pairs of trials, switching tasks and displays between trials. In the continuous
transition condition, the display rotated in depth and in azimuth from one
display format to the other. In the discrete transition condition, the azimuth
rotation was in the opposite direction, and then the terrain "snapped" to the
final orientation. The results showed that response time after transition was
less for the continuous condition. We argue that smooth transition to the
correct position provided improved visual momentum between displays.

%X Pictorial depth cues and instructional set are two factors that influence
the degree to which size constancy maintains in static two-dimensional
perspective displays. Signal detection theory (SDT) allows the determination of
whether these factors influence observers' sensitivity to perceived size (d')
versus their subjective criteria (bias) for making "same" or "different"
discriminative responses. Two objects were presented at various perceived
distances in static perspective displays that varied in number of available
pictorial depth cues. Observers made comparative size judgments regarding the
objects' apparent distal size (phenomenal instructions) or objective distal
size (objective instructions). Observers showed greater sensitivity to distal
size differences when responding to apparent, rather than objective size
differences. The presence of more pictorial depth cues produced greater
sensitivity than a reduced-cue condition, especially under objective
instructions. Overall, results indicate that SDT reveals aspects of size
perception in pictorial displays not assessed through more traditional analyses
based solely on accuracy.

%X Complex safety-critical work domains such as anesthesia require human
operators to direct their attention appropriately. A sonification is a possible
method for directing attention to relevant changes while still allowing
monitoring under divided attention conditions. However, there is currently
little information to guide the design of sonification. Two experiments
investigated the effect of the number of auditory streams on ability to detect
changes (Experiment 1), and the effect of the number of auditory streams under
different attention conditions (Experiment 2). When monitoring with selective
attention, participants noted changes more accurately with three streams than
with one or two streams, but when there were also distracter changes
participants noted changes more accurately in multiple streams. Overall,
accuracy was lower when attention was divided than when it was selective, but
accuracy was especially low in the three-stream configuration. Distracter
changes increased divided attention accuracy. The results suggest that the
number of streams should be minimized if operators' attention will be divided
between monitoring and other tasks.

%X In the auditory warning literature, investigators have identified acoustic
parameters such as harmonicity and interpulse interval that affect perceived
urgency of a warning sound. In the present investigation, we asked whether
these parameters would affect visual orienting in a visual search task.
Participants located and identified visual targets in a large cluttered search
field. Audio cues to the target were also presented. In baseline conditions,
auditory cues varying in perceived urgency were presented alone, and the time
required to identify the visual target was measured. In the paired-cue
conditions, two audio cues were presented, one valid and one invalid. Cue
informativeness and cue urgency were manipulated. Performance interference was
measured as the difference in search latencies between the informative cue and
the corresponding cue in the baseline condition. Although baseline search
latencies were not affected by perceived urgency in the baseline conditions,
perceived urgency did affect the amount of interference produced by
uninformative cues in the paired-cued conditions.

polarities (Walker, 2002), as well as the addition of some contextual design
features (Bonebright, Nees, Connerley, &amp; McCain, 2001; Flowers, Buhman,
&amp; Turnage, 1997), in order to improve performance. However, little has been
done to quantify the performance effects of such features, or to investigate
effects of training in specific sonification tasks such as point estimation.
Smith and Walker (2002) took a step towards quantifying and comparing the
effects of adding several contextual design features. Presented here are
selected results from a comprehensive follow-on study comparing effects of
adding auditory context, either with or without training. The overall results
indicate that some kinds of auditory context improved performance, while others
did not. Training improved performance, and an interaction was discovered
between type of auditory context and type of training (Smith, 2003).

%X The degree to which distance can be perceived depends on combinations of
distance cues that are inherently ambiguous in isolation. Previous research on
combining distance cues has focused on static monocular cues and has shown an
additive relation. The present experiment was designed to examine how people
integrate monaural cues (loudness, delay of reception from initiation, and
frequency attenuation) to perceive distance. Monaural distance information was
presented to participants using desktop computers and headphones. A general
linear model (GLM) analysis revealed that monaural cues, much like visual cues,
are combined linearly to form a percept of distance, but with greater weighting
given to loudness. Thus, designers of spatial displays that might be used in
conditions of poor visibility could supply auditory cues for distance
information. Additionally, this paper could be seen as a step along the way in
understanding how people integrate multiple sources of information to perceive
distance.

%X Modern Traffic Advisory Systems (TAS) can increase flight safety by
providing pilots with real-time information about the locations of nearby
aircraft. However, most current collision avoidance systems rely on
non-intuitive visual and audio displays that may not allow pilots to take full
advantage of this information. In this experiment, we compared the response
times required for subjects participating in a fully-immersive simulated flight
task to visually acquire and identify nearby targets under four different
simulated TAS display conditions: 1) no display; 2) a visual display combined
with a non-spatialized warning sound; 3) a visual display combined with a
clock-coordinate speech signal; and 4) a visual display combined with a
spatialized auditory warning sound. The results show that response times varied
in an orderly fashion as a function of display condition, with the slowest
times occurring in the no display condition and the fastest times occurring in
the 3D audio display condition, where they were roughly 25% faster than those
without the 3D audio cues.

number of menu items visible at a time on the display) on the usability of
small screen devices. Cognitive factors (field dependency, locus of control and
mental rotation ability) mediating the effects were assessed in order to
identify the underlying processes of accessing information. Thirty-nine
participants processed tasks on a simulated cellular phone where one, three or
seven menu items were presented on the display. Search time, executed steps as
well as ratings of the ease of use were collected. Results show that
intermediate foresight (three items) led to the best performance. Highly field
dependent users showed to have extreme difficulties when only one function was
seen on the display whereas low spatial ability participants had most trouble
with seven items displayed at a time. These findings suggest that cognitive
processes of prestructuring information account for the effects of menu
foresight.

%X Random menu search is a task component involved in many human-machine
interfaces and has been modeled with various cognitive models including ACT-R
and EPIC. Based on a review of empirical data in menu search and strengths and
limitations of existing models, this article proposes a model that is based on
the queueing network approach, which has been successfully applied in some
other task domains (e.g., response time, driver performance). The queueing
network model for random menu selection was implemented and evaluated through
model simulation. In contrast to existing models that rely on multiple
task-specific strategies to account for performance and eye movement data, the
queueing network model uses only one strategy already employed in an existing
cognitive model to account for the same data. The value of this "minimal task
strategy" approach for modeling complex menu search tasks is discussed, based
on the reported findings of the queueing network model and a comparison to
existing models.

study in which response time to three groups of semantically related icons were

human observers to attend solely to one icon property without being influenced
by other salient icon information. Humans are easily influenced by their
experience of an icon: they tend to judge very simple, but unfamiliar icons (as
defined by an automated analysis) as complex (Forsythe et al., 2003). This
means that when humans are unreliable judges about the degree of detail or
intricacy in an icon. The degree of detail or intricacy in an icon is one
property is that lends itself to automation (Forsythe et al., 2003). As a
decision-making aid, an automated system would make the process of icon
development and modification a less speculative, more cost-effective activity.

basic visual search task, we studied the effects of increased task difficulty
on subject performance and their corresponding eye measures. Results show a
decrease in performance as the number of objects on the screen increase. What
results could be expected if differences in individual abilities to perform
visual search were controlled? This experiment looks at one method that can be
used to control for individual differences in visual search abilities.

%X Visual search in an important aspect of many tasks, but it not well
understood how layout design affects visual search. This research uses reaction
time data, eye movement data, and computational cognitive modeling to
investigate the effect of local density on the visual search of structured
layouts of words. Layouts were all-sparse, all-dense, or mixed. Participants
found targets in sparse groups faster, and searched sparse groups before dense
groups. Participants made slightly more fixations per word in sparse groups,
but these were much shorter fixations. The modeling suggests that participants
may have attempted to process words within a consistent visual angle regardless
of density, but that they were more likely to miss the target if the target was
in a dense group. Furthermore, it was found that the participants tended to
search sparse groups before dense groups. When combining densities in a layout,
it may be beneficial to place important information in sparse groups.

%X This paper presents an evaluation of the perception of streaming multimedia
quality when delivered over a limited bandwidth, third generation (3G) wireless
data network. The study has three primary objectives: 1) measure the perceived
quality of the multimedia experience as a function of frame rate, audio
fidelity and data connection speed, 2) identify where the perceived quality of
the multimedia experience shifts from being acceptable to unacceptable, and 3)
identify the optimal combination of frame rate, audio fidelity and connection
speed that provides the best customer experience. Analysis was conducted using
Response Surface Methodology (RSM). RSM was used to identify how the three
parameters of frame rate, audio stream bit rate and data connection speed
interact and affect significant shifts in the perceived quality of the
multimedia experience. Results identify the parameters and their
characteristics that are related to shifts in the perceived quality across five
types of multimedia content. The findings of this study are used to guide
multimedia content developers on how to create (i.e., coding and encoding)
multimedia content to ensure the best possible experience over limited
bandwidth 3G wireless data networks. In addition, this research has
implications for the design of future mobile data networks that will use
quality of service technologies to ensure the best possible customer
experience.

%X Researchers have begun examining variables that may moderate the degrading
effects of alarm mistrust on alarm reaction performance. We examined alarm
systems of varying reliability levels (60 or 80 percent true alarms) that
generated either short or long duration alarms. We studied the impact of these
variables on participant response frequency and perception of signal validity.
The researchers sampled 40 Old Dominion University psychology students. We
predicted that participants would rate long duration alarm signals as more
representative of a valid signal. We also believed that participants would use
the representativeness heuristic as a response strategy. The results partially
supported our hypotheses. Participants rated the long duration signals as
significantly more representative of a valid signal (p&lt;.001). However,
although participants responded significantly more often to long duration
alarms (p&lt;.01), participants in the 80% reliability group responded to
significantly more alarms than those in the 60% reliability group (p=.02). The
performance results are inconsistent with our hypothesis. Although participants
perceived the long duration alarms to be more representative than the short,
they did not base their response strategy entirely on alarm representativness.
Despite these unexpected findings, the results suggest that alarm signal
duration has a significant impact on alarm response frequency. Therefore,
designers of complex systems may be able to moderate response degradation due
to unreliability by designing systems that generate long duration alarm
stimuli.

%X Why do the psychophysical functions for line length (linear) and area
(compressive) differ and do they differ for both the tactile and visual
modalities? Experiments 1A and B examined the effects of a two-dimensional
perception on psychophysical functions for visual perception. Participants used
magnitude estimation to judge the diameter, area, and circumference of a set of
14 circles. The psychophysical functions for diameter was approximately 1.0,
for area was approximately .60, and for circumference was above 1.0, indicating
that two-dimensional perception, per se, does not cause the compressive
function for area. Obtaining spatial information without vision can be
important for people with demanding graphically based decision-making tasks and
people with visual impairments. Tactile interfaces provide an alternative way
to display and obtain information. Do the tactile and visual modalities process
spatial information in similar ways? Experiment 2 examined the correspondence
between visual and tactile perception. Participants touched, but did not see, a
series of circles. For each circle they judged diameter, area, and
circumference. Psychophysical functions for diameter length, circumference
length, and area of a circle estimated by tactile perception in Experiment 2
were comparable to those for visual perception.

%X Resource-sharing between spatial and temporal processing was investigated
using dual task methodology to construct performance operating characteristics.
Spatial tasks involved discrimination of line length and temporal tasks
involved discrimination of duration. Preliminary results suggest that a
tradeoff occurs within the easier task of the two difficulty levels, but that a
simple tradeoff is not observed at the more difficult level. This pattern of
results suggests that the relationship between spatial and temporal perception
varies according to difficulty level. That is, the degree to which the
processes share common capacities varies as a function of the metrical
characteristics of stimuli to be processed.

%X Trends have been extensively used in operations to monitor and manage
evolving process situations. They provide detail about process variables but
can take up significant screen space, potentially occluding other important
monitoring parameters. As more data becomes available to the operations team,
trends could proliferate and overload the operator. This paper presents the
time-based information needs generated from plant personnel interviews, and
discusses four existing and six alternative formats for displaying time-based
information to tackle this problem. A framework was also developed to link the
requirements to design options. The framework can be used to assess the
benefits and limitations of the display options and help inform design based on
the conditions of use in operations.

%X This study examined the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) as
a tool to measure mental effort (as indexed by cerebral blood flow velocity)
with increases in task load. Two tasks were chosen for this study based on
their applicability to the task of piloting, a working memory (digit span) task
and a visuo-motor tracking task. Based on previous findings of a possible
relationship between mental workload and cerebral blood flow velocity it was
hypothesized that both tasks would exhibit an increase in cerebral blood flow
velocity in relation to baseline and that blood flow velocity would increase
with increases in task demand. Although performance and subjective measures of
mental workload indicated increased levels of effort to perform the digit span
and tracking tasks as a function of task load, no systematic change in blood
flow velocity was found with task demand in either task. Future work is needed
to validate the use of TCD as a workload measurement tool.

%X An experiment was conducted in which participants performed a simulated
vehicle dispatching task using a map display with two information domains. The
intensity of one information domain was varied to examine the effect on
processing the information in a cluttered display. Response times were recorded
for questions either requiring focused attention on a particular information
domain or divided attention between the two information domains. The results of
the present experiments indicate that it is possible to "declutter" a display
without erasing any information. By "lowlighting" one information domain and
keeping the other domain at a fairly high intensity level, performance on tasks
requiring divided attention is optimal, as is performance on tasks requiring
focused attention to one domain exclusively. These results are also discussed
in conjunction with a computational model of the effects of discriminability
and salience on performance in a cluttered display with variable intensity
codings used to visually segregate different domains of information.

%X Direct manipulation of optical looming provides convincing evidence of the
contribution of optical looming in estimating time-to-collision (TTC). Precise
manipulation of optical looming cues can be easily accomplished through
computational scaling of (real or virtual) objects without impinging upon the
naturalness of the task. This paper first discusses three ways to manipulate
optical looming by scaling object size in order to influence perception of TTC.
Then two principles affecting the implementation of optical looming
manipulation are addressed. Next by revisiting the data of previous research,
influences of knowledge about the optical looming manipulation and practice on
the effect of optical looming manipulation are discussed. This supports our
proposed principles and confirms the possibility of introducing the concept of
optical looming manipulation into actual automobile design. Finally a potential
application of optical looming manipulation, a dynamic brake light system, is
proposed for automobile driving, to reduce the frequency of rear-end
collisions. Issues in implementation of such a system and future research to
validate it are also identified.

%X People are sometimes unable to detect changes in their field of view,
especially when the change coincides with a distraction. This failure to detect
visual changes is known as change blindness. Our research on change blindness
is motivated by the increasing use of complex digital displays in both military
and industrial process control systems. We are interested in the extent to
which important changes in displayed information might be missed, and methods
to decrease vulnerability to change blindness. The present study examined
whether practice detecting specific changes would lead to better change
detection performance in general. Participants practiced detecting specific
visual changes, such as an icon changing from blue to red, using the flicker
paradigm with feedback given after each trial. Practice did lead to improved
detection performance for the practiced changes (i.e. the blue to red changes).
As performance improved, reaction time declined as well. To assess the
generality of this effect, following practice, participants were given a
transfer test in which changes that had not occurred during practice were
scheduled (e.g., green to yellow changes or icon shape changes). Performance on
these novel changes was significantly worse than for the practiced changes and
there was no significant difference between the within-category changes (such
as green to yellow instead of blue to red), and the between-category novel
changes (the shape changes). These results therefore suggest that the
improvements observed were specific to the changes practiced. On the other
hand, the possibility exists that the procedure used actually taught
participants to ignore the features that changed in transfer. During practice,
these features were presented, but never changed. If participants learned to
ignore these features during practice, that would work to oppose any
generalization of heightened visual attention. This and other factors that may
have affected performance are discussed.

participants viewed 20 different clips of major studio release movies that were
2 minutes in duration. Each clip was encoded at five different rates (490 kbps,
771 kbps &amp; 1100 kbps, VHS and DVD). Each participant saw each clip only
once and the level at which that clip was encoded was selected from a counter
balanced list. Results indicated that desirability of the content played a
significant role in a viewer's subjective ratings of the sound and video
quality for a particular clip. It was found that the sound and picture quality
of highly desirable content (as determined by each viewer) was rated
significantly higher than content that was deemed neutral or undesirable. The
study has implications for selecting content for subjective video quality
studies.

%X The present study examined whether search memory is facilitated by the
presence of ecologically congruent cues. Participants completed a visual search
task in which they had to decide whether one or two targets were present in an
array of 12 items. Reaction time and eye movements were recorded. Targets
consisted of either organic stimuli (person, dog, bird), artifacts (jets) or
symbols (stars or a backwards 'S'). These were placed on one of three
backgrounds (neutral gray, sky, or grass). Reaction times showed that search
memory was greatest for organic stimuli (people, dogs), followed by complex
symbols, and finally stimuli that are most associated with aerial searches. Eye
movements showed a similar pattern of results. This pattern of data suggests a
continuum in the reliance on inhibitive markers during visual search, such that
naturally paired stimuli and backgrounds may be more likely to yield nonamnesic
searches.

%X The present study investigated how changing the mass distribution of a
hockey stick influenced the perceived affordances of a stick's utility for
performing either a precision or power action. Top-weighted sticks were
preferred for executing precisely controlled movements, both before and after
using the stick to complete an interception action task. Initially,
participants in the power condition preferred the bottom -weighted stick.
However, once participants performed the power condition action task, they
preferred a stick with a mass concentration closer to their point of grasp.
These results indicate that a held object's perceived affordances are
influenced both by its mass distribution, and the perceiver's level of
experience using the tool for a given action. Human factors consideration
include designing hand-held sporting equipment that capitalizes on people's
sensitivity to an object's mass distribution.

%X Empirical studies consistently show that judgments of the speed of
self-motion are influenced by changes in the altitude of an observer. In
general, a given actual speed is judged to be relatively faster from a lower
altitude and relatively slower from a higher altitude. Similarly, loss of
altitude can be accompanied by a false perception of increasing speed, while
increases in altitude can be accompanied by a false perception of loss in
speed. The direction of these effects is consistent with the Global Optical
Flow Rate (GOFR) Hypothesis. However, the pattern of effects is not
proportional to the ratio of velocity to altitude as predicted by the GOFR
Hypothesis. An alternative model is presented that predicts additive effect of
speed and altitude changes on speed perception.

of this cueing method to examine more widely used trackball and trackpad
computer input devices. Test subjects controlled the input devices with their
right hand, while their left hand was aligned with an adjustable rigid object
that provided the kinesthetically sensed cue. Results show that the kinesthetic
cue reduces extraneous path motion, as previously seen for pen-tablet devices.
Analysis indicates that when the cue was present, individuals having more
exposure to geometry and mathematics slowed their movements, possibly
indicating additional mental processing to monitor motion. Without cueing, the
trackpad users showed worse performance than trackball users at large
rotational disturbances. However, trackpad users showed the greatest
improvements when the cue was added.

a 3D view from behind the robot (3D-Camera) in which depth cues were
manipulated. Our results show people adopt an egocentric frame of reference
when depth cues are salient and an exocentric reference frame when depth cues
are absent. The results suggest the absence or presence of depth cues is a
critical component in choosing a reference frame. We discuss the extension of
Bryant and Tversky's (1999) theoretical framework to a dynamic environment,
such as navigation.

presented on figural than on ground elements, namely the figure superiority
effect, extends to performance on vigilance or sustained attention tasks. In
the experimental condition, targets requiring discriminations of line
orientation were presented on figure-ground displays that could be organized as
a face, a seahorse, and a pineapple, respectively, against a uniform black or
white background. A control condition was also employed in which the same
targets were presented on a bipartite black/white field. Figure-ground
organization did not differentially effect signal detection in the experimental
condition. However, perceptual sensitivity was significantly greater for
signals appearing in the meaningful figure-ground display than in the control
display, which lacked a meaningful figure-ground segregation. Consequently,
meaningful figure-ground organization can be a critical psychophysical factor
in controlling sustained attention.

%X Observers monitored displays of five circles for the presence or absence of
a line in one of the circles during a 40-min vigil. Displays were updated 6,
12, or 24 times/min (event rate). Signal detections varied inversely with event
rate when observers monitored for the absence of the distinguishing feature but
not when monitoring for the presence of that feature and judged the workload of
their assignment to be greater when monitoring for feature absence than
presence. In addition, the availability of information processing resources, as
indexed by transcranial Doppler sonography measurements of cerebral blood flow,
was exhausted more rapidly when observers monitored for feature absence than
for feature presence. This effect was limited to the right hemisphere. The
results are consistent with the view that detecting feature absence is more
capacity demanding than detecting feature presence and with previous brain
imaging findings indicating right hemispheric control of vigilance.

and task complexity affected human performance and perceived workload. We
hypothesized that using an alarm system would improve task performance and
lower perceived workload, particularly when task complexity was high and at the
medium threshold level. Twenty-one students from Old Dominion University
participated in this study. Results showed that alarm use improved performance
during low task complexity. For high task complexity, improvement was
accomplished only when alarm system threshold was low or intermediate. Results
also indicated that changing the alarm system threshold affected performance
only under high task load conditions. Optimal performance was achieved by
setting the threshold of the alarm system at its lowest level. The use of
alarms reduced workload under both low and high task complexity levels, but
only when the threshold was high.

%X One vital responsibility of all law enforcement officers lies in their
obligation to defend themselves and those around them in the event of a violent
threat. The best tool available to them to perform this duty is their sidearm
and their skill in using it. To evaluate the efficiency of this tool use,
seventy-one police officers participated in a field study examining the
relationship between workload and shooting performance. Use of linear
regression analysis produced evidence linking higher reported workload on the
mental subscale of the NASA-TLX while completing a shooting task to poorer
shooting performance when controlling for marksmanship skill. This finding is
discussed in the context of previous work in the areas of workload and
attentional allocation.

%X Irrelevant noise in the work environment has long been viewed as a source of
annoyance and disturbance with speech being rated as the worst (e.g. Nemecek
and Grandjean, 1973; Kjellberg and Landstrom, 1994). This may be particularly
detrimental in environments where background speech is prevalent, such as call
centers. Furthermore, additional disruption may occur when the background
speech is similar to items in the primary task. We report an experiment that
examined the effects of speech and the role of semantic similarity using a call
center-like task. Analyses showed that although both similar and dissimilar
speech noise conditions were worse than a quiet noise condition, there was no
difference between the two speech conditions. Results are discussed in light of
the changing-state account of the irrelevant sound effect.

%X This study examines the abilities of three subjective measures of workload
to predict dual task performance. The measures compared are: The Workload
Profile (WP), the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ), and the Global Rating
Questionnaire (GRQ). Each of these measures is based on a different theoretical
model of cognitive workload. Participants first played three computer games.
They were asked to rate the games on subjective workload using all three
measurement indices. Subjects were then asked to play pairings of the games
simultaneously. Only the MRQ significantly predicted task interference, and it
also showed the least variability over participants.

%X The Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ) is an easily administered
instrument for measuring subjective workload, with a previously demonstrated
ability to predict dual-task interference between simple laboratory-based
tasks. Here its predictive properties are investigated using complex
computer-based games. Participants performed pairs of games simultaneously with
opposite hands. Percent performance decrements relative to single games were
found to be positively correlated to the resource similarity between games as
assessed by the MRQ. Specifically, a profile similarity metric (RSQ, the
squared correlation between games in resource usage) significantly outperformed
metrics based on overlap similarity (OLAP, the summation of minima across
resources) and overall demand (TOT, the total demand summed across resources).
The correlation obtained between the RSQ metric and task interference, r=
+0.61, indicates that the MRQ possesses substantial criterion validity when
applied to complex tasks.

%X Recently much attention has been paid to head accelerations experienced
during roller coaster rides and their association with brain injuries (Smith
and Meaney, 2002, Braksiek and Roberts, 2002). This paper provides a context
for comparing head accelerations experienced on roller coasters to some
activities of daily living (ADL) and other recreational activities.
Historically, research dealing with head accelerations has come in two main
areas. First, accelerations that are very short duration events occurring
during direct or indirect head impacts. Second, longer duration accelerations
that occur during events like flying an airplane. A third but much smaller set
of data is available for events that fall between these two classic types of
head acceleration. Simply reporting "maximum g's" without a consideration of
the duration, direction, or type of the acceleration does not provide an
accurate description of the event, nor does it directly predict the likelihood
of an injury. This paper presents results from a review of the literature and
several studies conducted by the authors to compare the magnitudes and
durations of head accelerations experienced during ADL and from riding a sample
of roller coasters.

%X One of the functions of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is
to examine and assess accident investigation methods and techniques. In this
paper we present an approach being explored to assess human actions in aviation
accidents that draws from fault tree analysis and cognitive work analysis. The
paper shows how these two different approaches can be used to model human
actions in an aviation accident, and then integrate the results of that process
into an overall accident investigation process. The paper begins by showing how
a fault tree depicts the sources of human interaction failures with aircraft
systems, and then proceeds to describe the steps taken to derive the failures
using cognitive work analysis. The paper concludes with a discussion of ongoing
efforts to test the method and to explore other techniques.

%X This paper describes a new resource for developing and evaluating consumer
product instructions. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff,
when conducting product safety assessments, often finds that the instructions
provided with a product are deficient and result in consumers misassembling or
misusing the product. Therefore, CPSC staff recently released the
Manufacturer's Guide to Developing Consumer Product Instructions. This Guide is
unique in providing a relatively comprehensive, yet compact, set of principles
specifically addressing the development and evaluation of instructional
material for consumer products. It has a strong human factors orientation. The
approach to developing the document was based upon the behavioral sequence that
must be accomplished if the final outcome is to be a change in product user
behavior. The content, structure, and perspective of the Guide make it useful
for human factors professionals in product design, safety research, and
forensics, as well as for developers of instructions and safety materials.

%X The observed seat belt usage rates for front seat occupants have improved
over the last few decades to 79% across the country in 2003. However, these
usage rates, observed at intersections and at freeway entrances, may provide
overestimates of actual rates for occupants that are belted at the start of the
drive cycle. In the current study, we observed seat belt usage patterns of
drivers and front seat passengers exiting gasoline stations, malls, and other
public locations to determine whether their seat belts were fastened before
leaving the premises as well as how grasping and buckling movements were
completed. Contrary to the national usage rates for drivers and front seat
occupants, only 52% of the occupants fastened their seat belts before leaving
the public locations. We discuss these findings in terms of driver behavior and
factors that influence the normal procedural sequences at the start of the
drive cycle.

%X An expert panel and scientific literature analysis provided data for
classifying and evaluating countermeasures for transportation operator fatigue.
The panel identified a set of risk factors that are common across
transportation modes, and a variety of strategies used or available to reduce
fatigue. Twenty such fatigue countermeasures were identified and evaluated on
the basis of empirical data in the literature. Of the twenty, only six provide
reasonable relief from fatigue without undesirable side effects; these include:
adequate sleep, caffeine, napping, anchor sleep, trip planning, and a good
sleeping environment. The remaining 14 countermeasures either produce side
effects, are illegal without a prescription, are impractical for everyday
implementation, or simply do not work. These latter countermeasures, such as
opening a window for fresh air while driving, or stopping to exercise, are
potentially dangerous, as they may lead drivers to believe they are not
fatigued when in fact they are.

%X Operator fatigue is a critical issue that applies to all modes of commercial
transportation. Managing the fatigue of commercial transportation operators
requires an understanding of the practical challenges faced by operators in
managing alertness. A survey of risk factors was conducted among twenty-five
commercial transportation operators to help the broader commercial
transportation industry understand the relevance of fatigue problems to their
operations. A number of factors associated with operator fatigue were found to
be common across the airline, rail, maritime, and trucking operations studied.
Findings pertaining to eight factors that were found to have a major influence
upon operator fatigue are presented. When these factors are present, they can
be addressed through comprehensive fatigue management programs that address the
systemic causes of fatigue; as well as through countermeasures that may provide
long-term or temporary relief to operators.

Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). A fourth alternative design based on
components of the other three signs was created for this study. Participants
rated the signs on three characteristics: the likelihood that they would (a)
notice, (b) understand, and (c) comply with the sign. They were also asked to
rank the signs in order of overall effectiveness and answer several
sign-related open-ended questions. The text-only sign was rated lowest on all
three characteristics and was most often ranked as the least effective sign.
The alternative design with the most elaborate symbol and complete set of words
was rated significantly higher than the other three signs on all three
characteristics and also ranked as most effective. Potential directions for
future research are discussed and signage recommendations are made.

data were made for 1983-1998 to discern those caused by suicide during flight
in general aviation and to determine if the public is placed at risk by them.
It was found that suicides were about 0.06% of the accidents and that about 1.4
occurred per year. The characteristics and predisposing circumstances of the
crashes are described. Most crashes were into mountains, hillsides or bodies of
water. Public property was rarely damaged and no injuries to the public were
recorded. Based on these data the public is at little risk from suicides in

%X The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently unveiled a public
education framework titled "Preparing Makes Sense. Get Ready Now" designed to
inform citizens how to respond during national emergencies such as nuclear,
chemical, and biological terrorist attacks. Within the framework, pictorial
safety symbols are used to communicate the nature of the hazards and the
behavior necessary to avoid injury. Fifty-seven participants were tested for
their comprehension of 24 DHS symbols. Given the ANSI Z535.3 (2001) criterion
of 85% correct, 19 of the 24 DHS pictorial safety symbols are unacceptable for
communicating hazard-related information. ANSI Z535.3 (2001) also recommends
that acceptable symbols have no more than 5% critical confusions, defined as
incorrect answers opposite to the intended meaning. Of the 24 symbols tested
here, 16 symbols had critical confusion levels above 5%. The use of human
factors methodologies is discussed as a means to improve symbol design and
comprehension.

%X Male landscaping mulch handlers were asked to use the Moldex N-100 filtering
facepiece and provide feedback on factors associated with usability, comfort,
and perceived value of the respirator. Recommendations for design changes to
improve comfort and usability were solicited. Mean responses to questions
employing a Likert-type scale indicated that the workers found it easy to
communicate while wearing the mask and agreed that the head straps were easy to
adjust. Questions concerning comfort and voluntary use yielded low scores,
indicating that the workers found the masks uncomfortable and that they would
be unlikely to adopt patterns of voluntary use. When the results were analyzed
along with worker age, the study found that older workers were more interested
in voluntary use, however were also more concerned about comfort. Key
suggestions for design change involved greater adjustability of the nose piece
and improvement of the exhalation valve.

personal flotation devices (PFDs) yielded a number of interesting findings and
observations. First, a mixed-format focus group methodology, in which
participants gave individual, written feedback as well as engaging in a
structured group discussion regarding prototype labeling, was used
successfully. Second, this methodology was useful in assessing people's
interpretation of graphic elements for relatively complex information on a
label. Third, additional evaluation methods could be used to determine how
people may use redundant information on a label. Finally, participants were
able to provide general or high-level feedback regarding their overall
preference for revised labeling (compared to the baseline labeling). These
observations may be applicable to other projects involving the evaluation and
revision of labeling.

elementary school environment. For this study, three safety analysis methods,
an ergonomic checklist, a classroom ergonomic analysis, and a task analysis
were used to determine whether teachers and students were practicing
ergonomically safe methods. Twelve classrooms in grades kindergarten through
fifth grade were evaluated. Based upon the evaluations, several classrooms
utilized adjustable furniture to "fit the task to the person," but not all
adjustable furniture was properly used. In a number of classrooms, children
practiced bad posture which can lead to future musculoskeletal disorders.

performed in stressful circumstances. The current work examines the effects of
cross modality of warning presentation and retention in a dual task paradigm in
a simulated environment with various task-induced stress levels. Consistent
with the Hancock and Warm model of stress and attention, it was found that when
task demand is relatively low, the modality of presentation is of less
importance and participants are able to comply. When task demand is relatively
high, the modality of presentation was critical and played a significant role
in compliance behavior. Additionally, it was found that participants were
significantly less likely to comply in the verbal modality across all levels of
working memory demand than in either the pictorial or written modalities.

%X Previous research on textual warnings has mainly focused on individual
signal words, but much less research has concerned signal words in context
within warnings. The current study investigated printed (visual) warnings
statements that contained signal words paired with hazard and instruction
statements. These statements have been previously used in research on voice
(auditory) warnings by Barzegar and Wogalter (2000). The results showed that
participants rated warning statements containing hazard and instruction
information paired with the signal word "DEADLY" significantly higher on
intended carefulness than the same statements paired with the signal word
"DANGER." Statements paired with a signal word were rated higher than
statements without a signal word. Overall, the pattern of the ratings for the
printed statements in this study concurs with that of Barzegar's and Wogalter
(2000) voice warning data. Implications and suggestions to the design of
effective warning statements are discussed.

evidence that they prevent accidents. Most studies of warnings use subjective
judgments or responses or else measure compliance in laboratory conditions
rather than real-world compliance, but many researchers, juries, and regulators
continue to advocate development and deployment of warnings. Several lines of
research suggest that people -- including researchers and safety professionals
-- are prone to an attribution error, emphasizing individual rationality and
character while underestimating the importance of situational influences.
Recommendations are offered for a shift in warnings research and practice.

%X Adverse drug events (ADE) are common, costly, and responsible for
significant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. They are a
leading cause of death, accounting for up to 106,000 American deaths annually.
Our healthcare system relies on accurate reporting of ADE by clinicians to the
pharmaceutical companies, and by the companies to the FDA. The system also
relies on the pharmaceutical companies providing accurate and complete warnings
and contraindications to physicians and patients. Frequently, however, these
risks are not effectively communicated to those who prescribe and take the
medications. A critical evaluation of the American drug hazard management
system reveals several factors that contribute to these shortcomings and
therefore impact patient safety. These system components interact to increase
the probability of adverse drug events and accordingly, impact consumer safety.

%X Attitudes towards human and organizational factors can have an impact on
effective team performance and consequently on patient safety. The Operating
Room Management Attitudes Questionnaire (ORMAQ) measures attitudes to
leadership, communication, teamwork, stress and fatigue, work values, and
organizational climate. Data were collected from 231 consultant and trainee
surgeons, and 121 surgical nurses from 17 Scottish Hospitals using a customized
version of the ORMAQ. The respondents generally demonstrated positive attitudes
to teamwork, leadership and safety and were similar to those reported in
previous ORMAQ surveys of anaesthetists in Scotland and of surgeons in other
countries. However, consultant and trainee surgeons differed in their attitudes
to briefings, critical situations, and competence acknowledgement.

%X Accidents rarely happen; close calls ("near misses") are much more
prevalent. So learning from close-calls is statistically more feasible. This
paper describes a new technique for rating, or having a computer help to rate,
the relative severity of close-call events. Various potential applications are
in transportation close-calls: between aircraft on the ground or in the air,
between highway or rail or maritime vehicles or such vehicles and fixed
objects; also close-calls in surgery or other medical treatments on patients,
or in police or security work. Currently the technique is being developed and
validated for specific application to airport runway incursions -- where an
aircraft or vehicle violates safe separation criteria relative to another
aircraft. The technique starts from severity ranges prejudged by subject matter
experts and tabled for each of a set of possible near-miss scenarios and range
of closest proximities, including the overall best (global minimum) and worst
(global maximum) severities, as well as ratings for the worst case for each of
a set of "influence factors." (These numbers specify the corners for each
dimension of a several-dimensional "severity space"). A scale of influence
levels associated with key objective properties of each influence factor is
also prejudged by subject matter experts. Then, for any particular close-call
event in any particular scenario, one need only specify the key objective
properties of the event. The event's severity is then determined by a
combinatorial algorithm drawing on these properties and the tabled values.
Validation efforts for runway incursions comparing the technique's predictions
to independent expert ratings are promising.

%X Forty-four participants performed two tasks: administering medication with a
nebulizer and changing a vacuum cleaner bag. Within the context of each task,
participants were exposed to a warning label containing either a single message
or a total of five messages. Warning labels were placed so that participants
would have to interact with and remove them in order to complete the tasks.
Noticing and reading of the warning labels and compliance with a target message
were assessed. Data on attention to and use of associated product manuals were
also obtained. While the results showed no effect of the number of messages on
noticing or reading of the labels or compliance with the target message,
several interesting findings were observed. Reasons for non-compliance with
warning messages were obtained and the implications of these data are
discussed.

%X Construction companies are constantly dealing with project safety and
quality issues. Research indicates that characteristics of successful safety
management are similar to those of successful quality management. A survey of
construction contractors in Wisconsin was conducted to investigate what they
think and do in regards to safety and quality management. Results indicate that
management commitment, employee involvement, training, and communication were
perceived as the most effective characteristics of safety and quality
management. Perceived benefits of safety management were reduced claims and
workers compensation premiums. Perceived benefits of quality management were
more repeat customers and reduced rework. Barriers to safety were costs
associated with training and enforcement, and barriers to quality were lack of
skilled workers and the low-bid contract award process. Contractors who
reported the use of "hard measures" for safety performance, such as
inspections/audits, process for collecting safety measures, and a "near-miss"
reporting, had significantly better self-reported safety outcome measures.

%X This paper outlines the techniques applied and lessons learnt when applying
formal human error and reliability techniques to support the production of a
railway safety case in the UK. This paper argues that the optimum techniques
for addressing human error may need to be adapted from those advocated by human
factors professionals in order to achieve a pragmatic, valid and justifiable
safety argument within the often limited timescales and costs. In particular,
during this work it was found that formal classification of errors did not
assist in identifying human error events or specifying mitigations against
these events. In addition the application of formal human reliability
techniques did not adequately address the potential for human violation
(Williams, 1997). It is concluded that formal methods can only be used as
supporting techniques to a qualitative approach and that quantified human
reliability techniques should not be used definitively due to their inherent
weaknesses.

%X The breakdown or failure of crew resource management (CRM) has been cited as
a causal factor in a large number of civilian and military aviation accidents.
However, a recent review of the literature has revealed that many of the CRM
concepts currently being trained are unrelated and/or unclear, making it
difficult to determine the effectiveness of existing CRM training programs. The
U.S. Navy/Marine Corps are no different. In an effort to determine the critical
skills that should be taught, we examined U.S. Navy/Marine Corps Class A
aviation accident data between 1990 and 2000 for CRM failures. In this study,
275 U.S. Naval aviation CRM failures were examined to identify those critical
to safety in U.S. Naval aviation. Of the six CRM failures identified, the
failure to conduct an adequate brief and the lack of communication accounted
for over 50% of the failures examined, suggesting the importance of these areas
when training CRM.

%X During the course of a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-sponsored
research project "Identification of Driver Errors," "driver errors" in crashes
and near-crashes (i.e., critical incidents) were investigated and an analysis
approach was developed to help identify infrastructure-related and
non-infrastructure-related problems at intersections and other roadway sites.
The research team carefully examined the relationship between the
infrastructure, driver error, and critical incidents. This was accomplished by
first determining which incidents appeared to have an infrastructure component
(signing, signaling, delineation, alinement, geometry, etc.). These incidents
were then reexamined to determine the precise nature of the infrastructure
components. Once the problems had been identified, countermeasures were
suggested. This work is a demonstration of the synergistic effects of combining
human factors engineering techniques with traffic engineering. By broadening
the earlier traffic-conflict technique to include greater consideration of
driver behavior, with emphasis on generalized driver errors, a better
understanding of critical incidents and their corresponding countermeasures has
been obtained.

%X The Thermal Stress Index (TSI) was developed to provide a means for rapidly
estimating the physiological severity of exposure to extreme temperatures for
shipboard firefighters and to provide a rational means for finding their most
effective work rest cycles. It was meant to be an adjunct to discrete event
simulation models of human behavior in complex environments. In this way, a
modeling tool with the TSI equation could be used to recommend the number of
personnel needed onboard for fighting shipboard fires, the least recovery time
needed before they could be returned to duties and to estimate the extent of
heat casualties while an onboard fire is fought. As a stand-alone algorithm,
the TSI could assist management of fire crews using a simple spreadsheet
program to estimate safe exposure and recovery times for forest fires, such as
those that annually burn US forests and major building fires.

%X Adverse events, or accidents, in healthcare can have significant clinical
outcomes including loss of property, health (morbidity), and life (mortality).
Healthcare accidents have features that make post-event investigations
particularly difficult. The investigation and analysis of medical accidents is
intended to discover information that explains the nature and cause of what
occurred in the interest of preventing or minimizing future loss. The thorough,
objective investigation of medical adverse events rarely happens due to the
complexity of the environment, litigation, risk, and socio-political
implications. Special concerns can undermine investigation depth, breadth, and
quality. Healthcare's distinct difference from other high hazard sectors such
as aviation and nuclear power requires a unique approach. Healthcare accident
examination requires detailed domain knowledge and the use of diverse
investigation methods. This paper describes the current state of medical
accident analysis, obstacles to understanding such accidents and strategies to
overcome them, as well as future investigation and analysis approaches.

%X Although driving often involves considerable use of a vehicle's mirrors,
collecting data on the frequency and duration of mirror glances can be
difficult. First, data collection in the real world may be time-consuming and
unsafe. Second, low-cost simulators have used visual inserts within the
projected image to simulate the inside mirror. When such inserts are used, a
driver's search and scan behavior differs significantly from that in the real
world. Both eye movements and eye accommodation processes are different for
mirror inserts then for actual mirrors. This paper describes a low-cost driving
simulator that allows actual rear-vision mirrors to be used. Thus, eye-mirror
scan behavior in our simulator emulates that of the real world. Our simulator,
with the actual vehicle mirrors, is composed of two networked PCs, two
projectors, and two screens. The forward view is projected to the front screen
from the server, and the rear view is projected to the back screen from the
client. The scene and autonomous vehicles in the server and client are
synchronized by communication between the server and client. A driver seated in
the vehicle body/buck views the front driving scene on the front screen and
views the rear driving scene in either the left-side mirror or inside mirror. A
small video camera, which is synchronized with the computer-generated visual
scene, is used to record the operator's glances to the vehicle's mirrors. We
plan to gather information and data during a study driver behavior when making
lane changes under various situations. The results may be relevant to
understanding the process of attaining driving skills, and could contribute to
the content of driver training and education.

%X Through an integration of synthetic agents, intelligent tutoring, and
scenario-based training in a simulation environment, Synthetic Teammates for
Real-time Anywhere Training and Assessment (STRATA) is being developed to
overcome conventional training limitations by providing deployable training
that offers on-demand practice for individuals and teams, with or without
instructors, and without requiring users to be co-located. STRATA will use
synthetic agents embedded in a virtual training environment when human players
needed to play the part of team members are missing. As part of DARWARS,
DARPA's Training Superiority program that is establishing persistent, online
training worlds, STRATA will provide these training opportunities with
low-footprint, portable hardware. An Event-Based Approach to Training (EBAT) is
being used to facilitate highly context specific training and to support
generalization to a variety of mission types. The first STRATA application
demonstrates Close Air Support (CAS) training. A cognitive task analysis of
representative CAS missions, identifying decision making requirements, radio
communications, and coordination, has been conducted in order to develop our
synthetic models and help identify observable triggering conditions necessary
to measure performance targeted in the EBAT method. In order to support the
project goals of individual and team-centered training, a generalizable
training architecture, and the reuse of cognitive agents across mission types,
scenario and training management systems, as well as a cognitive agent library
(CAL) are being developed.

%X Ergonomists and researchers often utilize electromyographic (EMG) recordings
to produce estimates of muscular work load in occupational exposure assessment.
Prolonged measurements, possible with recent technological advances in portable
data acquisition and compact memory storage technologies, require efficient
data reduction methods not always available in commercial software packages.
The Iowa EMG Analysis Program (IEAP) was created to provide researchers the
means to incorporate multiple processing techniques suited for the analysis of
prolonged EMG measurements. IEAP currently includes subroutines to calculate
the amplitude probability distribution function, exposure variation analysis,
clustered exposure variation analysis, and gaps analysis profiles for up to
four channels of root-mean-square processed EMG data. Data management functions
include the creation of customized hypertext markup language (HTML)
documentation and text files able to seamlessly incorporate analysis results
into existing statistical software packages. IEAP is a powerful EMG analysis
tool ideally suited for ergonomists and researchers involved in occupational
ergonomics studies.

%X Interest in cross-cultural traffic signs is in part motivated by the
increase of motorists driving in foreign countries. This study investigated
comprehension levels of 100 international road signs and the effect of brief
sign training with the associated referent (sign meaning) on subsequent
comprehension. Using open-ended questions U.S. drivers were tested on their
ability to correctly report the meaning and action associated with various
international road signs. Later they were exposed to the textual referent in a
brief 5 minute training exercise. Following the training exercise,
comprehension was retested. For many signs initial comprehension levels were
low and critical confusions (serious errors) were high. However, after a brief
training session comprehension levels dramatically improved. The results
indicate that U.S. drivers may have difficulty understanding traffic signage
outside of the U.S. To some extent training of the sign meanings might
counteract low comprehension and high critical confusions. More extensive
training or redesign may be needed to ensure U.S. drivers understand
particularly highly signs.

system designed to evaluate the impact of the addition of a synthetic vision
system (SVS) to a commercial airliner cockpit. The NASA-run empirical study
revealed that while pilots rarely looked out the window during most phases of
approach and landing, they devoted a substantial proportion of their gaze
toward the SVS. A model pilot implemented in ACT-R was connected to a
commercial flight simulator package in an attempt to model pilots' attention
allocation behaviors. Based on metrics such as transitions from one display to
another, the model provides a good approximation to pilot behaviors and should
allow us to perform virtual experiments on the impact of changes to the SVS.

%X We have developed virtual worlds that run on a single personal computer and
can be displayed using two outputs. A single display of the two outputs has a
resolution of 3200 x 1200 pixels. The field-of-view may be as large as 120
degrees with little distortion. Frame rates are in excess of 60 per second. The
common use of such high-resolution wide-screen displays in simulators and
virtual reality could significantly improve the experience of participants.
Such a near-photorealistic large display may enhance the believability of
scenarios and raise a person's sense of presence in the virtual experience.
This may increase the sensitivity and validity of performance measures. Virtual
reality application areas that could benefit from using a high-resolution
wide-screen display include those used for training, education, and medical
applications such as the treatment of psychological disorders. Since many
driving tasks involve a large field of view, low-cost effective driving
simulators can now be easily constructed. We use a driving simulator to
demonstrate the use of a high-resolution wide-screen display.

%X Spatial tactile displays allow for the cueing of directional information
without drawing upon the visual and auditory channels. This work highlights the
effectiveness of a tactual display versus a spatial auditory display baseline
for augmenting a visual search task. Touch provides highly salient and covert
signals that narrow the visual search space, potentially shortening response
times, improving accuracy, and imposing minimal additional demand upon visual
and auditory channels. Applications of this display technology for spatial
location of targets include acquisition of potential threats in simulated and
real combat environments, as well as improved localization of objects for first
responders or for those with sensory impairments.

%X This paper reviews evidence from a series of experiments that identify a
characteristic 250-350 Hz tool vibration that may enable a dentist to make a
specific clinical determination during a dental exam. The specific task is a
generalized version of crown margin gap estimation. The results suggest that
the vibration of the dental tool may be the salient haptic characteristic
perceived by the dentist. Our previous experiments indicate that this vibration
occurs when the probe releases potential energy after moving across the gap. A
Fourier power spectrum of the vibration indicates that the vibration energy is
in the maximally sensitive range of the Pacinian corpuscle, an organ which
senses fingertip skin vibration. This paper discusses follow-up experiments
designed to verify that including the vibration makes the size of the crown
margin gap more salient while damping the vibration makes the size of crown
margin gap more difficult to estimate. Defining the essential characteristics
of the haptic signal is essential for redesigning, implementing and assessing
the next generation of our dental surgical simulator.

%X Domain visualization attempts to present the interrelationships between
research areas by spatially representing the fields or sub fields of science.
The science of human factors has grown over the past decade. In addition, sub
specialties within the field have developed making it even more complex to
understand. As a future human factors practitioner, understanding a
multidisciplinary field such as this necessitates a domain analysis because of
its evolutionary and complex nature. This paper reports the preliminary results
of this analysis using author co-citation analysis (ACA) and three domain
visualization tools, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and Pathfinder
Networks. Sixty authors were mapped selected from core ergonomics, human
factors (HF) and human computer interaction (HCI) journals. Preliminary results
suggest that ergonomics is treated as a separate entity, while HF and HCI are
more intertwined with some key researchers forming the core of the research
community. Future research directions are discussed.

letter arrangements to determine the optimum design for text entry with a
rotary controller. Few research studies have examined keyboard shapes to
determine the criteria that are most relevant for non-standard input devices.
This study included examination of both visual search and movement control
aspects of text entry. Older and younger participants moved a knob on a rotary
controller from a start position to a target position on four different
keyboard shapes. These participants also searched for a target symbol on three
different arrangements of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks on one of the
same keyboard shapes as the movement trials. Results from the younger adults in
both experiments are discussed in this study, along with early results from
several older adults.

%X Throughout the lifespan, humans need to understand complex relationships
between environmental cues. These may be perceptual-motor cues, such as
operating an input device, or cognitively oriented, such as understanding how
exercise and food intake affect and interact with the body's blood sugar level.
Past research has shown age-related differences in the ability to integrate
cues: younger adults integrate related task components better than unrelated
components while older adults perform the same for low and high relatedness
(Korteling, 1991, 1993). What remains to be discovered is whether different
types of training affect performance with different amounts of cue relation.
Our prediction is that augmenting relationships of the cues during task will
produce higher performance when task cues are interrelated. Simplifying the
task (showing fewer relationships at one time) will produce higher performance
when the cues are unrelated. We expect to uncover age-related differences for
conditions when task and training type are mismatched. The results of this
study should provide insight into cognitive skill acquisition and appropriate
training methods for older adults.

problems older adults have experienced such as memory, comprehension, and
sensory issues. A structured interview consisting of two parts was designed to
gather this information. The first part focuses on the specific communication
problems participants may have had. The second part of the study involves six
scenarios in which a fictitious patient has a communication problem with a
health care professional. The goal of the scenarios is to determine the types
of strategies, if any, participants recommend using when faced with
communication problems with their health care professional. The findings from
this study will be used to identify and categorize problems and strategies to
inform design solutions to remedy these communication problems.

%X Older adults' failure to comply with their medication regimens has motivated
considerable research. Much previous research has concentrated on the creation
of physical memory aids or has focused on the role of conditions like
depression. However, the ways in which older adults do adhere to their
medication regimens -- their medication memory strategies -- can also provide
useful information. Through an understanding of these adherence strategies as
well as the conditions under which nonadherence occurs, we can analyze the
relationship between reported strategies and variables, like metamemory,
non-routine activities, and medication regimen complexity. The present study
proposes a questionnaire designed to elicit this information from older adults.
Data from this questionnaire can be used to increase medication adherence by
providing guidelines for specialized adherence strategies, identifying
conditions under which nonadherence is most likely to occur, and by providing
insight into future design of memory aids for medication taking.

%X Past automation research has focused primarily on machine-related factors
(e.g., automation reliability) and human-related factors (e.g.,
accountability). Other machine-related factors such as type of automation
errors, misses or false alarms, have been noticeably overlooked. These two
automation errors correspond to potential operator errors, omission (misses)
and commission (false alarms), which have proven to directly affect operators'
trust in automation. This proposed research will examine how
automation-error-type affects operator trust and begin to develop baseline
trust measures as they relate to error type and participant age. It is expected
that participants presented with more automation false alarms than misses will
experience a larger degradation of subjective trust than those presented with
equal numbers of false alarms and misses or more automation misses than false
alarms.

%X Pregnant women, though typically numbering one million a year in the United
States workforce, are often neglected by the ergonomic community. This claim is
supported by considering available literature from a variety of sources
including peer reviewed ergonomic journals, ergonomics text books, general web
searches, cites pulled from seminal research articles, and reviews of the NIOSH
and OSHA WebPages. Results show that only a few researchers have attempted to
go beyond back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome concerns to consider other
ergonomic factors affecting pregnant women. More information concerning the
health of the fetus is available than the health and well-being of the pregnant
women. Much of the research that focuses on pregnant women separate from their
fetuses is nearly a decade old, leaving a tremendous gap in current research.
Clearly additional and varied research considering both long and short term
effects of ergonomic stressors on pregnant women are warranted.

%X The success of any election ultimately depends on the voters' ability to
accurately cast a vote using the given technology. If the user interface is
confusing, the system may fail to record the intent of the voter, and
essentially disenfranchise citizens in the process. In the extreme case of the
fiasco surrounding the presidential election of 2000, it became exceedingly
clear that the study of human factors for voting design was a necessary, yet
neglected, area of research. This study presents an analysis of current
electronic voting systems with regard to machine type (touchscreen versus
touchscreen + keypad), ballot design (full ballot interface versus one office
per page interface), and effects of age. Fifty participants ages 18-26 (M =
20.52) and fifty participants ages 64-77 (M = 68.27) were recruited from the
community and asked to complete a hypothetical ballot given a list of
candidates to choose, in each of four experimental conditions. Results revealed
lowest error rates for both groups using the touchscreen system, and lowest
errors for both groups using the one office per page interface. Touchscreen
systems also revealed faster completion times than touchscreen + keypad designs
for both age groups, with fastest completion times occurring in the full ballot
interface. Implications are discussed.

temporal information in a format reasonable for computers, but cumbersome for
humans. Study participants compared sentences describing relationships between
time intervals to either an alpha-numeric or graphical display and responded
true/false. Two categories of relationships were examined: relative (before,
after) and contained (during, contains). The graphical display allowed faster
rejection of instances of categorical mismatch based on perceptual differences
and evaluation of truth-conditions at a higher level of abstraction between the
two types of relationships.

%X Traditionally, teens are taught procedures to use during hazardous
situations (e.g., when encountering an obstacle and needing to swerve around
it). In most driver education programs these procedures are taught through
lecture; however, this has not proven to be effective. This study will utilize
a similar lecture on the skill of avoiding obstacles, and teens will then train
in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Participants will be divided into three
training groups: (1) Swerving Practice, in which teens practice steering in
scenarios that require swerving, (2) Situation Recognition, in which teens
react to the same scenarios, but respond only with a button press, and (3) No
Practice, in which participants read verbal descriptions of the same scenarios.
Participants will then be tested in scenarios requiring swerving maneuvers. It
is expected that teens in the Swerving Practice condition will yield the
fastest reaction times and the fewest errors.

%X Transfer of training from simulators to real-world environments has recently
come under investigation, as the generalizability of task-specific training has
come into question. New hypotheses recommend that, to ensure effective
performance under stress in real-world environments, one should supplement
skill-based training with Stress Exposure Training (SET). Stress Exposure
Training has further benefits in that it may serve as a more generalizable form
of training and transfer across tasks and stressors. The impact of improving
performance and reducing perceived stress and workload is of vital importance
to many military operations, especially in high technology and high workload
situations such as Landwarrior or Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs; Mouloua,
Hancock, &amp; Gilson, 2003), in which mistakes are costly in terms of
economics as well as life. In this paper the limits of SET transfer between
laboratory training and field performance are investigated in regards to
simulated combat target identification tasks.

addresses what to do if you are getting an early start on career planning and
if you are fairly far along in the graduate school experience, even if you did
not begin early career preparation These topics are most timely, because in a
very competitive labor market outstanding preparation is vital, and if one did
not do the appropriate preparation remedial action may be necessary.
Fortunately, early preparation (or even taking remedial action) enhances the
entire graduate school experience. The panel itself will address questions from
the audience about careers preparation. A second paper will be produced by

%X In many cultures, the color "red" is commonly associated with danger and has
an established symbolic meaning that does not require explanation (i.e., a
population stereotype). Because of the frequent mapping of red with situations
requiring immediate attention, the proposed study employs a visual search task
to examine whether the color red possesses automatic or involuntary
attention-capturing qualities that other colors (e.g., blue) do not possess.
Participants will search for red or blue targets in the presence of green
distractors, and green targets in the presence of red or blue distractors.
Also, participants will be cued in advance for the likely location of the
target. If the frequent association of red with danger/warning makes the
response to red an automatic or involuntary process, then search for green
targets among red distractors will lead to the slowest response times despite
the fact that target location is cued.

results showed that more lane deviations were made during the navigation than
the non navigation task. These findings indicate the greater workload levels
associated with the use of video navigation devices. These findings have major
implications for driver safety and telematic systems design.

conversations while driving with driving only conditions. This study
investigated how conversing on a cell phone differs from conversing with a
passenger. Participants conversed about close-call situations they experienced.
We compared how well drivers followed task instructions when driving only, when
driving and conversing on a cell phone, and when driving and conversing with a
passenger. The results show that the number of driving errors was highest in
the cell-phone condition. Analyzing the conversations we found that in
passenger conversations more references were made to traffic and more turn
taking followed those references than in cell phone conversations. The results
show that passenger conversations differ from cell phone conversations because
the surrounding traffic becomes a topic of the conversation, helping driver and
passenger to share situation awareness, and mitigating the potential effects of
conversation on driving.

simulated driving. We found that even when participants looked directly at
objects in the driving environment, they were less likely to create a durable
memory of those objects if they were conversing on a cell phone. Moreover, this
pattern was obtained for objects of both high- and low-relevance, suggesting
that very little semantic analysis of the objects occurs outside the restricted
focus of attention. These data support the inattention-blindness interpretation
in which the disruptive effects of cell phone conversations on driving are due
in large part to the diversion of attention from driving to the phone
conversation. We suggest that even when participants are directing their gaze
at objects in the driving environment that they may fail to "see" them when
they are on the phone because attention is directed elsewhere.

%X The number of wireless phone subscribers in the U.S. is constantly growing.
Studies have shown that use of wireless phones while driving contributes to
crashes. Efforts to pass legislation allowing only hands-free wireless phone
use while driving are widespread and based on the assumption that a hands-free
interface is safer than a hand-held one. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration conducted a driving simulator study to examine the effects of
phone interface type on driving performance and drivers' ability to perform
phone tasks. Participants' phone interface preferences were also recorded.
Fifty-four participants drove a simulated freeway route with each of three
phone interfaces: hand-held, headset hands-free (voice dialing and headset),
and voice dialing hands-free (voice dialing with cradle-mounted speaker phone).
Although post-drive questionnaire results show that participants rated the
hand-held interface to be most difficult to use, this interface was associated
with the fewest dialing errors and significantly faster dialing times than the
two hands-free interfaces. Drivers answered the phone more quickly when using
the voice dialing hands-free phone interface than when using the hand-held or
headset hands-free interfaces. Younger drivers answered the phone significantly
more quickly than the older drivers. Hang up times were significantly faster in
the voice dialing hands-free condition and were slowest in the headset
hands-free condition. Conversation task performance did not differ as a
function of phone interface. Thus, although drivers considered them easier to
use than hand-held phone interfaces, hands-free interfaces were more
time-consuming to interact with while driving. Further analyses of these data
will investigate how other aspects of phone task performance are related to eye
glance behavior and driving performance.

using an approximation of a rigorous and validated model of driver behavior.
The system compares these simulations with a driver's actual observed behavior,
thus inferring the driver's unobservable intentions. The paper demonstrates how
this system can detect a driver's intention to change lanes, achieving an
accuracy of 85% with a false alarm rate of 4% detecting 80% of lane changes
within 1/2 second and 90% within 1 second; and detecting 90% before the vehicle
moves 1/4 of the lane width laterally -- that is, approximately when the
vehicle first touches the destination lane line.

%X This driving simulator study focuses on false and missing alarms produced by
a forward collision warning system and estimates the effect of alarm timing on
driver response to alarm malfunction from the perspective of driver trust. The
results show that drivers who experience late alarms are reluctant to respond
to a false alarm and are not influenced by a missing alarm, however drivers who
experience early alarms tend to respond to a false alarm and suffer a delayed
response to critical situations following a missing alarm. Furthermore, drivers
whose judgement of trust is relatively high, tend to exhibit delayed braking,
compared with drivers who have lower levels of trust. These results suggest
that driver behaviour towards false and missing alarms may vary according to
alarm timing and its influence on trust in alarms, moreover there is a
possibility that the negative effects of alarm malfunction may be mitigated by
manipulating alarm timing.

%X Five design guidelines were created to aid in the development of lane change
crash avoidance systems (LCAS), using on-road data. In preparation for
guideline development, field data were used to characterize a sample of lane
changes and baseline (straight-ahead) driving events. Analysis of lane change
frequency and duration, as well as turn signal use and eye glance movements
revealed unique patterns among drivers and conditions. The "vehicle + signal"
predictive logistic regression model is recommended, taking advantage of
distance, time-to-collision (TTC), and turn signal data. Design guidelines as
the basis for LCAS development were: 1) Warning levels should include presence
detection and imminent warnings; 2) Display modality should be visual displays
for presence detection and auditory/tactile displays for imminent warnings; 3)
Display location (visual) should include forward and mirror locations; 4)
Predictive warning algorithms should include TTC, distance, brake and turn
signal use, eye behavior, lane position, side object information, and
acceleration; 5) In terms of system integration, LCAS should be designed in the
context of other in-vehicle systems to maximize effectiveness and safety. Prior
to implementation, testing is strongly recommended regarding warning levels,
display location, warning format, predictive algorithms, and alarm rates.

%X It is estimated that as many as 2.7 million crashes per year occur at
intersections or are intersection related. These crashes result in over 8,500
fatalities every year and have prompted substantial research of technologies
that provide vehicle-based, infrastructure-based, or infrastructure-cooperative
Intersection Violation Warnings (IVWs) to drivers. Such a system would use a
pre-specified algorithm to identify drivers that have a high likelihood of
violating a traffic control device and subsequently warn the driver to stop.
However, prior to developing these algorithms, scientists must understand how
drivers respond to traffic signals. The current study characterized this driver
response in terms of driver deceleration rates and response time. Drivers
approached a signalized intersection at 35 mph (56.3 km/h), while their state
(baseline, distracted, and willful) was manipulated and the signal phase
changed at various distances. Results indicate that the chosen level of
deceleration varied with the state of the driver (e.g. distracted) and the
distance from the intersection at which the light changes. Response times,
however, did not vary based on these factors. Implications of these results are
discussed in terms of their applicability toward adapting the performance of
existing Forward Collision Warning algorithms for use in IVW applications.

%X This panel focuses on key issues that confront investigators who use driving
simulators and must (a) design experiments, (b) interpret data and (c) write
reports in human factors and medical research-related applications of these
simulators. Presentations from an experienced panel of researchers from the
U.S. and Canada aim to raise awareness of the audience (and panel members) and
discuss solutions to a number of thorny research issues confronting driving
simulator users. This effort draws upon but is distinct from previous work that
has customarily emphasized engineering concerns facing simulator developers.
   The panel began with a "Collaboratory" at University of Iowa in March 2001.
Discussions continued at the Driving Assessment conferences in Snowmass (2001)
and in Park City (2003), the latter under the aegis of the Simulation Users
Group (SUG). The SUG met again at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in
Washington, D.C. in January (2004) to address an array of topics including
physical fidelity, simulation adaptation syndrome, standards for reporting
methods, and variable selection. The session room was filled to capacity and
the topics were deeper than could be addressed in the available time. Clearly,
the discussions needed to continue beyond the TRB.
   The current HFES panel session addresses a limited set of topics in depth
and allow the audience to explore the issues at length during the open
discussion period. The abstracts of each panelist address topics that are not
much discussed in the literature. These topics include: simulator discomfort
related drop-out rates, participant characteristics, measurement precision and
missing data, and the need for simulation standards, e.g., for reporting
methodology and as a prelude to clinical trials, e.g., to test efficacy of
"treatments" such as in-vehicle driver alerting devices for at-risk drivers.

%X This paper reports a study conducted to evaluate the Traditional vs. the
Center Mounted instrument cluster using a fixed base driving simulator.
Twenty-four drivers (12 tall males and 12 short females) drove six laps on a
freeway driving course. After familiarization with the simulator, the drivers
were randomly assigned to drive first three laps with one cluster location, and
then they drove the next three laps with the cluster mounted in the second
location. In each lap, the drivers performed 16 tasks in pre-selected random
orders. The tasks involved increasing or decreasing speeds to instructed target
speeds, operating cruise controls and setting instructed speeds, reading gages,
viewing mirrors and operating selected controls in the vehicle. The results of
the study showed: 1) The driver's abilities to maintain speed and lateral
position were significantly better (about 13% reduction in standard deviations
of speed and lateral position) when driving with the center mounted cluster as
compared to the traditional location. 2) The total number of eye glances made
by the drivers in performing the tasks was not affected by the cluster
location. 3) The drivers' preferences, after driving with both the clusters,
however, were mixed-about half the drivers preferred the center cluster over
the traditional cluster. 4) Older drivers had significantly larger standard
deviations in both speed and lateral position than the younger drivers in using
both the clusters.

%X Young drivers are known to perform less than ideally in a number of traffic
contexts. Behavior feedback is critical for the development of safe driving
skills. Forty-two young drivers aged 18 to 20 were randomly assigned to three
training conditions: an insight and error training condition, an error only
training condition, or a control condition. Participants in the training
conditions drove simulated trials in which a lead vehicle braked suddenly in
front of them. The insight + error group received verbal performance feedback,
while the error only group did not. The insight + error group showed a
significant increase in time headway by the end of training. However, the
increase was not significant in the follow-up drive one week later. Overall
driver confidence was also not affected by the training. Results suggest that
the combination of insight and error-based feedback modulates behavior over
short time periods, but may not be sufficient for the adoption of safe
behaviors over longer time periods.

%X Novice drivers have a fatality rate that is ten times higher than the most
experienced group of drivers. The primary reason for this is the novice
drivers' inability to predict the risks that appear in the roadway ahead. No
driver education programs currently exist which teach risk awareness skills to
novice drivers across a number of different scenarios. Such a program was
developed and then evaluated in two experiments. In the first, 24 novice
drivers completed a PC-based risk awareness training program which displayed
plan views of 10 different risky scenarios. In the second, the risk awareness
of these 24 trained novice drivers and an additional 24 untrained novice
drivers was evaluated in an advanced driving simulator using measures of their
eye movements. The set of PC trained novice drivers were more likely to
recognize risks on the driving simulator, both in those scenarios studied in
training and those not seen previously.

%X Optical looming has been proposed as a potentially important cue for the
perception of time-to-collision (TTC) in the control of locomotion. In this
paper, an investigation is reported on how manipulation of the optical looming
cue can influence the perception of TTC, and thereby braking behaviour, for
automobile driving in a low fidelity simulator. Eleven participants were
instructed to follow a leading vehicle (LV) and appropriately respond to the
braking events of the LV, which occurred randomly at different deceleration
rates. For some braking events, during braking of the LV, size of the LV was
expanded without subjects being aware of it. Results showed that subjects
braked sooner when confronting an expanding LV compared to a constant-size LV.
The experiment supports the theory that drivers use TTC information derived
from optic looming to control braking. Potential application of the results to
possibly reduce occurrences of rear-end collisions in real automobile driving
is also discussed.

%X Use of in-vehicle routing and navigational systems (IRANS) is on the rise.
IRANS may place additional informational processing demands on drivers thus
compromising safety. Driving requires extensive visual processing and therefore
auditory route guidance (ARG) systems have important safety advantages.
However, relative to visual guidance formats, little attention has been focused
on the design components of ARG formats. The current investigation examined the
relative impact of three different ARG formats (traditional, cardinal, and
landmark) on drivers' ability to learn novel routes through unfamiliar areas in
a driving simulator. Results indicated that the inclusion of salient landmark
information in ARG instructions facilitated route learning ability for a
majority of drivers, relative to traditional ARG information and the inclusion
of cardinal directions. Application of these results has the potential to
increase transportation safety by decreasing the attentional processing
requirements and distraction cost of existing IRANS displays.

fatigue-related accidents, particularly during the nighttime hours (Pack et
al.). However, there is a probable relationship between nighttime
fatigue-related accidents and the number of young drivers on the road during
this same time period. This paper introduces a measure of exposure, the number
of drivers on the road for a given hour, and evaluates its affect on fatal
accident and fatigue-related fatal accident rates. Data from the National
Household Travel Survey 2001 and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System are
used. Overall, fatal accident and fatal fatigue-related accident rates are low
but the increased risk of young drivers, particularly during the nighttime
hours is highlighted.

%X The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of circadian
cycles, gender, and propensity for cognitive errors on driving performance.
Participants (14 women, 6 men), classified as "Evening Types," performed a
low-fidelity driving task during either their peak (evening) or off-peak
(morning) times. Although neither penalty nor damage scores varied
significantly by time of day, a gender by time of day interaction was observed
for damage scores. Specifically, women driving during the day (off-peak) had
accrued significantly more damage to their vehicles than did women driving in
the evening (peak). However, damage scores for men were not significantly
impacted by the time of day in which they drove. Women also received
significantly higher penalty scores regardless of time of day. Participants'
overall propensity for committing cognitive failures was significantly related
to penalty scores (r = .50), but not to damage scores (r = .39). The results
help identify individual differences in risk factors for driving.

as a primary cause of these fatalities. Such skills may be particularly
compromised during the night. The purpose of this study is to determine how
visual scanning skills are affected by lighting conditions and driving
experience. Using a head mounted eye tracker, drivers' scanning skills were
evaluated on a simulator. The results show that novice drivers are less likely
to scan for risks than experienced drivers in both the daytime and nighttime
conditions and both novice and experienced drivers are less likely to scan for
risks in the nighttime than they are in the daytime. Moreover, novice drivers
are scanning the risky areas less than 50 percent of the time during daytime
conditions, suggesting a need for risk prediction training during both daytime
and nighttime conditions.

variability appeared to increase somewhat in the sun condition. These effects,
which are similar to what has been reported for driver behavior in fog and
other impaired-visibility conditions, increase the risk of accidents. Causes
and implications are discussed in the paper.

%X Flach, Smith, Dittman, &amp; Stanard's (2003) hypothesis that a linear
weighting of optical angle and expansion rate are used as a criterion for
braking is evaluated in a simple driving task. The task required participants
to drive from an initial stationary position to a full stop at a comfortable
distance in front of a stationary obstacle. The simulated vehicle was
controlled with an accelerator and a brake. Acceleration and deceleration were
proportional to displacement of these controls. Results showed that people's
critical actions (releasing the accelerator and initiating the brake)
corresponded with a Tau criterion (constant ratio of angle and expansion rate).
Time histories suggest that people were adopting non-proportional, discrete
control strategies that approached time optimal, bang-bang control.

%X A meta-analysis was conducted to explore the costs associated with cell
phone use while driving, using standardized measures of effect size along five
dimensions (moderator variables) that were hypothesized to impact the costs
associated with cell phone use. Sixteen studies (contributing a total of 37
analysis entries) met the appropriate conditions for the meta-analysis.
Overall, there were clear costs to driving performance when drivers are engaged
in cell phone conversations. However, investigation of moderator variables
indicated that these costs were borne primarily by reaction time tasks, with
far smaller costs associated with tracking (lane keeping) performance.
Hands-free and hand-held phones revealed similar patterns of results, as did
simulator versus field studies. Conversation tasks tended to show greater costs
to performance than did information-processing tasks (e.g., word games).
Finally, costs in driving performance were roughly equivalent whether the
conversation was with a passenger or whether over a cell phone.

%X Advanced in-vehicle technologies (IVTs) are rapidly being introduced.
Methods of assessing the mental workload required by the driving situation are
imperative to the safe implementation of these advanced systems. The current
investigation compared the sensitivity of an array of assessment techniques to
changes in simulated driving task demand. P300 amplitude was sensitive to
increased driving task demand due to reduced visibility (presence of fog) but
was not sensitive to changes in road type (urban versus freeway). Conversely,
RT and accuracy to a secondary task were sensitive to changes in road type but
were not sensitive to the visibility manipulation. Subjective workload ratings
were not sensitive to either manipulation. Results are discussed in terms of
their implications for assessing the impact of environmental factors on the
mental workload demands of the driving task and for the design and
implementation of adaptive driver interfaces.

car-following task in a driving simulator. In the choice response task, they
responded either manually or vocally to whether a visual or auditory stimulus
was presented once or twice. In the braking task, they depressed a brake pedal
to the onset of the lead car's brake lights. The onset delay between the choice
and braking stimuli was varied. This manipulation revealed that the braking
reaction was greatly affected by concurrent performance of the choice task,
although there were no or very small specific effects on it by the stimulus and
response modalities of the choice task. The results demonstrate that even a
well-practiced, "simple" task such as vehicle braking is subject to dual-task
slowing and appear to be due to central, not peripheral, interference.

impact upon the driving behavior of young and old participants. The effect of a
secondary task on measures of driving performance including the recognition of
road signs, detection and avoidance of large low contrast road hazards,
judgment of cone gaps, and time to complete the course was assessed for young
and older participants as they drove around a 5 km closed road driving course.
The secondary task required participants to verbally report the sums of pairs
of numbers presented either through a computer speaker (auditorially) or via a
dashboard mounted monitor (visually) while driving. The results show that
drivers reported fewer road signs, increased their time to complete the road
course, and misjudged cone gaps more frequently under the dual-task (visual and
auditory) conditions compared to the single task condition and these effects
were greater for the older participants.

%X The focus of this symposium, co-sponsored by the Psychophysiology in
Ergonomics interest group of the International Ergonomics Association, is to
illustrate how psychophysiological measurement can contribute to a broad sample
of research issues in driving. Papers from Japan, France, and the United States
will be presented that examine diverse research questions in driver workload,
sleepiness, affect, and attention. The papers report how a variety of
psychophysiological measures (e.g., ocular activity, and skin, cardiovascular,
and electroencephalographic responses) that were obtained in research
environments ranging from laboratory part-task and driving simulation to field
studies can supplement and complement more traditional performance and
subjective measures of driver behavior. The papers will present both past and
present uses of psychophysiology in driving research as well as discuss
potential uses of psychophysiology for future research.

%X In some previous simulator studies, we showed that drivers, engaged in a
secondary in-vehicle task at different display separations, were able to buffer
some aspects of the driving task (e.g., vehicle control), but not others (e.g.,
hazard response; Horrey &amp; Wickens, 2002, Horrey, Alexander, &amp; Wickens,
2003). We speculate that this pattern of results may be a result of effective
time-sharing between the ambient visual task of vehicle control and the focal
visual in-vehicle task, but task interference between the in-vehicle task and
the focal task of hazard detection and identification. Alternatively, drivers
may be using an optimal scanning strategy that allows them to effectively
monitor both the roadway and the in-vehicle device. In this paper, we detail
some of the theoretical background, describe some relevant research, and
present a model of scanning behavior.

%X Driving simulators provide a closely controlled environment for examining
links between human physiology and behavior. Physiologic measurements in
different driving tasks can assess body temperature, heart rate, respiratory
rate, galvanic skin response, electroencephalographic activity,
electromyography activity, gastric activity, eyelid closure (as an index of
alertness and arousal), and eye movements (as an index of cognitive
processing). Synchronous measures of driver physiology and performance in
driving simulator scenarios can illuminate relationships between cognitive
deficits and performance errors in drivers who lack awareness of
self-impairment and environmental hazards. Demonstrations include falling
asleep at the controls in drivers affected by cognitive overload, fatigue,
prescription medicine or drug effects, or mental decline from brain disease.

%X Driver annoyance, trust, and workload were manipulated in a simulated
driving task with an unreliable auditory calendar system side task while
cardiovascular measures were collected. Participants performed a car-following
task in either a difficult or easy driving condition while interacting with an
automated voice calendar. The automated calendar system used a spoken alert to
notify drivers as they approached a desired location (i.e., "pharmacy").
Reliability was manipulated at 90, 70, 50, and 30 percent correct prediction of
the location. Drivers also experienced of one of four auditory alerts (none,
60, 75, or 90 dB SPL) designed to elicit subjective annoyance. Low-frequency
hear rate variability (LF-HRV, 0.10 Hz band variance) was suppressed during
high workload and differed between baseline driving and driving with the
calendar system. LF-HRV suggested that cognitive effort was lower for more
reliable systems with an alarm tone.

%X The aim of the experiment was to test the effect of an automated system of
bus docking on drivers' mental workload, to guarantee good acceptance and
minimal distraction from traffic. Reduced workload is thought to be brought
about by helping the driver to maneuver, as he is only required to monitor
proper functioning of the system. Workload was estimated by electrodermal
activity recording while drivers tested five scenarios, involving or not the
docking system. Results showed that docking precision was improved by the
system, compared with manual docking. Drivers' workload was higher when they
monitored the functioning of the system but was reduced after a learning
process. Increased workload was evidenced in the event of dysfunction of the
docking system, especially when drivers had to take over control. However,
after habituation, such a system could be integrated into buses to improve
safety during boarding and egress.

%X Twenty male students performed three 5-minute trials of a PC-based
multi-task which consisted of three independent tasks, i.e., resource
management task, system monitoring (vigilance reaction time) task and
compensatory tracking task. Participants were instructed to perform only one
task (tracking) during the second trial. Tracking task performance, subjective
workload, mood scores and physiological parameters (Tissue Blood Volume,
Hemodynamics, Systolic Time Intervals, Heart Rate Variability and Skin
Potential Level (SPL)) were obtained. The task performance was significantly
improved and subjective workloads evaluated by NASA-TLX were significantly low
in the second trial. SPL measured on the left palm showed a significantly high
value in the low workload trial when compared to high workload trials. No other
physiological parameter showed such workload related significant changes among
the trials. This result suggested that SPL is sensitive to the workload change
although that the electrode must be attached to a palm so that it may disturb
task performance.

%X This research investigates the ability of a driver to detect forward and
peripheral events while driving and interacting with a voice recognition
system. Thirty-seven participants took part in a driving experiment on a closed
highway. Participants performed phone dialing tasks using either a voice
recognition system simulation or a manual cell phone while driving.
Participants also monitored two lights: one mounted on the hood of the vehicle
and one on the left side mirror. Participants were instructed to press a foot
pedal when a light appeared (i.e., event). Data were collected on drivers'
glance locations as well as their responses to events. Results suggested that
voice recognition dialing generally resulted in better visual scanning of the
environment and response time to events than manual dialing. In addition, for
younger participants, performance using the voice recognition system was
similar to baseline driving, while older participants showed performance
decrements for all tasks relative to baseline driving.

%X Situation Awareness (SA) is critical to safe driving in a dynamic traffic
environment. SA is predicated on the timely sampling of information in the
driving environment. Distraction from secondary tasks can interrupt this
sampling resulting in increased traffic conflicts and crashes. It is
hypothesized that SA may be improved if sampling is augmented with (redundant)
non-visual feedback about relevant information in the driving scene. The
current study examined a Driver Support System (DSS) based on continuous haptic
feedback communicated through the gas pedal. This system was evaluated in a
driving simulator with participants distracted by a secondary task utilizing
the CD player. The results indicate that this DSS improved reaction time,
response time, and response appropriateness (safety margin) despite an apparent
increase in the transition period between pedals. Various mechanisms to explain
these effects are posited.

%X Most young drivers are comfortable driving at night despite the increased
danger. The selective degradation hypothesis predicts that drivers'
overconfidence at night is a consequence of their ability to steer being
preserved even though their ability to recognize details is impaired. To test
this hypothesis, ten participants drove a curvy simulated roadway with varying
levels of luminance, blur, and visual field size. Steering performance, but not
visual acuity, was degraded when the visual field was reduced. Acuity, but not
steering performance, was severely degraded by extreme blur and extremely low
luminance. These findings support the selective degradation hypothesis, suggest
that separate neural mechanisms support visual recognition and visual guidance
skills, and emphasize the problems that occur when unexpected low contrast
objects are present in the roadway environment at night.

%X Computer, software, telecommunications, and automotive companies have begun
to develop In-Vehicle Information System (IVIS) functions despite the potential
for these devices to distract drivers. A simulator study examined how the
demands of an IVIS affected driver response in tactical and control braking
conditions. The IVIS demands were manipulated according to multiple resource
theory dimensions of processing code and stage. Drivers listened to and
answered questions about messages containing information about restaurants. The
findings show that verbal and spatial coding had little effect on driving
performance, but responding to the messages degraded reaction time in the
tactical braking conditions. These results suggest that particular
consideration should be given to IVIS tasks that demand a response from the
driver and that tactical rather than simply control driving performance merits
attention in IVIS evaluation.

%X The change detection paradigm was used in a single-monitor driving simulator
to study drivers' awareness of other vehicles on the roadway. While driving, a
moving or parked vehicle ahead (30 or 60 m) would occasionally change location
(30% or 60% nearer or farther away), color, or identity during a 150 ms
blank-out period. The results showed that only for moving vehicles with a very
large location displacement (60%) can the participants detect changes as well
as with the color or identity change. We also examined how the driving task
itself influences the formation of this representation; overall, the detection
performance was better in the non-driving condition. We argue that vehicle
location is coarsely represented in drivers' memory, and that this, together
with vehicle features, is used to visually monitor more fine-grained location
information. This helps explain why drivers often fail to notice a decreasing
distance to the car ahead, resulting in rear-end collisions.

multiple displays. An IDS provides a logical structure and uses a standardized

Air Traffic Control (ATC). We conducted an investigation of information and
usability requirements in each of the ATC domains. Based on the investigation
and on existing design guidelines and standards, we developed design principles
that capture the critical components of designing an effective IDS for ATC. In
order to be useful and usable, an IDS and the information it contains should be
accessible, current, comprehensive, and standardized. We discuss each of these
principles, the motivation for including them, and some specific examples of
how they can be implemented in an IDS. We also discuss the methods used for
collecting data from the field, refining, and validating the principles.

utilization, the number of tasks performed, and the quality of decisions made
by the operators. Recently, C3TRACE was used to develop models of two Future
Combat Systems (FCS) conceptual configurations. This paper discusses the theory
and application of the tool.

methods. Typically these rely on task analysis data supported by various
algorithms that provide measures of performance quality. This paper reports on
a validation study with one such method, for cognitive task analysis of skilled
operator performance, task performance time estimation, workload assessment,
and human error analysis. This was used to model train drivers' response to
route features and derive performance time and workload estimates. The modelled
scenarios were run in a cab simulator with N=17 driver subjects. Observational
data were used to compare their strategy, performance times and workload
profiles against predictions. The results show that the method produces data
that are a useful approximation of real performance strategy, timings and
workload.

methods of training. Knowledge engineering is a process to extracts knowledge
from expert operators that has been applied successfully in the past to
redesign current systems and to develop training methods for complex tasks. In
this paper we present a formal model of the process, a description of its
steps, and an example of its application to a current system. The present study
demonstrates the benefit of applying the knowledge engineering process to learn
about the operation of a commercial lawn mower. In this study, nine operators
were interviewed to obtain the knowledge and cues they used to perform a mowing
task. Examples of the results from knowledge engineering are presented.

%X Design patterns have been increasing in popularity as a method supporting
human-computer interface (HCI) development. Patterns represent various levels
of design abstraction and can describe the design rationale in a consistent
manner. They can enable design communication among distributed designers
working on large scale command and control (C{sup:2}) systems. The design goal
for a complex C{sup:2} system is a concise set of patterns that supports a
large variety of mission domains. A set of design patterns has been developed
for a future Naval C{sup:2} system. The HCI task domains encompass a variety of
mission and shipboard task processes. A small set of design patterns have been
created to represent a set of HCI navigation tasks which serve a variety of
mission types. Task navigation HCI methods guide the user to computer generated
products which service mission goals in a "mission-centered" design context.
Task product patterns are described by a taxonomy of task product
characteristics. Further testing of the proposed navigation &amp; product
patterns is in progress and usability tests indicate that patterns tested thus
far show promising performance and training gains.

%X This paper reports on a study into the Levels of Abstraction Hierarchy
(LOAH). The original proposition for the LOAH was that it depicted the levels
of system representation, working from functional purpose through to physical
form to determine causes of a malfunction, or from physical form to functional
purpose to determine purpose for system function. The LOAH has been widely used
throughout human supervisory control research to explain individual behaviour,
but most control rooms comprise teams. The research sought to determine if the
LOAH could be used to describe human supervisory control teams. A series of
interviews were conducted in an energy distribution company. The results favour
the LOAH, but suggest that people in the team are predominately operating at
different levels of system representation, depending upon their team role.

%X The Crew Station Design Tool helps designers visualize and optimize their
choices of controls and displays, and position those elements in a workstation.
This paper describes the tool's ability to design the cockpit of a fixed-wing
aircraft and compares the results to an actual airliner. The tasks, task
sequences, operator assignments, and control and display assignments were
developed with the help of a subject matter expert. After this information was
entered into the tool, the cockpit was drawn in a three-dimensional graphic
environment. Alternate layouts were created using three different criteria: 1)
frequency of use, 2) sequence of use, and 3) frequency and sequence of use. Of
the three layouts, the frequency of use was subjectively closest to the actual
airliner. The proposed layout also suggested some control and display locations
that might be better for an actual flight deck.

%X A supporting investigation of human operator errors is discussed. Existing
classification systems (taxonomies) are mostly used to analyze the accident
reports, and not for investigating the accidents themselves. These systems
provide appropriate taxonomy primarily for Reason's latent conditions and not
so much for active errors. A model incorporating the active error
characteristics of underlying cognitive sources along with the classification
system for them is presented. It describes a human operator error as a group of
frames adjusted to the activity of different operators, such as pilot or air
traffic controller. Our model of active error and its classification system,
combined with existing latent conditions classification systems, constitute a
powerful tool -- a decision support system for investigating human errors.
Additionally, our model can be used as a basis for defining algorithms to
analyze human performance in complex man-machine systems.

%X This paper examines three of the Integrated Performance Modelling
Environment's builtin workload methodologies: Prediction of Operator
Performance (POP), Information Processing/Perceptual Control Theory (IP/PCT),
and POPIP. The newly-implemented POPIP is compared to its forerunner
methodologies, POP and IP/PCT. POP, developed by QinetiQ, predicts performance
degradation from interference between concurrent tasks using estimates of
workload on different channels. IP/PCT, developed by DRDC Toronto, theorizes
that all factors that impact human cognitive workload can be reduced to their
effects on the amount of information to be processed, and the amount of time
available before the task must be completed. POPIP uses components from both
POP and IP/PCT for a combined workload algorithm that offers interference based
on time pressure, and task scheduling. A sample IPME model is discussed, and
used as an example in comparing all three workload methodologies.

CSCW phenomena. In our prior work a more ecological laboratory approach was
developed to study activity awareness issues derived directly from earlier
fieldwork. In the first study participants worked on a simulated long-term
project with a confederate who introduced collaborative breakdown scenarios.
Although the study produced many realistic behaviors, findings indicated that
there was room for improving the model by making the simulation more ecological
and engaging for participants. This paper examines the results of a follow-up
study conducted with the goal of improving the laboratory model. The follow-up
study varied two important elements of simulation from the first study. A real
long-term project was used, and the confederate was replaced with another
participant. Differences in results from the two studies indicate how the
changes made to the model impacted its effectiveness.

%X A survey method is described that has been successfully used to gather
multi-dimensional user preferences for public transit information systems.
Iterative user testing aided in both (a) creation of a transit meta-scenario
and (b) design of an intuitive survey method for collecting a broad array of
data in a short period of time (30 minutes). The survey provided user
requirements for 2,304 combinations of preferred types of information, as well
as where, when, and the preferred delivery method for each type. Letter-number
combinations were used to capture where and how participants wanted each
information type. The survey method provided high-quality data over a range of
transit customer types. Effectiveness of the survey no doubt benefited from the
iterative user testing approach used during development. The technique employed
in this study provides an efficient and productive approach to the collection
of multi-dimensional user requirements.

revealed both that: these models/analyses are not widely used in studies
reported in HF/E journals, and practitioners avoid them due to misconceptions
regarding their scientific validity. For applications-orientated HF/E studies,
two conditions are demonstrated where directional testing is appropriate: (a)
When unpredicted direction differences would be meaningless (e.g.,
cumulative-risk declines with increased exposure); and (b) When unpredicted
directional findings will result in the same action as no difference (e.g.,
many program-and product-evaluations). One- vs. two-tailed testing results in
sample-size savings of &ge;30% across virtually all situations where the
Student t-test or corresponding 'directional F-test' may be appropriately
applied. HF/E practitioners are encouraged to: Utilize one-tailed and
directional models/analyses when conditions reflect the logical or functional
'one-sidedness' implicit in many HF/E studies, and Take full advantage of the
substantially reduced sample-sizes (&le;70%) and associated resource
expenditures.

representations of complex systems is described in this report, with an
illustrative application to an integrated telematics system for use in
passenger vehicles. Thirty-two "tech-savvy" and "average-user" participants
completed a card-sorting task based on the functional and information elements
of an integrated telematics system under development. The data were
comparatively analyzed using cluster and structural analyses. While both types
of analyses generally identified the same mental model categories, only the
structural analysis provided information about "distributed" functions that
occurred in more than one category of the user's mental representation. This
led to a more detailed and interconnected implementation of the telematics
system. Usability evaluations of the structural-analysis-based design provided
support of its effectiveness in capturing the mental representations of the
telematic system held by both "tech-savvy" and "average-user" participants.

%X Time and money constraints are often an issue when selecting a method for
testing user interface designs. The Wizard of Oz technique allows usability
practitioners to re-create speech user interfaces without building a
hi-fidelity prototype. Wizard of Oz in a Structured Expert Review (WiSER)
leverages the advantages of Wizard of Oz by combining it with aspects of the
Cognitive Walkthrough method. The result is a method which can be efficiently
implemented to test speech user interfaces by using usability practitioners as
test participants and the designer as the wizard. The participant is presented
with a set of tasks to complete using the speech user interface. After each
task, problem areas are discussed and design alternatives, explored; modified
versions of the two questions identified by Spencer [2000] are addressed for
each problem area. This paper covers a direct comparison of WiSER to an online
usability test in which both tests are executed on a voice dialer application.

%X Heuristic evaluation method comparison is important for developing new
heuristic sets, to ensure effectiveness and utility. However, comparing
different sets of heuristics requires a common baseline upon which a comparison
can be made, usually some set of usability problems from a particular
interface. This is often accomplished by having evaluators perform system
evaluation to produce a set of usability problems for each method in question.
A problem arises in that different methods produce different sets of problems,
thus introducing validity concerns and ambiguity in resolution of disparate
problem sets. We address this problem by illustrating a new comparison
technique in which predetermined usability issues are presented to the
evaluators up front, followed by assessment of thoroughness, reliability, and
cost for the target methods. Comparison of method effectiveness is simplified,
and validity concerns are ameliorated.

%X In a ubiquitous computing environment, the operation information on a
product is collectable to a homeserver. Operation information in this paper
means that the button on an operation panel are pushed and the door of a
refrigerator are opened. This data is very extensive and is a motion level.
Authors consider analysing this information by datamining method. That is, it
is extracting the information about usability out of operation information by
datamining. The authors propose this called In-Situ Ergonomics: gathering data
from products in the actual situation, analysing data with datamining method
and extract information for ergonomics research. In order to realize In-Situ
Ergonomics, the following serves as a subject.
 - The collection method of the user operation information from each product
 - The accumulation method of a lot of data
 - The semantic analysis of operation information datamining method
 - The cooperation method with the existing usability analysis method

%X Both Traditional and Fuzzy Signal Detection Theory (SDT) methods of analyses
were compared using a duration discrimination task of brief light flashes. Both
difficulty and response bias (by instruction) were manipulated. The two methods
clearly provided different estimates of SDT parameters. The Fuzzy SDT analyses
inflated performance while the traditional SDT analyses underestimated
performance. In some cases performance on the 'easier' condition was worse than
on the more 'difficult' condition. This may be due to differences in the range
of durations discriminated, which was narrower in the 'easier' condition. Range
of stimuli used can impact performance, although it or maybe an artifact of the
procedure for the crisp analysis. Fuzzy SDT met the assumptions of traditional
SDT, the assumption of normally distributed noise and signal plus noise
distribution holds. In addition, the equal variance assumption holds for the
more difficult discrimination for all participants.

%X Validation is an essential step in developing a new measure. This research
is concerned with gathering initial evidence of the construct validity of the
Mild Motion Questionnaire (MMQ), a 39-item paper-and-pencil based tool for
assessing sopite syndrome and other responses to non-sickening motion. Two
groups of participants (49 US Navy trainee pilots versus 56 undergraduate
students) completed the MMQ after exposure to one of four disparate stimuli: a
familiarization flight, visuomotor sensory rearrangement, a control task, or
progressive muscle relaxation. The various treatment conditions led to
distinctly different symptoms of sopite in participants. The specific symptom
profiles revealed through MMQ subscale scores differed greatly and predictably
across conditions, suggesting that the MMQ effectively discriminated among the
types of symptoms experienced. In addition, a convergence was observed between
responses on an established motion sickness questionnaire and subscales of the
MMQ pertaining to sickening responses to mild motion, supporting further the
(convergent) construct validity of the MMQ.

%X The focus on worker training to recognize hazards assumes that workers will
always recall what constitutes a safe or unsafe situation as well as respond to
perceived or actual risks in the same manner. Regardless of the safety training
program adopted, the focus on worker training to recognize hazards frequently
overlooks the fact that hazard recognition is contextual and subject to
individual judgment and experience. In addition, the tendency to work in known
hazardous situations will depend on a worker's risk orientation. The specific
aim of this research was to develop a methodology to assess worker sensitivity
and risk orientation towards unsafe work conditions. The methodology was
developed using Signal Detection Theory. The methodology was demonstrated for
ironworkers. The methodology proposed in this research provides a guiding
framework for training development on how to enhance workers' abilities to
identify the boundary beyond which work is no longer safe.

%X Postural instability is a primary symptom of advanced Parkinson's disease
(PD). Falling, and restriction of activity due to postural instability have a
major influence on the health and quality of life of individuals with PD.
Presently, clinical measurement of postural stability in PD is crude. The
purpose of the present study was to assess the ability of static posturography
and a time-series analysis technique termed recurrence quantification analysis
(RQA) to detect postural instability in PD (Hoehn and Yahr Stage 3 --
participants with known postural instability). The results of analyses indicate
that the postural sway of participants with PD was more variable than that of
elderly, healthy controls. In addition, the spatiotemporal profile of postural
sway for PD participants reflected greater regularity and stability. These
results suggest that the novel combination of static posturography and RQA may
be a suitable testing and evaluation method for detecting postural instability.

%X Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been successfully used for years in
academic institutions. The military would like to leverage this capability in
training simulators, however scenario-based training (SBT) differs from
classroom instruction in significant ways. This symposium focuses on ITS
methodological extensions that support SBT. The paper by Neville and her
colleagues (2004) describes, among other things, why scenario-based training is
important in military domains. The remaining papers in the symposium (Douglass,
2004; Mangos, 2004; Dorsey, White &amp; Bolton, 2004) describe different ways
of incorporating ITS concepts into SBT systems. While each paper describes a
different system architecture / approach, all three systems focus on
implementing two key capabilities of ITSs: student diagnosis and adaptive
instruction. While most of the work discussed in this symposium is in a
preliminary stage of development, the convergence of these two fields holds
great promise for increasing military training effectiveness, as well as many
opportunities for conducting future research.

will be using it and ways in which trainees should be able to interact with and
use the 3-D graphics. The training system must significantly improve the rate
of satellite system knowledge acquisition beyond the rate obtained using
current training practices. To this end, training principles that facilitate
the acquisition of complex, functional, and integrated knowledge guided the

%X This paper describes the Prolog-Like Agent Specification &amp; Tutor
Implementation Calculus (PLASTIC) framework. PLASTIC is an intelligent tutor
authoring system in which instructional agents based on models of human
decision making, communication, action, and unit task execution are specified
and deployed. To help non-programmers develop agent-based intelligent tutoring
systems, PLASTIC includes GUI-based agent specification and performance
visualization tools. PLASTIC agents provide instructional scaffolding by
offering helpful hints that highlight task-relevant aspects of problems, help
trainees think about tasks appropriately, guide trainees through unfamiliar
problems, and encourage new strategy formation. To demonstrate how PLASTIC is
used to implement agent-based instructional systems, a tutor incorporated into
an Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC) scenario-based training system is
discussed. The technology through which PLASTIC tracks AAWC trainee actions and
produces instructional scaffolding is discussed. The instructional impact of
the PLASTIC tutor incorporated into the AAWC scenario-based trainer is
illustrated with a discussion of training effectiveness data.

%X Higher-fidelity, scenario-based approaches for training teams and teamwork
skills present unique challenges to trainees. These challenges include
multitasking and prioritizing various actions given current scenario events.
This paper highlights a unique methodology and modeling approach, based on
intelligent tutoring system concepts, that is used to identify relatively
critical activities during a training exercise and provide targeted feedback to
trainees regarding their choice of actions. This feedback forms a basis for
reflection and improved performance via focused post-training, after-action
review sessions.

%X The scenario-based approach to training offers the potential for customized
instruction. However, practical limitations and little theoretical guidance for
individualizing instructional events to learners' needs have rendered difficult
the realization of this potential. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to
propose a framework for intelligent, scenario-based training that iteratively
and adaptively tailors training events to the unique needs of the learner.
Drawing from advances in assessment and psychometric theory, the proposed
framework allows decomposition of scenarios into component elements, empirical
investigation of how these elements influence training performance, and
adaptive generation of scenario content that targets the occurrence of
subjective learning events.

into military training programs at an increasing pace, but the results are
often different from those intended. This paper describes a three-year research
project to study the individual and organizational effects of this revolution
in training, as well as to develop recommendations and methods for more
effectively integrating new CDL technologies into training environments.
Qualitative case studies were conducted at eight diverse military training
sites, with researchers focusing on barriers, problems, and enablers for
technology employment. Study data has revealed employment concerns that must be
addressed during the CDL design, development, and delivery process to ensure
successful technology integration. These findings are then converted into
training, support, and reference materials to help CDL stakeholders (end users
and creators of the technology) achieve the full potential of this exciting,
new training technology.

%X Since the end of the cold war, military forces have increasingly been
required to manage crowds of people, some of which may quickly turn violent.
Frequently, crowd researchers identify "flashpoint" variables: environmental or
social triggers that cause a crowd to become hostile. The goal of this research
was to identify potential flashpoints, to assist the simulation and training
communities in crowd representation. Researchers exhaustively reviewed crowd
literature, surveyed subject matter experts in crowd control, and analyzed
anecdotal crowd events. Survey results indicated that crowd weapons, alcohol
and drugs, crowd commitment, and crowd desperation may be flashpoints for
violence. However, none of these variables strongly varied with culture.
Anecdotal results revealed additional flashpoint variables, such as aggression
and the use of auditory stimuli by control force members, instigators within
the crowd, and general masculine culture. These findings agree in part with
results from existing literature, and have implications for peacekeeper
training.

effective training solution for shipboard helicopter signaling skills. We
identified training objectives, explored training/simulation concepts,
identified signal task training requirements, and demonstrated a prototype
concept. The training solution includes an innovative prototype Hand Signal
Recognition System that utilizes computer vision, a personal computer, a video
camera, image acquisition and processing software, and a decision-making
algorithm to recognize hand signals in support of signal task training for the
Navy Landing Signal Enlisted (LSE) position. The training solution is practical
for LSE signal training at the schoolhouse, capable of being deployed aboard
ship with some constraints, and cost-effective. The training techniques and
hand signal recognition technology developed in this project, and the lessons
learned about training shipboard signaling skills, are useful to a variety of
training and human factors professionals. The training and technology are
relevant to a variety of applications such as emergency medical evacuation,
search and rescue, oil platform operations, and shipboard control of unmanned
aerial vehicles.

%X The management of risk remains one of the most significant skills that
pilots are expected to engage during aircraft operations. However, it is a
skill that is seldom taught explicitly during aviation training. The present
study sought to examine whether active involvement, and/or the provision of
feedback during training, impacted behaviour during a simulated flight. Forty
pilots were divided into groups so that some pilots flew the training flight in
pairs, while others flew the flight as a single-pilot operation. Following
training, half the participants received feedback concerning their performance.
During a test flight, one week later, those participants who were actively
involved in the flight displayed more risk averse behaviour in comparison to
those participants who were simply co-pilots. Furthermore, the provision of
feedback during training only appeared beneficial when pilots were able to
recall similarities between the test flight and other flights that they had
experienced.

%X The advantages of simulation in team training are well documented and
accepted by trainers and students. The opportunity for teams to apply knowledge
and practice skills to meet realistic problems in a realistic environment is
intuitively more motivating, and can be a more valuable training experience for
a team than merely reading about, being lectured on, or observing someone else
perform a task. Training managers also are attracted to the economic and
logistical advantages of linking multiple teams in a simulated environment when
compared to the cost and effort required for comparable live exercises. To
date, the primary focus of research in distributed simulation-based training
has been the continuous quest for greater realism in visual displays; enhanced
fidelity of the models that drive the simulation; and the need to improve the
speed, reliability, and capacity of communications among different simulators
and trainers. Less effort has been devoted to developing technologies that can
increase the instructional value of a simulation exercise or that could help an
instructional designer make the best use of a simulation-based training
opportunity. Such technologies would help an instructor to design more
effective scenarios; more accurately and efficiently observe, record, and
analyze the trainees' performance; and support the necessary learning events
before, during, and after the scenario to meet specific training objectives.

theory into techniques to diagnose performance and methods for debriefing and
illustrate how events within the training space can be monitored, filtered, and
potentially structured such that performance feedback is idiosyncratically
tailored. By utilizing a coordinated debriefing methodology that encompasses
cognitively-based and technologically-based components, we illustrate how
navigating the training space can be facilitated.

%X Automated data collection, assessment, and diagnosis capabilities are key
requirements of an instructional framework to support performance evaluation
and debrief of multiple teams participating in distributed simulation-based
exercises. This paper discusses methods and issues in the application of
automated performance data collection and assessment capabilities as part of a
prototype Debriefing Distributed Simulation-Based Exercises (DDSBE) system. The
automated data collection process obtains data from local and distributed
simulation systems and operator consoles to assess individual, team, and
multi-team performance on training objectives during scenario-critical/key
events. The automated assessment component accesses expected performance data
related to critical scenario events and compares the actions observed within a
specified time window with the set of expected responses. Performance is
assessed at the multi-team, team, and individual levels as appropriate.
Automated and observer-based semiautomated assessments are integrated into data
products suitable for diagnostic analysis and for single- and multi-team
debrief development. Preliminary data from an initial demonstration are
discussed.

%X As the technology of joint multi-mission systems advances, so does the
pressure to reduce the cost of these systems. Automation, which reduces
operator workload and provides opportunities for task reallocation and
consolidation, can achieve this goal. In addition, costs can be reduced by
using automated training tools that train operators and teams with fewer
trainers. The Debriefing Distributed Simulation-Based Exercises (DDSBE) program
addresses the need for automation in distributed training environments.
Technology is examined that requires fewer trainers to plan, execute, assess,
and debrief performance of the distributed training audience. However, fewer
trainers operating locally and remotely implies that trainers must be aware of
both their immediate assessment requirements and those in the broader training
environment. The Semi-Automated Observation and Assessment (SAOA) component of
DDSBE described in this paper is designed to increase trainer awareness of the
exercise and manage the flow of observation and assessment requirements.

%X Team performance is a complex and illusive phenomena that has not yet been
fully understood. Teams rely on certain underlying processes to shape their
performance. These underlying processes (i.e., "the black box") have been
investigated over the last few years. However, a significant amount of the
research has relied on command-and-control teams. The current study focuses on
the differentiation of teams based on interdependence, performance arrangement
and shared awareness to test the relationship between performance and teamwork
behaviors. In addition, the effects of stress, operationalized as workload
using a secondary task was also tested. Results showed some support for
different communication patterns in different team types. No effects of
workload were found. These results should be further investigated and applied
to future team research.

attitudes, and skills of trainees, CRM training has been adapted and
implemented in a number of domains beyond aviation. In this paper, we chose to
focus on the health care community's efforts because of the high risk and
frequency of errors in this domain. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is
threefold. First, we turned to the literature to identify and gather the
training evaluation efforts being conducted in the health care community.
Fifteen studies were identified. Next, we analyzed the research to determine
the effectiveness of the CRM training efforts. As the effectiveness of training
was not as positive as hoped, we conclude with several observations that may be
hindering the effectiveness of their training efforts.

%X There are a number of studies that suggest that virtual environment (VE)
systems can facilitate transfer of training (Darken &amp; Peterson, 2002;
P&eacute;ruch, Belingard, &amp; Thinus-Blanc, 2000; Rose et al., 2001). Yet
this benefit is not universal, as Brooks et al. (2002) found that VE training
was not beneficial for a recognition task. Thus, VE training may facilitate
some types of training tasks, while not benefiting others. As technology pushes
training more frequently into highly immersive environments, it is important to
delineate and examine characteristics of VE trainers (such as egocentric
perspective or multimodal interactivity) and consider the impact these
characteristics have on training tasks and desired outcomes. Towards this end,
a preliminary framework is herein presented which suggests that specific
characteristics of VE systems impact specific training outcomes. This effort
presents two operationally-based case studies that begin to examine different
parts of the proposed framework. The first study examines how egocentric
perspective was introduced into helicopter navigator training to impact spatial
knowledge acquisition; the second study investigates how a VE was used to
introduce interactivity into training to improve training outcomes for
procedural knowledge. Given the low number of participants, no substantive
conclusions can be made; rather, the studies are framed as an initial approach
to VE training effectiveness within a theoretical model.

development experts with the scenario-based training process. In particular,
little information exists that links different types of human performance
measures with the type of performance assessed and the purpose of training. In
an effort to provide new insights on this important issue, the present study
examined the appropriateness of four rating formats (i.e., checklists,
frequency count, distance and discrepancy, and rating scale) for six
performance outcomes, three process variables, and three purposes of
scenario-based training. Expert judgments were collected via a short survey.
The results indicated that for nine of the 12 variables a single measurement
strategy was most appropriate. However, the results also indicated that experts
tended to over rely on rating scales as their preferred choice. Implications
for practice and suggested requirements for future research are provided.

%X Previous research has indicated that the structure of an individual's
knowledge may be just as important as the quantity of knowledge. Given this,
using assessment methods that elicit trainee's knowledge structures seems
imperative for predicting performance. Unfortunately, incorporation of these
methods has been hindered, in part, due to the complexity of methods used to
derive a score and the belief that simpler methods of scoring will not provide
accurate information about an individual's knowledge. Presented here is a study
that investigated whether this claim was true for the structural knowledge
elicitation method, concept mapping. Twenty-six participants were run through a
same-day training and assessment session. Following, concept maps were scored
using a simple method and a complex method. Results indicated that both scoring
methods produced significantly higher scores for the trained group and
significantly lower scores for the untrained group. In addition, there was a
very strong, positive relationship between the two scoring methods. Finally,
both methods produced a moderately high correlation with the paper-pencil
assessment. Results and implications are discussed further within the paper.

%X With emerging technology and globalization, distributed teamwork has become
vital to organizational success and virtual environments are increasingly being
utilized to "close the gap" between dispersed team members. Although most
research conducted during the past few decades has focused on co-located teams,
some efforts have analyzed the inputs, processes, and outputs necessary for
effective interaction in virtual teams. For example, the Virtual Team Research
Model proposed by Driskell and colleagues (2003) addresses the effects of
computer mediated communication on team performance. Our current initiative
expands upon this model by focusing on distributed teams that utilize virtual
technology. We feel that by simultaneously considering both socio (i.e.,
distributed teamwork) and technical (i.e., virtual environments) factors, a
more detailed picture of virtual teams will be illuminated and thereby more
robust guidance can be provided to future research endeavors.

sickness was similar to previous studies of visually induced motion sickness.
The results indicate that contemporary console video game systems are capable
of inducing motion sickness.

%X This study examined the effect of adaptation training on simulation sickness
by inducing graded motion sickness through the systematic distortion of the
relevant characteristics of a VR device. Forty adults between the ages of 18
and 47 participated in this experiment. In the control condition, the
participants were required to complete a single self-propelled rotation
simulation (SRS) trial, and then use a visually coupled head mounted virtual
reality (VR) device plus exposure to an optokinetic rotating drum (OKN) device.
In the experimental condition, all the participants took part in a five-session
study in which they were exposed to five trials of the SRS and to the VE and
OKN rotating drum. Immediately following each task, all participants were
required to rate their level of dizziness. The results showed a significant
main effect of adaptation training on both the VR and OKN rotating drum as
reported by the dizziness ratings. These findings indicate that the difference
in dizziness rates was markedly higher among the control group than the
experimental group.

%X Of the 35,000 drivers and passengers who died in traffic crashes each year
between 1975 and 1998, older adults (65 and older) accounted for 10% of all
fatalities in 1975 and 17% in 1998. Such drivers will account for a projected
27% by 2015. In addition, the number of older drivers will increase two-thirds
by the year 2030. These facts present a threat to the safety of the motoring
public. It is hypothesized that older adults have such a high crash rate
because they are less likely to recognize risks than experienced, middle-aged
drivers. An experiment on an advanced, fixed-base driving simulator was
designed and performed to test this hypothesis. Participants' eye movements
were tracked throughout each drive. It is inferred that drivers are not aware
of risks that could potentially materialize at a particular area of the roadway
when they fail to direct their gaze at such areas. However, contrary to our
hypothesis, the older drivers were just as likely to recognize the risks as the
middle-aged drivers.

%X User perceptual sensitivity to changes of system latency was tested in three
simple virtual environments: one with only a foreground object, a second with
only a background object, and a third that combined both of these elements.
Prior psychophysical measurements of sensitivity, Just Noticeable Difference;
and bias, Points of Subjective Equality, from our laboratory are confirmed with
measurements in 13 subjects. Our measurements indicate that perceptual
stability across a variety of virtual environments will require latencies less
than 16 ms. We discount a possible explanation that the differences between our
results and those from a study by Allison et al. could be related to a visual
capture effect initially reported by L. Matin. Instead, the differences may be
due to the type of psychophysical judgment rendered by the subjects and the
degree to which subjects were instructed and practiced.

%X While human factors have been well researched in the development and use of
virtual environments, it has not received commensurate consideration in Mixed
Reality (MR) research much beyond the immediately relevant issues of fatigue
and discomfort. In this paper, we (1) analyze the feasibility of augmenting
human abilities via MR applications in tasks for assembly and related domains
from the perspective of cognitive engineering, (2) acknowledge the ergonomics
features and research issues inherent in MR systems, and (3) generate partial
guidelines that have been applied in our lab-based Augmented Reality prototype
to uncover and solve ergonomics issues. One of such issues, perceptual
compatibility, was also validated through a pilot experiment that compares use
of a head mounted display versus a standalone monitor in performing an
orientation task. It was found that subjects using the HMD perform in less
time, exhibit less orientation displacement, and experience less cognitive
load.

%X A comparative evaluation of collaborative display technologies was conducted
to explore their ability to support a pair of participants conducting a
collaborative workspace design review. Five review media were compared: 2D CAD
model on CRT, 3D CAD model on CRT, 3D CAD model on a Curved plasma display, a
large DataWall display, and a CAVE environment. Participants reviewed a model
depicting an in-vehicle navigation system installed within the front dash of a
vehicle and detected design flaws. Performance measures (number of detected
flaws and detection time) and usability measures (display, design review, and
collaborative quality) were collected. The main findings were: a) flaw
detection was better for 3D displays than the 2D display; b) flaws detection
was progressively reduced with more immersive 3D displays; c) speed-accuracy
tradeoffs were observed such that detection time was less for the 2D than the
3D displays, and decreased with the degree of immersion; d) using the standard
CRT is more cost-effective than using the Curved, DataWall, or CAVE displays.

%X Distributed immersive virtual environments (VEs) allow geographically
separate individuals to train together in a common setting, yet research
suggests the absence of face-to-face (FTF) contact may degrade distributed team
performance by negatively affecting communication-dependent team functions.
This study tested whether brief team communication training (TCT) could reduce
this distributed team disadvantage by imparting skills to compensate for the
lack of FTF contact. Two-person teams completed a series of VE missions under
local (same physical location) or distributed (different locations) conditions
with half of each team type receiving TCT. Results indicated all local teams
outperformed distributed teams overall, but there were no observable benefits
of TCT for team performance. Explanations focus on the brevity and
administration approach of the TCT as well as how cognitive overload may have
negated any beneficial aspects of TCT.

%X Simulator sickness results have been obtained in a novice driver training
experiment with approximately 500 young drivers who have yet to receive their
license to drive. Different participant groups were trained on three different
PC based driving simulator configurations: 1) a single-monitor desktop unit, 2)
a wide field-of-view three-monitor desktop unit, and 3) a wide field-of-view
projected image with an instrumented cab. Simulation sickness ratings scores
were obtained using a four-point rating scale provided to participants after
each training trial. Between-subject effects were broken down according to the
three simulator configuration types and gender across six training trial runs.
Analysis for average vehicle velocity was also reported as it may have been
related to simulator sickness. While the incidence of simulator sickness was
quite small, participants using the single-monitor configuration unexpectedly
reported the highest incidence of symptoms. Some gender differences were also
found according to training trials. Possible explanations for the results are
provided along with experience with high school driver education programs.

%X Mixed-Initiative robotic systems have been successful with providing
assistance for maneuvering a robot's position through a hazardous environment.
However, providing assistance to resolve viewing parameters such as camera
orientation have met with mixed results. Previous attempts, while effective at
increasing the likelihood that key viewpoints are utilized, have met with
strong dissatisfaction and struggles for control, overriding the some of the
potential benefits of the automation. This study evaluates the effects of
offloading the assistance to a separate, co-located video feed. The findings
suggest that it is possible to provide assistance to viewpoint control without
encroaching on the operator's threshold for desired control.

%X Attitude control refers to controlling the pitch and roll of a mobile robot.
As environments grow more complex and cues to a robot's pose sparser it becomes
easy for a teleoperator using an egocentric (camera) display to lose
situational awareness. Reported difficulties with teleoperated robots
frequently involve rollovers and sometimes even failure to realize that a robot
has rolled over. Attitude information has conventionally been displayed
separate from the camera view using an artificial horizon graphic or individual
indicators for pitch and roll. Information from separate attitude displays may
be difficult to integrate with an ongoing navigation task and lead to errors.
In this paper we report an experiment in which a simulated robot is maneuvered
over rough exterior and interior terrains to compare a gravity-referenced view
with a separated attitude indication. Results show shorter task times and
better path choices for users of the gravity-referenced view.

%X This paper describes a computational model of optical flow and demonstrates
how it can be used to estimate the navigation velocity of the user's viewpoint
during a virtual reality (VR) simulation. The model takes as input a VR
simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation
velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published
cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the
cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of
two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in
lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations
used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an
extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple
depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological
neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The
benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.
