	abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation {(LDA),} can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The {LDA} model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of {LDA} is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model {(CTM),} where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution {[J.} Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139–177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the {CTM} to the articles from Science published from 1990–1999, a data set that comprises {57M} words. The {CTM} gives a better fit of the data than {LDA,} and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

	abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature - an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in {CiteSpace} {II,} a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.},

	abstract = {To better understand the topic of this colloquium, we have created a series of databases related to knowledge domains (dynamic systems [small {world/Milgram],} information visualization {[Tufte],} co-citation {[Small],} bibliographic coupling {[Kessler],} and scientometrics {[Scientometrics]).} I have used a software package called {HistCiteTM} which generates chronological maps of subject (topical) collections resulting from searches of the {ISI} Web of Science1 or {ISI} citation indexes {(SCI,} {SSCI,} and/or {AHCI)} on {CD-ROM.} When a marked list is created on {WoS,} an export file is created which contains all cited references for each source document captured. These bibliographic collections, saved as {ASCII} files, are processed by {HistCite} in order to generate chronological and other tables as well as historiographs which highlight the most-cited works in and outside the collection. {HistCite} also includes a module for detecting and editing errors or variations in cited references as well as a vocabulary analyzer which generates both ranked word lists and word pairs used in the collection. Ideally the system will be used to help the searcher quickly identify the most significant work on a topic and trace its year-by-year historical development. In addition to the collections mentioned above, historiographs based on collections of papers that cite the {Watson-Crick} 1953 classic paper identifying the helical structure of {DNA} were created. Both year-by-year as well as month-by-month displays of papers from 1953 to 1958 were necessary to highlight the publication activity of those years.},
