  abstract     = {This thesis deals with membrane systems with symbol objects as a theoretical
                  framework of distributed parallel multiset processing systems.
                  A halting computation can accept, generate or process a number, a vector
                  or a word, so the system globally defines (by the results of all its computations)
                  a set of numbers or a set of vectors or a set of words, (i.e., a language)
                  or a function. The ability of these systems to solve particular problems is
                  investigated, as well as their computational power, e.g., the language families
                  defined by different classes of these systems are compared to the classical
                  ones, i.e., regular, context-free, languages generated by extended tabled
                  0L systems, languages generated by matrix grammars without appearance
                  checking, recursively enumerable languages, etc. Special attention is paid to
                  communication of objects between the regions and to the ways of cooperation
                  between the objects.
                  An attempt to formalize the membrane systems is made, and a software
                  tool is constructed for the non-distributed cooperative variant, the configuration
                  browser, i.e., a simulator, where the user chooses the next configuration
                  among the possible ones and can go back. Different distributed models are
                  considered. In the evolution--communication model rewriting-like rules are
                  separated from transport rules. Proton pumping systems are a variant of
                  the evolution--communication systems with a restricted way of cooperation.
                  A special membrane computing model is a purely communicative one: the
                  objects are moved together through a membrane.
                  Determinism is a special property of computational systems; the question
                  of whether this restriction reduces the computational power is addressed. The
                  results on proton pumping systems can be carried over to the systems with bistable
                  catalysts. Some particular examples of membrane systems applications
                  are solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time, and solving the sorting
                  problem.},
