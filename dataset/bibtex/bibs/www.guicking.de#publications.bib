  abstract = {Today there exist many frameworks for the development of synchronous groupware applications. Although
  the domain of these applications is very heterogeneous, existing frameworks provide only limited flexibility to
  integrate diverse groupware applications in a meaningful way. We identify five variation points that a groupware
  framework needs to offer in a flexible way in order to facilitate the integration of diverse groupware applications.
  Based on these variation points, we propose a groupware framework called Agilo that tries to overcome the limited
  flexibility of existing frameworks by offering multiple realizations of these variation points and providing a
  modular architecture to simplify the integration of applications and the extensibility and adaptability to different
  application and integration requirements.},

  sophisticated and flexible groupware frameworks for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents the
  architectural design of Agilo, a groupware framework that has been designed explicitly for synchronous groupware
  applications involving the use of heterogeneous devices. By respecting device heterogeneity from the ground up, the
  framework provides an architectural design that is highly flexible along different architectural dimensions on the
  one hand and simple yet powerful to use on the other hand. Two applications from different application domains
  based on Agilo are described together with first usage experiences from the developer’s point of view.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of mobile devices in today’s business contexts raises the de-mand to shift
  the focus of groupware framework design. Instead of solely focusing on functional requirements of specific
  application domains or device characteristics, non-functional require-ments need to be taken into account as well.
  Flexibility concerning the integration of devices and tailorability of the framework according to different usage
  contexts is essential for addressing device heterogeneity. Besides flexibility, in order to support the development
  of real-world ap-plications involving heterogeneous devices, robustness and scalability concerns need to be
  addressed explicitly by the framework.

  This paper presents Agilo, a groupware framework for synchronous collaboration. The framework incorporates
  approaches addressing flexibility, robustness, and scalability issues. The combination of these concerns makes it
  suitable for development of collaborative applications involving even hundreds of users. As example application, a
  commercial electronic meeting system is presented by illustrating typical usage scenarios, explaining
  application-specific require-ments and describing the system design. Experiences gathered during application
  development are presented. In order to empirically measure the performance and scalability of Agilo, initial
  experiments using the presented application are described. The experiments give a first impres-sion of the
  performance and scalability and point out issues that require further research.},
