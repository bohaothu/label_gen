%%%                        The initial draft of this bibliography for
%%%                        the years 1990--1996 contained 963 entries,
%%%                        and was constructed primarily from the OCLC
%%%                        Contents1st database.  Regrettably, that
%%%                        database does not record final page numbers
%%%                        of journal articles, so there are many page
%%%                        ranges of the form 123--?? in this
%%%                        bibliography.  The collection was then
%%%                        augmented with 398 entries from the author's
%%%                        personal bibliography files, and from a May
%%%                        1994 snapshot of the huge Computer Science
%%%                        bibliography archive on ftp.ira.uka.de.
%%%                        Later additions came from the Compendex
%%%                        databases (1970--1996), and the IEEE INSPEC
%%%                        CD ROM database (1989--1995).
%%%
%%%                        BibTeX citation tags are uniformly chosen
%%%                        as name:year:abbrev, where name is the
%%%                        family name of the first author or editor,
%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
%%%                        3-letter condensation of important title
%%%                        words. Citation tags were automatically
%%%                        generated by software developed for the
%%%                        BibNet Project.

%%%                        In this bibliography, entries are sorted by
%%%                        journal, and then by publication order, with
%%%                        the help of ``bibsort -byvolume''.  The bibsort
%%%                        utility is available from ftp.math.utah.edu
%%%                        in /pub/tex/bib.
%%%
%%%                        Fields within entries have been put into a
%%%                        consistent order by the biborder utility,
%%%                        and the entire bibliography has been
%%%                        processed by the bibclean syntax checker
%%%                        and prettyprinter, and by bibcheck.  These
%%%                        tools are available in the same archive as
%%%                        bibsort.

%%%                        Spelling has been verified with the UNIX

%%%                        heuristic checks on the validity of the
%%%                        bibliography files have also been made

                 fact be several differnt groups of users with different
                 desires and goals. The procedures illustrated below

                 equations. A quantitative method of speed comparison is
                 presented that is quite general and allows direct speed
                 comparisons between specific analog and digital
                 computers. The method is based on calculating the
                 number of operations per second (multiplications,
                 additions, loads, stores, etc. ) necessary for a
                 digital computer to match the computing speed of
                 various analog components (integrators, summers,
                 multipliers, etc. ) and hence a collection of such
                 components comprising a specific analog computer. This
                 calculated number of operations per second can then be
                 compared with the actual operation-per-second
                 capability of any specific digital computer to afford a
                 direct speed comparison.",

                 both to evaluate alternatives during software design
                 and to simulate the detection of errors during testing.
                 A convenient way of describing program structure and
                 simulating the detection of errors is to represent the
                 program in a directed graph. Arcs are the segments of a
                 program between branch and merge points. The length of
                 an arc is equal to the number of source statements in
                 the segment. A path is a series of connected arcs that
                 begins at a start node and terminates at a terminal
                 node. Structural characteristics correspond to program
                 characteristics. For example, numbers of nodes, arcs,
                 paths and source statements correspond to branching and
                 merging, arithmetic and data transfer operations,

                 problem, using six major factors to sort out the issues

                 which the information is to be stored and in which the
                 computer system is to operate, characterized as the
                 external or ``real'' environment. The second factor
                 refers to protection mechanisms outside of the computer
                 itself preventing unauthorized access to the system.
                 The next line of defense is mechanisms within the
                 computer system. The problem of organizing and
                 arranging the information to be protected comes next.
                 Since this information is stored in a computer, the
                 characteristics of the hardware and operating system
                 have to be considered. Finally, the reliability of the
                 hardware and software systems is a factor in the

                 control environment. (2) If an external control device
                 is changed, the system can be reconfigured by making
                 only software changes. (3) The minicomputer is free for
                 other tasks while the microcomputer is executing its
                 present task. (4) The microcomputer memory can be
                 downloaded in microseconds, eliminating the need for
                 individual ROM for each task. (5) The micro system

                 minicomputer, allowing tasks to be developed without

                 in batch-produced, discrete-part manufacturing.
                 Programmable automation consists of a system of
                 multidegree-of-freedom manipulators (commonly known as
                 industrial robots) and sensors under computer control,
                 which can be programmed to perform specified jobs in
                 the manufacturing process and can be applied to new
                 (but similar) jobs by reprogramming. Sensors are needed
                 for visual inspection of workpieces; for determination
                 of identity, position, and orientation of unindexed
                 workpieces; and for adaptive control of manipulator
                 movements. The authors discuss the use of contact
                 sensors, which search for, recognize, grasp, and move

                 advantages of reduced package size, higher board

                 propagation delay, and easy assembly and disassembly

                 applications. However, if sockets were available, such
                 a ceramic package could be installed on epoxy-glass
                 printed circuit boards; if the chip carrier concept
                 were implanted in plastic or with compliant leads,
                 there could be direct attachment to such boards. In

                 multiple-processor computers called ``distributed
                 computer'' systems. Such systems are very

                 extensibility, integrity, and performance. A

                 improved performance, improved system availability,
                 easier adjustment to a growing workload, and some
                 individualized control over machine resources. But wide
                 application awaits the implementation of distributed
                 data management services and solutions to several
                 difficult problems. Most notably, crash recovery has
                 received insufficient attention. Even when these
                 problems are solved, the problem of migrating from
                 current systems to the new architecture must still be
                 addressed. Nevertheless, the dramatic drop in the cost
                 of computers makes distributed systems inevitable.
                 Distributed data management systems possess a kind of
                 architecture that is analogous to the more generalized
                 architecture of whole computer systems. Architectures
                 for distributed data management systems can be divided
                 into integrated and federated classes. In the
                 integrated architecture, each component data base
                 management software package ``knows about'' the
                 existence of all the others. This approach is possible
                 only if the entire system is designed and built from
                 the ground up. If, on the other hand, existing data
                 base systems must be used, the result is one of two
                 forms of a ``federated'' architecture. In the simplest
                 case, each of the software data base managers supports
                 the same model and command language. However, an
                 integrator must be superimposed, containing the data
                 and procedures required to make the collection of data
                 base managers behave as a single entity. The third
                 class of architectures is a heterogeneous federation,
                 in which totally disparate data base systems are
                 linked. This type of architecture is clearly the most

                 software and associated protocols that allow a set of
                 autonomous computers, which are interconnected by a
                 computer network, to be used together in a convenient
                 and cost-effective manner. An NOS would help users and
                 their programs exploit the resources distributed among
                 network hosts in much the same way that a single-host
                 operating system provides its users with controlled
                 access to local resources. It would tend to make the
                 underlying network and the boundaries between host
                 systems transparent to users. It would remove many of
                 the logical distinctions between resources that are
                 local and those that are remote. Such a system would
                 provide an environment within which uniform accounting
                 throughout the network would be feasible. In addition,
                 an NOS environment could support a wide range of easily
                 accessible information services, which might range from
                 current information on the status of constituent
                 systems to information about the hardware and software
                 resources available. Because of the potential for
                 redundancy and the inherent autonomy of the constituent
                 host systems, an NOS can, in principle, provide service
                 of far higher availability than can a single-host
                 operating system. However, the potential for decreased
                 availability also exists, if the NOS depends on system
                 components that are subject to failure. Thus, an NOS
                 must be carefully designed to produce a system with
                 increased, rather than decreased, availability. Several
                 projects have been undertaken to study, design, and
                 build such systems. In these projects, intensive study
                 was devoted to the first two of the four previously
                 mentioned factors: facilitating access to network
                 resources and resolving incompatibilities among

                 is to describe the computing machine in terms of its
                 major units and then to describe each of these units in
                 progressively greater detail. This contrasts with the
                 earlier approach in which individual gating circuits
                 were described, and later developed into larger units.
                 The older approach lends itself well to laboratory work
                 in which a few components or circuits may be assembled
                 and tested in a short time. The cost of this is small,
                 and a whole class of students may perform a useful
                 exercise with relatively small overhead. In contrast,
                 the modern approach requires the student to design
                 and\slash or modify a complete computer structure from
                 relatively large units. Providing sufficient equipment
                 to support this approach is too expensive to
                 contemplate. The advent of microcomputers opens up a
                 number of possibilities, but none is helpful where
                 experiments with basic structure and operation codes
                 are involved, since a large part of the design is
                 fixed. At the other end of the scale, designing with
                 TTL circuits is at too low a level to allow a
                 significant piece of equipment to be built by one or
                 two students in a few days. Between these two extremes
                 falls the Register Transfer Modules (RTM's). Each
                 module is large enough to form a sensible sub-unit, but
                 small enough to allow the system designer real scope.
                 Experience suggests that after a few days'
                 familiarizing himself with RTM's, the student can
                 develop a simple design in about one day. This paper
                 discusses the requirements of a teaching laboratory in
                 relation to the teaching of computer architecture and
                 suggests how RTM's may be used to meet those
                 requirements. Since a read-write microprogram store
                 module would be extremely useful if not actually
                 essential for this purpose, the design of such a module
                 is also described.",

                 needs of a relatively new experience-microcomputer

                 be applied to the tasks for which it is best suited and
                 then later linked together into a single program. In
                 this article, after a perspective view of the setting
                 for new language development, the key objectives which
                 governed the development of PLZ are examined. Then the
                 principal features of the new

                 high-and rising-cost of developing software products.
                 Among these, one technique that has proved effective
                 entails constructing programs from small, well-defined
                 modules. This technique, called modular programming,
                 can be used in any programming language; however,
                 without language support to enforce module boundaries,
                 errors often occur. The PL/M language and compiler are
                 designed to bring the advantages of modular programming
                 to microprocessor software systems. Since the
                 fundamental PL/M language facility for organizing a
                 program is the module, software systems can be
                 partitioned into manageable units. The PL/M module can
                 hold data and procedures and, if properly used, provide
                 encapsulation of programming abstractions. In this way
                 it is related to several other language mechanisms that
                 provide for grouping operations logically related to a
                 single data structure.",

  abstract =     "Medicine's technological imperative and weak cost
                 control mechanisms make it an attractive market for
                 equipment suppliers. The computer system, with data
                 acquisition and display added to its computational
                 power, epitomizes the application of technology to
                 medicine. But despite the widespread acceptance of
                 computers in medical applications, little progress has
                 been made in solving the problems of software
                 formulation, clinical effectiveness, pass-through of
                 cost savings, and ethical responsibility. While some
                 applications merely extend established engineering
                 techniques into medicine, others have to accommodate a
                 combination of physiological and social variables that
                 do not fit neatly into the mathematical formulations
                 common in engineering. In consequence, they are not
                 easily programmed. In view of the forces bearing upon
                 medical practitioners to embrace (not always wisely)
                 the latest technology, some additional policy mechanism
                 may be needed. Third-party reimbursement agencies,
                 including the insurance companies and state and federal
                 governments, strongly influence the spread of new
                 technology beyond research institutions. When
                 computerization can produce results at least as good as
                 those produced by traditional methods, and at lower
                 cost, these agencies should adjust their reimbursement
                 rates accordingly to encourage the technology to
                 spread. When computerization cannot be shown to save
                 money, reimbursement agencies should insist on evidence
                 that it measurably improves clinical outcome before
                 agreeing to reimburse the higher costs.",

                 techniques for achieving mainframe performance with the
                 LSI modular approach utilizing off-the-shelf modules.
                 Evaluation data were collected by using these
                 techniques to design (on paper) an emulator of an
                 existing mainframe computer, Sperry Univac 1108. This
                 computer was chosen because its macroarchitecture,
                 performance, and construction cost were well documented
                 and understood by the research team. Additionally, from
                 the point of view of commercial mainframe
                 manufacturers, it is important to use new technology to
                 emulate existing macroarchitectures. In this way new
                 mainframe products can be implemented that do not
                 require an expensive conversion of existing user and
                 operating system software. Only those few details of
                 the 1108 useful for explaining this LSI modular design

                 optimum distribution of program modules across two
                 processors. Also, real-time load balancing is possible

                 algorithm for calculating optimum assignments under

                 orbiting earth 14 times a day at the average equatorial
                 altitude of 784 kilometers (about 500 miles). Sweeping
                 across 95 percent of the ocean area every 36 hours, it
                 is capable of taking more measurements in a single day
                 than previous sea-based instruments acquired in
                 decades. The satellite's four microwave instruments and
                 its visual and infrared radiometer are returning data
                 to earth in three streams: an occasional real-time
                 analog transmission from the synthetic aperture radar
                 at 20 MHz, a rate equivalent to 110 million bits per
                 second; a real-time digital transmission from the other
                 instruments at 25K bps; and a periodic digital
                 transmission of stored data at 800K bps. There are
                 three systems for processing Seasat-A data. One is the
                 optical processing of synthetic aperture radar data
                 into film images. The second is the digital processing
                 of low-rate telemetry data into data records. The
                 third, conducted in near-real-time at the Navy's Fleet

                 planned to add the effect of low-rate telemetry data to

                 programs and stored data, permitting data to be
                 accessed without concern for device-related details.
                 File systems encourage a close dependency between data
                 and the programs that use the data. This is fine as
                 long as few programs use each file; but as the number
                 of applications increases, serious problems result. The
                 way data is structured tends to be appropriate for
                 early applications but less appropriate for later ones.
                 If the file is restructured to be usable by multiple
                 application programs, all of the programs must be
                 modified. If multiple copies of the file are kept, each
                 copy structured to meet the needs of a few
                 applications, the problem arises of maintaining the
                 consistency of the file copies. Data-base management
                 systems have evolved from file systems to overcome
                 these limitations. A DBMS isolates application programs
                 from physical file structures, presenting instead
                 logical data structures. Physical file formats can be
                 changed in response to changing application needs, but
                 the logical data definition need not be changed. A DBMS
                 also encourages the definition of subfiles, to ensure
                 that programs confine their attention to relevant
                 portions of a logical file. These facilities increase
                 the data independence of application software,
                 increasing its immunity to changes in the logical and
                 physical organization of files.",

                 operated with one hand and is suitable for typing large
                 amounts of data at high speed. It can handle a much
                 larger alphabet than any reasonably sized conventional
                 keyboard. Because it requires only one hand, it makes
                 new computer applications possible. Because it is so
                 small and mechanically simple, it costs less to
                 manufacture than a conventional keyboard. It has a
                 five-by-two array of square keys operated by the
                 fingers and a row of four rectangular keys operated by
                 the thumb. The finger keys have rounded depressions,
                 called ``dimples.'' When a finger presses a dimple, the
                 corresponding character is formed. If the ``D'' dimple
                 is pressed, one key goes down and a ``D'' is typed. If
                 the ``E'' dimple is pressed, two keys go down and a
                 ``B'' is typed. If the ``W'' dimple is pressed, four
                 keys go down and a ``W'' is typed. There are 27 dimples
                 on the keyboard, providing space for the entire
                 alphabet. The operator may press up to three finger
                 dimples at once, producing a string of letters in one
                 stroke --- hence the term ``chord,'' since this is
                 analogous to playing a chord on the piano. Typical
                 examples of chords are ``the'' and ``for,'' which are
                 common strings in English. Since the ring finger and
                 little finger do not function well independently, only
                 three fingers are used to form chords. The thumb
                 keyboard has troughs instead of dimples, and by
                 pressing a trough it is possible to depress either one
                 thumb key or two adjacent thumb keys as part of a
                 chord. Since there are seven troughs and since not
                 pressing a trough is a valid action when forming a
                 chord, there are eight thumb positions. The commonest
                 character in the English language is the space, so it
                 is given special treatment. If the SPACE trough is
                 pressed as a part of a chord, a space is inserted ahead
                 of the string of characters specified by the finger
                 dimples. Thus, it is possible to type ``the'' as a
                 single chord. The thumb can also be used to reverse the
                 normal left-to-right sequence of letters in a chord,
                 with or without a space. Thus ``and'' and ``ing'' can
                 be typed as single chords using the SPACE-REVERSE and
                 REVERSE troughs. By using the UPPER trough it is
                 possible to type ``THE'', and using the SPACE-UPPER-LOW
                 trough, it is possible to type ``The'', as single
                 chords. There are also troughs for a SPECIAL character
                 case and for a NUMBER case. There is also the
                 equivalent of the case lock of a conventional
                 typewriter, which permits the keyboard to be locked in
                 a particular case.",

                 other new technologies. Though CCDs and magnetic
                 bubbles are often mentioned as competing technologies,
                 each has a major thrust in a different class of
                 applications. A summary is given of the comparative
                 aspects of CCDs and bubbles. While CCDs will tend to be
                 used in large computers with a high performance
                 emphasis, bubbles are more suited to
                 microprocessor-based systems. In minicomputer systems,
                 again, CCDs are better suited to the high-end machines,
                 where virtual-memory systems are emerging. Bubbles will
                 tend to be used for applications in which the use of
                 cartridges or floppy disks for operating system storage
                 limits performance.",

                 important applications of optical computing are those

  abstract =     "Computing systems based on a data-flow organization of
                 computation are presently under development in
                 laboratories in the US and Europe. These systems are a
                 fundamentally new style of concurrent (tightly coupled,
                 distributed) computer, which could eventually supersede
                 the conventional general-purpose computer. Conventional
                 computers and programs, even those capable of
                 concurrent activity, are implicitly sequential and
                 require any desired concurrency to be indicated
                 explicitly. They are control-flow computers, and they
                 can be contrasted with data-flow computers, which allow
                 concurrent operations to be activated as soon as their
                 input data are available. The search for computing
                 systems that can utilize the natural concurrency in
                 problems is motivated by at least two interlinked
                 requirements: the need to increase performance, and the
                 need to better utilize system resources. The solution
                 advocated here for the design of concurrent computers
                 is the use of some form of data-flow organization of
                 computation. Whereas in control-flow computers
                 instructions in a program are selected for execution by
                 a sequential flow of control, instructions in a
                 data-flow computer are selected by the flow of partial
                 results (data tokens) through a program. When a
                 data-flow instruction generates a data token, copies of
                 the token (or control tokens signalling the
                 availability of the data) are passed to each
                 destination instruction that is ready to use the data
                 as input. When all the input tokens of an instruction
                 are available, the instruction is ready to be executed.
                 Since a number of instructions may become ready to
                 execute asynchronously, data-flow computers have an
                 obvious potential for exploiting concurrency.",
