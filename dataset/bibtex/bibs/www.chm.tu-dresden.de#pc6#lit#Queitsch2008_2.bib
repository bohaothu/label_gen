  abstract = {{FePt nanoparticles from the gas phase are deposited onto regular
	two-dimensional bacterial surface layer proteins with a four-fold
	lattice symmetry and a lattice constant of 12.5 nm. Transmission
	electron microscopy shows that the particle arrangement adopts both,
	the symmetry and periodicity of the protein template. The influence
	of the particle density on both the degree of agglomeration and the
	regularity of the particle arrangement is studied. Depositing the
	particles in a magnetic field applied parallel to the substrate leads
	to a significant decrease in agglomeration and thereby to an increase
	in the fraction of regularly arranged particles at high particle
	densities.}},
