	Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means of investigating brain function. Whereas TMS of the human frontal eye fields (FEFs) does not induce saccades, electrical stimulation of the monkey FEF evokes eye-head gaze shifts, with neck muscle responses evoked at stimulation levels insufficient to evoke a saccade. These animal results motivated us to examine whether TMS of the FEF (TMS-FEF) in humans evokes a neck muscle response. Subjects performed memory-guided saccades to the left or right while TMS (two pulses at 20â€ƒHz) was delivered on 30\% of trials to the left FEF coincident with saccade instruction. As reported previously, TMS-FEF decreased contralateral saccade reaction times. We simultaneously recorded the activity of splenius capitis (SPL) (an ipsilateral head turner). TMS-FEF evoked a lateralized increase in the activity of the right SPL but not the left SPL, consistent with the recruitment of a contralateral head-turning synergy. In some subjects, the evoked neck muscle response was time-locked to stimulation, whereas in others the evoked response occurred around the time of the saccade. Importantly, evoked responses were greater when TMS was applied to the FEF engaged in contralateral saccade preparation, with even greater evoked responses preceding shorter latency saccades. These results provide new insights into both the nature of TMS and the human oculomotor system, demonstrating that TMS-FEF engages brainstem oculomotor circuits in a manner consistent with a general role in eye-head gaze orienting. Our results also suggest that pairing neck muscle recordings with TMS-FEF provides a novel way of assaying the covert preparation of oculomotor plans.},

	Abstract = {It is well recognized that the brain uses sensory information to accurately produce motor commands. Indeed, most research into the relationship between sensory and motor systems has focused on how sensory information modulates motor function. In contrast, recent studies have begun to investigate the reverse: how sensory and perceptual systems are tuned based on motor function, and specifically motor learning. In the present study we investigated changes to human proprioceptive acuity following recent motor learning. Sensitivity to small displacements of the hand was measured before and after 10 min of motor learning, during which subjects grasped the handle of a robotic arm and guided a cursor to a series of visual targets randomly located within a small workspace region. We used a novel method of assessing proprioceptive acuity that avoids active movement, interhemispheric transfer, and intermodality coordinate transformations. We found that proprioceptive acuity improved following motor learning, but only in the region of the arm's workspace explored during learning. No proprioceptive improvement was observed when motor learning was performed in a different location or when subjects passively experienced limb trajectories matched to those of subjects who actively performed motor learning. Our findings support the idea that sensory changes occur in parallel with changes to motor commands during motor learning.},

@article{Hore:2011fk,
	Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that in fast arm movements the CNS deliberately utilizes interaction torques to decelerate (brake) joint rotations. Twelve subjects performed fast 2-D overarm throws in which large elbow extension velocities occurred. Joint motions were computed from recordings made with search coils; joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. After ball release, a large follow-through shoulder extension acceleration occurred that was initiated by shoulder extensor muscle torque. This shoulder acceleration produced a flexor interaction torque at the elbow that initiated elbow deceleration (braking). An instantaneous mechanical interaction of passive torques then occurred between elbow and shoulder, i.e., elbow extension deceleration produced a large shoulder extensor interaction torque that contributed to the shoulder extension acceleration which, simultaneously, produced a large elbow flexor interaction torque that contributed to elbow extension deceleration, and so on. Late elbow flexor muscle torque also contributed to elbow deceleration. The interaction of passive torques between shoulder and elbow was braked by shoulder flexor muscle torque. In this mechanism, shoulder musculature contributed to braking elbow extension in two ways: shoulder extensors initiated the mechanical interaction of passive torques between shoulder and elbow and shoulder flexors dissipated kinetic energy from elbow braking. It is concluded that, in fast 2-D throws, the CNS deliberately utilizes powerful interaction torques between shoulder and elbow to brake motion at the elbow.},

@article{Wilson:2010uq,
	Abstract = {Relatively few studies have been reported that document how proprioception varies across the workspace of the human arm. Here we examined proprioceptive function across a horizontal planar workspace, using a new method that avoids active movement and interactions with other sensory modalities. We systematically mapped both proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity to hand position change) and bias (perceived location of the hand), across a horizontal-plane 2D workspace. Proprioception of both the left and right arms was tested at nine workspace locations and in 2 orthogonal directions (left-right and forwards-backwards). Subjects made repeated judgments about the position of their hand with respect to a remembered proprioceptive reference position, while grasping the handle of a robotic linkage that passively moved their hand to each judgement location. To rule out the possibility that the memory component of the proprioceptive testing procedure may have influenced our results, we repeated the procedure in a second experiment using a persistent visual reference position. Both methods resulted in qualitatively similar findings. Proprioception is not uniform across the workspace. Acuity was greater for limb configurations in which the hand was closer to the body, and was greater in a forward-backward direction than in a left-right direction. A robust difference in proprioceptive bias was observed across both experiments. At all workspace locations, the left hand was perceived to be to the left of its actual position, and the right hand was perceived to be to the right of its actual position. Finally, bias was smaller for hand positions closer to the body. The results of this study provide a systematic map of proprioceptive acuity and bias across the workspace of the limb that may be used to augment computational models of sensory-motor control, and to inform clinical assessment of sensory function in patients with sensory-motor deficits.},

@article{Debicki:2011kx,
	Abstract = {An unexpected property of unskilled overarm throws is that wrist flexion velocity at ball release does not increase in throws of increasing speed. We investigated the nature of the interaction torques and wrist mechanical properties that have been proposed to produce this property. Twelve recreational throwers made seated 2-D throws, which were used as a model for unskilled throwing. Joint motions were computed from recordings made with search coils; joint torques were calculated from inverse dynamics. Wrist flexion velocity at ball release was actually smaller in fast throws than in slow throws. This was associated in fast throws with the decrease in a large wrist flexor muscle torque (i.e., a calculated residual torque) in the last 40 ms before ball release, and its reversal to an extensor torque. Consequently, wrist flexor muscle torque was unable to oppose a small maintained wrist extensor interaction torque that arose from continuing elbow extension acceleration. The decrease in wrist flexor muscle torque was not associated with a decrease in wrist flexor EMG activity, nor with an increase in wrist extensor EMG activity. These findings support the hypothesis that the smaller wrist flexion velocity at ball release in fast 2-D throws results from a wrist extensor interaction torque and from a large wrist extensor viscoelastic torque. We propose that in fast 3-D throws skilled subjects decelerate elbow extension before ball release to help overcome these wrist extensor torques.},

@article{Kistemaker:2010uq,
	Abstract = {It has been widely suggested that the many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal system may be exploited by the CNS to minimize energy cost. We tested this idea by having subjects making point-to-point movements while grasping a robotic manipulandum. The robot created a force field chosen such that the minimal energy hand path for reaching movements differed substantially from those observed in a null field. The results show that after extended exposure to the force field, subjects continued to move exactly as they did in the null field and thus used substantially more energy than needed. Even after practicing to move along the minimal energy path, subjects did not adapt their freely chosen hand paths to reduce energy expenditure. The results of this study indicate that for point-to-point arm movements minimization of energy cost is not a dominant factor that influences how the CNS arrives at kinematics and associated muscle activation patterns.},

@article{Brown:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Watching an actor make reaching movements in a perturbing force field provides the observer with information about how to compensate for that force field. Here we asked two questions about the nature of information provided to the observer. Is it important that the observer learn the difference between errant (curved) movements and goal (straight) movements by watching the actor progress in a relatively orderly fashion from highly curved to straight movements over a series of trials? Or is it sufficient that the observer sees only reaching errors in the force field (FF)? In the first experiment, we found that observers performed better if they observed reaches in a FF that was congruent, rather than incongruent, with the FF used in a later test. Observation-trial order had no effect on performance, suggesting that observers understood the goal in advance and perhaps learned about the force-field by observing movement curvature. Next we asked whether observers learn optimally by observing the actor's mistakes (high-error trials), if they learn by watching the actor perform with expertise in the FF (low-error trials), or if they need to see contrast between errant and goal behavior (a mixture of both high- and low-error trials). We found that observers who watched high-error trials were most affected by observation but that significant learning also occurred if observers watched only some high-error trials. This result suggests that observers learn to adapt their reaching to an unpredictable FF best when they see the actor making mistakes.},

@article{Debicki:2010fk,
	Abstract = {The speed of arm movements is normally increased by increasing agonist muscle activity, but in overarm throwing, an additional effect on speed may come from exploitation of interaction torques (a passive torque associated with motion at adjacent joints). We investigated how the central nervous system (CNS) controls interaction torques at the shoulder and elbow to increase speed in 2-D overarm throwing. Twelve experienced throwers made slow, medium, and fast 2-D throws in a parasagittal plane. Joint motions were computed from recordings made with search coils; joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. For slow and medium-speed throws, elbow extension was primarily produced by elbow muscle torque. For fast throws, there was an additional late-occurring elbow extensor interaction torque. Parceling out this elbow extension interaction torque revealed that it primarily arose from shoulder extension deceleration. Surprisingly, shoulder deceleration before ball release was not caused by shoulder flexor (antagonist) muscle torque. Rather, shoulder deceleration was produced by passive elbow-to-shoulder interaction torques that were primarily associated with elbow extension acceleration and velocity. It is concluded that when generating fast 2-D throws, the CNS utilized the arm's biomechanical properties to increase ball speed. It did this by coordinating shoulder and elbow motions such that an instantaneous mechanical positive feedback occurred of interaction torques between shoulder and elbow before ball release. To what extent this mechanism is utilized in other fast multijoint arm movements remains to be determined.},

Subjects can also benefit from visual observation of others' kinematic errors. Here, using fMRI, we scanned subjects watching movies depicting another person learning to reach in a novel dynamic environment created by a robotic device. Passive observation of reaching movements (whether or not they were perturbed by the robot) was associated with increased activation in fronto-parietal regions that are normally recruited in active reaching. We found significant clusters in parieto-occipital cortex, intraparietal sulcus, as well as in dorsal premotor cortex. Moreover, it appeared that part of the network that has been shown to be engaged in processing self-generated reach error is also involved in observing reach errors committed by others. Specifically, activity in left intraparietal sulcus and left dorsal premotor cortex, as well as in right cerebellar cortex, was modulated by the amplitude of observed kinematic errors.},

	Abstract = {Motor learning is dependent upon plasticity in motor areas of the brain, but does it occur in isolation, or does it also result in changes to sensory systems? We examined changes to somatosensory function that occur in conjunction with motor learning. We found that even after periods of training as brief as 10 min, sensed limb position was altered and the perceptual change persisted for 24 h. The perceptual change was reflected in subsequent movements; limb movements following learning deviated from the prelearning trajectory by an amount that was not different in magnitude and in the same direction as the perceptual shift. Crucially, the perceptual change was dependent upon motor learning. When the limb was displaced passively such that subjects experienced similar kinematics but without learning, no sensory change was observed. The findings indicate that motor learning affects not only motor areas of the brain but changes sensory function as well.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments are reported on the influence of different timing relations on the McGurk effect. In the first experiment, it is shown that strict temporal synchrony between auditory and visual speech stimuli is not required for the McGurk effect. Subjects were strongly influenced by the visual stimuli when the auditory stimuli lagged the visual stimuli by as much as 180 msec. In addition, a stronger McGurk effect was found when the visual and auditory vowels matched. In the second experiment, we paired auditory and visual speech stimuli produced under different speaking conditions (fast, normal, clear). The results showed that the manipulations in both the visual and auditory speaking conditions independently influenced perception. In addition, there was a small but reliable tendency for the better matched stimuli to elicit more McGurk responses than unmatched conditions. In the third experiment, we combined auditory and visual stimuli produced under different speaking conditions (fast, clear) and delayed the acoustics with respect to the visual stimuli. The subjects showed the same pattern of results as in the second experiment. Finally, the delay did not cause different patterns of results for the different audiovisual speaking style combinations. The results suggest that perceivers may be sensitive to the concordance of the time-varying aspects of speech but they do not require temporal coincidence of that information.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of subjects to adjust the control of limb movements to counteract the effects of self-generated loads. The degree to which subjects change control signals to compensate for these loads is a reflection of the extent to which forces affecting movement are represented in motion planning. Here, we have used empirical and modeling studies to examine whether the nervous system compensates for loads acting on the jaw during speech production. As subjects walk, loads to the jaw vary with the direction and magnitude of head acceleration. We investigated the patterns of jaw motion resulting from these loads both in locomotion alone and when locomotion was combined with speech production. In locomotion alone, jaw movements were shown to vary systematically in direction and magnitude in relation to the acceleration of the head. In contrast, when locomotion was combined with speech, variation in jaw position during both consonant and vowel production was substantially reduced. Overall, we have demonstrated that the magnitude of load associated with head acceleration during locomotion is sufficient to produce a systematic change in the position of the jaw. The absence of variation in jaw position during locomotion with speech is thus consistent with the idea that in speech, the control of jaw motion is adjusted in a predictive manner to offset the effects of head acceleration.},

	Abstract = {A significant problem in motor control is how information about movement error is used to modify control signals to achieve desired performance. A potential source of movement error and one that is readily controllable experimentally relates to limb dynamics and associated movement-dependent loads. In this paper, we have used a position control model to examine changes to control signals for arm movements in the context of movement-dependent loads. In the model, based on the equilibrium-point hypothesis, equilibrium shifts are adjusted directly in proportion to the positional error between desired and actual movements. The model is used to simulate multi-joint movements in the presence of both "internal" loads due to joint interaction torques, and externally applied loads resulting from velocity-dependent force fields. In both cases it is shown that the model can achieve close correspondence to empirical data using a simple linear adaptation procedure. An important feature of the model is that it achieves compensation for loads during movement without the need for either coordinate transformations between positional error and associated corrective forces, or inverse dynamics calculations.},

	Abstract = {During multijoint limb movements such as reaching, rotational forces arise at one joint due to the motions of limb segments about other joints. We report the results of three experiments in which we assessed the extent to which control signals to muscles are adjusted to counteract these "interaction torques." Human subjects performed single- and multijoint pointing movements involving shoulder and elbow motion, and movement parameters related to the magnitude and direction of interaction torques were manipulated systematically. We examined electromyographic (EMG) activity of shoulder and elbow muscles and, specifically, the relationship between EMG activity and joint interaction torque. A first set of experiments examined single-joint movements. During both single-joint elbow (experiment 1) and shoulder (experiment 2) movements, phasic EMG activity was observed in muscles spanning the stationary joint (shoulder muscles in experiment 1 and elbow muscles in experiment 2). This muscle activity preceded movement and varied in amplitude with the magnitude of upcoming interaction torque (the load resulting from motion of the nonstationary limb segment). In a third experiment, subjects performed multijoint movements involving simultaneous motion at the shoulder and elbow. Movement amplitude and velocity at one joint were held constant, while the direction of movement about the other joint was varied. When the direction of elbow motion was varied (flexion vs. extension) and shoulder kinematics were held constant, EMG activity in shoulder muscles varied depending on the direction of elbow motion (and hence the sign of the interaction torque arising at the shoulder). Similarly, EMG activity in elbow muscles varied depending on the direction of shoulder motion for movements in which elbow kinematics were held constant. The results from all three experiments support the idea that central control signals to muscles are adjusted, in a predictive manner, to compensate for interaction torques-loads arising at one joint that depend on motion about other joints.},

	Abstract = {External loads arising as a result of the orientation of body segments relative to gravity can affect the achievement of movement goals. The degree to which subjects adjust control signals to compensate for these loads is a reflection of the extent to which forces affecting motion are represented neurally. In the present study we assessed whether subjects, when speaking, compensate for loads caused by the orientation of the head relative to gravity. We used a mathematical model of the jaw to predict the effects of control signals that are not adjusted for changes to head orientation. The simulations predicted a systematic change in sagittal plane jaw orientation and horizontal position resulting from changes to the orientation of the head. We conducted an empirical study in which subjects were tested under the same conditions. With one exception, empirical results were consistent with the simulations. In both simulation and empirical studies, the jaw was rotated closer to occlusion and translated in an anterior direction when the head was in the prone orientation. When the head was in the supine orientation, the jaw was rotated away from occlusion. The findings suggest that the nervous system does not completely compensate for changes in head orientation relative to gravity. A second study was conducted to assess possible changes in acoustical patterns attributable to changes in head orientation. The frequencies of the first (F1) and second (F2) formants associated with the steady-state portion of vowels were measured. As in the kinematic study, systematic differences in the values of F1 and F2 were observed with changes in head orientation. Thus the acoustical analysis further supports the conclusion that control signals are not completely adjusted to offset forces arising because of changes in orientation.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of independent muscle coactivation at the shoulder and elbow. Subjects performed rapid point-to-point movements in a horizontal plane from different initial limb configurations to a single target. EMG activity was measured from flexor and extensor muscles acting at the shoulder (pectoralis clavicular head and posterior deltoid) and elbow (biceps long head and triceps lateral head) and flexor and extensor muscles acting at both joints (biceps short head and triceps long head). Muscle coactivation was assessed by measuring tonic levels of electromyographic (EMG) activity after limb position stabilized following the end of the movements. It was observed that tonic EMG levels following movements to the same target varied as a function of the amplitude of shoulder and elbow motion. Moreover, for the movements tested here, the coactivation of shoulder and elbow muscles was found to be independent - tonic EMG activity of shoulder muscles increased in proportion to shoulder movement, but was unrelated to elbow motion, whereas elbow and double-joint muscle coactivation varied with the amplitude of elbow movement and were not correlated with shoulder motion. In addition, tonic EMG levels were higher for movements in which the shoulder and elbow rotated in the same direction than for those in which the joints rotated in opposite directions. In this respect, muscle coactivation may reflect a simple strategy to compensate for forces introduced by multijoint limb dynamics.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the control signals underlying voluntary human arm movement have a "complex" nonmonotonic time-varying form, and a number of empirical findings have been offered in support of this idea. In this paper, we address three such findings using a model of two-joint arm motion based on the lambda version of the equilibrium-point hypothesis. The model includes six one- and two-joint muscles, reflexes, modeled control signals, muscle properties, and limb dynamics. First, we address the claim that "complex" equilibrium trajectories are required to account for nonmonotonic joint impedance patterns observed during multijoint movement. Using constant-rate shifts in the neurally specified equilibrium of the limb and constant cocontraction commands, we obtain patterns of predicted joint stiffness during simulated multijoint movements that match the nonmonotonic patterns reported empirically. We then use the algorithm proposed by Gomi and Kawato to compute a hypothetical equilibrium trajectory from simulated stiffness, viscosity, and limb kinematics. Like that reported by Gomi and Kawato, the resulting trajectory was nonmonotonic, first leading then lagging the position of the limb. Second, we address the claim that high levels of stiffness are required to generate rapid single-joint movements when simple equilibrium shifts are used. We compare empirical measurements of stiffness during rapid single-joint movements with the predicted stiffness of movements generated using constant-rate equilibrium shifts and constant cocontraction commands. Single-joint movements are simulated at a number of speeds, and the procedure used by Bennett to estimate stiffness is followed. We show that when the magnitude of the cocontraction command is scaled in proportion to movement speed, simulated joint stiffness varies with movement speed in a manner comparable with that reported by Bennett. Third, we address the related claim that nonmonotonic equilibrium shifts are required to generate rapid single-joint movements. Using constant-rate equilibrium shifts and constant cocontraction commands, rapid single-joint movements are simulated in the presence of external torques. We use the procedure reported by Latash and Gottlieb to compute hypothetical equilibrium trajectories from simulated torque and angle measurements during movement. As in Latash and Gottlieb, a nonmonotonic function is obtained even though the control signals used in the simulations are constant-rate changes in the equilibrium position of the limb. Differences between the "simple" equilibrium trajectory proposed in the present paper and those that are derived from the procedures used by Gomi and Kawato and Latash and Gottlieb arise from their use of simplified models of force generation.},

	Abstract = {The kinematics of human jaw movements were assessed in terms of the three orientation angles and three positions that characterize the motion of the jaw as a rigid body. The analysis focused on the identification of the jaw's independent movement dimensions, and was based on an examination of jaw motion paths that were plotted in various combinations of linear and angular coordinate frames. Overall, both behaviors were characterized by independent motion in four degrees of freedom. In general, when jaw movements were plotted to show orientation in the sagittal plane as a function of horizontal position, relatively straight paths were observed. In speech, the slopes and intercepts of these paths varied depending on the phonetic material. The vertical position of the jaw was observed to shift up or down so as to displace the overall form of the sagittal plane motion path of the jaw. Yaw movements were small but independent of pitch, and vertical and horizontal position. In mastication, the slope and intercept of the relationship between pitch and horizontal position were affected by the type of food and its size. However, the range of variation was less than that observed in speech. When vertical jaw position was plotted as a function of horizontal position, the basic form of the path of the jaw was maintained but could be shifted vertically. In general, larger bolus diameters were associated with lower jaw positions throughout the movement. The timing of pitch and yaw motion differed. The most common pattern involved changes in pitch angle during jaw opening followed by a phase predominated by lateral motion (yaw). Thus, in both behaviors there was evidence of independent motion in pitch, yaw, horizontal position, and vertical position. This is consistent with the idea that motions in these degrees of freedom are independently controlled.},

	Abstract = {We investigated phasic and tonic stretch reflexes in human jaw-opener muscles, which have few, if any, muscle spindles. Jaw-unloading reflexes were recorded for both opener and closer muscles. Surface electromyographic (EMG) activity was obtained from left and right digastric and superficial masseter muscles, and jaw orientation and torques were recorded. Unloading of jaw-opener muscles elicited a short-latency decrease in EMG activity (averaging 20 ms) followed by a short-duration silent period in these muscles and sometimes a short burst of activity in their antagonists. Similar behavior in response to unloading was observed for spindle-rich jaw-closer muscles, although the latency of the silent period was statistically shorter than that observed for jaw-opener muscles (averaging 13 ms). Control studies suggest that the jaw-opener reflex was not due to inputs from either cutaneous or periodontal mechanoreceptors. In the unloading response of the jaw openers, the tonic level of EMG activity observed after transition to the new jaw orientation was monotonically related to the residual torque and orientation. This is consistent with the idea that the tonic stretch reflex might mediate the change in muscle activation. In addition, the values of the static net joint torque and jaw orientation after the dynamic phase of unloading were related by a monotonic function resembling the invariant characteristic recorded in human limb joints. The torque-angle characteristics associated with different initial jaw orientations were similar in shape but spatially shifted, consistent with the idea that voluntary changes in jaw orientation might be associated with a change in a single parameter, which might be identified as the threshold of the tonic stretch reflex. It is suggested that functionally significant phasic and tonic stretch reflexes might not be mediated exclusively by muscle spindle afferents. Thus, the hypothesis that central modifications in the threshold of the tonic stretch reflex underlie the control of movement may be applied to the jaw system.},

	Abstract = {1. When subjects trace patterns such as ellipses, the instantaneous velocity of movements is related to the instantaneous curvature of the trajectories according to a power law-movements tend to slow down when curvature is high and speed up when curvature is low. It has been proposed that this relationship is centrally planned. 2. The arm's muscle properties and dynamics can significantly affect kinematics. Even under isometric conditions, muscle mechanical properties can affect the development of muscle forces and torques. Without a model that accounts for these effects, it is difficult to distinguish between kinematic patterns that are attributable to central control and patterns that arise because of dynamics and muscle properties and are not represented in the underlying control signals. 3. In this paper we address the nature of the control signals that underlie movements that obey the power law. We use a numerical simulation of arm movement control based on the lambda version of the equilibrium point hypothesis. We demonstrate that simulated elliptical and circular movements, and elliptical force trajectories generated under isometric conditions, obey the power law even though there was no relation between curvature and speed in the modeled control signals. 4. We suggest that limb dynamics and muscle mechanics-specifically, the springlike properties of muscles-can contribute significantly to the emergence of the power law relationship in kinematics. Thus, without a model that accounts for these effects, care must be taken when making inferences about the nature of neural control.},

	Abstract = {Coarticulation in speech production is a phenomenon in which the articulator movements for a given speech sound vary systematically with the surrounding sounds and their associated movements. Although these variations may seem to be planned centrally, without explicit models of the speech articulators, the kinematic patterns that are attributable to central control cannot be distinguished from those that arise because of dynamics and are not represented in the underlying control signals. We address the origins of coarticulation by comparing the results of empirical and modeling studies of jaw motion in speech. The simulated kinematics of sagittal-plane jaw rotation and horizontal jaw translation are compared with the results of empirical studies in which subjects produce speech-like sequences at a normal rate and volume. The simulations examine both "anticipatory" and "carryover" coarticulatory effects. In both cases, the results show that even when no account is taken of context at the level of central control, kinematic patterns vary in amplitude and duration as a function of the magnitude of the preceding or following movement, in the same manner as that observed empirically in coarticulation. Because at least some coarticulatory effects may arise from muscle mechanics and jaw dynamics and not from central control, these factors must be considered before drawing inferences about control in coarticulation.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of muscle coactivation provide a window into mechanisms of limb stabilization. In the present paper we have examined muscle coactivation in single-joint elbow and single-joint shoulder movements and explored its relationship to movement velocity and amplitude, as well as phasic muscle activation patterns. Movements were produced at several speeds and different amplitudes, and muscle activity and movement kinematics were recorded. Tonic levels of electromyographic (EMG) activity following movement provided a measure of muscle cocontraction. It was found that coactivation following movement increased with maximum joint velocity at each of two amplitudes. Phasic EMG activity in agonist and antagonist muscles showed a similar correlation that was observable even during the first 30 ms of muscle activation. All subjects but one showed statistically significant correlations on a trial-by-trial basis between tonic and phasic activity levels, including the phasic activity measure taken at the initiation of movement. Our findings provide direct evidence that muscle coactivation varies with movement velocity. The data also suggest that cocontraction is linked in a simple manner to phasic muscle activity. The similarity in the patterns of tonic and phasic activation suggests that the nervous system may use a simple strategy to adjust coactivation and presumably limb impedance in association with changes in movement speed. Moreover, since the pattern of tonic activity varies with the first 30 ms of phasic activity, the control of cocontraction may be established prior to movement onset.},

Each object (stick, shoulder pad, elbow pad) imparts a distinct load upon the limb, and a key problem in motor neuroscience is to understand how the brain controls movement for different mechanical contexts. We addressed this issue by training non-human primates to make reaching movements with and without viscous loads applied to the shoulder and/or elbow joints, and then examined neural representations in primary motor cortex (MI) for each load condition. Even though the shoulder and elbow loads are mechanically independent, we found that some neurons responded to both of these single-joint loads. Furthermore, changes in activity of individual neurons during multi-joint loads could be predicted from their response to subordinate single-joint loads. These findings suggest that neural representations of different mechanical contexts in MI are organized in a highly structured manner that may provide a neural basis for how complex motor behaviour is learned from simpler motor tasks.},

	Abstract = {Visually guided arm movements such as reaching or pointing are accompanied by saccadic eye movements that typically begin prior to motion of the arm. In the past, some degree of coupling between the oculomotor and limb motor systems has been demonstrated by assessing the relative onset times of eye and arm movement, and by the demonstration of a gap effect for arm movement reaction times. However, measures of limb movement onset time based on kinematics are affected by factors such as the relatively high inertia of the limb and neuromechanical delays. The goal of the present study was thus to assess the relative timing of rapid eye and arm movements made to visual targets by examining electromyographic (EMG) activity of limb muscles in conjunction with eye and arm position measures. The observation of a positive correlation between eye and limb EMG onset latencies, and the presence of a gap effect for limb EMG onset times (a reduction in reaction time when a temporal gap is introduced between the disappearance of a central fixation point and the appearance of a new target) both support the idea that eye and arm movement initiation are linked. However, limb EMG onset in most cases precedes saccade onset, and the magnitude of EMG activity prior to eye movement is correlated with both the direction and amplitude of the upcoming arm movement. This suggests that, for the rapid movements studied here, arm movement direction and distance are specified prior to the onset of saccades.},

This device maintained the limb in the horizontal plane such that hand motion was generated only by flexor and extensor motions at the shoulder and elbow. The study describes the kinematic and kinetic features of the shoulder, elbow, and hand during reaching movements from a central target to peripheral targets located on the circumference of a circle: the center-out task. While subjects made reaching movements with relatively straight smooth hand paths and little variation in peak hand velocity, there were large variations in joint motion, torque, and power for movements in different spatial directions. Unlike single-joint movements, joint kinematics and kinetics were not tightly coupled for these multijoint movements. For most movements, power generation was predominantly generated at only one of the two joints. The present analysis illustrates the complexities inherent in multijoint movements and forms the basis for understanding strategies used by the motor system to control reaching movements and for interpreting the response of neurons in different brain regions during this task.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies of multijoint arm movements have shown that the CNS holds arm kinematics constant in different situations by predictively compensating for the effects of interaction torques. We determined whether this was also the case for wrist joint flexion in natural overarm throws performed by skilled subjects in 3D, a situation where large passive torques can occur at the wrist. Specifically, we investigated whether wrist flexion amplitudes are held constant in throws of different speeds. Joint rotations were recorded at 1,000 Hz with the search-coil technique. Contrary to a previous study on constrained 2D throwing, indirect evidence was found that in fast throws passive torques associated with forearm deceleration were exploited to increase wrist flexion velocity. This increase in wrist flexion velocity was associated with constant wrist flexion amplitudes at ball release (mean 27 degrees) for throws of different speeds. Furthermore, final wrist flexion positions after ball release were similar for a particular subject irrespective of the speed of the throw. This was associated in faster throws with increased magnitudes of wrist flexor and wrist extensor EMG activity which damped passive torques associated with forearm angular deceleration. It is concluded that wrist flexion in overarm throws of different speeds is produced by central signals which precisely control net joint torque by both exploiting and damping passive torques during different parts of the throw to keep wrist joint angular position parameters constant. As such the results show that control strategies for natural 3D throwing are different from those for constrained 2D throwing.},

	Abstract = {We used a robotic device to test the idea that impedance control involves a process of learning or adaptation that is acquired over time and permits the voluntary control of the pattern of stiffness at the hand. The tests were conducted in statics. Subjects were trained over the course of 3 successive days to resist the effects of one of three different kinds of mechanical loads: single axis loads acting in the lateral direction, single axis loads acting in the forward/backward direction, and isotropic loads that perturbed the limb in eight directions about a circle. We found that subjects in contact with single axis loads voluntarily modified their hand stiffness orientation such that changes to the direction of maximum stiffness mirrored the direction of applied load. In the case of isotropic loads, a uniform increase in endpoint stiffness was observed. Using a physiologically realistic model of two-joint arm movement, the experimentally determined pattern of impedance change could be replicated by assuming that coactivation of elbow and double joint muscles was independent of coactivation of muscles at the shoulder. Moreover, using this pattern of coactivation control we were able to replicate an asymmetric pattern of rotation of the stiffness ellipse that was observed empirically. These findings are consistent with the idea that arm stiffness is controlled through the use of at least two independent co-contraction commands.},

	Abstract = {The population vector hypothesis was introduced almost twenty years ago to illustrate that a population vector constructed from neural activity in primary motor cortex (MI) of non-human primates could predict the direction of hand movement during reaching. Alternative explanations for this population signal have been suggested but could not be tested experimentally owing to movement complexity in the standard reaching model. We re-examined this issue by recording the activity of neurons in contralateral MI of monkeys while they made reaching movements with their right arms oriented in the horizontal plane-where the mechanics of limb motion are measurable and anisotropic. Here we found systematic biases between the population vector and the direction of hand movement. These errors were attributed to a non-uniform distribution of preferred directions of neurons and the non-uniformity covaried with peak joint power at the shoulder and elbow. These observations contradict the population vector hypothesis and show that non-human primates are capable of generating reaching movements to spatial targets even though population vectors based on MI activity do not point in the direction of hand motion.},

	Abstract = {Cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task requirements-both in statics and during movement. However, relatively little is known about the conditions under which the motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. The goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. The electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. Movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. Measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. We observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. In addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. This suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. We also observed a general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time, supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.},

	Abstract = {When arm movements are perturbed by a load, how does the nervous system adjust control signals to reduce error? While it has been shown that the nervous system is capable of compensating for the effects of limb dynamics and external forces, the strategies used to adapt to novel loads are not well understood. We used a robotic exoskeleton [kinesiological instrument for normal and altered reaching movements (KINARM)] to apply novel loads to the arm during single-joint elbow flexions in the horizontal plane (shoulder rotation was allowed). Loads varied in magnitude with the instantaneous velocity of elbow flexion, and were applied to the shoulder in experiment 1 (interaction loads) and the elbow in experiment 2 (direct loads). Initial exposure to both interaction and direct loads resulted in perturbations at both joints, even though the load was applied to only a single joint. Subjects tended to correct for the kinematics of the elbow joint while perturbations at the shoulder persisted. Electromyograms (EMGs) and computed muscle torque showed that subjects modified muscle activity at the elbow to reduce elbow positional deviations. Shoulder muscle activity was also modified; however, these changes were always in the same direction as those at the elbow. Current models of motor control based on inverse-dynamics calculations and force-control, as well as models based on positional control, predict an uncoupling of shoulder and elbow muscle torques for adaptation to these loads. In contrast, subjects in this study adopted a simple strategy of modulating the natural coupling that exists between elbow and shoulder muscle torque during single-joint elbow movements.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies have used transfer of learning over workspace locations as a means to determine whether subjects code information about dynamics in extrinsic or intrinsic coordinates. Transfer has been observed when the torque associated with joint displacement is similar between workspace locations-rather than when the mapping between hand displacement and force is preserved-which is consistent with muscle- or joint-based encoding. In the present study, we address the generality of an intrinsic coding of dynamics and examine how generalization occurs when the pattern of torques varies over the workspace. In two initial experiments, we examined transfer of learning when the direction of a force field was fixed relative to an external frame of reference. While there were no beneficial effects of transfer after training at a single location (experiments 1 and 2), excellent performance was observed at the center of the workspace after training at two lateral locations (experiment 2). Experiment 3 and associated simulations assessed the characteristics of this generalization. In these studies, we examined the patterns of transfer observed after adaptation to force fields that were composed of two subfields that acted in opposite directions. The experimental and simulated data are consistent with the idea that information about dynamics is encoded in intrinsic coordinates. The nervous system generalizes dynamics learning by interpolating between sets of control signals, each locally adapted to different patterns of torques.},

	Abstract = {Single-joint elbow flexions are associated with muscle activity at the shoulder that opposes interaction torques arising from rotation of the elbow. We have previously shown that this activity is linearly related to elbow muscle torque and is robust in the presence of novel dynamic loads. Here we examined this relationship in the context of shoulder joint fixation. We tested the hypothesis that after mechanically fixing the shoulder the relationship between shoulder muscle activity and elbow muscle torque will be preserved. In contrast, proposals in which energetic variables are optimized predict that shoulder muscle activity should cease. Subjects performed single-joint elbow flexions in a horizontal plane while interacting with the KINARM robotic exoskeleton. After repeated movements with the shoulder joint fixed we observed a slight and gradual decrease in the activity of pectoralis major relative to movements in which the shoulder was free to rotate. However the strength of the coupling between the shoulder and elbow did not change after shoulder fixation. This is consistent with our previous findings and suggests that the nervous system maintains this inter-joint coupling relationship even when activity at the fixed joint is no longer needed for movement accuracy.},

	Abstract = {In recent studies of human motor learning, subjects learned to move the arm while grasping a robotic device that applied novel patterns of forces to the hand. Here, we examined the generality of force field learning. We tested the idea that contextual cues associated with grasping a novel object promote the acquisition and use of a distinct internal model, associated with that object. Subjects learned to produce point-to-point arm movements to targets in a horizontal plane while grasping a robotic linkage that applied either a velocity-dependent counter-clockwise or clockwise force field to the hand. Following adaptation, subjects let go of the robot and were asked to generate the same movements in free space. Small but reliable after-effects were observed during the first eight movements in free space, however, these after-effects were significantly smaller than those observed for control subjects who moved the robot in a null field. No reduction in retention was observed when subjects subsequently returned to the force field after moving in free space. In contrast, controls who reached with the robot in a NF showed much poorer retention when returning to a force field. These findings are consistent with the idea that contextual cues associated with grasping a novel object may promote the acquisition of a distinct internal model of the dynamics of the object, separate from internal models used to control limb dynamics alone.},

The neural basis of this effect is poorly understood. We tested the idea that proactive interference results from persisting neural representations of previously learned skills in the primary motor cortex (M1). We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of M1 to disrupt retention of a recently learned motor skill. If interference results from the retention of this skill then its disruption should be associated with reduced interference. Subjects reached to targets while interacting with a robotic arm that applied force fields to the limb. Fifteen minutes of 1-Hz rTMS to M1 impaired the retention of a first force field, and more importantly, reduced proactive interference when subjects learned a second one.

Although recent studies have provided intriguing new insights, in comparison with volume of research on the visual control of movement, relatively little is known about how movement influences vision. The motor system is perfectly suited to learn about environmental forces. Does environmental force information, learned by the motor system, influence visual processing? Here, we show that learning to compensate for a force applied to the hand influenced how participants predicted target motion for interception. Ss trained in one of three constant force fields by making reaching movements while holding a robotic manipulandum. The robot applied forces in a null [null force field (NFF)], leftward [leftward force field (LFF)], or [rightward force field (RFF)] direction. Training was followed immediately with an interception task. The target accelerated from left to right and Ss's task was to stab it. When viewing time was optimal for prediction, the RFF group initiated their responses earlier and hit more targets, and the LFF group initiated their responses later and hit fewer targets, than the NFF group. In follow-up experiments, we show that motor learning is necessary, and we rule out the possibility that explicit force direction information drives how Ss altered their predictions of visual motion. Environmental force information, acquired by motor learning, influenced how the motion of nearby visual targets was predicted.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies of learning to adapt reaching movements in the presence of novel forces show that learning multiple force fields is prone to interference. Recently it has been suggested that force field learning may reflect learning to manipulate a novel object. Within this theoretical framework, interference in force field learning may be the result of static tactile or haptic cues associated with grasp, which fail to indicate changing dynamic conditions. The idea that different haptic cues (e.g. those associated with different grasped objects) signal motor requirements and promote the learning and retention of multiple motor skills has previously been unexplored in the context of force field learning. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The present study tested the possibility that interference can be reduced when two different force fields are associated with differently shaped objects grasped in the hand. Human subjects were instructed to guide a cursor to targets while grasping a robotic manipulandum, which applied two opposing velocity-dependent curl fields to the hand. For one group of subjects the manipulandum was fitted with two different handles, one for each force field. No attenuation in interference was observed in these subjects relative to controls who used the same handle for both force fields. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that in the context of the present learning paradigm, haptic cues on their own are not sufficient to reduce interference and promote learning multiple force fields.},

	Abstract = {To adapt to novel unstable environments, the motor system modulates limb stiffness to produce selective increases in arm stability. The motor system receives information about the environment via somatosensory and proprioceptive signals related to the perturbing forces and visual signals indicating deviations from an expected hand trajectory. Here we investigated whether subjects modulate limb stiffness during adaptation to a purely visual perturbation. In a first experiment, measurements of limb stiffness were taken during adaptation to an elastic force field (EF). Observed changes in stiffness were consistent with previous reports: subjects increased limb stiffness and did so only in the direction of the environmental instability. In a second experiment, stiffness changes were measured during adaptation to a visual perturbing environment that magnified hand-path deviations in the lateral direction. In contrast to the first experiment, subjects trained in this visual task showed no accompanying change in stiffness, despite reliable improvements in movement accuracy. These findings suggest that this sort of visual information alone may not be sufficient to engage neural systems for stiffness control, which may depend on sensory signals more directly related to perturbing forces, such as those arising from proprioception and somatosensation.},

	Abstract = {Neural representations of novel motor skills can be acquired through visual observation. We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test the idea that this "motor learning by observing" is based on engagement of neural processes for learning in the primary motor cortex (M1). Human subjects who observed another person learning to reach in a novel force environment imposed by a robot arm performed better when later tested in the same environment than subjects who observed movements in a different environment. rTMS applied to M1 after observation reduced the beneficial effect of observing congruent forces, and eliminated the detrimental effect of observing incongruent forces. Stimulation of a control site in the frontal cortex had no effect on reaching. Our findings represent the first direct evidence that neural representations of motor skills in M1, a cortical region whose role has been firmly established for active motor learning, also underlie motor learning by observing.},

	Abstract = {The motor system can use a number of mechanisms to increase movement accuracy and compensate for perturbing external forces, interaction torques, and neuromuscular noise. Empirical studies have shown that stiffness modulation is one adaptive mechanism used to control arm movements in the presence of destabilizing external force loads. Other work has shown that arm muscle activity is increased at movement end for reaching movements to small visual targets and that changes in stiffness at movement end are oriented to match changes in visual accuracy requirements such as target shape. In this study, we assess whether limb stiffness is modulated to match spatial accuracy requirements during movement, conveyed using visual stimuli, in the absence of external force loads. Limb stiffness was estimated in the middle of reaching movements to visual targets located at the end of a narrow (8 mm) or wide (8 cm) visual track. When greater movement accuracy was required, we observed modest but reliable increases in limb stiffness in a direction perpendicular to the track. These findings support the notion that the motor system uses stiffness control to augment movement accuracy during movement and does so in the absence of external unstable force loads, in response to changing accuracy requirements conveyed using visual cues.},

@article{Cothros:2009fp,
	Abstract = {Recent motor learning studies show that human subjects and nonhuman primates form neural representations of novel mechanical environments and associated forces. Whereas proficient adaptation is seen for a single force field, when faced with multiple novel force environments, movement performance and in particular the ability to switch between different force environments declines. It is difficult to reconcile these findings with the notion that primates can proficiently switch between multiple motor skills. Conceivably, particular kinds of sensory, cognitive, or perceptual contextual cues are required. This study examined the effect of visual feedback on motor learning, in particular, cues that simulated interaction with a virtual object. A robot arm was used to deliver novel patterns of forces (force fields) to the limb during reaching movements. We tested the possibility that subjects transition more easily between novel forces and their sudden absence when they are accompanied by visual cues that relate to object grasp. We used a virtual display system to present subjects with different kinds of visual feedback during reaching, including illusory feedback, indicating grasp of a virtual object during reaching in the force field, and object release in the absence of forces. Throughout the experiment, subjects in fact maintained grasp of the robot. We found that, indeed, the most effective visual cues were those associating the force field with grasp of the virtual object and the absence of the force field with release of the object. Our findings show more broadly that specific visual cues can protect motor skills from interference.},
