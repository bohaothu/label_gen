@article{Niemeyer:2010a,
	Abstract = {A novel implementation for the skeletal reduction of large detailed reaction mechanisms using the direc- ted relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA) is developed and presented with examples for three hydrocarbon components, n-heptane, iso-octane, and n-decane, relevant to sur- rogate fuel development. DRGEPSA integrates two previously developed methods, directed relation graph-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) and directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP), by first applying DRGEP to efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to further remove unimportant species, producing an optimally small skeletal mechanism for a given error limit. It is illustrated that the combination of the DRGEP and DRGASA methods allows the DRGEPSA approach to overcome the weaknesses of each, specifically that DRGEP cannot identify all unimportant species and that DRGASA shields unimportant species from removal. Skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane and iso-octane generated using the DRGEP, DRGASA, and DRGEPSA methods are presented and compared to illustrate the improvement of DRGEPSA. From a detailed reaction mechanism for n-alkanes covering n- octane to n-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions, two skeletal mechanisms for n-decane generated using DRGEPSA, one covering a comprehensive range of temperature, pressure, and equiva- lence ratio conditions for autoignition and the other limited to high temperatures, are presented and val- idated. The comprehensive skeletal mechanism consists of 202 species and 846 reactions and the high- temperature skeletal mechanism consists of 51 species and 256 reactions. Both mechanisms are further demonstrated to well reproduce the results of the detailed mechanism in perfectly-stirred reactor and laminar flame simulations over a wide range of conditions. The comprehensive and high-temperature n-decane skeletal mechanisms are included as supplementary material with this article.},

@inproceedings{Niemeyer:2009,
	Abstract = {A novel implementation, using directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA), for the skeletal reduction of large detailed reaction mechanisms was developed and presented. DRGEPSA integrates two previous methods, directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) and directed relation graph aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA), by first applying DRGEP to efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to further eliminate unimportant species. A skeletal reduction of a detailed n-heptane mechanism was performed to illustrate the individual weaknesses of DRGEP and DRGASA and to show that DRGEPSA diminished these weaknesses. Furthermore, a comprehensive skeletal mechanism for n-decane was generated using DRGEPSA to demonstrate the applicability of the DRGEP method to the skeletal reduction of large surrogate fuel mechanisms. Specifically, the detailed mechanism of n-decane containing 940 species and 3887 reactions was reduced to a skeletal mechanism containing 211 species and 794 reactions, which exhibits good performance in predicting ignition delays over a wide range of equivalence ratios, temperatures, and pressures.},
