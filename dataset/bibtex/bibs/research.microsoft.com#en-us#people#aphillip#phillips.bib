Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulation of cellular growth and development. While highly studied, it is still not fully understood how the signal is orchestrated. One of the reasons for the complexity of this pathway is the extensive network of inter-connected components involved in the signaling. In the aim of identifying critical mechanisms controlling signal transduction we have performed extensive analysis of an executable model of the EGFR pathway using the stochastic pi-calculus as a modeling language. 

Results: Our analysis, done through simulation of various perturbations, suggests that the EGFR pathway contains regions of functional redundancy in the upstream parts; in the event of low EGF stimulus or partial system failure, this redundancy helps to maintain functional robustness. Downstream parts, like the parts controlling Ras and ERK, have fewer redundancies, and more than 50% inhibition of specific reactions in those parts greatly attenuates signal response. In addition, we suggest an abstract model that captures the main control mechanisms in the pathway. Simulation of this abstract model suggests that without redundancies in the upstream modules, signal transduction through the entire pathway could be attenuated. In terms of specific control mechanisms, we have identified positive feedback loops whose role is to prolong the active state of key components (e.g., MEK-PP, Ras-GTP), and negative feedback loops that help promote signal adaptation and stabilization. 

Conclusions: The insights gained from simulating this executable model facilitate the formulation of specific hypotheses regarding the control mechanisms of the EGFR signaling, and further substantiate the benefit to construct abstract executable models of large complex biological networks. }

Recently, a range of information-processing circuits have been implemented in DNA by using strand displacement as their main computational mechanism. Examples include digital logic circuits and catalytic signal amplification circuits that function as efficient molecular detectors. As new paradigms for DNA computation emerge, the development of corresponding languages and tools for these paradigms will help to facilitate the design of DNA circuits and their automatic compilation to nucleotide sequences. We present a programming language for designing and simulating DNA circuits in which strand displacement is the main computational mechanism. The language includes basic elements of sequence domains, toeholds and branch migration, and assumes that strands do not possess any secondary structure. The language is used to model and simulate a variety of circuits, including an entropy-driven catalytic gate, a simple gate motif for synthesizing large-scale circuits and a scheme for implementing an arbitrary system of chemical reactions. The language is a first step towards the design of modelling and simulation tools for DNA strand displacement, which complements the emergence of novel implementation strategies for DNA computing. }

Synthetic biology aims at producing novel biological systems to carry out some desired and well-defined functions. An ultimate dream is to design these systems at a high level of abstraction using engineering-based tools and programming languages, press a button, and have the design translated to DNA sequences that can be synthesized and put to work in living cells. We introduce such a programming language, which allows logical interactions between potentially undetermined proteins and genes to be expressed in a modular manner. Programs can be translated by a compiler into sequences of standard biological parts, a process that relies on logic programming and prototype databases that contain known biological parts and protein interactions. Programs can also be translated to reactions, allowing simulations to be carried out. While current limitations on available data prevent full use of the language in practical applications, the language can be used to develop formal models of synthetic systems, which are otherwise often presented by informal notations. The language can also serve as a concrete proposal on which future language designs can be discussed, and can help to guide the emerging standard of biological parts which so far has focused on biological, rather than logical, properties of parts. }

This chapter presents a visual process calculus for designing and simulating computer models of biological systems. The calculus is based on a graphical variant of stochastic pi-calculus extended with mobile compartments, and the simulation algorithm is based on standard kinetic theory of physical chemistry. The calculus forms the basis of a formal visual programming language for biology. The basic primitives of the calculus are first introduced by a series of examples involving genes and proteins. More complex features of the calculus are then illustrated by examples involving gene networks, cell differentiation, and immune system response. The main benefit of the calculus is its ability to model large systems incrementally, by directly composing simpler models of subsystems. The formal nature of the calculus also facilitates mathematical analysis of models, which in future could help provide insight into some of the underlying properties of biological systems. }

Rho GTP-binding proteins play a key role as molecular switches in many cellular activities. In response to extracellular stimuli and with the help from regulators (GEF, GAP, Effector, GDI), these proteins serve as switches that interact with their environment in a complex manner. Based on the structure of a published ordinary differential equations (ODE) model, we first present a generic process model for the Rho GTPbinding proteins, and compare it with the ODE model. We then extend the basic model to include the behaviour of the GDIs and explore the parameter space for the extended model with respect to biological data from the literature. We discuss the challenges this extension brings and the directions of further research. In particular, we present techniques for modular representation and refinement of process models, where, for example, different Rho proteins with different rates for regulator interactions can be given as the instances of the same parametric model. }

Actin is the monomeric subunit of actin filaments which form one of
the three major cytoskeletal networks in eukaryotic cells. Actin
dynamics, be it the polymerisation of actin monomers into filaments or
the reverse process, plays a key role in many cellular activities such
as cell motility and phagocytosis. There is a growing number of
experimental, theoretical and mathematical studies on the components
of actin polymerisation and depolymerisation. However, it remains a
challenge to develop compositional models of actin dynamics, e.g., by
using differential equations. In this paper, we propose compositional
process algebra models of actin polymerisation, and present a
geometric representation of these models that allows to generate
movies reflecting their dynamics. }

In recent years it has become clear that techniques developed for
concurrent programming are in fact very useful for the analysis of
complex systems in biology. To some level of abstraction, it is

entities that compute according to the rules of chemical reactions. In
this paper we present a tool for representing and stochastically

We present an approach for constructing dynamic models for the
simulation of gene regulatory networks from simple computational
elements. Each element is called a "gene gate" and defines an
input/output-relationship corresponding to the binding and production
of transcription factors.  The proposed reaction kinetics of the gene
gates can be mapped onto stochastic processes and the standard
ode-description. While the ode-approach requires fixing the system�s
topology before its correct implementation, expressing them in
stochastic pi-calculus leads to a fully compositional scheme: network
elements become autonomous and only the input/output relationships fix
their wiring. The modularity of our approach allows to pass easily
from a basic first-level description to refined models which capture
more details of the biological system. As an illustrative application
we present the stochastic repressilator, an artificial cellular clock,
which oscillates readily without any cooperative effects. }

We present a graphical semantics for the pi-calculus, that is easier
to visualize and better suited to expressing causality and temporal
properties than conventional relational semantics. A pi-chart is a
finite directed acyclic graph recording a computation in the
pi-calculus. Each node represents a process, and each edge either
represents a computation step, or a message-passing
interaction. Pi-charts enjoy a natural pictorial representation, akin
to message sequence charts, in which vertical edges represent control
flow and horizontal edges represent data flow based on message
passing. A pi-chart represents a single computation starting from its
top (the nodes with no ancestors) to its bottom (the nodes with no
descendants).  Unlike conventional reductions or transitions, the
edges in a pi-chart induce ancestry and other causal relations on
processes.  We give both compositional and operational definitions of
pi-charts, and illustrate the additional expressivity afforded by the
chart semantics via a series of examples. }

representation of gene network elements which can be used to build
complex circuits in a transparent and efficient way. To demonstrate
the power of the approach we apply it to several artificial networks,
such as the repressilator and combinatorial gene circuits first
studied in Combinatorial Synthesis of Genetic Networks [1]. For two
examples of the latter systems, we point out how the topology of the
circuits and the interplay of the stochastic gate interactions
influence the circuit behavior. Our approach may be useful for the

Boxed ambient calculi have been used to model and reason about a wide
variety of problems in mobile computing. Recently, several new
variants of Boxed Ambients have been proposed, which seek to improve
on the original calculus. In spite of these theoretical advances,
there has been little research on how such calculi can be correctly

machine uses a list semantics, which is close to an implementation

implementation. The machine is proved sound and complete with respect

described, together with an application for tracking the location of
migrating ambients. The correctness of the machine ensures that the
work done in specifying and analysing mobile applications is not lost

The Internet has grown substantially in recent years, and an
increasing number of applications are now being developed to exploit
this distributed infrastructure. Mobility is an important paradigm for
such applications, where mobile code is supplied on demand and mobile
components interact freely within a given network. However, mobile
applications are difficult to develop: not only do they involve
complex parallel interactions between multiple components, but they
must also satisfy strict security requirements. One could argue that
the development of such applications requires a rigorous means of
describing and reasoning about mobile computation, through the use of
an appropriate model.

Foundational research by Cardelli and Gordon on the Ambient Calculus
has shown that process calculi are a promising approach to modelling
mobile computation. This thesis builds on more recent research in the
field of process calculi, and presents a new model of computation
known as the Channel Ambient calculus, which can be used both to
specify mobile applications and to reason about their security
properties. The primitives of the model were developed with real-world
applications in mind, and are designed to be at a level of abstraction
suitable for an application programmer.

The thesis also bridges a gap between theory and implementation by
defining a distributed abstract machine for the Channel Ambient
calculus. The abstract machine uses a list semantics, which is close
to an implementation language, and a blocking semantics, which leads
to an efficient implementation. The machine is proved sound and
complete with respect to the underlying calculus. A prototype
implementation is also described, together with an application for
tracking the location of migrating ambients. The correctness of the
machine ensures that the work done in specifying and analysing mobile
