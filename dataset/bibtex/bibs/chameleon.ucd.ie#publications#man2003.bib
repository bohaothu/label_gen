  abstract =     {Artificial Intelligence research to date is inherently based on one ``mind'' for
                  one body. This paper discusses work which aims to realise a system where the ``mind'' has
                  the opportunity to migrate between different ``bodies'' and thereby achieve a new
                  perspective on system design and artificial intelligence.},
