	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of learning compact, view-independent, realistic 3D models of human actions recorded with multiple cameras, for the purpose of recognizing those same actions from a single or few cameras, without prior knowledge about the relative orientations between the cameras and the subjects. To this aim, we propose a new framework where we model actions using three dimensional occupancy grids, built from multiple viewpoints, in an exemplar-based HMM. The novelty is, that a 3D reconstruction is not required during the recognition phase, instead learned 3D exemplars are used to produce 2D image information that is compared to the observations. Parameters that describe image projections are added as latent variables in the recognition process. In addition, the temporal Markov dependency applied to view parameters allows them to evolve during recognition as with a smoothly moving camera. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with experiments on real datasets and with challenging recognition scenarios.},

	abstract = {Many virtual environments and games must be populated with synthetic characters to create the desired experience. These characters must move with sufficient realism, so as not to destroy the visual quality of the experience, yet be responsive, controllable, and efficient to simulate. In this paper we present an approach to character motion called Snap-Together Motion that addresses the unique demands of virtual environments. Snap-Together Motion (STM) preprocesses a corpus of motion capture examples into a set of short clips that can be concatenated to make continuous streams of motion. The result process is a simple graph structure that facilitates efficient planning of character motions. A user-guided process selects “common ” character poses and the system automatically synthesizes multi-way transitions that connect through these poses. In this manner well-connected graphs can be constructed to suit a particular application, allowing for practical interactive control without the effort of manually specifying all transitions.},

	abstract = {There are many applications that demand large quantities of natural looking motion. It is difficult to synthesize motion that looks natural, particularly when it is people who must move. In this paper, we present a framework that generates human motions by cutting and pasting motion capture data. Selecting a collection of clips that yields an acceptable motion is a combinatorial problem that we manage as a randomized search of a hierarchy of graphs. This approach can generate motion sequences that satisfy a variety of constraints automatically. The motions are smooth and human-looking. They are generated in real time so that we can author complex motions interactively. The algorithm generates multiple motions that satisfy a given set of constraints, allowing a variety of choices for the animator. It can easily synthesize multiple motions that interact with each other using constraints. This framework allows the extensive re-use of motion capture data for new purposes.},

@article{lee_siggraph02,
	abstract = {Real-time control of three-dimensional avatars is an important problem in the context of computer games and virtual environments. Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion.},

@inproceedings{Han06,
	abstract = {Three dimensional (3D) video is attracting a lot of attention as a new multimedia representation method. 3D video is a sequence of 3D models (frames) that consist of varying vertices and connectivity. In conventional 2D video compression algorithms, motion compensation (MC) using block matching algorithm is frequently employed to reduce redundancy between consecutive frames. However, there is no such technology for 3D video so far. Therefore, in this paper, we have developed an extended block matching algorithm (EMBA) to reduce temporal redundancy of geometry information of 3D video by extending the idea of 2D block matching to 3D space. In our EBMA, a cubic block is used as a matching unit and, MC is achieved efficiently by matching the mean normal vectors of the sub-blocks, which turned out to be sub-optimal by our experiments. The residual information is further transformed by discrete cosine transform (DCT) and then encoded. The extracted motion vectors are also entropy encoded. As a result of our experiments, compression ratio ranging from 10\% to 18\% of the original 3D video data has been achieved},

To meet different requirements for compression and level of detail of motion abstraction, adaptive extraction parameters are also applied. The experiments demonstrate that our method can not only compress and summarize the motion capture data efficiently, but also keep the consistency of keyframe collection between similar human motion sequences, which is of great benefit to further motion data retrieval or editing.},

The acquisition system is based on multiple sparsely placed 3D video bricks, each comprising a projector, two grayscale cameras, and a color camera. Relying on structured light with complementary patterns, texture images and pattern-augmented views of the scene are acquired simultaneously by time-multiplexed projections and synchronized camera exposures. Using space–time stereo on the acquired pattern images, high-quality depth maps are extracted, whose corresponding surface samples are merged into a view-independent, point-based 3D data structure. This representation allows for effective photo-consistency enforcement and outlier removal, leading to a significant decrease of visual artifacts and a high resulting rendering quality using EWA volume splatting. Our framework and its view-independent representation allow for simple and straightforward editing of 3D video. In order to demonstrate its flexibility, we show compositing techniques and spatiotemporal effects.},

@article{Li05,

Clearly, a shorter version is also necessary in applications where storage, communication bandwidth, and/or power are limited. The summarization process inevitably introduces distortion. The amount of summarization distortion is related to its "conciseness", or the number of frames available in the summary. If there are m frames in the original sequence and n frames in the summary, we define the summarization rate as m/n, to characterize this "conciseness". We also develop a new summarization distortion metric and formulate the summarization problem as a rate-distortion optimization problem. Optimal algorithms based on dynamic programming are presented and compared experimentally with heuristic algorithms. Practical constraints, like the maximum number of frames that can be skipped, are also considered in the formulation and solution of the problem.},

The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study.},

	abstract = {3D video objects provide the same functionalities as virtual computer graphics objects but depict the motion and appearance of real world moving objects. They can be viewed interactively from any direction and integrated in complete 3D scenes with other virtual and real world elements. So far, related work only considered extraction, representation, and rendering methods. Compression and transmission has not yet been studied in detail and combined with the other components into one complete system. In this paper, we present such a complete system for efficient 3D video object extraction, representation, coding, and interactive rendering. Data representation is based on 3D mesh models and view-dependent texture mapping using video textures. The geometry extraction is based on a shape-from-silhouette algorithm. The resulting voxel models are converted into 3D meshes that are coded using MPEG-4 SNHC tools. The corresponding video textures are preprocessed taking the object's shape into account and coded using an H.264/AVC codec. The presented results illustrate that based on the proposed methods a complete transmission system for 3D video objects can be built.},

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance},

Rotation invariant features are derived from the coefficients of these transforms. Furthermore we compare two different voxel representations, namely, binary denoting object and background space, and continuous after distance transformation. In the binary voxel representation the voxel values are simply set to 1 on the surface of the object and 0 elsewhere. In the continuous-valued representation the space is filled with a function of distance transform. The rotation invariance properties of the DFT and RCT schemes are analyzed.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to model an action based on both the shape and the motion of the performing object. When the object performs an action in 3D, the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x, y) contour in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x, y, t), which can be treated as 3D object in the (x, y, t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties. A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach. After the STV is generated, actions descriptors are computed by analyzing the differential geometric properties of STV. Finally, using these descriptors, we perform action recognition, which is also formulated as graph theoretical problem. Several experimental results are presented to demonstrate our approach.},

@article{Kazhdan07,
	abstract = {In many shape analysis applications, the ability to find the best rotation that aligns two models is an essential first step in the analysis process. In the past, methods for model alignment have either used normalization techniques, such as PCA alignment, or have performed an exhaustive search over the space of rotation to find the best optimal alignment. While normalization techniques have the advantage of efficiency, providing a quick method for registering two shapes, they are often imprecise and can give rise to poor alignments. Conversely, exhaustive search is guaranteed to provide the correct answer, but, even using efficient signal processing techniques, this type of approach can be prohibitively slow. In this paper, we present a new method for aligning two 3D shapes. We show that the method is markedly faster than existing approaches based on efficient signal processing and we provide registration results demonstrating that the alignments obtained using our method have a high degree of precision and are markedly better than those obtained using normalization.},

	abstract = {Isometric surfaces share the same geometric structure, also known as the "first fundamental form." For example, all possible bendings of a given surface that includes all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.},

The approach is based on the multiresolutional Reeb graph matching presented by Hilaga et al. (2001). The original method only takes into account topological information what is often not sufficient for effective matchings. Therefore we proposed to augment this graph with geometrical attributes. We also provide a new topological coherence condition to improve the graph matching. Moreover 2D appearance attributes and 3D features are extracted and merged to improve the estimation of the similarity between models. Besides, all these new attributes are user-dependent as they can be weighted by variable terms. We obtain a flexible multiresolutional and multicriteria representation called augmented Reeb graph (ARG). Good preliminary results have been obtained in a shape-based matching framework compared to existing methods based only on statistical measures. In addition, our study lead us to an innovative part matching scheme based on the same approach as our augmented Reeb graph matching.},

Our goal is to enable support for traditional database operations (sorting, distance metrics, range queries, nearest neighbors, etc) on large databases of solid models. We introduce an approach to compare models based on shape using information extracted from the model boundary representation into Model Signature Graphs. We show how the Model Signature Graphs can be used to compute topological distances among models and how to use these measures to create metric spaces for indexing and clustering of solid models. We believe this work will begin to bridge the solid modeling and database communities, enabling new paradigms for interrogation of CAD datasets based on the engineering content of solid models. {\copyright}2001 ASME},

@article{el_mehalawi_cad03,
	abstract = {This paper presents an approach for retrieving and matching similar designs in a database of mechanical components. The retrieval and matching process is based on the geometric and topological similarity between mechanical components. The process constitutes five steps: (i) transforming the component from the CAD system in STEP format, (ii) building an attributed graph for it, (iii) abstracting the graph into some geometric entities, (iv) retrieving a set of similar graphs based on the abstracted data, and (v) matching the graph of the new design with each graph on the set of similar graphs. This paper addresses the last three steps. Retrieving and matching mechanical parts based on their shape has many applications such as cost estimation and process planning. Matching similar parts and calculating a similarity index for them has applications in manufacturing evaluation, design by case-based reasoning, robotics, and computer integrated manufacturing. Having a database system of mechanical components based on part shape serves in all of these applications.},

In this paper, we give the representation scheme of the CAD model in such a database. Components are represented using attributed graphs in which the nodes correspond to the surfaces of the component and the links correspond to the edges of the component. The graph is based on the standard for the exchange of product information (STEP) physical file of the component. STEP file should be unique for a single component regardless of the underlying CAD system. The process of creating the graph of a component constitutes two sub-tasks: (i) importing the CAD model from the CAD system in STEP format and (ii) transforming the STEP data into attributed graph-based representation. The graph and its attributes describe the topology of the component completely together with some geometric data that are not dependent on any coordinate system such as surface type and curve type.

	abstract = {The description of 3D shapes with features that possess descriptive power and invariant under similarity transformations is one of the most challenging issues in content based 3D model retrieval. Spherical harmonics-based descriptors have been proposed for obtaining rotation invariant representations. However, spherical harmonic analysis is based on latitude-longitude parameterization of a sphere which has singularities at each pole. Consequently, features near the two poles are over represented while features at the equator are under-sampled, and variations of the north pole affects significantly the shape function. In this paper we discuss these issues and propose the usage of spherical wavelet transform as a tool for the analysis of 3D shapes represented by functions on the unit sphere. We introduce three new descriptors extracted from the wavelet coefficients, namely: (1) a subset of the spherical wavelet coefficients, (2) the L1 and, (3) the L2 energies of the spherical wavelet sub-bands. The advantage of this tool is three fold; First, it takes into account feature localization and local orientations. Second, the energies of the wavelet transform are rotation invariant. Third, shape features are uniformly represented which makes the descriptors more efficient. Spherical wavelet descriptors are natural extension of 3D Zernike moments and spherical harmonics. We evaluate, on the Princeton Shape Benchmark, the proposed descriptors regarding computational aspects and shape retrieval performance.},

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion.},

In this paper we address two issues concerning spin-images, namely: (1) comparing uncompressed spinimages across large datasets is costly, and (2) a method to select the appropriate bin size and image width for spinimages is not clearly defined.  Our solution to these issues is a multi-resolution method that generates a pyramid of spin-images by successively decreasing the spin-image size by powers of two. To efficiently correlate surface points, we compare spin-images in a low-to-high resolution manner. Once multi-resolution spin-images are generated for a given object, we have found that the different resolutions can also be used to compare objects that have differing or non-uniform point densities. To select the appropriate bin sizes for comparing such objects, we use the ratio of the average edge lengths of the objects. We also show preliminary results of using the pyramid to converge on the appropriate image width by traversing the pyramid in a low-to-high resolution manner looking for the highest resolution at which the fewest number of highly correlated points are found to match a given feature point.},

Since 3D polygonal model can be expressed as a set of facets, the GGFM can fast constitute a spherical histogram about the normal orientation and area and position of every facet on the surface of the model. By computing the spherical correlation between the GGFMs of the matched models, similarity of two models can be obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in 3D model similarity matching and is invariant to the translation and rotation and scaling of 3D model. Comparing to the existing methods, this method is fast and needs low computation and storage cost since each facet of the model needs to be computed only once in GGFM.},

@article{Corney02,
	abstract = {This article describes the coarse shape filters that support the 3D, Internet-based search engine ShapeSifter, which aims to locate parts already in production that have a shape similar to a desired new part. The search engine analyzes the target model's shape characteristics and performs a similarity match on the database's contents. Our main challenge is identifying shape metrics that produce effective characterizations of 3D models for similarity comparison. We focus on using three novel convex hull-based indices to carry out a preliminary coarse filtering of candidates prior to more detailed analysis. We also describe the crucial role played by two databases of benchmark objects. Unlike other shape-matching systems, we chose ShapeSifter's architecture (multistep query), 3D representation (triangulated mesh), and implementation (Java3D) to allow deployment online once it matures},
