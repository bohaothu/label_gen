 abstract     = {The immunological synapse (IS) is a junction between the T cell and antigen-presenting cell and is composed of supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs). No studies have been published on naive T cell IS dynamics. Here, we find that IS formation during antigen recognition comprises cycles of stable IS formation and autonomous naive T cell migration. The migration phase is driven by PKCtheta, which is localized to the F-actin-dependent peripheral (p)SMAC. PKCtheta(-/-) T cells formed hyperstable IS in vitro and in vivo and, like WT cells, displayed fast oscillations in the distal SMAC, but they showed reduced slow oscillations in pSMAC integrity. IS reformation is driven by the Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp). WASp(-/-) T cells displayed normal IS formation but were unable to reform IS after migration unless PKCtheta was inhibited. Thus, opposing effects of PKCtheta and WASp control IS stability through pSMAC symmetry breakin. . .},

We present experiments that enhance our understanding of these dynamics by measuring the intrinsic response of single DNA molecules to sudden changes in tension or torsion. The observed dynamics can be accurately described by quasistatic models, independent of the degree of supercoiling initially present in the molecules. In particular, the dynamics are not affected by the continuous removal of the plectonemes. These results set an upper bound on the hydrodynamic drag opposing plectoneme removal, and thus provide a quantitative baseline for the dynamics of bare DNA.},

 abstract     = {We quantify the influence of the topology of a transcriptional regulatory network on its ability to process environmental signals. By posing the problem in terms of information theory, we do this without specifying the function performed by the network. Specifically, we study the maximum mutual information between the input (chemical) signal and the output (genetic) response attainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle number fluctuations. We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits, including various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species, each under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network, constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the networks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support multiple high-information solutions. These findings suggest a potential resolution of the âcross-talkâ phenomenon as well as the previously unexplained observation that transcription factors that undergo proteolysis are more likely to be auto-repressive.},

 studying gene transcriptional regulation in simpler organisms using a
 novel supervised learning algorithm called GeneClass. GeneClass is
 motivated by the hypothesis that in model organisms such as Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene is
 up- or down-regulated in a particular microarray experiment based on the
 presence of binding site subsequences (\&quot;motifs\&quot;) in the gene's regulatory
 region and the expression levels of regulators such as transcription
 factors in the experiment (\&quot;parents\&quot;). GeneClass formulates the learning
 task as a classification problem--predicting 1 and -1 labels
 corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of biological
 and measurement noise in microarray measurements. Using the Adaboost
 algorithm, GeneClass learns a prediction function in the form of an

 subjected to global constraints, as, for example, when the iterated steps
 of a motor protein acting on a single molecule must not exceed the total
 molecule length. We have developed a maximum-likelihood analysis,

 underlying growth mechanisms. Numerous network mechanisms have recently
 been proposed to reproduce specific properties such as degree
 distributions or clustering coefficients. We present a method for
 inferring the mechanism most accurately capturing a given network

 Drosophila melanogaster protein network is confidently and robustly (to
 noise and training data subsampling) classified as a
 duplication-mutation-complementation network over preferential attachment,
 small-world, and a duplication-mutation mechanism without complementation.
 Systematic classification, rather than statistical study of specific

 complex networks.},

 abstract     = {Motivation: Studying gene
 regulatory mechanisms in simple model organisms through analysis of
 high-throughput genomic data has emerged as a central problem in computational
 biology. Most approaches in the literature have focused either on
 finding a few strong regulatory patterns or on learning descriptive
 models from training data. However, these approaches are not yet
 adequate for making accurate predictions about which genes will be up-
 or down-regulated in new or held-out experiments. By introducing a
 predictive methodology for this problem, we can use powerful tools
 from machine learning and assess the statistical significance of our
 predictions. Results: We present a novel classification-based method for
 learning to predict gene regulatory response. Our approach is motivated
 by the hypothesis that in simple organisms such as Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene
 is up- or down-regulated in a particular experiment based on (1)
 the presence of binding site subsequences ( motifs') in the gene's
 regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of regulators such
 as transcription factors in the experiment ( parents'). Thus, our
 learning task integrates two qualitatively different data sources:
 genome-wide cDNA microarray data across multiple perturbation and
 mutant experiments along with motif profile data from regulatory
 sequences. We convert the regression task of predicting real-valued gene
 expression measurements to a classification task of predicting
 1 and -1
 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of
 biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. The learning
 algorithm employed is boosting with a margin-based generalization of
 decision trees, alternating decision trees. This large-margin classifier
 is sufficiently flexible to allow complex logical functions, yet
 sufficiently simple to give insight into the combinatorial mechanisms
 of gene regulation. We observe encouraging prediction accuracy on
 experiments based on the Gasch S. cerevisiae dataset, and we show
 that we can accurately predict up- and down-regulation on held-out
 experiments. We also show how to extract significant regulators, motifs and
 motif-regulator pairs from the learned models for various stress responses.
 Our method thus provides predictive hypotheses, suggests biological
 experiments, and provides interpretable insight into the structure of
 genetic regulatory networks. Availability: The MLJava package is

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Recent genomic and bioinformatic advances have motivated the
 development of numerous network models intending to describe graphs of
 biological, technological, and sociological origin. In most cases the
 success of a model has been evaluated by how well it reproduces a few key
 features of the real-world data, such as degree distributions, mean
 geodesic lengths, and clustering coefficients. Often pairs of models can
 reproduce these features with indistinguishable fidelity despite being
 generated by vastly different mechanisms. In such cases, these few target
 features are insufficient to distinguish which of the different models
 best describes real world networks of interest; moreover, it is not clear
 a priori that any of the presently-existing algorithms for network
 generation offers a predictive description of the networks inspiring them.

 by a nonlinear wave equation. A linear stability analysis predicts
 instabilities within the well-known resonance tongues; their boundaries
 agree very well with experiment. Full simulations of the 3D dynamics
 reproduce and elucidate many aspects of the experiment. The chain is also
 observed to tie knots in itself, some quite complex. This is beyond the

 a viscous fluid induced by that of a wall bounding the fluid), we consider
 the motion of a polymer, one end of which is moved in an impulsive or
 oscillatory way. Analytical solutions for the time-dependent shapes of
 such moving polymers are obtained within an analysis applicable to
 small-amplitude deformations. In the case of oscillatory driving,
 particular attention is paid to a characteristic length determined by the
 frequency of oscillation, the polymer persistence length, and the viscous
 drag coefficient. Experiments on actin filaments manipulated with optical
