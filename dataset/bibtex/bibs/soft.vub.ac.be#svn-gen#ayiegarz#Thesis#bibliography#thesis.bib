title = {A Survey on Aspect-Oriented Modelling Approaches},
abstract = {Aspect-orientation provides a new way of modularization by clearly separating crosscutting concerns from non-crosscutting ones. Although originally emerged at the programming level, aspect-orientation meanwhile stretches also over other development phases. Not only due to the rise of model-driven engineering, approaches already exist for dealing with aspect-orientation at the modeling level. Nevertheless, concepts from the programming level are often simply reused without proper adaptation. Consequently, such approaches fall short in considering the full spectrum of modeling concepts not present in programming languages, like, e.g., different views on the application's structure and behavior. In this paper we present a survey on existing aspect-oriented modeling approaches. In doing so, we first discuss a common reference architecture for aspect-oriented modeling and thus, take a step towards a consolidated and more comprehensive view on aspect-orientation. Second, we set up a framework of evaluation criteria directly derived from the common reference architecture and thus, allowing for a structured evaluation of approaches. And third, we provide a comparison of aspect-oriented modeling approaches by means of a running example making the approaches' strengths and shortcomings more explicit and report on lessons learned.},

Package merge is used extensively in the UML 2 specification to modularize the definition of the UML 2 meta model and to define the four compliance levels of UML 2. Package merge is a novel construct in UML and currently not well understood. This paper summarizes our work to understand and improve package merge. First, we identify ambiguous and missing rules in the package merge definition and suggest corrections. Then, we formalize package merge and analyze it with respect to some desirable properties. Our analyses employs Alloy, a first-order modelling language with tool support, and concepts from mathematical logic which allow us to develop a general taxonomy of package extension mechanisms. The analyses reveal the unexpected failure of important properties.},

The resultant life cycle processes are then briefly discussed. The paper then introduces laws of Program Evolution that have been formulated following quantitative studies of the evolution of a number of different systems. Finally an example is provided of the application of Evolution Dynamics models to program release planning.},

title = {A survey on aspect-oriented 
 approaches},
abstract = {Aspect-orientation provides a new way of modularization by clearly separating crosscutting concerns from non-crosscutting ones. Although originally emerged at the programming level, aspect-orientation meanwhile stretches also over other development phases. Not only due to the rise of model-driven engineering, approaches already exist for dealing with aspect-orientation at the modeling level. Nevertheless, concepts from the programming level are often simply reused without proper adaptation. Consequently, such approaches fall short in considering the full spectrum of modeling concepts not present in programming languages, like, e.g., different views on the application's structure and behavior. In this paper we present a survey on existing aspect-oriented modeling approaches. In doing so, we first discuss a common reference architecture for aspect-oriented modeling and thus, take a step towards a consolidated and more comprehensive view on aspect-orientation. Second, we set up a framework of evaluation criteria directly derived from the common reference architecture and thus, allowing for a structured evaluation of approaches. And third, we provide a comparison of aspect-oriented modeling approaches by means of a running example making the approaches' s},

The result is a low-level model that is rooted in the solution domain. The evolution of a TC is a complex and expensive endeavor since there are intricate dependencies between all its constituent parts. More specific, an evolution problem arises when we need to add an unanticipated concern (e.g., security) that does not fit the expressiveness of the high-level metamodel, because such an addition forces us to adapt existing assets (i.e., metamodels, models, and transformations). We present a solution that adds a new concern model to the TC, in an independent way.},

journal = {Proceedings European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming},
title = {Aspect-Oriented Programming},
abstract = {In this paper, we present an overview of our recent research on programming language expressivity. The goal of this work is to make it possible for programs to clearly capture all of the important aspects of a system's behavior, including not only its functionality, but also issues such as its failure handling strategy, its communication strategy, its coordination strategy, its memory reference locality, etc. Our current work is based on the belief that programming languages based on any SINGLE abstraction framework---procedures, constraints, whatever---are ultimately inadequate for many complex systems. The reason is that the different aspects of a system's behavior that must be programmed, each tend to have their own {\&}quot;natural form{\&}quot;, so while one abstraction framework might do a good job of capturing one aspect, it will do a less good job capturing others. This conclusion has led us to develop a concept we call Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). In AOP, the different aspects of a system's behavior are each programmed in their most natural form, and then these separate programs are woven together to produce executable code. Our work on AOP is being carried out in the context of both general-purpose and domainspecific languages, we believe that it has contributions to make to both areas.},

   abstract = {The Model Driven Development (MDD) paradigm stimulates the use of models as the main artifacts for software development. These models can be situated at high levels of abstraction, close to the application’s business domain. Many consecutive automatic transformations (a transformation chain) can be applied to these models to add the necessary details in order to generate a concrete implementation. This means that a large part of the total development effort is relocated to the development of transformations and hence we should have the necessary tooling support for designing transformation chains. In this paper we propose a metamodel for a transformation chain modeling language that enables implementation independent composition of transformations. We also propose a concrete syntax for this language that is based on UML activity diagrams.},
