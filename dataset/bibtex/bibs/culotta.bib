    The task of learning to partition data into similar sets occurs
    frequently in many disciplines.  We construct a Bayesian model for
    learning to partition from labeled data.  Our model is based on the
    nonparametric Dirichlet process prior.  Experimental results show that
    our model is able to outperform existing solutions on real world
    datasets.
