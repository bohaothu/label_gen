  abstract = {The no-fit polygon is a construct that can be used between pairs of
	shapes for fast and efficient handling of geometry within irregular
	two-dimensional stock cutting problems. Previously, the no-fit polygon
	(NFP) has not been widely applied because of the perception that
	it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches
	that can cope with all problem cases without specific case-by-case
	handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation
	of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem
	cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore,
	the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is
	easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach
	handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities
	and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular
	packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world
	datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.},

  title = {A Graph-Based Hyper Heuristic for Educational Timetabling Problems},

  volume = {176},
  pages = {177--192},
  note = {to appear},
  abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of a simple generic hyper-heuristic
	approach upon a set of widely used constructive heuristics (graph
	coloring heuristics) in timetabling. Within the hyperheuristic framework,
	a Tabu Search approach is employed to search for permutations of
	graph heuristics which are used for constructing timetables in exam
	and course timetabling problems. This underpins a multi-stage hyper-heuristic
	where the Tabu Search employs permutations upon a different number
	of graph heuristics in two stages. We study this graph-based hyper-heuristic
	approach within the context of exploring fundamental issues concerning
	the search space of the hyper-heuristic (the heuristic space) and
	the solution space. Such issues have not been addressed in other
	hyper-heuristic research. These approaches are tested on both exam
	and course benchmark timetabling problems and are compared with the
	fine-tuned bespoke state-of-the-art approaches. The results are within
	the range of the best results reported in the literature. The approach
	described here represents a significantly more generally applicable
	approach than the current state of the art in the literature. Future
	work will extend this hyper-heuristic framework by employing methodologies
	which are applicable on a wider range of timetabling and scheduling
	problems. },

	prob- lems. Human rostering experts have many years of experience
	in making rostering de- cisions which reect their individual goals

	decisions and adapting them to solve new problems using the Case-Based
	Reasoning (CBR) paradigm. This method stores examples of previously
	encountered constraint violations and the operations that were used
	to repair them. The violations are represented as vectors of feature
	values.We investigate the problem of select- ing and weighting features
	so as to improve the performance of the case-based reasoning approach.
	A genetic algorithm is developed for o-line feature selection and
	weighting us- ing the complex data types needed to represent real-world
	nurse rostering problems. This approach signicantly improves the
	accuracy of the CBR method and reduces the number of features that
	need to be stored for each problem. The relative importance of dierent
	features is also determined, providing an insight into the nature
	of expert decision making in personnel rostering. Keywords: Scheduling,

	rostering practice is not common yet in hospitals. Many head nurses
	are currently still spending several days per month on constructing
	their rosters by hand. In recent years, the emergence of larger and
	more constrained problems has presented a real challenge because
	finding good quality solutions can lead to a higher level of personnel
	satisfaction and to flexible organisational procedures. Compared
	to many industrial situations (where personnel schedules normally
	consist of stable periodic morning-day-night cycles) health care
	institutions often require more flexibility in terms of hours and
	shift types. The motivation for the research presented in this paper
	has been provided by real world hospital administrators/schedulers
	and the approach that we describe has been implemented in over 40
	hospitals in Belgium. This paper consists of two main contributions:
	- Modelling the real world situation more accurately than has previously
	been done in the literature. - Presenting and evaluating an efficient
	and effective tabu search procedure to solve these problems (as represented
	in the real world model). The approach described in this paper concentrates
	on an advanced representation of the daily personnel requirements
	of healthcare institutions. We introduce 'time interval' personnel
	requirements. Instead of formulating the requirements as a number
	of personnel needed per shift type for each day of the planning period,
	time interval requirements allow for the representation of the personnel
	requirements per day in terms of start and end times of personnel
	attendance. This formulation enables the provision of a greater choice
	of shift work and part time work and reduces the amount of unproductive
	time because it enables the shifts to be split and combined. We present
	an algorithmic approach to handle this new formulation. We also set
	up a series of experiments which indicate that, not only does this
	approach take into account the requests and requirements of hospital
	schedulers, but it also generates higher quality schedules when compared
	with earlier approaches. The obtained results are better in the sense
	that various specific real world soft constraints can be satisfied
	by scheduling appropriate shift type combinations whereas in the
	shift type approach fixed shift types restricted the solution space.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm for the two-dimensional
	irregular stock-cutting problem, which generates significantly better
	results than the previous state of the art on a wide range of established
	benchmark problems. The developed algorithm is able to pack shapes
	with a traditional line representation, and it can also pack shapes
	that incorporate circular arcs and holes. This in itself represents
	a significant improvement upon the state of the art. By utilising
	hill climbing and tabu local search methods, the proposed technique
	produces 25 new best solutions for 26 previously reported benchmark
	problems drawn from over 20 years of cutting and packing research.
	These solutions are obtained using reasonable time frames, the majority
	of problems being solved within five minutes. In addition to this,
	we also present 10 new benchmark problems, which involve both circular
	arcs and holes. These are provided because of a shortage of realistic
	industrial style benchmark problems within the literature and to
	encourage further research and greater comparison between this and
	future methods. },

  abstract = {The structured representation of cases by attribute graphs in a Case-Based
	Reasoning (CBR) system for course timetabling has been the subject
	of previous research by the authors. In that system, the case base
	is organised as a decision tree and the retrieval process chooses
	those cases which are sub attribute graph isomorphic to the new case.
	The drawback of that approach is that it is not suitable for solving
	large problems. This paper presents a multiple-retrieval approach
	that partitions a large problem into small solvable sub-problems
	by recursively inputting the unsolved part of the graph into the
	decision tree for retrieval. The adaptation combines the retrieved
	partial solutions of all the partitioned sub-problems and employs
	a graph heuristic method to construct the whole solution for the
	new case. We present a methodology which is not dependant upon problem
	specific information and which, as such, represents an approach which
	underpins the goal of building more general timetabling systems.
	We also explore the question of whether this multiple-retrieval CBR
	could be an effective initialisation method for local search methods
	such as Hill Climbing, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing. Significant
	results are obtained from a wide range of experiments. An evaluation
	of the CBR system is presented and the impact of the approach on
	timetabling research is discussed. We see that the approach does
	indeed represent an effective initialisation method for these approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a case-based heuristic selection approach for
	automated university course and exam timetabling. The method described
	in this paper is motivated by the goal of developing timetabling
	systems that are fundamentally more general than the current state

	are memorized in a case base and are retrieved for solving the problem
	in hand. Knowledge discovery techniques are employed in two distinct
	scenarios. Firstly, we model the problem and the problem solving
	situations along with specific heuristics for those problems. Secondly,
	we refine the case base and discard cases which prove to be non-useful
	in solving new problems. Experimental results are presented and analyzed.
	It is shown that case based reasoning can act effectively as an intelligent
	approach to learn which heuristics work well for particular timetabling
	situations. We conclude by outlining and discussing potential research
	issues in this critical area of knowledge discovery for different

	of different fitness evaluation methods on the performance of two
	multiobjective methodologies when applied to a highly constrained
	two-objective optimisation problem. The two algorithms are: the Pareto
	archive evolutionary strategy and a population-based annealing algorithm.
	We demonstrate here, on a highly constrained problem, that the method
	used to evaluate the fitness of candidate solutions during the search
	affects the performance of both algorithms and it appears that the
	dominance relation is not always the best method to use. },

  abstract = {Abstract: Network intrusion detection sensors are usually built around
	low level models of network traffic. This means that their output
	is of a similarly low level and as a consequence, is difficult to
	analyze. Intrusion alert correlation is the task of automating some
	of this analysis by grouping related alerts together. Attack graphs
	provide an intuitive model for such analysis. Unfortunately alert
	flooding attacks can still cause a loss of service on sensors, and
	when performing attack graph correlation, there can be a large number
	of extraneous alerts included in the output graph. This obscures
	the fine structure of genuine attacks and makes them more difficult
	for human operators to discern. This paper explores modified correlation
	algorithms which attempt to minimize the impact of this attack.},

	surface mount placement machines. Most previous work has reported
	on improving only the assembly cycle time. The movement of the feeder
	carrier and PCB table are not always factors which are minimised.
	In this paper we introduce a triple objective function with a Chebychev
	dynamic pick-and-place approach to optimise the sequential pick and
	place machine. We are focusing on improving the feeder setup. The
	aims are to minimise the robot assembly time, the feeder movements
	and the PCB table movements. To provide flexibility to our approach,
	we integrate three weighted parameters into the triple objective
	function such that one can vary the importance of each factor to
	be minimised. Experimental results show that our approach gives good
	robot assembly time and less movement of the feeder carrier and PCB
	table. },

	Immune System (AIS) that exploits some of these characteristics and
	is applied to the task of film recommendation by Collaborative Filtering
	(CF). Natural evolution and in particular the immune system have
	not been designed for classical optimisation. However, for this problem,
	we are not interested in finding a single optimum. Rather we intend
	to identify a sub-set of good matches on which recommendations can
	be based. It is our hypothesis that an AIS built on two central aspects
	of the biological immune system will be an ideal candidate to achieve
	this: Antigen-antibody interaction for matching and idiotypic antibody-antibody
	interaction for diversity. Computational results are presented in
	support of this conjecture and compared to those found by other CF
	techniques.},

  abstract = {The combination of Evolutionary algorithms with local search was named
	'Memetic Algorithms' (MAs) in [1]. These methods are inspired by
	models of natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation
	of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of
	its members. Additionally, MAs are inspired by Richard Dawkin's concept
	of a meme, which represents a unit of cultural evolution that can
	exhibit local refinement [2]. In the case of MAs 'memes' refer to
	the strategies (e.g. local refinement, perturbation or constructive
	methods, etc) that are employed to improve individuals. In this paper
	we review some works on the application of MAs to well known combinatorial
	optimisation problems, and place them in a framework defined by a
	general syntactic model. This model provides us with a classification
	scheme based on a computable index D, which facilitates algorithmic
	comparisons and suggests areas for future research. Also, by having
	an abstract model for this class of meta-heuristics it is possible
	to explore their design space and better understand their behaviour
	from a theoretical standpoint.We illustrate the theoretical and practical
	relevance of this model and taxonomy for MAs in the context of a
	discussion of important design issues that must be addressed to produce
	effective and efficient Memetic Algorithms.},

	used in the transport industry, there is still much scope for improvements.
	This paper presents a novel evolutionary approach that simulates
	the self-adjusting process on a single schedule. Five factors characterized
	by fuzzy membership functions are first aggregated to evaluate the
	shift structure. This evaluating function is incorporated into a
	constructing heuristic to make shift selection. A self-adjusting
	algorithm is then designed to guide the constructing heuristic to
	improve a given initial schedule iteratively. In each generation
	an unfit portion of the working schedule is removed. Broken schedules
	are repaired by the constructing heuristic until stopping condition
	is met. Experimental results on real-world driver scheduling problems
	has demonstrated the success of the proposed approach. },

	catalysts, we use molecular dynamics (MD) with an implicit Generalized
	Born solvent model to explore their conformational space. Comparison
	with crystal data indicates that relevant conformations are obtained
	and that, furthermore, the correct biphenyl twist conformation is
	predicted, as illustrated by the superiority of the resulting model
	(leave-one-out q2 ) 0.78) compared to a random choice of low-energy
	conformations for each catalyst (average q2 ) 0.22). We extend this
	model by incorporating the MD trajectory directly into a 4D QSSR
	and by Boltzmann-weighting the contribution of selected minimized
	conformations, which we refer to as '3.5D' QSSR. The latter method
	improves on the predictive ability of the 3D QSSR (leave-one-out

  abstract = {Classification is an important research area in cancer diagnosis.
	Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is one of the most widely used fuzzy clustering
	algorithms in real world applications. However there are two major
	limitations that exist in this method. The first is that a predefined
	number of clusters must be given in advance. The second is that the
	FCM technique can get stuck in sub-optimal solutions. In order to
	overcome these two limitations, Bandyopadhyay proposed a Variable
	String Length Simulated Annealing (VFC-SA) algorithm. Nevertheless,
	when this algorithm was implemented, it was found that sub-optimal
	solutions were still obtained in certain circumstances. In this paper,
	we propose an alternative fuzzy clustering algorithm, Simulated Annealing
	Fuzzy Clustering (SAFC), that improves and extends the ideas present
	in VFC-SA. The data from seven oral cancer patients tissue samples,
	obtained through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),
	were clustered using FCM, VFC-SA and the proposed SAFC algorithm.
	Experimental results are provided and comparisons are made to illustrate
	that the SAFC algorithm is able to find better clusters than the
	other two methods.},

	problem arising at a major UK hospital. Although Genetic Algorithms
	have been successfully used for similar problems in the past, they
	always had to overcome the limitations of the classical Genetic Algorithms
	paradigm in handling the conflict between objectives and constraints.
	The approach taken here is to use an indirect coding based on permutations
	of the nurses, and a heuristic decoder that builds schedules from
	these permutations. Computational experiments based on 52 weeks of
	live data are used to evaluate three different decoders with varying
	levels of intelligence, and four well-known crossover operators.
	Results are further enhanced by introducing a hybrid crossover operator
	and by making use of simple bounds to reduce the size of the solution
	space. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to
	find high quality solutions and is both faster and more flexible
	than a recently published Tabu Search approach.},

	such better results: increased execution time. We discuss the impact
	of this trade-off between quality and execution time. In particular
	we discuss issues involving the proper estimation of the algorithm's

	life problems, even with limited computing resources, the approach
	has the fundamental flaw that it is only as effective as the heuristic
	that is used. We present an adaptive method that adapts to suit a
	particular problem instance 'on the fly'. This method provides an
	alternative to existing forms of 'backtracking', which are often
	required to cope with the possible unsuitability of a heuristic.
	We present a range of experiments on benchmark problems to test and
	evaluate the approach. In comparison to other published approaches
	to solving this problem, the adaptive method is more general, significantly
	quicker and easier to implement and produces results that are at
	least comparable (if not better) than the current state of the art.
	We also demonstrate the level of generality of this approach by starting
	it with the inverse of a known good heuristic, a null ordering and
	random orderings, showing that the adaptive method can transform
	a bad heuristic ordering into a good one.},

	evaluation for some large-scale set covering problems originating
	from the public transport industry. First, five factors characterized
	by fuzzy membership functions are aggregated to evaluate the structure
	and generally the goodness of a column. This evaluation function
	is incorporated into a refined greedy algorithm to make column selection
	in the process of constructing a solution. Secondly, a self-evolving
	algorithm is designed to guide the constructing heuristic to build
	an initial solution and then improve it. In each generation an unfit
	portion of the working solution is removed. Broken solutions are
	repaired by the constructing heuristic until stopping conditions
	are reached. Orthogonal experimental design is used to set the system
	parameters efficiently, by making a small number of trials. Computational
	results are presented and compared with a mathematical programming
	method and a GA-based heuristic.},

	algorithm under different partnering strategies. Cascading clusters
	of sub-populations are built from the bottom up, with higher-level
	sub-populations optimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level
	sub-populations potentially search a larger search space with a lower
	resolution whilst lower-level sub-populations search a smaller search
	space with a higher resolution. The effects of different partner
	selection schemes amongst the sub-populations on solution quality
	are examined for two constrained optimisation problems. We examine
	a number of recombination partnering strategies in the construction
	of higher-level individuals and a number of related schemes for evaluating
	sub-solutions. It is shown that partnering strategies that exploit
	problemspecific knowledge are superior and can counter inappropriate
	(sub-) fitness measurements.},

  abstract = {A common weakness of local search metaheuristics, such as Simulated
	Annealing, in solving combinatorial optimisation problems, is the
	necessity of setting a certain number of parameters. This tends to
	generate a significant increase in the total amount of time required
	to solve the problem and often requires a high level of experience
	from the user. This paper is motivated by the goal of overcoming
	this drawback by employing 'parameter-free' techniques in the context
	of automatically solving course timetabling problems. We employ local
	search techniques with 'straightforward' parameters, i.e. ones that
	an inexperienced user can easily understand. In particular, we present
	an extended variant of the 'Great Deluge' algorithm, which requires
	only two parameters (which can be interpreted as search time and
	an estimation of the required level of solution quality). These parameters
	affect the performance of the algorithm so that a longer search provides
	a better result - as long as we can intelligently stop the approach
	from converging too early. Hence, a user can choose a balance between
	processing time and the quality of the solution. The proposed method
	has been tested on a range of university course timetabling problems
	and the results were evaluated within an International Timetabling
	Competition. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been
	confirmed by a high level of quality of results. These results represented
	the third overall average rating among 21 participants and the best
	solutions on 8 of the 23 test problems.},

	heuristics in order to solve a given optimisation problem. The main
	motivation behind the development of such approaches is the goal
	of developing automated scheduling methods which are not restricted
	to one problem. In this paper we report the investigation of a hyperheuristic
	approach and evaluate it on various instances of two distinct timetabling
	and rostering problems. In the framework of our hyperheuristic approach,
	heuristics compete using rules based on the principles of reinforcement
	learning. A tabu list of heuristics is also maintained which prevents
	certain heuristics from being chosen at certain times during the
	search.We demonstrate that this tabu-search hyperheuristic is an
	easily re-usable method which can produce solutions of at least acceptable
	quality across a variety of problems and instances. In effect the
	proposed method is capable of producing solutions that are competitive
	with those obtained using stateof- the-art problem-specific techniques
	for the problems studied here, but is fundamentally more general
	than those techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) for the bi-objective
	public transport driver scheduling problem. A greedy heuristic is
	used, which constructs a schedule by sequentially selecting shifts,
	from a very large set of pregenerated legal potential shifts, to
	cover the remaining work. Individual shifts and the schedule as a
	whole have to be evaluated in the process. Fuzzy set theory is applied
	on such evaluations. For individual shifts, their structural efficiency
	is assessed by fuzzified criteria identified from practical knowledge
	of the problem domain. A GA is used to derive a near-optimal weight
	distribution amongst the fuzzified criteria, so that a single-valued
	weighted evaluation can be computed for each shift. The corresponding
	schedule constructed utilising the weight distribution is evaluated
	by the GAs fitness function, in which the two objectives of minimising
	the number of shifts and minimising the total cost are formulated
	as a fuzzy goal. Comparative results on real-world problems are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new type of genetic algorithm for the set covering
	problem. It differs from previous evolutionary approaches first because
	it is an indirect algorithm, i.e. the actual solutions are found
	by an external decoder function. The genetic algorithm itself provides
	this decoder with permutations of the solution variables and other
	parameters. Second, it will be shown that results can be further
	improved by adding another indirect optimisation layer. The decoder
	will not directly seek out low cost solutions but instead aims for
	good exploitable solutions. These are then post optimised by another
	hill-climbing algorithm. Although seemingly more complicated, we
	will show that this three-stage approach has advantages in terms
	of solution quality, speed and adaptability to new types of problems
	over more direct approaches. Extensive computational results are
	presented and compared to the latest evolutionary and other heuristic
	approaches to the same data instances.},

	approaches to timetabling problems that have been developed or are
	under development in the Automated Scheduling, Optimisation and Planning
	Research Group (ASAP) at the University of Nottingham. We have concentrated
	upon university timetabling but we believe that some of the methodologies
	that are described can be used for different timetabling problems
	such as employee timetabling, timetabling of sports fixtures, etc.
	The paper suggests a number of approaches and comprises three parts.
	Firstly, recent heuristic and evolutionary timetabling algorithms
	are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments
	are described: a method for decomposing large real-world timetabling
	problems and a method for heuristic initialisation of the population.
	Secondly, an approach that considers timetabling problems as multicriteria
	decision problems is presented. Thirdly, we discuss a case-based
	reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve new
	timetabling problems. Finally, we outline some new research ideas
	and directions in the field of timetabling. The overall aim of these
	research directions is to explore approaches that can operate at
	a higher level of generality than is currently possible.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a real-time stereo vision system that is required
	to support high-level object based tasks in a tele-operated environment.
	Stereo vision is computationally expensive, due to having to find
	corresponding pixels. Correlation is a fast, standard way to solve
	the correspondence problem. This paper analyses the behaviour of
	correlation based stereo to find ways to improve its quality while
	maintaining its real-time suitability. Three methods are suggested.
	Two of them aim to improve the disparity image especially at depth
	discontinuities, while one targets the identification of possible
	errors in general. Results are given on real stereo images with ground
	truth. A comparison with five standard correlation methods is provided.
	All proposed algorithms are described in detail and performance issues
	and optimisation are discussed. Finally, performance results of individual
	parts of the stereo algorithm are shown, including rectification,
	filtering and correlation using all proposed methods. The implemented
	system shows that errors of simple stereo correlation, especially
	in object border regions, can be reduced in real-time using non-specialised
	computer hardware.},

	solve problems arising in the areas of scheduling and timetabling.
	However, the classical genetic algorithm paradigm is not well equipped
	to handle the conflict between objectives and constraints that typically
	occurs in such problems. In order to overcome this, successful implementations
	frequently make use of problem specific knowledge. This paper is
	concerned with the development of a GA for a nurse rostering problem
	at a major UK hospital. The structure of the constraints is used
	as the basis for a co-evolutionary strategy using cooperating sub-populations.
	Problem specific knowledge is also used to define a system of incentives
	and disincentives, and a complementary mutation operator. Empirical
	results based on 52 weeks of live data show how these features are
	able to improve an unsuccessful canonical GA to the point where it
	is able to provide a practical solution to the problem.},

	An example is given to illustrate the retrieval, re-use and adaptation
	of structured cases. The results from our experiments show the effectiveness

	has provided very good results in certain scheduling problems. The
	resulting algorithm from this hybrid approach has been termed a Memetic
	Algorithm. This paper investigates the use of a memetic algorithm
	for the thermal generator maintenance scheduling problem. The local
	search operators alone have been found (in earlier work by the authors
	and others) to produce good quality results. The main purpose of
	this paper is to discover whether a memetic approach can produce
	better results. We describe the approach taken and highlight the
	variety of local search algorithms that were employed. We compare
	the memetic algorithms with a variety of algorithms that include
	the local search operators on their own and a range of algorithms
	that apply the local search operator to randomly generated solutions.
	We see that, for the problems tested, the memetic algorithms produce
	better quality solutions (although they do take more time about it).
	Of course, in practice, for a problem like this, the time taken to
	produce a solution is not a major issue. What is far more important
	is the quality of the solution. We conclude that the most effective
	method (of the ones tested here) is a memetic approach that employs
	a tabu-search operator.},

  abstract = {Intelligent systems are increasing being deployed in medicine and
	healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology
	for evaluating such systems. Potentially, Receiver Operating Characteristic
	(ROC) analysis could form a basis for objective evaluation of intelligent
	medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied
	to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems.
	Firstly, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory
	with existing methods. Secondly, many existing ROC methods use parametric
	assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected.
	Thirdly, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular,
	clinically meaningful, points on the curve, than on global indexes
	such as the area under the curve which is commonly used. A novel,
	robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles,
	that calculates the probability distribution for each point on a
	ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced
	as contours on the probability distribution. The theoretical work
	has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied
	to two real-world examples of ROC analysis taken from the literature
	(classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic
	diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real
	cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be
	enhanced. We illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance
	from analysis of ROC probability distributions and 95 percent confidence
	boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating
	probability distributions, and provides an accurate and robust method
	of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for small samples
	sizes typical of intelligent medical systems. It is conjectured that,
	potentially, the method could be extended to determine risks associated
	with the deployment of intelligent medical systems in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {The combination of local search operators, problem specific information
	and a genetic algorithm has provided very good results in certain
	scheduling problems, particularly in timetabling and maintenance
	scheduling problems.
	
	The resulting algorithm from this hybrid approach has been termed
	a Memetic Algorithm. This paper investigates the use of such an algorithm
	for the scheduling of transmission line maintenance for a known problem
	that has been addressed in the literature using a combination of
	a genetic algorithm and greedy optimisers. This problem is concerned
	with the scheduling of maintenance for an electricity transmission
	network where every transmission line must be maintained once within
	a specified time period. The objective is to avoid situations where
	sections of the network are disconnected, and to minimise the overloading
	of lines which are in service. In this paper we look at scheduling
	maintenance for the South Wales region of the national transmission
	network. We present and discuss, in some detail, a memetic algorithm
	that incorporates local search operators including tabu search and
	simulated annealing. A comparison is made both with the results from
	previous work, and against a selection of optimising techniques.
	The approach presented in this paper shows a significant improvement
	over previously published results on previously tackled problems.
	We also present results on another problem which has not been tackled
	in the literature but which is closer to the real world maintenance
	scheduling problems faced by such companies as The National Grid
	Company plc using the South Wales region.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory provide an important framework for
	representing and managing imprecision and uncertainty in medical
	expert systems, but the need remains to optimise such systems to
	enhance performance. This paper presents a general technique for
	optimizing fuzzy models in fuzzy expert systems by simulated annealing
	and N-dimensional hill climbing simplex method. The application of
	the technique to a fuzzy expert system for the interpretation of
	the acid-base balance of blood in the umbilical cord of new born
	infants is presented. The Spearman Rank Order Correlation statistic
	was used to assess and to compare the performance of a commercially
	available crisp expert system, an initial fuzzy expert system and
	a tuned fuzzy expert system with experienced clinicians. Results
	showed that without tuning, the performance of the crisp system was
	significantly better (correlation of 0.80) than the fuzzy expert
	system (correlation of 0.67). The performance of the tuned fuzzy
	expert system was better than the crisp system and effectively indistinguishable
	from the clinicians (correlation of 0.93) on training data, and was
	the best of the expert systems on validation data. Unlike most applications
	of fuzzy logic, where all fuzzy sets have normalised heights of unity,
	in this application it was found that a reduction in the height of
	some fuzzy sets was effective in enhancing performance. This suggests
	that the height of fuzzy sets may be a generally useful parameter
	in tuning fuzzy expert systems.},

  abstract = {An assessment of neonatal outcome may be obtained from analysis of
	blood in the umbilical cord of an infant immediately after delivery.
	This can provide information on the health of the newborn infant,
	guide requirements for neonatal care, and is recommended practice
	of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. However,
	there are problems with the technique. Samples frequently contain
	errors in one or more of the important parameters, preventing accurate
	interpretation and many clinical staff lack the expert knowledge
	required to interpret error-free results. In this paper the development
	and implementation of an expert system to overcome these difficulties
	is described. The expert system validates results, provides a textual
	interpretation and archives all results to database for audit, research
	and medico-legal purposes. The system has now been in routine clinical
	use for over three years in Plymouth, and has also been installed
	in several other hospitals in the UK. Results are presented in which
	the types and frequency of errors are established and the user acceptance
	of the system is determined.},

	one. In the UK, the recent growth in student numbers and the adoption
	of modular degree structures by many institutions has made scheduling
	of university courses and exams an even bigger problem than it used
	to be. In this paper we will discuss automatic timetable generation.
	We will consider the use of traditional methods such as graph colouring
	and of advanced modern methods such as the application of genetic

  abstract = {The problem of constructing an automated system for use with timetabling
	is a particularly well known one. Many programs exist for this task
	but perform well only in particular isolated environments. We are
	currently developing a general system able to cope with the ever
	changing requirements of large educational institutions. In this
	paper, we present the methods and techniques behind such a system.
	We present graph colouring and room allocation algorithms and show
	how the two can be combined together to provide the basis of a flexible
	and widely applicable timetabling system. We also discuss, in some
	detail, how several common timetabling features can be handled within
	the system. We intend to overcome the problems of intractability
	by producing a spreadsheet type system that the user can guide in
	an informed and useful way. This gives the user control of the search
	and the possibility of bactracking where no reasonable solution is
	found, while still letting the heuristic algorithms do the hard work.
	Such an approach cannot guarantee an optimal solution but it can
	guarantee a solution the user is happy with. It is safe to assume
	that any user addressing a timetabling problem in an University environment
	has some idea of the timetable required and is qualified to judge
	whether a solution is suitable or not.},

	cord blood sampling, to determine the ranges for pH, pCO2 and Base
	Deficit and to examine the relationships of these parameters between
	cord vessels. Design An observational study of umbilical cord artery
	and vein blood gas results. Setting A large district general hospital
	in the UK. Subjects One thousand nine hundred and forty-two cord
	results from 2013 consecutive pregnancies of 34 weeks or more gestation,
	monitored by fetal scalp electrode during labour. Results Only 1448
	(74.6 percent) of the 1942 supposedly paired samples had validated
	pH and pCO2 data both from an artery and the vein; 54 (2.8 percent)
	had only one blood sample available, 90 (4.6 percent) had an error
	in the pH or pCO2 of one vessel and in 350 (18 percent) pairs the
	differences between vessels indicated that they were not sampled
	from artery and vein as intended. Only 60 percent of the cases with
	an arterial pH less than 7.05 had evidence of a metabolic acidosis
	(base deficit in the extracellular fluid 10 mmol/l or more). Of all
	the cases, 2.5 percent had a venous-arterial pH difference greater
	than 0.22 units. Conclusions Both artery and vein cord samples must
	be taken and the results screened to ensure separate vessels have
	been sampled. Interpretation of the results requires the examination
	of pCO2 and base deficit of the extracellular fluid from each vessel
	as well as the pH. Confusion about the value of cord gas measurements
	may be due to the use of erroneous data and inadequate definitions
	of acidosis which do not differentiate between respiratory and metabolic
	components.},
