   abstract = {Adding runtime support for BPEL extensions typically requires (1) reacting to
      navigation events from a BPEL engine executing an extended process model and
      (2) affecting the engine’s navigation behavior based on external triggers. This
      is usually achieved in a proprietary way for each engine and for each
      extension.
      
      In this paper, we provide a systematic approach to controlling and reacting to
      process behavior as well as growing the set of supported control points, thus
      enabling support for multiple application domains in a composable manner in a
      BPEL engine. The framework presented in this paper (1) enables a BPEL engine to
      support extensions, even on existing BPEL processes, and (2) allows developers
      to create pluggable extension implementations that can be reused across
      multiple BPEL engines. An implementation of the approach is presented and used
      in three different projects that need widely differing extended BPEL
      capabilities.},

   abstract = {During the construction of service-oriented architectures, service modelers
      concern themselves with the characteristics of good services and how such
      services can be designed. For instance, they look for advice regarding
      interface granularity and criteria to assess whether existing software assets
      are fit for reuse in service-oriented environments. There are no
      straightforward answers to such questions – service identification,
      specification and realization techniques are required. Service identification
      and specification are well covered by existing methodologies; for service
      realization, architectural decision models can be leveraged. At present, the
      construction of architectural decision models is an education- and
      labor-intensive undertaking; if such models exist at all, they often are
      isolated from other artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new engineering
      approach to service modeling that leverages reusable architectural decision
      models as its central service realization concept. We outline a multi-level
      decision tree and position it as a prescriptive service realization methodology
      for three engagement types observed in practice. The benefits of service
      engineering with reusable architectural decision models are semiautomatic
      decision identification in analysis models, improved decision making quality,
      and better decision enforcement and risk mitigation capabilities.},

   abstract = {In enterprise application development and other software construction projects,
      a critical success factor is to make sound architectural decisions. Text
      templates and tool support for capturing architectural decisions exist, but
      have failed to reach broad adoption so far. One of the inhibitors we perceived
      on large-scale industry projects is that architectural decision capturing is
      regarded as a retrospective and therefore unwelcome documentation task which
      does not provide any benefit during the original design work. A major problem
      of such a retrospective approach is that the decision rationale is not
      available to decision makers when they identify, make, and enforce decisions.
      Often a large, possibly distributed, community of decision makers is involved
      in these three steps. In this paper, we propose a new conceptual framework for
      proactive decision identification, decision maker collaboration, and decision
      enforcement. Based on a meta model capturing reuse and collaboration aspects
      explicitly, our framework instantiates decision models from requirements models
      and re usable decision templates. These templates capture know ledge gained on
      other projects em ploy ing the same architectural style. As an exemplary
      application of these concepts to service-oriented architecture shows, reusable
      architectural decision models can speed up the decision identification and
      improve the quality of the decision making. Reusable architectural decision
      models can also simplify the exchange of architecture design rationale within
      and between project teams, and expose decision out come as model transformation
      parameters in model-driven software development.},

   abstract = {We present a technique to enhance control-flow analysis of business process
      models. The technique considerably speeds up the analysis and improves the
      diagnostic information that is given to the user to fix control-flow errors.
      The technique consists of two parts: Firstly, the process model is decomposed
      into single-entry-single-exit (SESE) fragments, which are usually substantially
      smaller than the original process. This decomposition is done in linear time.
      Secondly, each fragment is analyzed in isolation using a fast heuristic that
      can analyze many of the fragments occurring in practice. Any remaining
      fragments that are not covered by the heuristic can then be analyzed using any
      known complete analysis technique.
      
      We used our technique in a case study with more than 340 real business
      processes modeled with the IBM WebSphere Business Modeler. The results suggest
      that control-flow analysis of many real process models is feasible without
      significant delay (less than a second). Therefore, control-flow analysis could
      be used frequently during editing time, which allows errors to be caught at
      earliest possible time.},

      These processes are often long-running. Therefore WS-BPEL employs a
      long-running transaction model to handle the internal transactions of a WS-BPEL
      process. WS-Business Activity (WS-BA) is a set of mechanisms and protocols to

      is supervised by an external coordinator. In addition our approach allows
      external partners to participate in these modified internal WS-BA transactions

      the development of such applications is cumbersome, in particular the
      implementation of their often complex control flow. To ease the development of
      context-aware applications we present the concept of context-aware workflows.
      Thereafter we present an implementation of these concepts based on a standard
      workflow language. Context-aware workflows are not only interesting for the
      development of context-aware applications, but also enable workflow technology
      to be applied in new domains that are process oriented and yet not supported by
      workflow systems like production processes in the manufacturing industry. The
      concept of context-aware workflows is a first approach that enables modeling

   abstract = {The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is a language to orchestrate web
      services into a single business process. In a choreography view, several
      processes are interconnected and their interaction behavior is described from a
      global perspective. This paper shows how BPEL can be extended for defining
      choreographies. The proposed extensions (BPEL4Chor) distinguish between three
      aspects: (i) participant behavior descriptions, i.e. control flow dependencies
      in each participant, (ii) the participant topology, i.e. the existing
      participants and their interconnection using message links and (iii)
      participant groundings, i.e. concrete configurations for data formats and port
      types. As BPEL itself is used unchanged, the extensions facilitate a seamless
      integration between service choreographies and orchestrations. The suitability
      of the extensions is validated by assessing their support for the Service
      Interaction Patterns.},

      Firstly, we suggest combining existing control flow validation techniques with

      techniques can be used to find implementations, e.g. services (or combinations
      of services), for the implementation of process activities at modeling time.
      The discovered implementations allow for mapping the process steps to the IT
      infrastructure according to several strategies during process configuration,
      which helps clearly separating modeling from configuration concerns.
      Furthermore, a new way of testing executable process models is suggested.},

   abstract = {Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), an emerging paradigm for designing and
      implementing business collaborations within and across organisational
      boundaries, are currently of interest to both software vendors and scientists.
      In this paradigm, the functionality provided by business applications is
      encapsulated within web services: software components described at a semantic
      level, which can be invoked by application programs or by other services
      through a stack of internet standards including HTTP, XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI.
      Once deployed, web services provided by various organisations can be
      interconnected in order to implement business collaborations, leading to
      composite web services. Ultimately, these composed services are there to
      support business processes. Therefore, the relationship between business
      process management, workflow technology and SOAs is highly relevant. This is
      illustrated by the interest in the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL)
      standard. Therefore, this Special Issue of the International Journal of

   abstract = {Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architecture paradigm targeting
      integration of applications within and across enterprise boundaries. It has
      gathered research and industry acceptance and has given an enormous impetus to
      the business process management technology. Web service (WS) technology is one
      implementation of the SOA paradigm. It enables seamless integration of new and
      legacy applications through a stack of standardized composable specifications.
      WS orchestration is facilitated by the Business Process Execution Language
      which provides a recursive service composition model. While the programming
      model the WS technology provides is very flexible, a major deficiency is the
      need to discover services implementing a particular abstract interface, whereas
      functional similarities of services are disregarded. The Semantic Web Service
      technologies, like Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) and Web Ontology
      Language for Services have been developed with the purpose of eliminating these
      deficiencies by enabling service discovery based on functional and
      non-functional properties. The paper aims to focus on these issues. This paper
      presents a list of requirements that business processes impose on SOA
      applications. It analyzes the support that WSMO/Web Service Model eXecution
      environment (WSMX) provides to address these requirements and compares it with
      the support enabled by the WS specification stack. The paper identifies major
      flaws in the WSMO model and its reference implementation with respect to
      business process support. The paper recommends possible solutions for
      eliminating the lack of needed features on behalf of WSMO/WSMX. It presents in
      detail how to enable asynchronous stateful communication among WSMO WS and
      partner-based WS discovery by extending the WSMO model. Additionally, it
      extends the API of the reference implementation to facilitate the execution of
      services communicating asynchronously.},

      well-known ontology repositories, including native stores and database based
      stores, and highlight strengths and limitations of each store. We take Minerva
      as an example to analyze ontology storage in databases in depth, as well as to
      discuss efficient indexes for scaling up ontology repositories. We then discuss
      a scalable reasoning method for handling expressive ontologies, as well as
      summarize other similar approaches. We will subsequently delve into the details
      of one particular ontology language based on Description Logics called WSML-DL
      and show that reasoning with this language can be done by a transformation from
      WSML-DL to OWL DL and support all main DL-specific reasoning tasks. Finally, we
      illustrate reasoning and its relevance by showing a reasoning example in a
      practical business context by presenting the Semantic Business Process
      Repository (SBPR) for systemical management of semantic business process
      models. As part of this, we analyze the main requirements on a such a
      repository. We then compare different approaches for storage mechanisms for
      this purpose and show how a RDBMS in combination with the IRIS inference engine
