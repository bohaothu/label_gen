    We show that unseen words account for a
    large part of the translation error when moving
    to new domains. Using an extension of
    a recent approach to mining translations from
    comparable corpora (Haghighi et al., 2008),
    we are able to find translations for otherwise
    OOV terms. We show several approaches
    to integrating such translations into a phrasebased
    translation system, yielding consistent
    improvements in translations quality (between
    0.5 and 1.5 Bleu points) on four domains and
    two language pairs.
