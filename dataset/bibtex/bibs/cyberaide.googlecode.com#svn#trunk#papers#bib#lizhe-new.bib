	abstract = {The design, implementation, and performance of the Condor scheduling system, which operates in a workstation environment, are presented. The system aims to maximize the utilization of workstations with as little interference as possible between the jobs it schedules and the activities of the people who own workstations. It identifies idle workstations and schedules background jobs on them. When the owner of a workstation resumes activity at a station, Condor checkpoints the remote job running on the station and transfers it to another workstation. The system guarantees that the job will eventually complete, and that very little, if any, work will be performed more than once. A performance profile of the system is presented that is based on data accumulated from 23 stations during one month},

It is the OpenID to resolve these burdensome. The OpenID provides the single sign-on service which a user can be authenticated in several Web sites by submitting the password of OpenID to authentication server only once. In this paper, we analyze the single sign-on in OpenID and show an experiment of vulnerability of OpenID.},

	abstract = {Applications hosted in today's data centers suffer from internal fragmentation of resources, rigidity, and bandwidth constraints imposed by the architecture of the network connecting the data center's servers. Conventional architectures statically map web services to Ethernet VLANs, each constrained in size to a few hundred servers owing to control plane overheads. The IP routers used to span traffic across VLANs and the load balancers used to spray requests within a VLAN across servers are realized via expensive customized hardware and proprietary software. Bisection bandwidth is low, severly constraining distributed computation Further, the conventional architecture concentrates traffic in a few pieces of hardware that must be frequently upgraded and replaced to keep pace with demand - an approach that directly contradicts the prevailing philosophy in the rest of the data center, which is to scale out (adding more cheap components) rather than scale up (adding more power and complexity to a small number of expensive components).},
