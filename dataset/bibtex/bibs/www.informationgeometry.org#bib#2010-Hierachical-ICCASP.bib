 Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are a convenient and essential tool for the estimation
 of probability density functions. Although GMMs are used in many research domains
 from image processing to machine learning, this statistical mixture modeling is
 usually complex and further need to be simplified. In this paper, we present a GMM
 simplification method based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Our method allows
 one to first to quickly compute a compact version of the initial GMM, and second
 to automatically learn the optimal number of components of the simplified GMM. Using
 the framework of Bregman divergences, this simplification algorithm, although presented
 here for GMMs, is suitable for any mixture of exponential families.
