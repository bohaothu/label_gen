Wilbur exposes the RDF data model as a frame-based representation system; an object-oriented view of frames is adopted, and RDF data is integrated with the host language by addressing issues of input/output, data structure compatibility, and error signaling. Through seamless integration we have achieved a programming system well suited for building Semantic Web applications. },

@inproceedings{stuckenschmidt:partially-shared-ontologies,
	Abstract = {In has been argued that ontologies play a key role in multiagent communication because they provide and define a shared vocabulary to be used in the course of communication. In real-life scenarios, however, the situation where two agents completely share a vocabulary is rather an exception. More often, each agent uses its own vocabulary specified in a private ontology that is not known by other agents. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem for the situation, where agents share at least parts of their vocabulary. We argue that the assumption of a partially shared vocabulary is valid and sketch an approach for re-formulating terms from the private part of an agent's ontology into a shared part thus enabling other agents to understand them. We further describe how the approach can be implemented using existing technology and proof the correctness of the re-formulation with respect to the semantics of the ontology-language DAML+OIL. },

@techreport{fikes:domain-specific,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the methodology for developing intelligent systems that promotes building knowledge bases by assembling reusable ontologies and knowledge base modules from on-line libraries to include associating domain-specific reasoners with reusable ontologies and incorporating such reasoners into an intelligent system as part of the knowledge assembly process.  The methodology is based on an existing hybrid reasoning architecture that provides an API and functional specification for special-purpose reasoners.  We illustrate the methodology by describing a reusable time ontology and an associated set of domain-specific
reasoners for the vocabulary of relations defined in that ontology.  The ontology is designed to upport large-scale knowledge system applications by providing an easily-understandable, flexible, formally defined, and effective means of representing knowledge about time and the standard components and properties of calendars.  The domain-specific reasoners support ``telling'' and ``asking'' operations for
temporal ordering relations on time points and the Allen relations on time intervals.},

OWL-QL is a formal language and precisely specifies the semantic relationships among a query, a query answer, and the knowledge base(s) used to produce the answer.  Unlike standard database and Web query languages, OWL-QL supports query-answering dialogues in which the answering agent may use automated reasoning methods to derive answers to queries, as well as dialogues in which the knowledge to be used in answering a query may be in multiple knowledge bases on the Semantic Web, and/or where those knowledge bases are not specified by the querying agent.  In this setting, the set of answers to a query may be of unpredictable size and may require an unpredictable amount of time to compute.},

In this paper we show how ontologies can be contextualized, thus acquiring certain useful properties that a pure shared approach cannot provide. We say that an ontology is contextualized or, also, that it is a contextual ontology, when its contents are kept local, and therefore not shared with other ontologies, and mapped with the contents of other ontologies via explicit (context) mappings. The result is Context OWL (C-OWL), a language whose syntax and semantics have been obtained by extending the OWL syntax and semantics to allow for the representation of contextual ontologies.},

@inproceedings{mandell:adapting-bpel4ws,
	Abstract = {Towards the ultimate goal of seamless interaction among networked programs and devices, industry has developed orchestration and process modeling languages such as XLANG, WSFL, and recently BPEL4WS. Unfortunately, these efforts leave us a long way from seamless interoperation. Researchers in the Semantic Web community have taken up this challenge proposing top-down approaches to achieve aspects of Web Service interoperation. Unfortunately, many of these efforts have been disconnected from emerging industry standards, particularly in process modeling. In this paper we take a bottom-up approach to integrating Semantic Web technology into Web services. Building on BPEL4WS, we present integrated Semantic Web technology for automating customized, dynamic binding of Web services together with interoperation through semantic translation. We discuss the value of semantically enriched service interoperation and demonstrate how our framework accounts for user-defined constraints while gaining potentially successful execution pathways in a practically motivated example. Finally, we provide an analysis of the forward-looking limitations of frameworks like BPEL4WS, and suggest how such specifications might embrace semantic technology at a fundamental level to work towards fully automated Web service interoperation. },

@misc{revelli:role-of-agents,
	Abstract = {What is an intelligent agent? This apparently anodyne question provokes a great deal of debate on and off the Internet.  While simplifying to the maximum, we find on one side the people that almost regard intelligent agents as human beings, and on the other those that consider them to be no more than simple software programs.  {\par} Jacques Ferber proposes the following definition: `` Something can be called an agent if it is a physical or virtual entity that:   {\par}{\newline}is able to act in an environment,   {\newline}can communicate directly with other agents,   {\newline}is driven by a group of tendencies [...  ],   {\newline}has its own resources,   {\newline}is able to perceive its environment (but in a limited way),   {\newline}has only a partial representation of this environment (and possibly none),   {\newline}has skills and offers services,   {\newline}may be able to reproduce,   {\newline}whose behavior aims to satisfy its objectives, by taking account of the resources and skills that it possesses, and according to its perception, of its representations and the communications that it receives.''{\par}{\par}{\newline} On the other hand, many regard an agent as an ``entity authorized to act in the name of someone else''.  Such a definition puts an intelligent agent in the same category as a real estate agent, a security agent, or a sales agent...  Consequently, the distinction between an intelligent agent, and basic software remains very unclear.  {\par} In spite of its limits, this vision constitutes a good starting point for a definition that would be sufficiently realistic, without being too limited.  We can therefore affirm that an intelligent agent is a software entity that has its own attributes, and that acts with the goal of performing a certain number of tasks in the name of another entity (another agent or a person).  {\par}{\newline}Autonomy: an agent is able to take initiative in an autonomous way and it exerts control over its actions.  In other words, it has the capacity to define its own objectives and achieve them without human supervision.    {\newline}Capable of collaboration:  an agent is able to interact and cooperate with other agents or human beings in order to complete its tasks.    {\newline}Capable of learning:  an agent is able to adapt to the needs of its user by analyzing its past actions.    {\newline}Goal-oriented:  an agent accepts precise ``human requests'' and decides how to satisfy them.    {\newline}Flexibility:  the actions of an agent are not entirely pre-established and defined; it is able to choose what it will do, and in which order, according to the external environment.    {\newline}Self-starting:  contrary to traditional software, an agent can decide to start an action at a precise moment, according to the external environment,    {\newline}Individual character: an agent has a well-defined personality and its own ``emotional state'',    {\newline}Mobility: an agent is able to move from one system to another and through various architectures and platforms, etc.    {\par}{\par}{\newline} But when should we speak about intelligent agents?  Do they have to have all, or just some, of these attributes?    {\par} The debate is interminable, perhaps insoluble, and not of much interest to the end-user.  Many companies, for obvious marketing reasons, make use of this terminological blur to qualify their software as an intelligent agent.  What is clear is that, as of this date, on the Internet, no agent known as ``intelligent'' has all of these attributes.  Consequently, trying to define an ``intelligent'' agent creates an oxymoron.  Between the theoretical principles of artificial intelligence and concrete reality that one observes on the Internet, the difference can be great.    {\par} That said, as Pierre-Alain Le Cheviller points out, ``these agents, if they don't use the same technology [as artificial intelligence], have the same objectives and can be very useful tools for information professionals''.  {\par} For this reason, instead of speaking about intelligent agents in a broad sense, it is undoubtedly preferable to speak about software agents or better still to refer to the tasks that these assistants are intended to perform: therefore we will talk about search agents, monitoring agents, e-commerce agents, etc.    {\par} An extract from ``Strategic Internet Intelligence'' (Dunod, 2000){\newline}   With the author's agreement.  },

	Abstract = {The advent of software agents gave rise to much discussion of just what such an agent is, and of how they differ from programs in general. Here we propose a formal definition of an autonomous agent which clearly distinguishes a software agent from just any program. We also offer the beginnings of a natural kinds taxonomy of autonomous agents, and discuss possibilities for further classification. Finally, we discuss subagents and multiagent systems. },
