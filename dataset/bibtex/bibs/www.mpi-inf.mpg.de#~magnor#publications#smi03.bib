		  dynamic scene from a handful of video streams may be
		  considered one of the most challenging, but at the
		  same time also most auspicious tasks in contemporary
		  computer graphics and computer vision research. The
		  anticipation of revolutionary new applications such
		  as interactive 3D television broadcasts motivates
		  the ongoing work on free-viewpoint video
		  rendering. This paper aims at giving a
		  state-of-progress report on this lively research
		  endeavour. Different acquisition setups and on-line
		  reconstruction approaches are exemplified. Yielding
		  interactive frame rates, depth map-based techniques,
		  polyhedral as well as volumetric visual hull
		  reconstruction approaches, and combined methods
		  employing visual hull-guided depth map estimation
		  are presented. The experience gained with these
		  approaches allows identifying future research
		  directions towards real-time analysis and
		  high-quality synthesis of dynamic, real-world
		  scenes."  }
