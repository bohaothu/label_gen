   abstract = {	  Most of the  solutions proposed to the Yale shooting
		  problem    have either   introduced new nonmonotonic
		  reasoning    methods (generally  involving  temporal
		  priorities)  or  completely reformulated  the domain
		  axioms  to represent   causality explicitely.   This
		  paper presents a new solution based on the idea that
		  since the abnormality  predicate takes a situational
		  argument,  it is important for   the meanings of the
		  situations  to  be held  consistent over the various
		  models  being compared.   This is accomplished  by a
		  simple  change in  circumscription policy: when {\em
		  Ab} is circumscribed, {\em Result} (rather than {\em
		  Holds}) is allowed to vary.  in addition, we need an
		  axiom  ensuring  that every  consistent situation is
		  included   in  the  domain  of   discourse. Ordinary
		  circumscription    will then produce the intuitively
		  correct answer.   Beyond its conceptual  simplicity,
		  the solution  proposed here has aditional advantages
		  over previous approaches.  Unlike  the approach that
		  uses  temporal priorities,  it can support reasoning
		  backward in time as well as  forward. And unlike the
		  causal  approach, it can  handle ramifications  in a
		  natural manner.},

		  spatial  relations  for pairs of  regions, which are
		  all  logically  defined    from two  primitive  (but
		  axiomatised)  notions.  The  first primitive is  the
		  notion of two regions  being connected, which allows
		  eight mutually    exhaustive  and  pairwise disjoint
		  relations  to  be defined.  The second  primitive is
		  the  convex hull of a region  which allows many more

		  purpose inference mechanisms for reasoning with this
		  formalism, both statically and over time and discuss
		  how  these  can be  used   to perform  tasks such as
		  spatial  database querying  and  integrity checking,

		  to  Kuipers'   QSIM algorithm,  but  differs  in the

		  the  envisioning  process.  The  program  implements
		  part  of an axiomatic,  first  order theory that has

		  the  modelled domain and  is expressed in the theory
		  as  sets  of distinct topological  relations holding
		  betwen sets of objects.   These form the qualitative
		  states  in  the  underlying theory   and simulation.
		  Processes  in the   theory  are  represented  in the
		  envisionment as paths in  the envisionment tree.  We
		  show the feasability  of this particular ontology in
		  the  implementation  of a simulation program derived
		  from a  logic-based formal theory.  A description of

		  phagocytosis and exocytosis  - two processes used by
		  unicellular  organisms    for   garnering  food  and
		  expelling waste  material respectively.  Finally  we

		  theorem prover by mapping program transformations to
		  logical inferences in the modelling theory.  } }

		  automatic route-guidance  system. On   all    trips,
		  drivers were  given  the opportunity  to plan  their
		  routes using a street-map, and making whatever notes
		  or sketches   they  chose.  On  certain   trips they
		  received advice via  a speech-synthesizer.  This was
		  supposedly from  the automatic guidance  system, but
		  in fact triggered by the experimenter.  As expected,
		  both guidance and  rudimentary  familiarity with the
		  network built  up   during the  study   resulted  in
		  reduced   journey  times,  and brought the  drivers'
		  routes closer  to the  recommendations given via the
		  speech  synthesizer. En-route halts and U-turns were
		  also    reduced. Observation  and drivers'  comments
		  indicated   that route-choice    criteria        are
		  context-dependent,    and     that      errors    in
		  route-following    cause     considerable  delay and
		  frustration to unguided drivers in unfamiliar areas.

		  method --- has been   broadly accepted as the  right
		  approach. This paper introduces a new method, called
		  {\em    sweeping   presumptions},  for     modelling
		  nonmonotonic reasoning.  The main goal of  the paper
		  is     to provide  an example-driven,  non-technical
		  introduction  to the method of sweeping presumtions,
		  and  thereby    make  it  plausible   that  sweeping
		  presumptions can be usefully applied to the problems
		  of  nonmonotonic  reasoning.  The paper discusses  a
		  representative sample of  examples tat have appeared
		  in   the literature on  nonmonotonic  reasoning, and
		  discusses them from  the point  of view of  sweeping
		  presumptions.}  }

		  formula   is  equivalent   to    a    first    order
		  formula.   After this, we   establish that  a set of

		  undecidable  to  tell  whether   such  formulae have

		  states  in  the  underlying theory  and  simulation.
		  Processes in the   theory  are  represented  in  the
		  envisionment as paths  in the envisionment tree.  We
		  show the feasability  of this particular ontology in
		  the  implementation  of a simulation program derived
		  from a  logic-based formal theory.  A description of
		  the algorithm is  given and the whole is illustrated
		  with an example  of  a simulation of the   processes
		  phagocytosis and exocytosis -  two processes used by
		  unicellular   organisms  for  garnering food     and
		  expelling  waste material   respectively. Finally we
		  show how the program can be  viewed as a specialized
		  theorem prover by mapping program transformations to
		  logical inferences in the modelling theory.  }

   abstract = {   This paper  presents a uniform semantic treatment of
		  nonmonotonic inference  operations  that   allow for
		  inferences  from  infinite  sets of  premises.   The
		  semantics is formulated  in terms  of {\em selection
		  functions}   and is a   generalization of   the {\em
		  preferential entailment} semantics of Shoham (1987),
		  (1988), Kraus,   Lehman,    and Magidor (1990)   and
		  Makinson (1990) (to  appear).  A selection functions
		  picks out  from  a  given  set  of  possible  states
		  (worlds, situations,  models) a subset consisting of
		  those states that   are, in  some sense,   the  most
		  preferred ones. A   proposition $\alpha$  is a  {\em
		  nonmonotonic  consequence} of  a set of propositions
		  $\Gamma$     iff   $\alpha$     holds  in   all  the
		  most-preferred  $\Gamma$-states.  In the  literature
		  on revealed preference theory, there are a number of
		  well-known  theorems concerning the representability
		  of   selection   functions,   satisfying     certain
		  properties,  in   terms  of   underlying  preference
		  relations.  Such  theorems  are  utilized e to  give
		  corresponding   representation        theorems   for
		  nonmonotonic   inference operations.  At  the end of
		  the   paper,    the connection  between nonmonotonic
		  inference  and  belief  revision,  in  the  sense of
		  Alchour\`{o}n,   G\"{a}rdenfors,   and Makinson,  is
		  explored. In this connection, {\em infinitary belief
		  revision operations}, that allow for the revision of
		  a theory    with   a   possibly  infinite   set   of
		  propositions, are introduced    and    characterized
		  axiomatically.  several   semantic    representation
		  theorems are proved  for operations of  this kind.},

   ABSTRACT = {	  This  paper  deals   with   methods    of   faithful
		  transformations between logical  systems.    Several
		  methods  for   developing transformations of logical
		  formulae   are  defined     which eliminate unwanted
		  properties  from   axiom    systems without   losing
		  theorems.  The  elementary  examples we present  are
		  permutation,    transitivity, equivalence   relation
		  properties of   predicates and congruence properties
		  of functions.   Various translations between logical
		  systems    are    shown  to    be    instances    of
		  K-transformations,  for example the transition  from
		  relational  to functional translation of modal logic
		  into  predicate logic, the transition from axiomatic
		  specifications of   logics via    unary  provability
		  relations to a binary consequence relations, and the
		  development  of   neighbourhood       semantics  for
		  nonclassical propositional logics.}

   ABSTRACT = {	  Given  a   Hilbert    style   specification   of   a
		  propositional extension   of  standard propositional
		  logic, it is  shown how  the basic model   theoretic
		  semantics can   be  obtained from   the  axioms   by
		  syntactic transformations. The  transformations  are
		  designed in such a  way that they eliminate  certain
		  derived  theorems from the Hilbert axiomatization by
		  turning them into tautologies.}

		  this theory various classification hierarchies   are

		  The nodes  of these lattices correspond  to concepts

		  We usually think  of plans  as linear  sequences  of
		  actions. This is because  plans are usually executed
		  one  step  at a time.  But  plans themselves are not
		  constrained by limitations  of linearity. This paper
		  describes a  new  information  structure, called the
		  procedyral net, that represents a  plan as a partial
		  ordering  of  actions    with respect  to  time.  By
		  avoiding premature commitments to a particular order
		  for  achieving subgoals,  a  problem solving  system
		  using   this representation   can  deal easily   and
		  directly  with   problems that   are  otherwise very
		  difficult to solve.}, owner = {john} }

        brings about an event which terminates it. For example, when
        the increasing level of water in a sink reaches the overflow,
        it ceases to increase. the formulation is applied to a simple

		  1969, the  so-called   frame problem  has  been  the
		  subject of much  fascination and debate. Although it
		  was defined in  the narrow context of  the situation
		  calculus, a   specific  temporal  formalism,  it was
		  clear from   the   start  that  it  is   in  fact  a
		  manifestation of some fundamental problem intemporal

		  identify the general    form of certain  classes  of
		  problems that arise in formal temporal reasoning. We
		  argue that problems  such as the frame problem arise
		  from   the conflicting    desires   to  reason  both
		  rigorously  and  efficiently about  the future. This
		  conflict   does   not   depend  on   the  particular
		  underlying temporal     formalism. In particular, we
		  identify two formalism-independent problems,  called
		  the  qualification     problem  and  the   exetended
		  prediction    problem,   which  subsume   the  frame
		  problem. To illustrate  that these new  problems are

		  considerations   that  traditionally fall within the
		  scope of computer science in general, and artificial
		  intelligence in particular,  sheds new  light on the
		  subject of  causation.  It  is argued that  adopting
		  causal   notions can    be  viewed    as  filling  a
		  computational   need.   They   allow  reasoning with
		  relatively efficient  methods for  reasoning   about
		  those representations. Specifically, it is  proposed
		  that   causal reasoning   is   intimately  bound  to
		  nonmonotonic  reasoning.  An account of causation is
		  offered   that  relies  upon  this  connection   and
		  compares the proposal  to  previous  accounts within

		  components called beliefs,  choices,   capabilities,
		  comitments, and possibly others; for this reason the
		  state  of   an agent   is   called its  {\em  mental
		  state}.  The  mental  state  of  agents  is captured
		  formally  in  an  extension  of   standard epistemic
		  logics:  beside  temporalizing  the  knowledge   and
		  belief    operators, AOP   introduces operators  for
		  commitment,  choice     and capability.  Agents  are
		  controlled by  {\em  agent programs},  which include
		  primitives for  communicating with other  agents. In
		  the   spirit   of  {\em  speech-act  theory},   each
		  communication  primitive  is   of   a  certain type:
		  informing, requesting,  offering,  and  so on.  This
		  document presents the  concept of AOP, and describes
		  progress made to  date towards realizing it.},

		  by McCarthy to formalize  common sense knowledge and
		  nonmonotonic reasoning  in  general-purpose database
		  and   knowledge  base  systems.     That   is, basic
		  circumscription,   parallel   circumscription    and
		  priority circumscription. Basic circumscription is a
		  special  case  of   parallel circumscription   while
		  parallel  circumscription  is   a  special  case  of
		  priority circumscription.    Lifschitz   has reduced
		  priority     circumscription     into       parallel
		  circumscription,       ie.,   represented   priority
		  circumscription as a  conjunction  of  some parallel
		  circumscription  firmulas. In  this paper,  we  have
		  reduced parallel circumscription      into     basic
		  circumscription under   some   restrictions,    ie.,
		  parallel circumscription of  a Z-conflict free first
		  order logic  formula  can    be represented   as   a
		  conjunction of some basic circumscription formulae.}
