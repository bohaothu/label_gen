   abstract =     "One of the common queries in many database
      applications is finding approximate matches to a given
      query item from a collection of data items. For
      example, given an image database, one may want to
      retrieve all images that are similar to a given query
      image. Distance-based index structures are proposed for
      applications where the distance computations between
      objects of the data domain are expensive (such as
      high-dimensional data) and the distance function is
      metric. In this paper we consider using distance-based
      index structures for similarity queries on large metric
      spaces. We elaborate on the approach that uses
      reference points (vantage points) to partition the data
      space into spherical shell-like regions in a
      hierarchical manner. We introduce the multivantage
      point tree structure (mvp-tree) that uses more than one
      vantage point to partition the space into spherical
      cuts at each level. In answering similarity-based
      queries, the mvp-tree also utilizes the precomputed (at
      construction time) distances between the data points
      and the vantage points.\par We summarize the experiments comparing
      mvp-trees to vp-trees that have a
      similar partitioning strategy, but use only one vantage
      point at each level and do not make use of the
      precomputed distances. Empirical studies show that the
      mvp-tree outperforms the vp-tree by 20\% to 80\% for
      varying query ranges and different distance
      distributions. Next, we generalize the idea of using
      multiple vantage points and discuss the results of
      experiments we have made to see how varying the number
      of vantage points in a node affects affects performance
      and how much is gained in performance by making use of
      precomputed distances. The results show that, after
      all, it may be best to use a large number of vantage
      points in an internal node in order to end up with a
      single directory node and keep as many of the
      precomputed distances as possible to provide more
      efficient filtering during search operations. Finally,
      we provide some experimental results that compare
      mvp-trees with M-trees, which is a dynamic distance-based index
      structure for metric domains.",
