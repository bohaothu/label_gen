  abstract =     {This paper describes the architecture  of DiscMC, an interactive system which supports isosurfacing on regular volume datasets. DiscMC adopts a discretized fitting algorithm that considerably reduces the number of polygons generated by a Marching Cubes-like scheme while presenting shorter running times. The extracted surfaces are composed of polygons lying within a finite number of incidences, thus allowing simple merging of the output facets into large coplanar triangular facets. A pyramidal representation of the volume dataset has been adopted to speed-up isosurface fitting, by avoiding $empty$ volume traversal, and to support multiple level resolution fitting. The system has been implemented in a Unix environment, using a $de facto$ standard graphics library. The functionalities and the user interface of the system are described in detail.}

  abstract =     {In visualization of scattered data, one is often faced with the problem of finding the nearest neighbours of a data site. This task frequently occurs in an advanced stage of the visualization process, where several data structures have been created during run time. Many applications compute a triangulation of the data for their visualization purposes. To take advantage of the previously allocated data structure we propose an algorithm for determining the $k$ nearest neighbours in a triangulated point set. As a benefit, this algorithm dynamically computes exactly as many neighbours as necessary for the specific application and does not assume a particular kind of triangulation. Furthermore, it works in any finite-dimensional, metric affine space.}

Resampling to cubic voxels is possible at the cost of significant increase of data volume and rendering time. We present an algorithm for direct ray tracing of rectilinear grids, which enables the implementation of surface rendering with subvoxel surface detection based on local interpolation, as well as different volume techniques (color compositing, re-projection, maximum intensity projection). Further we present a faster version of the basic algorithm, based on cubic macro-regions assigned to each background voxel. Each macro-region is defined by its chessboard distance to the nearest foreground voxel and can be skipped during the scene traversal. The speed-up is this gained by increasing the step along the ray, maintaining 6-connectivity of the ray in the object vicinity, which is necessary for correct surface detection.}

It presents psychological tests which have been performed in order to find quantitative relationships for this scheme, and discusses why simple numerical relationships may be hard to find.
Our work is  motivated by research into interactive and immersive scientific visualization which pose two opposing demands: maximum image quality at sufficient frame rates. We believe that these two factors also crucial for many other applications, e.g., virtual reality. For this scheme, special focus  is on the user's perception of the system. Three components of Visualization System Quality are identified: Data quality, image quality, and interaction quality. In order to migrate from merely qualitative to a more quantitative model, psychological tests were  performed to measure  the influence of frame rate and rendering mode on the perception on visualized three dimensional vector data. Results of the tests are presented and general suggestions for good perceptual tests are made.
We believe  that the experience we gained will be of benefit to many who are interested in question of visualization system quality.}

All higher  level system functionality is pushed into modular components outside of the kernel, resulting in a rich and powerful environment. For these modular components (called satellites) a uniform interface metaphor for users based on a tray of cards, has been used.

Not only do they permit rapid construction of a display application, but they allow simulation to be incorporated, giving the scientist the opportunity to interact with the calculation as well. However, if these systems are to realise their full potential for problem solving, additional support must be given for the iterative investigation which characterises this activity. This paper will review these systems, identify some of their shortcomings as problem solving environments and describe current work which addresses these deficiencies. An implementation of our ideas for IRIS Explorer system will demonstrate their effectiveness in a study of gas turbine exhaust emissions.}

It is not easy, however, to understand its complex nature that is 'hidden' behind a 'veil' of two probability functions, one associated with the given space of data parameters and the other with the temporal data flow. Our system, named Visual Markov, aims at removing the veil by visualizing the continuous density HMM and displaying its individual states. Moreover, it is able to show the iterative process of HMM training, step after step. In a similar way, also the HMM based classification can be presented. The system is a highly illustrative tool that is well suited both for research and teaching purposes. In the article, we demonstrate its application in the speech recognition domain.}

The motivation behind this work is to provide an intuitive and natural 3D interface such that users will view these objects as tools during the visualization process. To help achieve this goal, the selection of the object tools are derived from expressions commonly used during visualization. For example, &quot;let's paint this (iso)surface red&quot;; &quot;cut away the front part of that volume&quot;; &quot;look at it from this angle&quot;; &quot;you get similar effects from an x-ray photo&quot;; and &quot;let's explore this data set&quot;. In this paper, we also extend the metaphor of cutting planes to allow the users to carve non-planar cross-sectional cuts through their data sets. This extension will directly benefit applications such as medical visualization where one might want to generate curved coronal cross-sections of lumbar spines; and in oceanography where one might want to compare numerical model output against data obtained along non-planar ship tracks.}

The scope of grids under consideration includes structured and unstructured, adaptive and hierarchical, conforming and nonconforming meshes. The functions spaces might be of Lagrangian or Hermitian type with higher polynomial degree and possibly discontinuous over element boundaries. Unfortunately, the rendering tools in scientific visualization are mostly restricted to special data structures which differ substantially from the data formats used in the numerical application. This forces users to map and interpolate their data, which is time consuming, storage extensive, and accompanied with interpolation errors.
We present an interface between numerical methods on various types of grids and general visualization routines which overcome most of these disadvantages. It is based on a procedural approach managing a collection of arbitrary elements and a set of functions describing each element type.}

Such images provide no information about the data distribution in the viewing direction. This paper reports our realisation of opaque an combined semi-transparent/opaque raycasting in nonregular grids. We emphasize on the mapping process, on the colour accumulation, and on the shading of isosurfaces. The generated images provide both holistic information and cues about spatial data distribution in the viewing direction. We use the same interpolating functions in the visualization algorithms as they are used in the data generation with the Finite Element method. Therefore, the rendered isosurfaces reveal interesting features that cannot be seen when isosurfaces are extracted directly with simplier algorithms.}

Different examples are discussed and we visualize a simulation of astrophysics which is based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Here gas dynamical processes are irregular an d vary strongly in time. We produced high quality images which display the simulation data correctly and showed that in this situation our approach is superior to resampling strategies.}

  abstract = {Rendering images from three-dimensional discrete data sets usually involves interpolation between samples. In terms of signal processing theory, common interpolation methods like trilinear and cubic interpolation are equivalent to the convolution of the sampled data with a suitably chosen reconstruction filter. Frequency domain volume rendering is a technique based on the Fourier projection-slice theorem for the efficient generation of line integral projection without absorption. The quality of the images relies almost completely on the quality of the interpolation filter for the extraction of a 2D slice from the 3D frequency domain representation of the volume. This paper presents experiences we obtained when implementing frequency domain volume rendering and investigates the use of scaling functions of biorthogonal wavelets as reconstruction filters that exhibit the required compact support in space and fast decay in the frequency domain. This method generates X-ray-like images with good quality and short rendering times. In order to accelerate the rendering process without much loss of image quality we introduce wavelets as a subband filtering scheme generating a hierarchical representation of the volume data with the potential for interactive data exploration.}

For a given data set, the data access behavior of a volume ray-tracer depends mostly on the way in which pixels of the image are traversed. This paper addresses the cache coherence problem and compares three kinds of pixel traversals order: one-way, two-way and along a space filling curve (e.g. a Hilbert curve) greatly enhances cache efficiency especially when size of the cache is small compared to that of the volume data, and in the meantime greatly simplifies task distribution and management.}

Bifurcations are recognized from the increasing number of connected components found per step. While traversing the structure of interest, a symbolic tree is generated which corresponds to the voxel-based reconstruction and which serves for interactive identification of sub-branches, their selection and specific coloring.}

Three techniques for refresh time control are presented: for data continuous in time, and for data at discrete time steps. The user interface of a typical application is discussed in detail. Three approaches are used: manipulation via a control panel, direct manipulation of a time graph, and keyboard accelerators. The combined use of a spatial and temporal views on the data proves to be very effective for the location and analysis of areas and time intervals of interest.}

Also current research challenges include domain-specific data models, algorithm visualization, new visual programming paradigms, and 3D interaction techniques.

The iteration of this operator starting with an arbitrary initial images converges towards a limiting image which is an approximation of the given target image. In their entirety the algorithms involved in the encoding and decoding of the image data are rather complex. The paper describes the results of our efforts to design and implement an interactive visualization system for the process of fractal image compression. The purpose of this task is twofold. The system aids the understanding of the complicated compression algorithms, thus, it is educational. On the other side it provides an interface to a current testbed for the development of fractal image compression algorithms. Thus, the action and performance of variations of algorithms can be studied visually using an algorithm animation system.}

In this paper a simple experimental system for spatial sound simulation is presented, along with the results of several experiments that were conducted with this system. The system, called SAGA (Spatial Audio in Graphical Applications), was built to investigate the usability of spatial sound in a three-dimensional graphical applications such as visualization.

Two primary uses of spatial sound in such applications are envisioned: (1) the active localization of virtual sound sources in a three-dimensional virtual environment in order to be able to move the point of view or a three-dimensional cursor two-wards this sound source, and (2) as an aid in the position determination of a cursor in a three-dimensional virtual environment. The results of the experiments conducted with the SAGA system show that the first use is very feasible, but the second will be more difficult to accomplish.}

	    to isolate and measure features of interest. We explore the use of two
	    algorithms, region growing and a variant of split/merge algorithm for
	    segmenting sequences of fetal ultrasound images. We describe an interactive system
	    that can rapidly process and segment an arbitrary number of features. The system
	    exploits frame to frame coherence for accelerating the segmentation process while at
	    the same time combining ttie strengths of these algorithms and some post-processing

	    These surfaces can be e.g. the output of a marching cubes algorithm which
