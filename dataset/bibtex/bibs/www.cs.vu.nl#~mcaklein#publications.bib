  abstract =     "Diabetes Mellitus type I is a disease that forces
                 patients to manage their blood glucose level manually,
                 by balancing their activities, food intake and insulin
                 dosages. There is a large experience with building
                 computational models for blood glucose level in
                 diabetic patients, which are primarily used to design
                 the medication regime for a specific patient. In this
                 paper, the design of an intelligent support application
                 is presented that uses a standard model for blood
                 glucose level to give patients real-time advice about
                 insulin and food intake. The advice is based on
                 measurements of blood glucose level, the electronic
                 agenda of a patient and model-based predictions of the
                 glucose level in the near future. A simulation of the
                 application is presented that illustrates the
                 feasibility of the system.",

                 several personal characteristics and a representation
                 of events (i.e. life events or daily hassles) the agent
                 model can simulate whether a human agent that recovered
                 from a depression will fall into a relapse or
                 recurrence. A number of well-known relations between
                 events and the course of depression are summarized from
                 the literature and it is shown that the model exhibits

                 there is a need to align these terminologies to other
                 terminologies. Even when the terminologies cover the

                 is even more complicated when the terminology does not

                 structure-rich terminology. This procedure uses the

                 method for semantic explicitation of concept

                 professionals, this is generally not problematic. In

  abstract =     "In medicine, many diseases cannot be defined
                 unequivocally by etiology or anatomical localization,
                 but are instead described by a combination of signs and
                 symptoms that are common in patients believed to be
                 having that disease. In communication between health
                 care professionals, this is generally not problematic.
                 In biomedical research, however, crisp definitions are
                 required to distinguish patients with and without the
                 disease. This results in different operational
                 definitions being in use for a single disease.
                 Comparing those definitions, e.g, for trial design, is
                 complicated by their complex structure. This paper
                 presents an approach to compare different operational
                 definitions of a single disease in a systematic manner
                 using formal ontological modeling and reasoning. The
                 concept of an operationalization hierarchy is
                 introduced, which is subsequently used to model and
                 analyze operational disease definitions. The approach
                 is illustrated with a case-study in the area of severe
                 sepsis.",

                 few years. In terms of the involved market volume, the
                 B2B area will hereby be the most interesting area.
                 Also, it will be the place, where the new technology
                 will lead to drastic changes in established customer
                 relationships and business models. In an era where open
                 and flexible electronic commerce provides new types of
                 services to its users, simple 1-1 connections will be
                 replaced by n-m relationships between customers and
                 vendors. This new flexibility in electronic trading
                 will generate serious challenges. The main problem
                 stems from the heterogeneity of information
                 descriptions used by vendors and customers, creating
                 problems in both manual trading and in direct 1-1
                 electronic trading. In the case of B2B market places,
                 it becomes too serious to be neglected. Product
                 descriptions, catalog formats and business documents
                 are often unstructured and non-standardized.
                 Intelligent solutions that mechanize the structuring,
                 standardizing, aligning, and personalizing process are
                 a key requisite for successfully overcoming the current

                 ontologies on the Web. RDF Schema (RDFS) is a basic
                 tool that enables users to define vocabulary, structure
                 and constraints for expressing metadata about Web
                 resources. However, it includes no provisions for
                 formal semantics, and its expressivity is not
                 sufficient for full-fledged ontological modeling and
                 reasoning. In this paper, we will show how RDFS can be
                 extended to include a more expressive knowledge
                 representation language. That, in turn, would enrich it
                 with the required additional expressivity and the
                 semantics of that language.We do this by describing the
                 ontology language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An
                 important advantage to our approach is that it ensures
                 maximal sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial
                 interpretation of an OIL ontology by less semantically
                 aware processors will yield a correct partial

                 from many areas of computer science. While in software
                 engineering modularization is mainly a vehicle for
                 supporting distributed development and re-use, in
                 knowledge representation, the main goal of
                 modularization is efficiency of reasoning. In this
                 paper, we concentrate on the benefits of modularization
                 in the context of ontologies, explicit representations
                 of the terminology used in a domain. We define a formal
                 representation for modular ontologies based on the
                 notion of Distributed Description Logics and introduce
                 an architecture that supports local reasoning by
                 compiling implied axioms. We further address the

                 completeness of compiled knowledge in the presence of

                 the context of the Web by looking at the
                 characteristics of the version relation between

                 also the conceptual relation between concepts in

                 because of the excitement about the vision of a
                 Semantic Web. When ontologies are used on the web, the
                 distributed and dynamic nature of it requires advanced
                 support for change management. This paper discusses the
                 working of OntoView, a web-based change management
                 system for ontologies. OntoView provides a transparent
                 interface to different versions of ontologies, by
                 maintaining not only the transformations between them,

                 provide a shared and common understanding of a domain.
                 However, it is still an important question how
                 ontologies can be applied fruitfully to online
                 resources. Therefore, we will investigate the relation
                 between ontology representation languages and document
                 structure techniques (schemas) on the web. We will do
                 this by giving a detailed comparison of OIL, a proposal
                 for expressing ontologies in the Web, with XML Schema,
                 a proposed standard for describing the structure and

                 these two refer to different levels of abstraction, but
                 that, in several cases, it can be advantageous to base
                 a document schema on an ontology. Lastly, we will show

                 ontologies on the Web. As a basis for this, RDF Schema
                 (RDFS) provides means to de ne vocabulary, structure
                 and constraints for expressing metadata about Web
                 resources. However, formal semantics are not provided,
                 and the expressivity of it is not enough for full-
                 edged ontological modeling and reasoning. In this
                 paper, we will show how RDFS can be extended in such a
                 way that a full knowledge representation (KR) language
                 can be expressed in it, thus enriching it with the
                 required additional expressivity and the semantics of
                 this language. We do this by describing the ontology
                 language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An important
                 advantage of our approach is a maximal backward
                 compatability with RDFS: any meta-data in OIL format
                 can still be partially interpreted by any
                 RDFS-only-processor. The OIL extension of RDFS has been
                 carefully engineered so that such a partial
                 interpretation of OIL meta-data is still correct under
                 the intended semantics of RDFS: simply ignoring the OIL
                 speci c portions of an OIL document yields a correct
                 RDF(S) document whose intended RDFS semantics is
                 precisely a subset of the semantics of the full OIL
                 statements. In this way, our approach ensures maximal
                 sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial
                 interpretation of meta-data by less semantically aware
                 processors will yield a correct partial interpretation
                 of the meta- data. We conclude that our method of
                 extending is equally applicable to other KR
                 formalisms.",

                 for information processing has lead to the creation of

                 The size of these ontologies and their monolithic

                 other areas, e.g. software engineering, these problems

                 established standards guarantees interoperability at
                 various levels. Until now, the Web has been designed
                 for direct human processing, but the next-generation
                 Web, which Tim Berners-Lee and others call the
                 ``Seman-tic Web,'' aims at machine-processible
                 information.1 The Semantic Web will enable intelligent
                 services such as information brokers, search agents,
                 and information filters, which offers greater
                 functionality and interoper-ability than current
                 stand-alone services. The Semantic Web will only be
                 possible once further levels of interop-erability have
                 been established. Standards must be defined not only
                 for the syntactic form of documents, but also for their
                 semantic content. Notable among recent W3C
                 standardization efforts are XML/XML schema and RDF/RDF
                 schema, which facilitate semantic interoperability. In
                 this article, we explain the role of ontologies in the
                 architecture of the Semantic Web. We then briefly
                 summarize key elements of XML and RDF, showing why
                 using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will
                 be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further
                 representation and inference layer is needed on top of
                 the Web's current layers, and to estab-lish such a
                 layer, we propose a general method for encoding
                 ontology rep-resentation languages into RDF/RDF schema.
                 We illustrate the extension method by applying it to
                 OIL, an ontology representation and inference
                 language.",

  abstract =     "As ontology development becomes a collaborative
                 process, developers face the problem of maintaining
                 versions of ontologies akin to maintaining versions of
                 software code or versions of documents in large
                 projects. Traditional versioning systems enable users
                 to compare versions, examine changes, and accept or
                 reject changes. However, while versioning systems treat
                 software code and text documents as text files, a
                 versioning system for ontologies must compare and
                 present structural changes rather than changes in text
                 representation of ontologies. In this paper, we present
                 the PROMPTDIFF ontology-versioning environment, which
                 address these challenges. PROMPTDIFF includes an
                 efficient version-comparison algorithm that produces a
                 structural diff between ontologies. The results are
                 presented to the users through an intuitive user
                 interface for analyzing the changes that enables users
                 to view concepts and groups of concepts that were
                 added, deleted, and moved, distinguished by their
                 appearance and with direct access to additional
                 information characterizing the change. The users can
                 then act on the changes, accepting or rejecting them.
                 We present results of a pilot user study that
                 demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool for change
                 management. We discuss design principles for an
                 end-to-end ontology-versioning environment and position

                 for information processing has lead to the creation of
                 a number of large ontologies about real world domains.
                 The size of these ontologies and their monolithic
                 character cause serious problems in handling them. In
                 other areas, e.g. software engineering, these problems
                 are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into
                 sets of meaningful and mostly self-contained modules.
                 In this paper, we suggest a similar approach for
                 ontologies. We propose a method for automatically
                 partitioning large ontologies into smaller modules

                 structure and constraints for expressing metadata about
                 Web resources. However, formal semantics for the
                 primitives defined in RDF Schema are not provided, and
                 the expressivity of these primitives is not enough for
                 full-fledged ontological modeling and reasoning. To
                 perform these tasks, an additional layer on top of RDF
                 Schema is needed. In this paper, we will show how RDF
                 Schema can be extended in such a way that a full
                 knowledge representation language can be expressed in
                 it, thus enriching it with the required additional
                 expressivity and the semantics of this language. We do
                 this by describing the ontology language OIL as an
                 extension of RDF Schema. First, we give a short
                 introduction to both RDF Schema and OIL. We then
                 proceed to define a Schema to express OIL ontologies in
                 RDF, where the aim is to use existing RDF terminology
                 where possible, and extending RDF(S) where necessary.
                 The result is an RDF Schema definition of OIL
                 primitives, which allows one to express any OIL
                 ontology in RDF syntax, thus enabling the added
                 benefits of OIL, such as reasoning support and formal
                 semantics, to be used on the Web. We conclude that our
                 method of extending is equally applicable to other

                 professionals, this is generally not problematic. In
                 biomedical research, however, crisp definitions are
                 required to unambiguously distinguish patients with and
                 without the disease. In practice, this results in
                 multiple, operational definitions being in use for a
                 single disease, which are defined ad hoc. Comparing
                 those definitions, e.g, for trial design, statistical

                 used to analyze to which extent the disease definitions
                 can be considered similar. The approach is illustrated

                 pieces of knowledge are not static, but evolve over
                 time. Domain changes, adaptations to different tasks,
                 or changes in the conceptualization require
                 modifications of the ontology. The evolution of
                 ontologies causes operability problems, which will

                 research come to the forefront as practical problems in
                 ontology evolution. These differences have important
                 implications for the development of ontologyevolution
                 frameworks: The traditional distinction between
                 versioning and evolution is not applicable to
                 ontologies. There are several dimensions along which
                 compatibility between versions must be considered. The
                 set of change operations for ontologies is difference.
                 We must develop automatic techniques for finding
                 similarities and differences between versions.",

  abstract =     "Recently, there has been a wide interest in using
                 ontologies on the Web. As a basis for this, RDF Schema
                 (RDFS) provides means to define vocabulary, structure
                 and constraints for expressing metadata about Web
                 resources. However, formal semantics are not provided,
                 and the expressivity of it is not enough for
                 full-fledged ontological modeling and reasoning. In
                 this paper, we will show how RDFS can be extended in
                 such a way that a full knowledge representation (KR)
                 language can be expressed in it, thus enriching it with
                 the required additional expressivity and the semantics
                 of this language. We do this by describing the ontology
                 language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An important
                 benefit of our approach is that it ensures maximal
                 sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial
                 interpretation of an OIL ontology by less semantically
                 aware processors will yield a correct partial
                 interpretation of the meta-data. We conclude that our
                 method of extending is equally applicable to other KR
                 formalisms.",
