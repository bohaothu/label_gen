  abstract =     "User errors cause or contribute to most computer
                 security failures, yet user interfaces for security
                 still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or
                 near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to
                 apply standard user interface design techniques to
                 security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective
                 security requires a different usability standard, and
                 that it will not be achieved through the user interface
                 design techniques appropriate to other types of
                 consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we
                 performed a case study of a security program does have
                 a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0.
                 Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis
                 together with a laboratory user test to evaluate
                 whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by
                 cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic
                 mail security. The analysis found a number of user
                 interface design flaws that may contribute to security
                 failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our
                 test participants were given 90 minutes in which to
                 sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority
                 of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude
                 that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective
                 security for most computer users, despite its
                 attractive graphical user interface, supporting our
                 hypothesis that user interface design for effective
                 security remains an open problem. We close with a brief
                 description of our continuing work on the development
                 and application of user interface design principles and
                 techniques for security.",

                 reasoning about security from a user-centred point of
                 view, by modelling a system in terms of actors and
                 actions and introducing the concept of the subjective
                 actor-ability state. We identify ten key principles for
                 user interaction design in secure systems and give case
                 studies to illustrate and justify each principle,
                 describing real-world problems and possible solutions.
