  review = {The author list five principles and illustrates them with example
	applications. * Mobile devices should facilitate and enrich the user
	experience, which is quite obvious. In one of the examples, students
	use the mobile device to give feedback/ask questions during a lecture
	anonymously. Great for shy students or (for students like in China
	who are not used to ask questions).
	
	 * Context Awareness. Here, context in the sense of location. Example:
	a location-aware to-do-list. Each task is assigned to a location,
	and when you reach that location you will get notified. "On my way
	home, remind me of buying nice flowers". The location can be used
	to extend the context, e.g., to friends that are nearby.
	
	 * Microtasking. This principle captures the observation that you
	cannot do the same tasks with your phone than you would do with your
	PC. Mobile devices are great for small tasks, "tasklets".
	
	 * Public Display. While you are usually restricted to the screen
	of your mobile device, don't forget that you can use public devices,
	e.g., at an art exhibition. I'm not sure whether this qualifies as
	a principle, but it's important to keep in mind that other output
	devices than the device itself can be employed. * Proactivity: here,
	proactivity is used in the sense that the device communicates information
	on the auditory channel, so you know what it is telling you without
	taking it out of the pocket. The final example illustrates the usage
	of other device plugged into the mobile device by Bluetooth. A carbon
	dioxide sensor notifies you whenever there is a critical level of
	pollution. The information of several users could be combined into
	public displays.}

  abstract = {The successful development of mobile learning is dependent on human
	factors in the use of new mobile and wireless technologies. The majority
	of mobile learning activity continues to take place on devices that
	were not designed with educational applications in mind, and usability
	issues are often reported. The paper reflects on progress in approaches
	to usability and on recent developments, with particular reference
	to usability findings reported in studies of mobile learning. The
	requirements of education are considered as well as the needs of
	students participating in distance education; discipline-specific
	perspectives and accessibility issues are also addressed. Usability
	findings from empirical studies of mobile learning published in the
	literature are drawn together in the paper, along with an account
	of issues that emerged in two mobile learning projects based at The
	Open University, UK, in 2001 and 2005. The main conclusions are:
	that usability issues are often reported in cases where PDAs have
	been used; that the future is in scenario-based design which should
	also take into account the evolution of uses over time and the unpredictability
	of how devices might be used; and that usability issues should be
	tracked over a longer period, from initial use through to a state
	of relative experience with the technology.},

	ontology-based queryrewriting method has been developed which uses
	the specified knowledge representation of the repository and an ontology
	mapping to compute the rewriting steps for translating. For distributing
	queries we realized a mediating architecture, which passes the translated
	queries to the repositories. This architecture has been integrated
	in the Web-based, user-adaptive and interactive e-learning environment
	ActiveMath. Currently, it enables the ActiveMath's course planner
	to access four heterogeneous LO repositories. The course planning
	component can create courses adapted to the learner's goals, knowledge,
	learning behaviour and a specific learning scenario. To select adequate
	LOs, the course planner initially queried its proprietary repository
	MBase for LOs. The challenge our architecture faces is to integrate
	more than one repository into ActiveMath's course generation. Currently,
	with the help of the architecture here-proposed, the course planner
	retrieves LOs additionally from the repository of the DaMiT-system,
	of the MathsThesaurus, and the LeActiveMath ExerciseRepository.},

	methods that take into account the learners' goals and individual
	properties such as mastery. This pedagogical knowledge needs to be
	elicited from pedagogical experts and hence is rather expensive to
	assess. Therefore, once a course generator has been developed, it
	makes sense to make course generation available as a web-service
	for web-based e-learning environments in order to reuse the pedagogical
	knowledge. In this paper, we present the web-service we developed
	for the course generator of the LeActiveMath system. We describe

	Secondly, the restricted mixture of case-based planning and planning

  abstract = {Current Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are focused very much
	on meeting the needs of the institution in providing a basic, common
	technology platform for teaching and learning. However monolithic
	VLEs are too hard to customize at the individual user level, and
	evolve far too slowly to meet teaching and learning of users who
	want their teaching and learning environments to be under their personal
	control. This paper explores how the concept of the Personal Learning
	Environment has influenced developments with learning technology,
	within the context of emerging social software, and examines a range
	of developments with existing VLEs that move them in the personalized
	direction. It contrasts the issues involved in bespoke extensions
	to VLEs as opposed to the incorporation of existing tools (mash-ups),
	and suggest that the latter approach offers the best hope to escape
	the bonds of a single VLE product by allowing teachers and learners
	to simply aggregate whatever tools and capabilities they desire from
	the Internet to use in their learning. Real progress is being made
	on several fronts, including the provision of interfaces to social
	software systems that support the building of applications that can
	be organized around a personal or group context, and in the development
	of specifications for learning tool interoperability.},

	researchers became aware of significant issues that were not obvious
	at the outset. Some are technical problems, such as how to manage
	technology with short battery life, or how to interact with a mobile
	device when walking. Some are educational, such as how to coordinate
	small group learning in the classroom, or to deliver teaching content
	through a small device. And some are broader issues of society, for
	example whether it is ethical for software on mobile devices to monitor
	and control children?s learning activities outside the classroom.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents course generation based on Hierarchical Task
	Network planning (HTN planning). This course generation framework
	enables the formalization and application of complex and realistic
	pedagogical knowledge. Compared to previous course generation, this
	approach generates structured courses that are adapted to a variety
	of different learning goals and to the learners' competencies. The
	thesis describes basic techniques for course generation, which are
	used to formalize seven different types of courses (for instance
	introducing the learner to previously unknown concepts and supporting
	him during rehearsal) and several elementary learning goals (e.g.,
	selecting an appropriate example or exercise).
	
	 The course generator developed in this thesis is service-oriented
	thus allowing the integration of learning supporting services into
	the generated course in a generic and pedagogically sensible way.
	Furthermore, learning environments can access the functionality of
	the course generator using a Web-service interface. Repositories
	are treated as services that can register at the course generator
	and make their content available for course generation. The registration
	is based on an ontology of instructional objects. Its classes allow
	categorizing laerning objects according to their pedagogical purpose
	in a more precise way than existing metadata specifications; hence
	it can be used for intelligent pedagogical functionalities other
	than course generation.
	
	 Course generation based on HTN planning is implemented in Paigos
	and was evaluated by technical, formative and summative evaluations.
	The technical evaluation primarily investigated the performance to
	Paigos; the formative and summative evaluations targeted the users'
	acceptance of Paigos and of the generated courses.},

  abstract = {Analogical reasoning consists of transferring the solution of a previously
	solved problem (called source) onto a new problem (called target).
	In this thesis I describe TOPAL, an approach for the analogical transfer
	of mathematical proofs. The transfer is performed at the level of
	proof plans, therefore the application of abstract planning operators,
	called methods, is replayed in the new problem rather than the application
	of single calculus steps. In order to cope with the complexity of
	proofs at plan level, I had to extent existing analogy frameworks
	in several ways: Firstly, as in proof planning a standard higher
	order matcher can no longer compare source and target terms, I propose
	extensions to higher order matching that make these comparisons possible
	again. Secondly, the underlying assumption of most analogy systems,
	namely that the differences in term structure expressed via the matching
	can be used to guide the transfer and adaption of the source plan,
	is not valid in proof planning. Therefore I show how planning mechanisms
	can be used to fulfil the same purpose of guiding transfer and adaptions.
	Thirdly, I propose how theorem proving by analogy can be realised
	as one of several problem solving strategies. I identify situations
	in which the use of analogy makes sense and present the corresponding
	strategic control knowledge. Finally, I have evaluated TOPAL. The
	evaluation shows that the use of planning mechanisms enhances the
	performance of the analogical transfer. By using these mechanisms
	a great number of complex problems can be solved.},

	this article, we discuss ACTIVEMATH from a service and semantics
	perspective. We describe the service-oriented technologies of ACTIVEMATH
	and how the services interplay with the domain semantics (mathematics)
	and the pedagogical semantics used, e. g., for course generation.
	More specifically, we provide details on the knowledge representation
	for mathematics we use in ACTIVEMATH and how it is used to represent
	learning materials. We also elaborate on the representation of learning
	objects from a pedagogical point-of-view, that is, how we capture
	the instructional semantics. We then show how learning goals are
	represented and how a course generator assembles sequences of learning
	objects to fulfil these goals. Some tools in ACTIVEMATH are client-based
	and require different techniques. We use our assembly tool as an
	example to illustrate how ACTIVEMATH integrates client-based tools.},

	access over 1000 of bioinformatic services, e.g., analysis algorithms

	of bioinformatic workflows. These workflows make tacit procedural
	bioinformatics explicit and as such lend themselves for being used
	in bioinformatics education. However, until now, no Taverna e-learning
	service exists. In this paper, we describe how Taverna can be used
	for learning and the services that need to be integrated in Taverna
	for that purpose. This includes a digital library of multimedia resources
	since multimedia, especially visualization, plays an important role
	in bioinformatics. Equally important is an intelligent educational
	service that automatically assembles learning activities and resources
	into a pedagogically coherent whole.},
