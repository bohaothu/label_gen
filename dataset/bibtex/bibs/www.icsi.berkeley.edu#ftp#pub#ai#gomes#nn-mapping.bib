        knowledge representation and reasoning ontoexisting general
        purpose massively parallel architectures with the objective of
        developing and implementing practical, real-time reasoning
        systems. SHRUTI, a connectionist knowledge representation and
        reasoning system which attempts to model reflexive reasoning,
        serves as our representative connectionist model. Realizations
        of SHRUTI are developed on the Connection Machine CM-2--an
        SIMD architecture--and on the connection Machine CM-5--an MIMD
        architecture. Though SIMD implementations on the CM-2 are
        reasonably fast--requiring a few seconds to tens of seconds
        for answering queries--experiments indicate that SPMD message
        passing systems are vastly superior to SIMD systems and offer
        hundred-fold speedups. The CM-5 implementation can encode
        large knowledge bases with several hundred thousand (randomly
        generated) rules and facts, and respond in under 500
        milliseconds to a range of queries requiring inference depths
        of up to eight. This work provides some new insights into the
        simulation of structured connectionist networks on massively
        parallel machines and is a step toward developing large yet
        efficient knowledge representation and reasoning systems."

%Abstract: Summary form only given.The inherent parallelism available
%in a neural network structure seems to indicate a simple method for
%parallel implementation in hardware. Unfortunately, the diversity in
%the type of neural network, limited analytical data on their
%computational requirements, and demanding communication requirements
%have all been significant impediments to the development of a
%general-purpose massively parallel neurocomputer. The authors have
%established a basic taxonomy of neural network implementations based
%on the granularity of parallelism exploited. A detailed analysis of
%the possible sources of parallelism in neural network models, along
%with architectural characteristics and their effective use in neural
%computation, was carried out with each class of implementations. This
%analysis is intended to be used as a framework for the design of
%future neurocomputer systems.

%Summary form only given, as follows. The authors examine the
%parallelism of a multilayered ANN (artificial neural network) and
%discuss a parallel algorithm suited to loosely coupled parallel
%processors. A mapping of a multilayered network to large-grain
%processors is proposed, and its performance is evaluated. For a
%two-layer backpropagation model which has N units in each layer, the
%highest speedup ratio is obtained with 8N processors but the parallel
%efficiency is less than 20%. With 2N processors and N/2 processors,
%the parallel efficiencies of the mapping are 50% and 80%,
%respectively.It is also shown that the proposed parallel algorithm is
%more efficient for a larger network.
