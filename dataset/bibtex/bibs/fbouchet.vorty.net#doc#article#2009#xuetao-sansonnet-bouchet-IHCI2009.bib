	abstract = {Assisting Conversational Agents are Embodied Conversational Agents dedicated to the Function of Assistance for applications and services to the general public, especially on the Internet. We have developed a web-based framework to experiment with assisting agents regarding the key issue of believability, and where good Natural Language Understanding is a primary concern. Now, we are confronted with the difficult issue of the cost of developing and customizing Natural Language Processing tools {(NLP-tools)} for each new assisted application. In this paper, we propose an approach which is a tradeoff between complex dialogue systems and naive chatbot systems. We think that our approach is worth considering because it focuses on a concise and well circumscribed linguistic domain: the domain of Assistance Requests that we captured by registering a corpus, in various contexts with ordinary people placed in front of Assisting Conversational Agents.},
