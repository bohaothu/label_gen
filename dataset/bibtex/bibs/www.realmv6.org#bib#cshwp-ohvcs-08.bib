  abstract = {Mobile phones and related gadgets in networks are on the spot to deliver sufficient performance for rich multimedia applications and communication. In this report we introduce a video conferencing software, which seamlessly integrates mobile with stationary users into fully distributed multi-party conversations. Innovations related to this work are twofold. At first we report on a highly optimized realisation of a H.264 codec and our implementation experiences of the video conference {\em software} on a consumer mobile. Within the tight bounds of real-time requirements on mobiles, the coding software outperforms compatible H.264 realizations. At second we present an integrated peer-to-peer group communication solution, which scales well for medium-size conferences and accounts for the heterogeneous nature of mobile and stationary participants.},
