	Documentary evidence from Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Greek cities
	indicates exchange of coins in very early history. FX is well suited
	for being traded in dealers' markets as long as full convertibility
	is assured. Such markets tend to emerge when the asset is freely
	negotiable, when credit risk is low or can easily be ascertained,
	and when contracts and settlement procedures are unambigous and reliable.
	The existence of many reputable buyers and sellers actively trading
	in different locations also favours the emergence of a dealers' market.
	Important with FX markets is the high number of potential market
	markers. This tends to keep transactions cost low. The delivery (as
	of late 1990s, now CLS) of the currencies in a transaction typically
	takes place through the payment systems of the countries of the two
	currencies traded. Due to different time zones there was a risk involved
	in this which is now resolved through CLS.},

	are imperfect substitutes. Past work on imperfect substitutability
	in foreign exchange falls into two groups: (1) tests using measures
	of asset supply and (2) tests using measures of central-bank asset
	demand. We address the demand side, but we use a broad measure of
	public demand rather than focusing on demand by central banks. Under
	floating rates, changing public demand has no direct effect on monetary
	fundamentals, current or future. This provides an opportunity to
	test for price effects from imperfect substitutability. We develop
	and estimate a micro portfolio balance model that has both Walrasian
	and microstructure features. Price effects from imperfect substitutability
	are clearly present: the immediate price impact of public trades
	is 0.44 percent per $1 billion (of which, about 80 percent persists
	indefinitely). This estimate is applicable to intervention trades
	in the special case when they are indistinguishable from private
	trades (i.e., when interventions are sterilized, anonymous, and provide
	no monetary-policy signal).},

  type = {typescript},
  abstract = {Exchange rate is quoted by dealers based on the order flow they receive.
	Market survey and FX market microstructure literature suggest that
	financial customers order flow is the most informative and leads
	total order flow. This paper explains exchange rate dynamics by linking
	financial customers FX order flow with their dynamic portfolio allocation
	among domestic and foreign assets. Specifically, for any currency
	pair in a particular period, one currency has relatively higher assets
	return than the other and can be considered as high-return currency
	(HRC). Profit-seeking financial customers would hold more (less)
	HRC assets if their returns are expected to increase (decrease).
	Such portfolio reallocation generates positive (negative) order flow
	for the HRC and the currency appreciates (depreciates). Meanwhile,
	holding HRC assets is risky because of exchange rate fluctuations
	and higher volatility associated with high-return assets. Everything
	else equal, when financial customers become more risk-loving (risk-aversion),
	they would hold more (less) HRC assets, which causes positive (negative)
	order flow toward the HRC and the currency appreciates (depreciates).
	Thus, value of high-return currency (low-return currency) is positively
	(negatively) driven by expected returns of HRC assets and investors
	risk appetite. The entire exchange rate dynamics is thus based directly
	on the financial market structure as opposed to traditional macroeconomic
	variables. As switch can occur in HRC status, business cycle and
	dominating factor, the direction that related financial variables
	affect exchange rate varies in different regimes. The paper finds
	country-specific period-specific supportive evidence for all major

	setting. Unlike other DGE macro models, which enrich either preference
	structures or production structures, our model enriches the information
	structure. The model departs from microstructure-style modeling by
	identifying the real activities where dispersed information originates,
	as well as the technology by which information is subsequently aggregated
	and impounded. Results relevant to the determination puzzle include:
	(1) persistent gaps between exchange rates and macro fundamentals,
	(2) excess volatility relative to macro fundamentals, (3) exchange
	rate movements without macro news, (4) little or no exchange rate
	movement when macro news occurs, and (5) a structural-economic rationale
	for why transaction flows perform well in accounting for monthly
	exchange rate changes, whereas macro variables perform poorly. Though
	past micro analysis has made progress on results (1) through (3),
	results (4) and (5) are new. Excess volatility arises in our model
	for a new reason: rational exchange rate errors feed back into the
	fundamentals that the exchange rate is trying to track.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to establish the link between the high frequency
	dynamics of spot exchange rates and developments in the macroeconomy.
	To do so, I first present a theoretical model of exchange-rate determination
	that bridges the gap between existing microstructure and traditional
	models. The model examines how dispersed microeconomic information
	known to individual agents outside the foreign exchange market is
	aggregated and transmitted to dealers via transaction flows (i.e.,
	order flow); and how the information is then embedded in the spot
	exchange rate. I then report empirical evidence that strongly supports
	the presence of the link between the macroeconomy, order flow, and
	high frequency exchange rate returns implied by the model. In fact,
	my empirical results indicate that between 20 and 30% of the variance
	in excess currency returns over one- and two-month horizons can be
	linked back to developments in the macroeconomy. This level of explanatory
	power is an order of magnitude higher than that found in traditional
	models -- even the newly developed monetary models incorporating
	central banks reaction functions. Moreover, it provides a straightforward
	solution to the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. Namely, the high
	frequency behavior of spot exchange rates reflects the flow of new
	information reaching dealers concerning the slowly evolving state
	of the macroeconomy, rather than the effects of shocks that drive
	rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions.},

	rate understate the effects of public news by 20 to 40 percent because

	in a new way. Past work on portfolio balance in foreign exchange
	falls into two groups: (1) tests using measures of asset supply and
	(2) tests using measures of central-bank asset demand. We address
	the demand side, but we use a broad measure of public demand, rather
	than focusing on demand by central banks. Under floating rates, changing
	public demand has no direct effect on interest rates, current or
	future. This provides an opportunity to test for portfolio-balance
	effects on price. We develop and estimate a micro portfolio-balance
	model that has both Walrasian and microstructure features. Portfolio-balance
	effects are clearly present: the immediate price impact of public
	trades is 0.44 percent per $1 billion (of which, about 80 percent
	persists indefinitely). This estimate is applicable to central-bank
	trades as well, as long as they are sterilized, secret, and provide
	no monetary-policy signal. Intervention of this type is most effective
	when the flow of macroeconomic news is strong.},

	portfolio shifts--unrelated to macroeconomic information--that induce
	portfolio-balance effects on price (e.g., from shifts in risk preferences
	or shifts in hedging demands). This paper addresses the main alternative
	hypothesis that the underlying cause of order flow is macroeconomic
	information. Using a two-equation system--one for price and one for
	order flow--we examine the links between order flow and macro announcements.
	We find strong empirical support for this alternative: the order

	a high-frequency version of a structural microstructure trade model

	underpinnings for the time-varying pattern of the probability of
	informed trading are rooted in the strategic arrival of informed
	traders on a particular hour-of-day, day-of-week, and geographic
	location (market). Specifically, we document that informed traders
	not only pick the low activity hours, but also attach the largest
	market weight to a particular market. The distributions of the estimated
	arrival rates confirm the commitment of the informed traders to strategic
	trading activities. In our framework, we acknowledge that an expected
	loss of informed trading to the market maker is a function of both
	the probability of informed trading and its likely impact on the
	price. The impact of the uninformed traders arrival on the daily
	foreign exchange price volatility is about twice the magnitude of
	the one for informed traders. These effects are in stark contrast
	to the findings from the hourly data that indicate dominance of informed
	traders. Finally, the results relate the informational content of
	trading to the trade size and suggest that the probability of the
	informed large trading is significantly higher than the probability
	of uninformed large trading.},

	for both order submissions and cancellations. We find that there
	is a clear trade-off between price aggressiveness and quantity: more

  pages = {23--49},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {This article examines how microstructure effects, evident in high
	frequency data, influence bid–ask spreads and volatility in transaction
	price series. It uses the event of European Monetary Union (EMU),
	and the upheaval that this entailed, as an opportunity to empirically
	investigate these relationships in the electronic inter-dealer spot
	FX market. The microstructure effects relate to both price and time.
	There are two price effects, namely price discreteness and price
	clustering, and two time effects, namely the time elapsed between
	sample periods and the time-gap between successive trades or quoted
	price submissions. Strong evidence emerges that all four factors
	are important in the determination of bid–ask spreads.
	
	
	This study uses a unique and rich foreign exchange (FX) dataset of
	global inter-dealer electronic transactions to examine microstructural
	effects in the spot foreign exchange market. This dataset enables
	us to shed new light on the debate surrounding the observations that
	trading volumes have fallen and bid–ask spreads have widened in inter-dealer
	spot FX markets following European Monetary Union (EMU). Our work
	provides a more detailed account of the changes that actually occurred
	at this time, because our data is more comprehensive than has previously
	been available. Our four-technical-feature explanation is in contrast
	to the hypothesis of market maker response to exogenous changes in
	volume as proposed by Hau, Killeen and Moore [Hau, H., Killeen, W.,
	Moore, M. (2000). The euro as an international currency: Explaining
	puzzling first evidence. Centre for Economic Policy Research, working
	paper., Hau, H., Killeen, W, Moore, M. (2002). How has the euro changed
	the foreign exchange market? Economic Policy 17, 34, 149-191].
	
	
	Price discreteness means that prices or exchange rates are not an
	infinite number of digits long, but rather they are truncated to
	a small number of digits. In the case of the FX market, exchange
	rates are specified to five digit accuracy. Price clustering refers
	to the fact that traders may not use all available exchange rates
	uniformly. In practice, rates ending in 0 or 5 tend to be used more
	than other rates. The time elapsed between the sample periods is
	important for a very obvious reason— price levels can differ radically
	if data is sampled from periods that are far apart in time. On the
	other hand, the time-gap between successive individual prices is
	also important because it allows these prices to drift apart. When
	the successive prices are transaction prices, this effect increases
	volatility. When they are successive bid and ask prices, the bid–ask
	spread is increased.
	
	
	EMU brought widespread change to financial markets. Much of this change
	is directly due to the re-denomination of certain instruments from
	Deutschemarks (DEM) to euros (EUR). Since these currency units are
	of different values, the nature of the price discreteness affecting
	instruments which are now denominated in EUR will be different from
	what it was under DEM denomination. This point is exemplified by
	our finding that the smallest sized bid–ask spread and smallest price
	increment for the EUR are both 74\% greater than that for the DEM,
	after controlling for drift in currency values.
	
	
	Our four proposed factors are successful in explaining the observed
	changes in bid–ask spreads, but are less able to explain the observed
	changes in price volatility. Also, our results overwhelmingly accept
	the price resolution hypothesis explanation for price clustering
	behavior in the spot FX market and overwhelmingly reject the price
	attraction hypothesis. In the case of the EUR(DEM)/USD bid–ask spread,
	we provide a deeper understanding of the technical market features
	that caused this to increase. We show that the widening of the USD/JPY
	bid–ask spread seems primarily due to the inter-temporal change in
	currency value. We also show that the narrowing of EUR(DEM)/CHF bid–ask
	spreads seems largely due a near 50\% decrease in the pricing increment
	used. We find that increased volume has reduced the time-gap for
	traded and quoted prices for USD/CHF. Finally, in the case of EUR(DEM)/JPY,
	we find that market practice caused wider bid–ask spreads. The bid–ask
	spread data evidence suggests that the advent of EMU seems to have
	strengthened the USD's position as the dominant international vehicle
	currency. We consider this surprising because we believe that part
	of the intention in launching the single currency must surely have
	been the opposite.},

	and is up sharply from that reported in the last surveys taken in
	1998. While the surveys point out the rapid growth of electronic
	brokers as an important FX institution, there has been no research
	on the microstructure issues that lead traders to choose electronic
	brokerage (EB) over the historically dominant, and still quite relevant,
	institution of direct dealing where bilateral conversations (either

	is struck. We provide theory and empirical analysis to further our
	understanding of the choice of trading venue in foreign exchange.
	Our theoretical model analyzes the choice of trading venue for “large”
	and “small” traders. The theory illustrates the importance of asymmetric
	information, transaction costs, and speed of execution. The most
	likely outcome has direct dealing used for large trades while the
	EB is used for small trades. The empirical analysis utilizes data
	on orders submitted to the Reuters 2000-2 EB system. We focus on
	the duration of time between order submission and finding a match
	for trade execution. An autoregressive conditional duration (ACD)
	model is specified using the Burr distribution. Given the price competitiveness
	of an order, duration is increasing in order size. Because of this
	longer duration for large orders on the EB, large traders will prefer
	the direct dealing market to the brokerage. We also find that the
	greater the depth of the market, the shorter the duration of orders
	of all sizes. This result is consistent with traders clustering in
	time to submit orders so as to increase the probability of finding
	a match.},

	pricing impacts of order flow. In particular, market under- and overreactions
	could happen and persist due to the presence of `behaviourally biased'
	traders while the asymmetric pricing impacts stem from varied risk
	aversion degrees of agents. The derived theoretical model, called
	the asymmetric portfolio shifts (APS) model, can be shown to be empirically
	equivalent to the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag framework
	proposed by Shin et al. (2009). Using Reuters D2000-1 trading data
	set, we find strong evidence of an asymmetric cointegrating relationship
	between exchange rate and order flow. Specifically, exchange rates
	react to order flows in a nonlinear fashion with the pricing impacts
	of trades in down market being significantly greater than in up market.
	Furthermore, the dynamic multiplier effects from our model suggest
	two typical patterns of the price discovery process: one following
	market underreaction is characterised by gradual and persistent adjustment,
	and one following market overreaction by short-term overshooting,
	volatile but faster adjustment. We also document that overreaction
	is more prominent in down market. Finally, our results clearly show
	that feedback trading strategies can either stabilise or destabilise
	the market depending on market conditions. Overall, our empirical
	results support the validity of the proposed APS model.},

  abstract = {Empirical research on the microeconomics of currency markets, an area
	known sometimes as currency market microstructure, has taken off
	in the past decade. This paper extracts from this research four lessons
	for modelling short-run exchange-rate dynamics. First, currency flows
	are a key determinant of exchange rates, and models should have these
	flows fully in focus. The appropriate equilibrium condition may be
	flow-currency supply equals flow-currency demand. Second, the flows
	of first-order relevance include those of financial traders, who
	use currencies essentially as a store of value, and commercial traders,
	who use currencies as a medium of exchange. Financial flows and commercial
	flows should be negatively related to each other, meaning that financial
	demand tends to be met by commercial supply. Also, financial flows
	should be positively related to exchange rates. Third, financial
	traders are motivated by profits, rather than consumption, and behave
	as if risk averse. Fourth, commercial traders are motivated by exchange-rate
	levels and rationally choose not to speculate. The workhorse models
	of international macroeconomics do not fit most of these lessons,
	and these important lacunae in their microfoundations may help explain
	their limited empirical success. The paper sketches an optimizing
	model of currency flows that is consistent with the lessons and has

	of the stability and ordering of "market" volatility, performed across
	several different fractions of the day, reveal that variances of

	trading hours, peaking at the opening of New York to subsequently
	fall with the closing of the European markets. Results also indicate
	that "market" volatility is significantly higher during intra-day
	versus overnight periods. Then, we introduce a structural model that
	attempts to explain those empirical regularities by capturing some
	currency-specific features of the data: possibly asymmetric and stochastic
	trading cost structure, discrete directional updates and parameters'
	temporal heterogeneity, and by relating the bid-ask spread to different
	sources of random noise. We evaluate these parameters via GMM using
	a set of convenient unconditional intra-day moments implied by the
	basic configuration of the model. Analysis of the resulting estimated
	patterns reveals that trading costs play a significant role in explaining
	the intra-day variability of bid and offer currency returns. Inventory
	considerations appear to be more relevant in the trading morning,
	while the perceived risk of arrival of informed trades seems more
	likely to affect the dealers' cost structure in the afternoon. The

	of the foreign currency are not necessarily equal to this objective,
	the central bank does not have an incentive to reveal its intervention
	operations and no announcement on its activity will be credible.
	Under these circumstances, secret sterilised intervention can be
	used to influences agents’ expectations and exchange rates, as the
	central bank possesses private information on these fundamentals.
	A surprising result of our analysis is that while announcements on
	the objective of intervention are not credible, they are not even
	desirable. In fact, the foreign exchange market is more efficient
	when this objective is secret than when it is common knowledge, because
	in the former case the central bank is more aggressive and reveals
	more of its private information.},

  abstract = {This paper models stochastic order flow generations in a FX market.
	Trading volume and volatility are endogenous. We circumvent an issue
	of defining equilibrium. Yet we provide a model of auctions process
	where rational FX dealers choose actions and transactions continue.
	Our features of our microstructure are handling (i) dealer's own
	choosing of price expectation believing others', (ii) asynchronous
	transactions (iii) characterizing sources of trading. Our approach
	makes use of instruments related to continuous time Markov process.
	We define a set of market states. Each one has an associated distribution
	of bid rate. Bid rate is a proxy for the transaction price. We construct
	an infinitesimal operator of Markov transitions between market states.
	Use of infinitesimal operator makes derivation of stochastic properties
	of bid rate possible.
	
	
	What determine trading volume and volatility are "dealers" expectation
	revision process, distribution of dealer's reservation prices and
	retail transactions. We show volume and volatility can change separately
	or together.
	
	
	FX auctions poses theoretical issues. Like other financial asset markets,
	in order for a trader to have perspective on price, he must take
	other traders' perspectives into consideration. In our model, he
	tries to fathom unobservable distribution of reservation prices and
	chooses his own. Meanwhile traders have transactions with retail
	customers. These retail transactions are passed onto wholesale market.
	Thus prices are formed through the interactions between heterogeneous
	price perspectives and the order flow from macro economy. The second
	issue is how to define equilibrium when the auctions are continuous.
	We do not have truistic point of time to define liquidation value.
	Also applying demand and supply on their asynchronous transactions
	is difficult. We use alternative benchmark value. The peak or trough
	of price, trader expects first in a row is the key variable. That
	value determines his present action.},
