from Speech Act Theory are applied to professional writing. 
It is demonstrated that this theory supports the use of an
explanation to maintain goodwill when composing negative
messages and also provides a useful classification of such
explanations based on 5 universal strategies for politely
refusing requests.  The strategies are: 1.  Deny that an
item referred to in the request exists.  2.  Deny that
address is the agent of the requested action.  3.  Deny that
the requested act is a future act.  4.  Cite reasons for the
addressee's inability to perform the requested act.  5. 
Cite reasons that the requested action is actually not
desired by the requestor.  The classification illuminates
some problems that novice writers exhibit in inventing
explanations. SU  Experimental/theoretical treatment.

be effective in a given problem domain, it is important to

by extending the traditional planning framework based on
first-order logic to include modal logic.  This extended
framework is then employed to represent beliefs and desires
of the user, communicative actions performed by the user and
the system, as well as the usual goals and task-related
actions.  The essence of this approach, then, is to view
natural language utterances of the DSS user as speech acts
that can be modeled using the extended framework; this view
can, in turn, be used to interpret natural language
utterances of the user. SU  Software \&\ systems.

used reality mapping (RM) view maps from the real world to a
formal model, while the formal language development (FLD)
view models by the formulation, development, and adoption of
organizational rules.  In the RM view, IS resembles science
and engineering models, while in the FLD view, the use of IS
is similar to the use of mass media for a local group.  A
comparison of the 2 views shows the importance of examining
the beliefs underlying information systems research and
development.  The views appeal to different world views, the
RM concentrating on completeness, predictability, and
consistency in IS design, and the FLD emphasizing human
communication and sense-making.  The 2 views supplement each
other, and the choice is not either/or but a matter of

in describing IS linguistic functions, language study
traditions are identified along with their applications to
the use, development, and management of IS.  Language views
include: 1.  the Fregean core (denotational), 2.  the
Chomskyan grammar (generative), 3.  Piaget's schema
(cognitive), 4.  the Skinnerian response (behavioristic),
and 5.  ordinary speaking (interactionist).  Development
methods and research differ widely among the views because
their basic assumptions are different.  Various views can
and should be used in IS development because each can
increase understanding of the problem-solving context.  Each
explicates some aspect of linguistic phenomena and has a
place in some environment.  IS researchers should select the
views that best suit their goals and the given development

processes they are trying to support, so they can select
networks that are harmonious with those processes.  The
architecture of a network needs to match the company's
organizational philosophy.  Action Technologies Inc.  (AT)
has created a networking software package, the Coordinator,
whose development was driven by social processes, rather
than vice versa.  It is based explicitly on a concept of
human interaction within organizations that was defined by 2
of the company's founders.  The software developers
encapsulated the flow of speech acts into a module called
the Conversation Manager.  AT also developed the
Communications Manager.  Another research effort that
retains the primacy of human communication took place at the
Computer Research Laboratory at Tektronix Inc.  Workers have
devised an electronic mail prototype that supports a special
type of message, called an Envoy.  Envoys are intelligent
messengers that perform various tasks in the network.  At
the opposite extreme from the Coordinator are computer
networks that not only support the work of people in
organizations, but can even perform some of it.  This is one
of the potentials of distributed artificial intelligence.

change from a source other than management.  Timing of the

language and a protocol to support communication between software agents.
Based on ideas from speech act theory, we propose a semantic description
for KQML that associates descriptions of the cognitive states of agents
with the use of the language's primitives (performatives). We use this
approach to describe the semantics for the basic set of KQML performatives.
We also investigate implementation issues related to our semantic approach.
We suggest that KQML can offer an all purpose communication language for
software agents that requires no limiting pre-commitments on the agents'
structure and implementation. KQML can provide the Distributed AI,
Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving and Software Agents communities
with an all purpose language and environment for intelligent inter-agent
communication.")

standardization. This paper is written for a
technical audience concerned with standardization
issues. The author includes a list of references
for detailed study, and diagrams are provided.
``EDIFACT defines United Nations rules for
electronic data interchange for administration,
commerce and transport.'' Salminen provides a
detailed history of this process and covers the
standard components and the standardization
process under EDIFACT. ``The main objective of
beginning EDIFACT work in 1985 was to converge
the UN/ECE EDI standards and North American
domestic standard ANSI ASC X12 into a single
international EDI standard. ...To date, this goal
has not been achieved.'' The chief problems in
EDIFACT standardization are consistency between
versions and in terminology, incomplete updates,
lack of synchronization in international and
national standardization, and incomplete upward
compatibility. A key to resolving these
difficulties is the careful design of the
``maintenance database.'' For people concerned
with standardization issues, this is recommended
reading.")

    comment="This study is important because it
speaks to real issues of performance and
productivity, of profit and loss, in the context
of the information technologies that shape this
decade. Its purpose is to forecast the dominant
technological forces that will affect
organizational change in the 1990s. The procedure
for the forecast is straightforward, and the
results, though counterintuitive, are quite
fascinating and point to an emphasis on human
factors interfaces that could affect many
decision processes on resource allocation (and
reallocation) in the current decade. While
technology forecasting and technology assessment
are closely related (``one informs the other'' say
the authors), the current study is a forecast;
that is, it is to ``evaluate the likelihood of
future developments and their impact on
society...speculating on the future value and
importance of innovations.'' Many US corporations
are using the techniques of technology
forecasting to provide inputs for future
planning. This study uses a traditional approach
to the forecast, aiming at technologies that will
``enter the market place and assume a dominant
position in the 1990s.'' The technique employed is
``key informant interviews,'' and the process of
selecting the 11 experts and winnowing the
candidate technologies was done with care. The
authors devote several pages to the research
procedures and make a clear case for the method
and its results. The 11 experts are clearly
well-qualified, all being actively involved in
developing, using, and explaining present and
future information technologies. The reduced list
of technologies involved 31 entries, ranging from
CASE tools and calendaring/tickling software at
the beginning to windowing software and word
processing software at the end. In between were
technologies like desktop publishing,
hypertext/hypermedia, LANs, and expert systems.
The results are surprising. The experts
synthesize their selections into several groups.
The winners, called ``critical information
technologies,'' are two groups: human interface
technologies and communication technologies.
Human interface technologies like speech
recognition, natural language processing, voice
input, and high-end workstations are judged to be
``key,'' and mice, touch screens, light pens, and
executive information systems ``important.'' In
communications, the ``key'' technologies are voice
mail, e-mail, fax, VSAT, and EDI, and high-end
workstations with ISDN, desktop publishing, and
LANs are ``important.'' The surprising result of
this careful study is the technologies that are
considered to have lesser roles in the 1990s.
Those with ``indirect impact'' are CASE, CD ROM,
relational databases, 4GL query languages,
prototyping, 32-bit PCs, and
hypertext/hypermedia. The list of technologies
with ``limited impact'' for the 1990s contains
several surprises. This list includes stand-alone
expert systems and AI; mainframes and
minicomputers; generalized decision support
systems; computerized libraries; data extraction
and conversion software; online external database
searching techniques; PBX; and calendaring and
tickling software. Finally, a special category
called ``Not yet mature by 1990s'' includes
biomolecular computing, nanotechnology, and
neural networks. The paper throws out a gauntlet
for organizations that are planning to adopt new
technologies in the coming years, stating
specifically the ones that have the best chances
for return on investment. Since many of the
panelists have been part of the successful
adoption of technologies in the 1980s, their
views are worth considering carefully. Their
conclusion: In sum, where management understands
the potential of these high return information
technologies and takes steps to implement them,
they will be able to respond more proactively to
the expected turbulence and functional
fragmentation of the 1990s (p. 1338).")
