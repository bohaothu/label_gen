	that encompasses its own rules of morphogenesis, an immortal state

	that still haunts the minds of scientists, physicians and patients,
	a complete cure of which is still a dream to be realized. The unpredictable
	microenvironment of cancerous cells in all of its existing forms
	i.e. leukaemic cells, solid tumours and sarcomas is well documented.
	This phenomenon expressed by cancerous sites in the body poses various
	obstacles towards drug efficacy. Thus, it has become necessary to
	address briefly the issues relating to tumour physiology, its vasculature
	and angiogenesis. The information could provide insight towards the
	development of tumour-targeted drug delivery. The salient features

	Van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions as well as traditional
	covalent bonds have been considered in order to have a broader range

	provide good results when individual bond types are correlated, although
	the logarithmic model seems to be slightly better than the double
	logarithmic one. Finally, a unique equation corresponding to model
	2 has been devised to correlate all the H-X or C-X bonds.},

	the intriguing case of the barrier to the rotation about a
	
	CC triple bond. Intuitively, one expects that the barrier

	to investigate an alternative approach based on spatial assemblies
	of nonsubstituted pi-electron systems that are coupled by dipole-dipole

	have superlinear dependencies that depend on coupling energies and
	oligomer sizes. These results are well rationalized by an excitonic
	model based on N interacting three-level systems. Analytical expressions
	for one-photon and two-photon energies and absorption strengths are
	derived for linear oligomers. An accurate calculation of large exitonic

	cores was achieved by regiospecific Friedel-Crafts reactions (acetylation,

	were synthesized with amidoferrocene, amidocobaltocenium and FeCp*(eta(6)-N-alkylaniline)(+)

  abstract = {We have investigated the movement of electrons around the peripheries
	of dendrimers and between their redox termini and electrodes through
	studies of the electrochemistry of dendrimers presenting metallocenes
	(and other transition metal sandwich complexes) as terminal groups.
	Because these compounds can be stabilized in both their oxidized
	and their reduced forms, their electrochemical and chemical redox
	processes proceed without decomposition (chemical reversibility).
	Most interestingly, electrochemical studies reveal that electron
	transfer within the dendrimers and between the dendrimers and electrodes
	are both very fast processes when the branches are flexible (electrochemical
	reversibility). When the dendrimer branches are sufficiently long,
	the redox events at the many termini of the metallodendrimer are
	independent, appearing as a single wave in the cyclic voltammogram,
	because of very weak electrostatic effects. As a result, these metallodendrimers
	have applications in the molecular recognition, sending, and titration
	of anions (e.g., ATP(2-)) and cations (e.g., transition metal complexes).
	When the recognition properties are coupled with catalysis, the metallodendrimers
	function in an enzyme-like manner. For example, Pd-II can be recognized
	and titrated using the dendrimer's terminal redox centers and internal
	coordinate ligands. Redox control over the number of Pd-II species
	located within a dendrimer allows us to predetermine the number of
	metal atoms that end up in the form of a dendrimer-encapsulated Pd
	nanoparticle (PdNP). For hydrogenation of olefins, the efficiency
	(turnover frequency, TOF) and stability (turnover number, TON) depend
	on the size of the dendrimer-encapsulated PdNP catalysts, similar
	to the behavior of polymer-supported PdNP catalysts, suggesting a
	classic mechanism in which all of the steps proceed on the Pi surface.
	On the other hand, Miyaura-Suzuki carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions
	catalyzed by dendrimer-encapsulated PdNPs proceed with Ti and TONS
	that do not depend on the size of the PdNPs. Moreover these catalysts
	are more efficient when employed in lower (down to "homeopathic")
	amounts, presumably because of a leaching mechanism whereby lad atoms
	escape from the PdNP surface subsequent to oxidative addition of
	the aryl halide. Under these conditions, the "mother" PdNPs have
	greater difficulty quenching the extremely active leached Pd atoms
	because of their low concentration. Although dendrimers presenting
	catalysts at their branch termini can be recovered and reused readily,
	their inner-sphere components can lead to steric inhibition of substrate
	approach. In contrast, star-shaped catalysts do not suffer from such
	steric problems, as has been demonstrated for water-soluble dendrimers
	bearing cationic iron-sandwich termini, which are redox catalysts
	of cathodic nitrate and nitrite reduction in water. },

  title = {Síntesi de nous borats i carborans halogenats. Estudi de la seva
	reactivitat},
  school = {ICMAB-CSIC},
  year = {2002},
  abstract = {1.- S’ha dissenyat un mètode simple i ràpid per a la síntesi amb alt
	rendiment de borats
	
	halogenats de fórmula [B6X6]2- (X = Br, I).
	
	2.- S’han sintetitzat i caracteritzat carborans halogenats (iodats
	i bromats) en la posició
	
	3 del clúster d’o-carborà. Per a aquests clústers:
	
	2a.- S’han dut a terme càlculs teòrics dels desplaçaments químics
	de 11B-RMN
	
	que han ajudat a assignar els senyals als diferents àtoms de bor del
	clúster.
	
	2b.- S’ha estudiat la seva reactivitat davant reactius de Grignard.
	Això ha permès
	
	obtenir derivats alquílics i arílics a la posició 3 del clúster d’o-carborà.
	
	2c.- S’ha provat la capacitat d’un dels compostos, el 3-Iodo-1,2-dicarba-closododecaborà,
	
	de formar una sal de fenil iodoni.
	
	2d.- S’ha estudiat la reactivitat de l’enllaç B-I front a la reacció
	amb metalls.
	
	Metalls com el sodi, el pal· ladi, el coure, el niquel i el magnesi
	han portat a la
	
	reducció de l’enllaç B-I a B-H. A més, l’estudi de la reacció del
	3-Iodo-1,2-
	
	dicarba-closo-dodecaborà amb magnesi ha permès desenvolupar un nou
	mètode
	
	de reducció de l’o-carborà.
	
	2e.- S’ha provat la reactivitat del l’enllaç Cclúster-H en el 3-Iodo-1,2-dicarbacloso-
	
	dodecaborà obtenint la substitució en el carboni.
	
	2f.- Per difracció de raigs X s’ha resolt l’estructura crista· lina
	del compost 3-
	
	Iodo-1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborà. En aquesta s’ha evidenciat l’existència
	
	d’interaccions intermoleculars.
	
	Conclusions
	
	114
	
	3.- S’han sintetitzat i caracteritzat nido-carborans halogenats en
	la posició 3 del clúster
	
	via degradació parcial dels clústers halogenats closo. L’estudi d’aquest
	procés ha
	
	permès determinar, en el cas d’un clúster substituït en B3 i B6, quin
	dels dos àtoms és
	
	l’eliminat.
	
	4.- S’ha sintetitzat i caracteritzat el 3,6-I2-1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborà,
	carborà
	
	substituït en les posicions 3 i 6 del clúster d’o-carborà. Per a aquest
	clúster:
	
	4a.- La reacció amb derivats de Grignard ha permès obtenir carborans
	substituïts
	
	en les posicions 3 i 6 amb restes alquílics i arílics.
	
	4b.- El desplaçament químic i en alguns casos l’acidesa dels àtoms
	d’hidrogen
	
	units als àtoms de carboni del clúster depèn del tipus de substituent
	que es troba
	
	en les posicions 3 i 6, essent aquest efecte de tipus additiu.
	
	5.- S’han sintetitzat i caracteritzat derivats de l’o-carborà nona
	i deca-B-substituïts.
	
	Aquest últim té substituits tots els àtoms de bor del clúster:
	
	5a.- S’ha sintetitzat el derivat de l’o-carborà iodat en les posicions
	
	3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11 i 12 . La síntesi s’ha dut a terme en globalment
	dues etapes. La
	
	primera es basa en la combinació de les reaccions de degradació parcial
	i
	
	inserció que permet obtenir el clúster iodat en posició 3 i la segona
	en un atac
	
	electrofílic amb ICl sobre el clúster monosubstituït que porta a l’obtenció
	del
	
	clúster nonaiodat.
	
	5b.- S’ha sintetitzat el derivat de l’o-carborà metilat en les posicions
	3,4,5,
	
	7,8,9,10,11 i 12 en dues etapes. La primera es basa en la combinació
	de les
	
	reaccions de degradació parcial i inserció que permet obtenir el clúster
	metilat en
	
	posició 3 i la segona en un atac electrofílic amb MeI sobre el clúster
	
	monosubstituït que porta a l’obtenció del clúster nonametilat.
	
	Conclusions
	
	115
	
	5c.- S’ha sintetitzat el derivat de l’o-carborà que té les deu posicions
	de bor
	
	3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 i 12 iodades a partir del clúster d’o-carborà
	mitjançant dues
	
	etapes. La primera es basa en la combinació de les reaccions de degradació
	
	parcial i inserció que permet obtenir el clúster iodat en posicións
	3 i 6 i la
	
	segona en un atac electrofílic amb ICl sobre el clúster disubstituït
	que porta a
	
	l’obtenció del clúster per-B-iodat.
	
	5d.- Intents de sintetitzar el clúster per-B-metilat, han portat a
	un carborà
	
	octametilat. Aquest fet experimental s’ha atribuït a l’efecte dels
	grups metils
	
	sobre els àtoms de bor del clúster. Aquest efecte ha estat quantificat
	mitjançant
	
	càlculs teòrics. Es pot concloure que a mesura que augmenta el nombre
	de grups
	
	metil en el clúster, augmenta la càrrega total positiva d’aquest i
	per tant,
	
	disminueix la susceptibilitat a l’atac electrofílic.
	
	5e.- S’ha estudiat l’acidesa dels àtoms d’hidrogen units als àtoms
	de carboni del
	
	derivat per-B-iodat de l’o-carborà front la desprotonació amb diferents
	bases i la
	
	protonació de la seva base conjugada amb diferents àcids.
	
	6.- S’han sintetitzat i caracteritzat nido-carborans octa i nona-halogenats.
	L’estudi del
	
	procés de degradació parcial ha permès determinar en aquest cas, quin
	dels dos àtoms
	
	de bor B3 o B6 ha estat eliminat.
	
	7.- S’ha estudiat l’aplicació de closo-carborans halogenats en el
	camp del
	
	radiomarcatge.},

  abstract = {Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture
	reaction that occurs when
	
	boron-10, a stable isotope, is irradiated with low-energy or thermal
	neutrons (10.025 eV) to yield high
	
	LET a particles and recoiling 7Li nuclei [log + nth- PBI - 4He(a)
	+ 7Li + 2.39 MeV]. Approximately
	
	109 boron-10 atoms must be delivered to each target cell in order
	to sustain a lethal lOB(n,a)7Li reaction.
	
	If MoAbs are to be used for targeting boron-10, then it is essential
	that they recognize a surface membrane
	
	epitope that is highly expressed on tumor cells and that a large number
	of boron-10 atoms be attached
	
	to each antibody molecule. In order to heavily boronate MoAbs, we
	have utilized starburst dendrimers
	
	(SD), which are precise, spherical macromolecules composed of repetitive
	poly(amidoamin0) groups.
	
	Second- and fourth-generation dendrimers, having 12 and 48 reactive
	terminal amino groups and molecular
	
	weights of 2414 and 10 632 Da, respectively, were boronated using
	an isocyanato polyhedral borane,
	
	Na(CH3)aNBloHsNCO. The boronated starburst dendrimers (BSD), in turn,
	were derivatized with
	
	m-maleimidobenzoylN-hydroxysulfosuccinimidee ster (sulfo-MBS). The
	MoAb IB16-6, which is directed
	
	against the murine B16 melanoma, was derivatized with N-succinimidyl3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate
	
	(SPDP). The MBS-derivatized BSD and SPDP-derivatized MoAb were reacted
	to yield stable
	
	immunoconjugates. The in vivo distribution patterns of 1251-labeled
	native and boronated MoAb IB16-6
	
	and SD were studied in normal and tumor-bearing C57B1/6 mice carrying
	sc implants of the B16 melanoma.
	
	The data obtained demonstrated that SD have a propensity to localize
	in the liver and spleen and that
	
	the absolute amount appeared to be directly related to the molecular
	weight and number of reactive
	
	terminal amino groups. Further studies are required to determine whether
	the properties of the boronated
	
	dendrimers can be modified so as to reduce their hepatic and splenic
	localization.},

  abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that dipolar aprotic solvents
	
	are the media of choice in some reactions and are unique in
	
	facilitating others.3 The special solvent effects of molecules
	
	such as DMF and Me2SO are attributable to their large dielectric
	
	constants coupled with the absence of solvation by
	
	hydrogen bonding and typically manifest themselves in
	
	properties such as poor anion solvation, voracious cation
	
	solvation, and a marked hydrophilicity. For the chemist, this
	
	latter feature is unfortunate since small amounts of water in
	
	these systems can diminish314 their nucleophilicity and may
	
	even be hazardous to some operations.5 The drying of these
	
	solvents is thus of paramount importance, but in these cases,
	
	as previously,' the chemical literature contains little reliable
	
	quantitative data.
	
	We have recently developed a method of solvent water assay
	
	which utilizes a tritiated water tracer for the determination
	
	of water content.6 The method circumvents many of the
	
	problems encountered in other assay methods and has provided
	
	some new correlations on the efficiency of desiccants.lS*
	
	For example, it has been shown that, rather surprisingly, the
	
	efficiency of a given desiccant is strongly dependent upon the
	
	solvent type,' and there is thus much uncertainty in extrapolating
	
	generalizations from one solvent type to another.
	
	The method has now been applied to the desiccation of the
	
	dipolar aprotics acetone, DMF, MeZSO, and HMPT. Since the
	
	dielectric constants of these solvents range between 20.7
	
	(acetone) and 46.7 (MeZSO), their rigorous desiccation is expected
	
	to be difficult.},

	opens the way for simple processing and a new class of flat-panel

	to get a preferential anchoring of the amino groups at the external

  abstract = {Organometallic compounds have been studied with X-ray crystallography
	from their very discovery. Yet structural organometallic chemists
	were almost exclusively concerned with the molecular structure and
	stereochemistry of organometallic compounds and clusters rather than
	with their crystal structures and packing characteristics. The growing
	importance of crystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry, however,
	led to interest in the nature of the interactions that bind organometallic
	molecules into crystals. In part, these interactions are similar
	to those found in purely organic crystals because the peripheries
	of these molecules often contain organic residues. Yet molecular
	features peculiar to organometallic compounds also do lead to distinctive
	supramolecular characteristics. Most notable among these intermolecular
	interactions are hydrogen bonds. Organometallic compounds contain
	a wealth and diversity of hydrogen bonds that are without counterpart
	in the organic world. These include C-H . . .O bonds to M- C=O acceptors,
	and hydrogen bonds wherein the metal atom itself acts as a donor
	or as an acceptor. Even more exotic is the dihydrogen bond M-1-H
	. . .H-M-2. Despite this variety, all these weak interactions have
	properties that resemble those of the more familiar hydrogen bonds
	such as O-H . . .O, N-H . . .O, O-H . . .N and N-H . . .N. Other
	interactions that are distinctive to organometallic compounds are
	the agostic interaction to electron deficient metals (C-H). . .M
	and the aurophilic interaction Au . . . Au. The Cambridge Structural
	Database (CSD) is an essential tool in the analysis of weak intermolecular
	interactions. Since the number of organometallic crystal structures
	in the CSD is very large, the weakest of intermolecular interactions
	may be studied with ever-increasing degrees of reliability. Through
	such analysis one is able to obtain a more complete idea of organometallic
	crystal architecture. Crystal engineering must pass through the stage
	of analysis before crystal synthesis can be attempted and organometallic
	crystal engineering is still in its infancy. However, the progress
	made so far in understanding the nature of intermolecular interactions
	in these crystals indicates that one may expect rapid progress in
	the engineering of organometallic crystals with desired structures
	and properties. },

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the field
	of liquid crystalline dendrimers. Such a fast development is, among
	other things, driven by the multiple possibilities offered by combining
	the mesomorphic properties of single mesogenic subunits with the
	supermolecular and versatile architectures of dendrimers to yield
	a new class of highly functional materials. The induction and the
	control of the mesomorphic properties (phase type and stability)
	in dendrimers can be achieved by a dedicated molecular design which
	depends on the chemical nature and structure of both the functional
	groups and the dendritic matrix. In particular, the intrinsic connectivity
	of the dendrimer such as the multivalency of the focal core and the
	multiplicity of the branches, both controlling the geometrical rate
	of growth, or the dendritic generation, plays a crucial role and
	influences at various stages the subtle relationships between the
	supermolecular structure and the mesophase structure and stability.
	In this critical review article, an account of the various types
	of dendritic systems that form liquid-crystalline mesophases along
	with a description of the self-organization of representative case-study
	supermolecules into liquid crystalline mesophases will be discussed.
	Some basics of thermotropic liquid crystals and dendrimers will be
	given in the introduction. Then, in the following sections, selected
	examples including side-chain, main-chain, fullerodendrimers, shape-persistent
	dendrimers, supramolecular dendromesogens and metallodendrimers,
	as representative families of LC dendrimers, will be described. In
	the conclusion some further developments will be highlighted. This
	review will not cover liquid crystalline hyperbranched and dendronized
	polymers that might be considered as being somehow less structurally
	"perfect''. },

  abstract = {A great parallel exists between metal complexes of cyclopentadienyl
	and arene ligands on one side and metal complexes of the nido derivatives
	of the icosahedral o-carborane clusters. With few exceptions, the
	metal complexation in the cluster can be viewed as the substitution
	of one or more bridging hydrogen atoms by the metal. Therefore, a
	necessary requirement for the complexation is the deprotonation of
	the nido cluster to generate a coordination site for that metal.
	The reaction to remove these protons, which most probably is one
	of the most commonly done processes in boron and metallaborane chemistry,
	is barely known, and no quantitative data are available on the magnitude
	of their p K a values. With the purpose of determining the acidity
	of nido-carboranes, a procedure to calculate the p K a values of
	nido boron clusters is presented in this paper for the first time.
	To this objective, some nido clusters have been selected and their
	geometry and NMR-spectroscopic properties have been studied, giving
	a good correlation between the theoretical and experimental data
	in both geometry distances and B-11 NMR spectroscopy. Of notice is
	the result that proves that the singular carbon atom in the thermodynamic
	isomer of [C2B10H13](-) is definitely part of the cluster and that
	its connection with the C2B3 face would be better defined by adding
	additional interactions with the two boron atoms nearest to the second
	cluster carbon. The p K a values of the nido species have been calculated
	by correlating experimental p K a values and calculated reaction
	Gibbs energies Delta G(s). Some pK(a) values of importance are -4.6
	and + 13.5 for 7,8-[C2B9H13] (1) and 7,8-[C2B9H12](-) (2), respectively.},

	and Na(H2O)[3,3'-Co(8-O(CH2CH2O)(2)C(O)CH3-1,2-C2B9H10)(1',2'-C2B9H10)]
	show that the chain contributes three or two oxygen atoms for coordination
	to Na+, and interestingly, the [3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)(2)](-) moiety
	provides extra B-H coordination sites. These B-H center dot center
	dot center dot Na interactions in the solid state have also been
	confirmed by dynamic NMR studies in solution. These new polyanionic
	compounds that contain multiple carborane or metallacarborane clusters
	at their periphery may prove useful as new classes of boron neutron
	capture therapy compounds with enhanced water solubility and as a
	core to make a new class of dendrimers.},

  abstract = {A modular construction of new carbosilane dendrimers, which contain
	four and eight peripheral carborane derivatives and propyl linkages
	between the C-cluster and the Si atoms, has been developed using
	different methodologies. Regiospecific hydrosilylation of 1-C6H5-2-(CH2CHCH2)-l,2-closo-C2B10H10
	(1) and 1-CH3-2-(CH2CHCH2)-1,2-closo-C2B10H10 (2) offers an efficient
	route to molecular precursors and building blocks that can provide
	both divergent and convergent strategies for dendritic growth. First
	generations of neutral carboranyl-containing dendrimers were constructed
	by two approaches: (a) a divergent approach via hydrosilylation of
	1 and 2 with the first generation of a carbosilane dendrimer containing
	peripheral Si-H functions, Si[(CH2)(2)(CH3)(2)SiH](4), 1G-H-4, to
	give dendrimers 7 and 8, respectively; (b) a convergent strategy,
	the growth of which was initiated with the groups that will become
	the periphery of the dendrimer. In the latter, the hydrosilylation
	of the allyl group in 1 and 2 with Me2HSiCl was carried out leading
	to the formation of 1-(CH2)(3)SiCl-2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10 [R = C6H5
	(3), CH3 (4)], and subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 gave compounds
	1-(CH2)(3)SiH-2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10 [R = C6H5 (5), CH3 (6)], which
	were treated with tetravinylsilane or the core molecule to yield
	the first generation dendrimers, 7 and 8, with four carborane clusters.
	Next generation dendrimers were built up in a similar manner: (a)
	by the hydrosilylation using 1G-H-4 of the vinyl group in dendrons
	9 and 10, which themselves have been prepared from the alkenylation
	of 3 and 4 with vinylmagnesium chloride; (b) by growing the carboranylsilane
	wedges 9 and 10 to a second generation and later assembling all to
	the core tetravinylsilane to obtain dendrimers 15 and 16. In addition,
	another set of a second generation dendrimers containing eight carborane
	clusters were prepared by hydrosilylation of the vinyl groups in
	the dendrimer Si{(CH2)(2)(CH3)Si[(CHCH2)(2)]}(4), 1G-Vi(8), with
	carboranylsilane dendrons 5 and 6, that contain Si-H functions. Degradation
	reaction of the peripheral closo-carboranes in dendrimers 7 and 8
	using KOH/EtOH led to the formation of the corresponding polyanionic
	carbosilane dendrimers containing four peripheral nido-carborane
	clusters.},

	of large-area electronic applications, such as displays, sensors
	and electronic barcodes. One of the key problems with existing organic
	TFTs is their large operating voltage, which often exceeds 20 V.
	This is due to poor capacitive coupling through relatively thick
	gate dielectric layers: these dielectrics are usually either inorganic
	oxides or nitrides, or insulating polymers, and are often thicker
	than 100 nm to minimize gate leakage currents. Here we demonstrate
	a manufacturing process for TFTs with a 2.5-nm-thick molecular self-assembled
	monolayer (SAM) gate dielectric and a high-mobility organic semiconductor
	(pentacene). These TFTs operate with supply voltages of less than
	2 V, yet have gate currents that are lower than those of advanced
	silicon field-effect transistors with SiO2 dielectrics. These results
	should therefore increase the prospects of using organic TFTs in
	low-power applications (such as portable devices). Moreover, molecular
	SAMs may even be of interest for advanced silicon transistors where
	the continued reduction in dielectric thickness leads to ever greater
	gate leakage and power dissipation.},

  abstract = {A new series of porphyrin-cobaltacarborane conjugates (1-5) that contain
	four to sixteen carborane clusters per porphyrin macrocycle, were
	prepared in excellent yields (90-97 %) by means of a ring-opening
	reaction of the zwitterionic cobaltacarborane [3,3prime-Co(8-C4H8O2--1,2-C2B9H10)(1prime,2prime-C2B9H11)].
	The X-ray structure of one conjugate (3) is presented. The aggregation
	properties of these conjugates were investigated by using absorption
	and fluorescence spectrophotometry, and the stages of microcrystal
	formation were captured by using atomic force microscopy. All conjugates
	were found to aggregate in aqueous solutions, to form a broad dispersity
	of particle sizes. The cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and preferential
	sites of subcellular localization of this series of conjugates were
	evaluated in human carcinoma HEp2 cells. The extent of conjugate
	cellular uptake depends on the number of cobaltacarborane units at
	the porphyrin periphery, their distribution, and the conjugate aggregation
	behavior. Conjugates 2 and 4, bearing either two adjacent or three
	3,5-dicobaltacarboranephenyl groups, accumulated the most within
	HEp2 cells and are, therefore, the most promising boron neutron capture
	therapy agents. All conjugates showed very low dark- and photo-toxicity,
	probably due to their strong tendency for aggregation in aqueous
	solutions, and localized subcellularly within vesicles that correlated,
	to some extent, with the cell lysosomes.},

	When advantageous, these properties can be classified as a positive
	dendrimer effect. Positive dendrimer effects can arise from site
	isolation, transition state stabilization and/or dielectric effects
	in the case of core-modified dendrimers, while peripherally modified
	dendrimers usually benefit from steric crowding or cooperativity
	for catalytic residues confined to the surface of the polymer. In
	this review, the appearance of positive dendrimer effects from the

	in which empirical corrections for the dispersion energy are included,
	have been carried out. A variety of pure and hybrid density functionals
	(BP86, PW91, PBE, BLYP, OLYP, B3LYP, B1PW91, PBE0, X3LYP) have been
	considered, and our calculations indicate the PBE functional and
	its hybrid variation are well suited for the calculation of transition

	make up for a sizeable portion of the intermolecular interaction,

	SiMe2-3,3’-Co(1,2-C2B9H9)2] (8);

	have been prepared from [8,8’-m-(1’’,2’’-
	
	C6H4)-3,3’-Co(1,2-C2B9H10)2] (2).
	
	Thus, depending on the chlorosilane,
	
	the temperature and the stoichiometry
	
	of nBuLi used, it has been possible to
	
	control the number of substituents on
	
	the Cc atoms and the nature of the attached
	
	silyl function. All compounds
	
	were characterised by NMR and UV/
	
	Vis spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF
	
	mass spectrometry; [NMe4]-3, [NMe4]-
	
	4 and [NMe4]-7 were successfully isolated
	
	in crystalline forms suitable for
	
	X-ray diffraction analyses. The 4 and
	
	8 ions, which contain one bridging -m-
	
	SiMe2 group between each of the dicarbollide
	
	clusters, were unexpectedly obtained
	
	from the reaction of the monolithium
	
	salts of 1 and 2, respectively,
	
	with Me2SiHCl at 78 8C in 1,2-dimethoxyethane.
	
	This suggests that an intramolecular
	
	reaction has taken place,
	
	in which the acidic CcH proton reacts
	
	with the hydridic SiH, with subsequent
	
	loss of H2. Some aspects of this
	
	reaction have been studied by using
	
	DFT calculations and have been compared
	
	with experimental results. In addition,
	
	DFT theoretical studies at the
	
	B3LYP/6-311GACHTUNGTRENUNG(d,p) level of theory
	
	were applied to optimise the geometries
	
	of ions 1–10 and calculate their
	
	relative energies. Results indicate that
	
	the racemic mixtures, rac form, are
	
	more stable than the meso isomers. A
	
	good concordance between theoretical
	
	studies and experimental results has
	
	been achieved.},

	is placed on dendrimers functionalized with either ferrocene or cobaltocenium
	groups, because their reversible electrochemistry makes them particularly
	attractive to the author's group. Dendrimers containing multiple,
	peripheral metallocene residues are of interest to develop multivalent
	interactions with suitable receptors or receptor assemblies. With
	dendrimers containing a single metallocene at their cores, the key
	questions relate to the effects of the dendritic mass on their properties
	and degree of encapsulation or site isolation. We focused our work
	on the electrochemical properties of these dendrimers as well as
	on their use as guests in molecular recognition processes with freely
	diffusing hosts. ((c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim,

	Ph) with KOH in ethanol produces the thiolate species [1-S-2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10](-).
	These react with iodine to give the disulfide bridged dicluster (1-S-2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2)
	(R = H, Me, Ph) compounds as analytically pure, white and air-stable
	solids in high yield. Synthesis of monothioether bridged species
	is synthetically more difficult. In fact three procedures have been
	tested to obtain the thioether bridged dicluster compounds (2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2)S
	(R = Me, H, Ph) but only (2-Me-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2)S was successfully
	synthesized and characterized. Attempts to produce mixed compounds
	(1-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)S(1-R'-1,2-closo-C2B10H10), R' &NOTEQUAL;
	R', were unsuccessful. Deboronation reaction of this dicarboranylthioether
	lead, depending on the reaction conditions, to monoanionic [(2-Me-1,2-closoC(2)B(10)H(10))S(8-Me-7,8-nido-C2B9H10)](-)
	or dianionic [(8-Me-7,8-nido-C2B9H10)(2)S](2-) sulfur bridge anions.
	Deboronation of carboranyl disulfides gave the corresponding dianionic
	[(7-S-8-R-7,8-nido-C2B9H10)(2)](2-) (R = H, Me, Ph) species. This
	reaction was very dependent, however, on the reaction conditions.
	With slight variation of the reaction conditions, splitting of the
	S - S bond leading to the thiolate species with retention of the
	closo cluster was also found. Carboranyl disulfides (1-S-2-R-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2)
	(R = H, Me, Ph) do not lead to thiosulfinates R-S(O)-S-R' by oxidation
	with H2O2 or I-2 as organic disulfides do. This behaviour is attributed
	to the presence of the sulfur atom directly bonded to the carbon
	cluster that produces electronic transfer from the filled orbitals
	on the sulfur atom into the cage LUMO ( largely located on the cage
	C-c-C-c bond). This causes a depletion of electron density on the
	sulfur, thence impairing sulfur oxidation, and facilitating S-S breaking.
	Crystal structures of monothioethers (2-Me-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2)S,
	[NMe4][(2-Me-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)S(8-Me-7,8-nido-C2B9H10)] (the first
	example reported in the literature of a two cluster compound incorporating
	the closo C2B10 and the nido [C2B9](-) moieties linked by a one member
	spacer) and disulfides (1-S-1,2-closo-C2B10H11)(2), (1-S-2-Me-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2),
	(1-S-2-Ph-1,2-closo-C2B10H10)(2) are reported which support the behaviour
	of these species.},

	chemical calculations at the MP2/def2-SVP level. A comparison with
	the available X-ray crystallographic data revealed a very good agreement

	with the calculated values obtained by the ab initio/GIAO approach
	at the MP2/def2-TZVP level. It was shown that the calculated data
	reproduced the experiment very closely. Thirdly, we investigated
	experimentally the halogenation reactions of B12 and attempted to
	explain the observed ratios between the two obtained disubstituted
	products (meta/ortho ~ 4:1) by calculating their thermodynamic stabilities
	using the DFT/B3LYP method. These calculations showed the enhanced
	stability of the meta disubstituted B12 but did not explain why the
	para product had not been observed in the experiment. We thus turned
	our attention to the kinetic aspects of exo-substitution reactions
	by exploring the possible reaction pathways and transition states.
	In spite of the complexity of the plausible reaction mechanisms,
	reasonable agreement was obtained between the calculated activation
	barriers and the experimental observations concerning the halogenation
	reactions of the B6 and B12 molecules. It also allowed to exclude
	from considerations certain reaction pathways leading to the mono-
	and dihalogenated B12 and B6 species.},

	density from the available lone pairs on the substituents to the
	Psi* low-lying virtual orbitals mainly distributed around C-c, producing
	a decrease in the C-c...C-c bond order and, thereby, an increase

	conventional organic compounds. Cluster boron chemistry, in particular
	the o-carboranes, provides the possibility to modulate the C-C distance
	in an almost continuous way within the same family of compounds.
	As an example, mixed pyrrolyl/dicarbollide sandwich cobalt complexes
	derived from closo-[3-Co(eta (5)-NC4H4)-1,2-C2B9H11] (1) display
	a continuous range of C-c. . .C-c distances between 1.640(7) for
	the parent compound and 1.919(6) for closo- [3-Co(eta (5)-NC4H4)-1,2-(SCH3)(2)-1,2-C2B9H9]
	(5). Here, C, represents the cluster carbon atom. The C-c. . .C-c
	modulation was achieved merely by modifying the substituents on the
	carbon of the cluster compound. The complexes studied were synthesized
	by reaction of the appropriate closo cluster, e.g., 1,2-(SCH3)2-1,2-C2B10H10
	with a suspension of K[NC4H4] and anhydrous COCl2. The new compounds
	are closo- [3-Co(eta (5)-NC4H4)-1,2-(SCH3)(2)-1,2-C2B9H9] (5), closo-[3-Co(eta
	(5)-NC4H4)-1,2-(SCH3)(2)-1,2-C2B9H9] (6), and closo-[3-Co(eta (5)-NC4H4)-1-C6H5-1,2-C2B9H10]
	(7). Their crystal structures were elucidated by single-crystal X-ray
	diffraction and are compared with those of the parent compound closo-[3-Co(eta
	(5)-NC4H4)-1,2-C2B9H11] (1) and earlier prepared compounds closo-[3-Co(eta
	(5)-NC4H4)-1-CH3-2-C4H9-1,2-C2B9H9] (2) and closo-[3-Co(eta (5)-NC4H4)-1-C6H5-2-C3H5-1,2-C2B9H9]
	(3). Purely alkyl substituents alter the C-c. . .C-c distance of
	the parent compound very little, which implies that steric effects,
	although relevant, are not the major cause of the lengthening. In
	contrast, substituents with lone pairs alter the C-c. . .C-c distance
	substantially. Computational methods suggest that the cause of the
	elongation is the transfer of electron density from the available
	lone pairs on the substituents to the Psi* orbitals on C-c, producing
	a decrease in the C-c. . .C-c bond order and, thereby, an increase
	in the C-c. . .C-c distance.},

  abstract = {Noncovalent interactions play a dominant role in
	
	many forefront areas of modern chemistry, from
	
	materials design to molecular biology. A detailed
	
	understanding of the physical origin and scope of
	
	such interactions has become a major goal of physical
	
	organic chemistry. Compared to the more conventional
	
	interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ion pairs
	
	(salt bridges), and the hydrophobic interaction, the
	
	cation-ð interaction1 has been relatively underappreciated.
	
	It is not a new effectsexperimental support
	
	for a prominent interaction in the gas phase
	
	appeared more than 15 years ago,2 and the potentialfor such an interaction
	has always been evident from
	
	an electrostatic analysis of benzene.
	
	However, it was not until cation-ð interactions
	
	were convincingly demonstrated and quantitated in
	
	a condensed phase, and especially in aqueous media,
	
	that the potential for this broadly applicable and
	
	important noncovalent binding force was recognized.
	
	The first indications came from two directions: an
	
	analysis of protein crystal structures;3 and studies
	
	involving artificial, cyclophane receptors in aqueous
	
	media.4-6 These early observations have led to a
	
	detailed investigation of all manifestations of the
	
	cation-ð interaction, from simple, gas-phase ionmolecule
	
	complexes to large, multisubunit protein
	
	systems. It is now clear that cation-ð interactions
	
	are prominent in a wide range of systems and should
	
	be considered as an important and general noncovalent
	
	binding force.1,7
	
	The present review will provide a detailed overview
	
	of the cation-ð interaction. We will first describe
	
	the fundamental nature of the interaction, emphasizing
	
	gas-phase measurements and high level theoretical
	
	studies. These provide valuable insights into the
	
	nature of the cation-ð interaction and suggest a
	
	novel electrostatic model that can serve as a useful
	
	guide for predictions about new systems. We then
	
	describe studies using synthetic receptors, mostly
	
	cyclophane structures in aqueous media. These
	
	systems provide the best quantitative data on the
	
	cation-ð interaction in a realistic medium. Most
	
	importantly, these studies unambiguously established
	
	that a hydrophobic binding site comprised of
	
	aromatic rings can compete with full aqueous solvation
	
	in the binding of highly solvated cations. Given
	
	these results, it was then reasonable to expect that
	
	Nature would use cation-ð interactions in appropriate
	
	situations, and it is now abundantly clear that
	
	this is so. We will catalogue the many biological
	
	systems in which cation-ð interactions are, or could
	
	well be, important in molecular recognition. The
	
	recognition of the generality of the cation-ð interaction
	
	has led to a better understanding of several novel
	
	binding sites, and to new suggestions about catalytic
	
	mechanisms.
	
	Note that in discussing the cation-ð interaction,
	
	we are not considering complexes of transition metals
	
	such as Ag+, Fe+, etc. with benzene and related ð
	
	systems.8-10 It is clear that the bonding in such
	
	systems is quite different from the effect we are
	
	discussing here because of interactions with d orbitals
	
	on the metal. In fact, it seems unreasonable to
	
	consider complexes such as Ag+âââC6H6 as being
	
	dominated by noncovalent interactions. Also, the
	
	reader should keep in mind that while the emphasis
	
	will be on the binding of cations to aromatic systems,
	
	the cation-ð interaction is not restricted to themsit
	
	is not a “cation-aromatic” interaction. Ethylene,
	
	acetylene, and other simple ð systems are fully
	
	anticipated to and are documented to be involved in
	
	cation-ð interactions.},

	have been assembled non-covalently using coordination chemistry.
	Although this restriction narrows the metallodendrimer field significantly,

	and recently have been recognized as potent
	
	inhibitors of HIV protease. They are characterized by exceptional
	hydrophobicity, rigid geometry, delocalized negative
	
	charge, ion-pairing behavior, and strong acidity of their conjugated
	acids. The completely novel phenomenon, association
	
	of these promising pharmaceutical tectons in aqueous solutions, is
	described here. The behavior of two structural types
	
	of metallacarboranes, [bis(1,2-dicarbollide)cobaltate(1-)] and bis[(3)-1,2-dicarbollylcobalt]-(3,6)-1,2-dicarbacanastide-
	
	(2-)], in aqueous solution was studied by a combination of static
	and dynamic light scattering and microscopy
	
	methods. Spherical aggregates with radii of ca. 100 nm and fairly
	monodisperse nanostructures were found in aqueous
	
	solutions. The behavior of nanoaggregates is fairly complex and depends
	on the concentration and aging of the
	
	solutions. The particles are stabilized in the solution by counterions.
	The formation of larger clusters upon dilution
	
	of bis(1,2-dicarbollide)cobaltate(1-) solutions was observed. The
	secondary aggregation can be suppressed by addition
	
	of NaCl. Gel permeation chromatography measurements of sodium bis(1,2-dicarbollide)cobaltate(1-)
	show that the
	
	majority of matallacarborane molecules form nanoaggregates and only
	a small amount of the metallacarborane remains
	
	molecularly soluble or forms small oligomers.},

	similar charges are found between the ortho-hydrogen atoms in planar
	biphenyl, between the hydrogen atoms bonded to the C1-C4 carbon atoms
	in phenanthrene and other angular polybenzenoids, and between the
	methyl hydrogen atoms in the cyclobutadiene, tetrahedrane and indacene
	molecules corseted with tertiary-tetra-butyl groups. It is shown
	that each such H-H interaction, rather than denoting the presence
	of "nonbonded steric repulsions", makes a stabilizing contribution
	of up to 10 kcal mol(-1) to the energy of the molecule in which it
	occurs. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules-the physics of an
	open system-demonstrates that while the approach of two bonded hydrogen
	atoms to a separation less than the sum of their van der Waals radii
	does result in an increase in the repulsive contributions to their
	energies, these changes are dominated by an increase in the magnitude
	of the attractive interaction of the protons with the electron density
	distribution, and the net result is a stabilizing change in the energy.
	The surface virial that determines the contribution to the total
	energy decrease resulting from the formation of the H-H interatomic
	surface is shown to account for the resulting stability. It is pointed
	out that H-H interactions must be ubiquitous, their stabilization
	energies contributing to the sublimation energies of hydrocarbon
	molecular crystals, as well as solid hydrogen. H-H bonding is shown
	to be distinct from "dihydrogen bonding", a form of hydrogen bonding
	with a hydridic hydrogen in the role of the base atom. },

	atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analysis has been applied to an anthraquinone,
	1,8-(MeZ)2ATQ (1 (Z=Se), 2 (Z=S), and 3 (Z=O)), and a 9-methoxyanthracene
	system, 9-MeO-1,8-(MeZ)2ATC (4 (Z=Se), 5 (Z=S), and 6 (Z=O)), as
	well as 1-(MeZ)ATQ (7 (Z=Se), 8 (Z=S), and 9 (Z=O)) and 9-MeO-1-(MeZ)ATC
	(10 (Z=Se), 11 (Z=S), and 12 (Z=O)). The total electronic energy
	density (Hb(rc)) at the bond critical points (BCPs), an appropriate
	index for weak interactions, has been examined for 5c-6e C2Z2O and
	3c-4e CZO interactions of the np(O)sdotsdotsdotsigma*(Z&bond;C) type
	in 1-12. Some hydrogen-bonded adducts were also re-examined for convenience
	of comparison. The total electronic energy densities varied in the
	following order: OsdotsdotsdotO (3: Hb(rc)=0.0028 au)=OsdotsdotsdotO
	(6: 0.0028 au)&gt;OsdotsdotsdotO (9: 0.0025 au)geNNsdotsdotsdotHF
	(0.0024 au)geOsdotsdotsdotO (12: 0.0023 au)&Gt;H2OsdotsdotsdotHOH
	(0.0015 au)&gt;SsdotsdotsdotO (8: 0.0013 au)=SsdotsdotsdotO (2: 0.0013
	au)geSsdotsdotsdotO (11: 0.0012 au)=SsdotsdotsdotO (5: 0.0012 au)&gt;HFsdotsdotsdotHF
	(0.0008 au)=SesdotsdotsdotO (10: 0.0008 au)=SesdotsdotsdotO (4: 0.0008
	au)geSesdotsdotsdotO (1: 0.0007 au)geSesdotsdotsdotO (7: 0.0006 au)&Gt;HCNsdotsdotsdotHF
	(-0.0013 au). Hb(rc) values for SsdotsdotsdotO were predicted to
	be smaller than the hydrogen bond of H2OsdotsdotsdotHOH and Hb(rc)
	values for SesdotsdotsdotO are very close to or slightly smaller
	than that for HFsdotsdotsdotHF in both the ATQ and 9-MeOATC systems.
	In the case of Z=Se and S, Hb(rc) values for 5c-6e C2Z2O interactions
	are essentially equal to those for 3c-4e CZO if Z is the same. The
	results demonstrate that two np(O)sdotsdotsdotsigma*(Z&bond;C) 3c-4e
	interactions effectively connect through the central np(O) orbital
	to form the extended hypervalent 5c-6e system of the sigma*(C&bond;Z)sdotsdotsdotnp(O)sdotsdotsdotsigma*(Z&bond;C)
	type for Z=Se and S in both systems. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
	revealed that ns(O) also contributes to some extent. The electron
	charge densities at the BCPs, NBO analysis, and the total energies
	calculated for 1-12, together with the structural changes in the
	PhSe derivatives, support the above discussion.},

	dendrimers encapsulating photosensitizers composed of a center dye
	molecule surrounded by poly(benzyl ether) dendrons with ionic peripheral
	groups as a new type of photosensitizer (PS) for photodynamic therapy
	(PDT). Dendrimers encapsulating porphyrin and with ionic peripheral
	groups (DPs) spontaneously formed polyion complex (PIC) micelles
	through electrostatic interactions with oppositely-charged block
	copolymers, and showed no self-quenching of the center dye molecule
	inside the micellar core due to a unique DP structure, leading to
	remarkable in vitro photocytotoxicity. The DP-incorporated micelles
	showed successful treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
	in rats without any sign of side effects. Thus, the DP-incorporated
	micelles are expected to be an innovative PS formulation for successful
	PDT against ophthalmic diseases. In this paper, we also review polymeric
	micelles incorporating phthalocyanine core dendrimers (DPc) for cancer
	PDT and novel light-responsive supramolecular gene carriers integrated
	with DPc for site-directed transfection in vivo. },

	by reaction of [10-SMe2-7,8-nido-C2B9H10](-) with NiCl(2)(.)6H(2)O,
	CoCl2, [RuCl2(dmso)(4)] and [FeClAdppe)], respectively. Reduction
	of 2(+) with metallic Zn leads to the neutral and isolable complex
	commo-[3,3'-Co(8-SMe2-1,2-C2B9H10)(2)] (3). Theoretical calculations
	using the ZINDO/1 semiempirical method show three energy minima for
	complexes 1-3 and 5 that agree with the presence of three different
	rotamers in solution at low temperature, while four relative energy
	minima have been found for 4. The calculated rotational energy barriers
	for complexes 1-5 have been found in the range 5.2 +/- 0.2 and 11.5
	+/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1). These values are in agreement with the experimental
	data calculated for complexes 2(+) and 5. Only one rotamer is found
	in the X-ray crystal structure of complexes 1-3, while two are observed
	for 4. Neutral complexes 1, 3 and 4 exhibit a gauche conformation,
	whereas a cisoid conformation is found for the 2(+) ion. Rotamers
	evident from X-ray diffraction studies are in agreement with the
	global energy minimum calculated by the ZINDO/1 method. The electrochemical
	studies conducted on 1, 3, 4 and 5 support the proposal that the
	charge-compensated ligand [10-SMe2-7,8-nido-C2B9H10](-) stabilises
	lower oxidation states in metals than the dianionic [7,8-nido-C2B9H11](2-)
	and even the [C5H5]- ligands.},

	identifying genes responsible for a plethora of genetic, infectious
	and metabolic diseases with the vision that therapies can then be
	developed. Although achieving a therapeutic intervention by gene
	delivery is perfectly feasible, the practical approach to achieving
	such a goal, at least in vivo, has proved far more challenging. Employing
	viruses as gene vectors has to-date proven to be the most effective
	method of delivery however concerns have emerged about both the short
	and long-term risks they pose. These fears being confirmed by incidents
	which led to the tragic deaths of subjects believed to have been
	triggered by adeno- & retroviral vectors used in clinical trials.
	This prompted many in the field to turn their research focus towards
	developing non-viral vectors deemed not only to be safer (non-immunogenic)
	than their viral counterparts but with a greater gene loading capacity.
	Polycationic dendrimers (PCDs) as vectors for this purpose have attracted
	significant interest due to their ease of synthesis, versatility

	bpy-PTZ = 10-(2,2'-bipyfidin-4-yl)methyl)phenothiazine). Compound
	1 can be viewed as an integrated light-harvesting antenna-reaction
	center species, in that the {Os{(mu-2,3-dpp)Ru(bpy)(2)}(3)}(8+) subunit
	is an efficient antenna system, coupled to well-known electron donor
	subunits, the phenothiazine (PTZ) moieties. The absorption spectrum,
	redox behavior, and luminescence behavior (both at room temperature
	in fluid solution and at 77 K in rigid matrix) of 1 have been investigated
	and compared with the properties of the parent [Os{(mu-2,3-dpp)Ru(bpy)(2)}(3)](8+)
	complex (2). The absorption spectrum and redox behavior confirm that
	1 behaves as a supramolecular, multicomponent species, in that each
	subunit (including the phenothiazine donor groups) is only slightly
	perturbed by the others. Analogously to what happens in the model
	complex 2, the light absorbed by the peripheral Ru(II) chromophores
	is transferred to the Os(II) core: however, the luminescence of the
	Os(II) core is efficiently quenched in 1 via moderately exoergonic
	reductive electron transfer by the peripheral phenothiazine donors,
	in spite of the presence of the intermediate Ru(II) centers. The
	quenching process becomes inefficient at 77 K. (c) 2006 Elsevier

  abstract = {Abstract: The hydrogen bond (HB) basicity of a series of ylides containing
	nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon as heavy atoms, as well as the influence
	of the formation of the HB complexes on their structure, has been
	studied. In addition, in this paper we propose the formation of some
	rather strong HBs (that could be considered low-barrier hydrogen
	bonds, LBHBs) between ylides and different neutral molecules. The
	ylides chosen for the study were H3N+-N-H, Me3N+-N-H, H2O+-N-H, Me2O+-N-H,
	H2O+-O-, Me2O+-O-, and Me3N+-C-H2. As HB donors, classical donors
	such as HF, HCN, and HCCH were used. The analysis of the protonation
	energies of the ylides and the optimized geometries, interaction
	energies, and characteristics of the electron density of the complexes
	shows that these ylides are very good HB acceptors, forming stable
	complexes even with weak HB donors. With strong donors, when the
	proton transfer did not take place, very strong HBs were formed with
	quite large interaction energies and very short HB distances which
	could be considered as LBHBs. Moreover, we have found that the sign
	of the Laplacian of the electron density at the bond critical point
	(2BCP) and that of the energy density (HBCP) could characterize the
	strength of HBs. Thus, weak HBs (EI < 12.0 kcal/mol) show both 2BCP
	and HBCP > 0, and medium HBs (12.0 < EI < 24.0 kcal/mol) show 2BCP
	> 0 and HBCP < 0, while strong HBs (and therefore LBHBs; EI > 24.0
	kcal/mol) show both 2BCP and HBCP < 0.},

  abstract = {Successful treatment of cancer by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)
	requires the selective delivery of (10)B to constituent cells within
	a tumor. The expression of the folate receptor is amplified in a
	variety of human tumors and potentially might serve as a molecular
	target for BNCT. In the present study we have investigated the possibility
	of targeting the folate receptor on cancer cells using folic acid
	conjugates of boronated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing 3rd
	generation polyamidoamine dendrimers to obtain (10)B concentrations
	necessary for BNCT by reducing the uptake of these conjugates by
	the reticuloendothelial system. First we covalently attached 12-15
	decaborate clusters to 3rd generation polyamidoamine dendrimers.
	Varying quantities of PEG units with varying chain lengths were then
	linked to these boronated dendrimers to reduce hepatic uptake. Among
	all prepared combinations, boronated dendrimers with 1-1.5 PEG(2000)
	units exhibited the lowest hepatic uptake in C57BL/6 mice (7.2-7.7%
	injected dose (ID)/g liver). Thus, two folate receptor-targeted boronated
	3rd generation polyamidoamine dendrimers were prepared, one containing
	approximately 15 decaborate clusters and approximately 1 PEG(2000)
	unit with folic acid attached to the distal end, the other containing
	approximately 13 decaborate clusters, approximately 1 PEG(2000) unit,
	and approximately 1 PEG(800) unit with folic acid attached to the
	distal end. In vitro studies using folate receptor (+) KB cells demonstrated
	receptor-dependent uptake of the latter conjugate. Biodistribution
	studies with this conjugate in C57BL/6 mice bearing folate receptor
	(+) murine 24JK-FBP sarcomas resulted in selective tumor uptake (6.0%
	ID/g tumor), but also high hepatic (38.8% ID/g) and renal (62.8%
	ID/g) uptake, indicating that attachment of a second PEG unit and/or
	folic acid may adversely affect the pharmacodynamics of this conjugate.},

  abstract = {Metal-containing dendrimers (metallodendrimers) have attracted a great
	deal of attention recently and their study is becoming a growing
	field. Many workers have entered the field and it is rapidly developing.
	In this review, the preparation, characterisation and applications
	of metal-containing dendrimers are discussed. The principal methodologies
	for the preparation of dendrimers are first demonstrated and then
	the derivatisation of organic dendrimers to form suitable potential
	ligands is presented. Finally the formation of transition-metal complexes
	of the dendrimers is discussed. The manuscript is organised such
	that the metallodendrimers are discussed by donor element in the
	dendrimer. As one might expect, phoshine and nitrogen-donor complexes
	have dominated this initial phase of synthesis. However, there are
	reports of metallodendrimers with a wide variety of donor atoms.
	In the few years since the first metallodendrimers were prepared,
	the field has moved rapidly towards potential applications, and this
	has been noted. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

	a clear picture of the effect of complexation on the P Cc-Cc-P fragments

	results in clear closing in the P-Cc-C, angles and shortening of

	torsion angle. Furthermore, complexation brings along shortening
	of the P-Cc bonds with concomitant increase of covalency, as revealed
	by atoms-in-molecules calculations. Although there is also change
	in the Cc Cc distance in the cage, no significant change is involved
	in the bonding. These findings are compared with the results obtained
	by single-crystal X-ray study for [PdCl2(1,2-((PPr2)-Pr-1)(2)-1,2-C2B10H10)]

  abstract = {About forty percent of newly developed drugs are rejected by the pharmaceutical
	industry and will never benefit a patient because of poor bioavailability
	due to low water solubility and/or cell membrane permeability. New
	delivery technologies could help to overcome this challenge. Nanostructures
	with uniform and well-defined particle size and shape are of eminent
	interest in biomedical applications because of their ability to cross
	cell membranes and to reduce the risk of premature clearance from
	the body. The high level of control over the dendritic architecture
	(size, branching density, surface functionality) makes dendrimers
	ideal carriers in these applications. Many commercial small molecule
	drugs with anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity
	have been successfully associated with dendrimers such as poly(amidoamine)
	{(PAMAM),} poly(propylene imine) {(PPI} or {DAB)} and poly(etherhydroxylamine)
	{(PEHAM)} dendrimers, either via physical interactions or through
	chemical bonding ([`]prodrug approach'). Targeted delivery is possible
	via targeting ligands conjugated to the dendrimer surface or via
	the enhanced permeability and retention {(EPR)} effect. The biocompatibility
	of dendrimers follows patterns known from other small particles.
	Cationic surfaces show cytotoxicity; however, derivatization with
	fatty acid or {PEG} chains, reducing the overall charge density and
	minimizing contact between cell surfaces and dendrimers, can reduce
	toxic effects.},

	uses adapted delocalized coordinates (Int J Quantum Chem 2006, 106,
	2536) for efficient geometry optimizations of equilibrium and transition-state
	structures, where both weak and strong coordinates may be present.
	The Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program is used for providing
	density functional theory and MM energies and gradients, while an
	interface to the ORCA program is available for including RHF, MP2,
	or semiempirical descriptions. The QUILD optimization setup reduces
	the number of geometry steps needed for the Baker test-set of 30
	organic molecules by ?30% and for a weakly-bound test-set of 18 molecules
	by ?75% compared with the old-style optimizer in ADF, i.e., a speedup
	of roughly a factor four. We report two examples of using geometry
	optimizations with numerical gradients, for spin-orbit relativistic
	ZORA and for excited-state geometries. Finally, we show examples

  abstract = {Reaction of [Rh(acac)(cod)] with 1 equivalent of HClO4 and subsequent
	treatment with tetramethylammonium or cesium salts of [7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10](-)
	anions affords [Rh(7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)-(cod)] (1: R, R' = Ph;
	2: R = Ph, R' = Me; 3. R = Et, R' = Me). The structure of 1 has been
	determined by crystallographic studies. The Rh(I) has a normal four-coordinated
	square planar geometry and the carborane ligand is bonded to the
	metal by means of a S-Rh and a B(11)-H-Rh bond. The cod ligand fulfills
	the coordination sphere of the metal with two olefin-Rh bonds. Variable-temperature
	H-1{B-11} NMR experiments indicate that 1 undergoes B-H/B-H-Rh exchange
	coupled with rotation of the [Rh(cod)](+) moiety. This dynamic process
	appears to involve exclusively the B(11)-Hgroup. The,presence of
	two species that exchange at room temperature is detected for complexes
	2 and 3. A structure analogous to 1 is suggested for the major species,
	whereas the minor species appears to involve a [Rh(cod)](+) fragment
	bonded to the cage by a single S-Rh bond. Complexes 1-3 rearrange
	in solution to give [Closo-3-(eta(3)-C8H13)-1-SR-2-R'-3,1,2-RhC2B9H9]
	(4: R, R' = Ph; 5: R = Ph, R' = Me;6: R = Et, R' = Me). The crystal
	structure of 4 reveals lack of bonding between C(1)-C(2) and the
	cluster adopts a pseudocloso geometry. The weighted average B-11{H-1}
	NMR chemical shift of 5 and 6 suggests that these clusters have a
	normal close structure. Kinetic studies of the reactions 2 - 5 and
	3 - 6 showed a common first-order rate constant for the two reactions.
	Complexes 2 and 3 in the presence of 1 equivalent of PPh3 present
	similar activity in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to the parent
	diphosphine complexes [Rh(7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)]. The closo-cyclooctenyl
	complexes 4 and 5 exhibit higher activity than the parent exo-nido
	isomers in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene.},

  abstract = {Forced exo-nide rhoda and ruthenacarboranes containing monothio and
	monophosphinocarboranes have been tested as catalyst precursors in
	different catalytic reactions. The catalyst precursors employed were
	[Rh(7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)] (R=Ph, Et; R'=Ph, Me), [Rh(7-PR2-X-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)2]
	(R=Ph, Et, Pr-i; R'=H, Me), [Rh(7-PPh2-8-Me-7,8-C2B9H10)(cod)], [Rh(7-SR-8-R'-7,
	8-C2B9H10)(cod)], [RuX(7-PR2-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)] (X = Cl,
	H; R = Ph; R' = H, Me, Ph) and [RuCl(7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)
	(R=Ph, Et; R'= Me, Ph). These complexes are obtained by the reaction
	of the tetramethylammonium or cesium salt of the nide ligand with
	Rh(I) or Ru(II) complexes incorporating ancillary ligands. Although
	two molecular structures are possible, the close and the exo-nido,
	only the exo-nido tautomer is generally formed. The cluster is coordinated
	to the metal through the S or P atom and one or two B-H-M interactions,
	depending on the metal. These exo-nido rhoda and ruthenacarboranes
	have been shown to catalyze in very good yield the hydrogenation
	of terminal alkenes but they are not active in the hydrogenation
	of internal alkenes. Both rhoda-monothio and monophosphinocarboranes
	present comparable activity at P = 45 bar and T = 66 degreesC, in
	the hydrogenation and isomerization of I-hexene. However, while the
	monothioether precursors are active at P = 1 atm and T = 25 degreesC,
	the monophosphino exhibited a very low activity. Ruthenamonophosphinocarboranes
	are also active in the hydrogenation of l-hexene, with a higher selectivity
	that the respective rhodacarboranes. On the other hand, [Rh(7-PPh2-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)
	(R' = H, Me) catalyze the hydrogenation of methacycline to doxycycline
	with high yield (ca. 100%) and very high diastereoselectivity, ruthenacarboranes
	are not active. All these complexes are recoverable after completion
	of the catalytic reaction. These exo-nino rhoda and ruthenacarboranes
	displayed a very low activity in the hydrogenation of internal alkenes,
	however, the close species [closo-3-(C8H13)-1-SR-2-R'-3,2,1-RhC2B9H9]
	(R = Ph; R' = Me, Ph) obtained from [Rh(7-SR-8-R'-7,8-C2B9H10)(cod)]
	were very efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene
	exhibiting higher activity than the parent exo-nido isomers. In addition
	to hydrogenation, exo-nino rhoda and ruthenamonothio and monophosphinocarboranes
	have also been tested as catalyst precursors in the insertion of
	carbenes to C=C and O-H bonds. The rhodamonophosphinocarboranes exhibited
	a high activity and similar stereoselectivity for the cyclopropanation
	of olefines (80-90%) and represent the first example of Rh(I) cyclopropanation
	catalysts. Furthermore, ruthenacarboranes are excellent cyclopropanation
	catalysts for activated olefins such as styrene and their derivatives
	while the cyclopropane yields were lower for cyclic olefins and terminal
	linear monoolefines (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We present the theoretical and technical foundations of the Amsterdam
	Density Functional (ADF) program with a survey of the characteristics
	of the code (numerical integration, density fitting for the Coulomb
	potential, and STO basis functions). Recent developments enhance
	the efficiency of ADF (e.g., parallelization, near order-N scaling,
	QM/MM) and its functionality (e.g., NMR chemical shifts, COSMO solvent
	effects, ZORA relativistic method, excitation energies, frequency-dependent
	(hyper)polarizabilities, atomic VDD charges). In the Applications
	section we discuss the physical model of the electronic structure
	and the chemical bond, i.e., the Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (MO)
	theory, and illustrate the power of the Kohn-Sham MO model in conjunction
	with the ADF-typical fragment approach to quantitatively understand
	and predict chemical phenomena. We review the ?Activation-strain
	TS interaction? (ATS) model of chemical reactivity as a conceptual
	framework for understanding how activation barriers of various types
	of (competing) reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be controlled,
	for example, in organic chemistry or homogeneous catalysis. Finally,
	we include a brief discussion of exemplary applications in the field
	of biochemistry (structure and bonding of DNA) and of time-dependent
	density functional theory (TDDFT) to indicate how this development
	further reinforces the ADF tools for the analysis of chemical phenomena.

	The structure of [Rh(7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)] has been determined
	by crystallographic studies. Rh(I) has a normal four-coordinated
	square-planar geometry. The carborane ligand is bonded to the metal
	by means of a P-Rh and a B(11)-H-Rh bond. Two PPh3 ligands fulfill
	the coordination sphere of the metal. The spectroscopic data indicate
	analogous structures for the rest of the complexes. [Rh(7-SPh-8-Me-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)]
	reacts with L = PPh3, PMePh2, and PEt3 to give the salts [RhL4][7-SPh-8-Me-7,8-C2B9H10].
	[Rh(7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)] does not react with PPh3, but
	it does react with L = PMePh2, PMe2Ph, and PEt3 to give different
	substitution products depending on the complex:phosphine ratio: [Rh(7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)L]
	at the ratio 1:1, [Rh(7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10)L-2] at the ratio 1:2,
	and [RhL4][7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10] at ratios higher than 1:3. Both
	the thioether and the phosphino families catalyze the hydrogenation
	of 1-hexene to n-hexane. The thioether family is an active catalyst
	at P = 1 bar and T = 25 degrees C, whereas the phosphino family requires
	higher temperatures and pressures. The hydrogenation of 2-hexenes
	proceeds much more slowly than for 1-hexene. Both catalytic systems
	are recoverable upon completion of reaction. [Rh(7-PPh2-8-H-7,8-C2B9H10)(PPh3)(2)]
	and [Rh(7-PPh2-8-Me-7,8-C(2)B9H(10))(PPh3)(2)] catalyze the hydrogenation
	of the antibiotic precursor methacycline to doxycycline with high
	yield and very high diastereoselectivity (ca. 100%) for the pharmacologically
	important molecule. The other possible isomer epi-doxycycline was
	not observed in any case.},

	analyzed with the help of Bader's topological theory of atoms in

	shows that the chemical and physical properties of the two types

	at the metal is considered. The Taylor and Hall model is supported
	by the CDA results for the neutral compounds. This model suggests
	that the metal-carbene bonds in Fischer-type complexes are due to
	donor-acceptor interactions between the metal fragment and singlet
	carbenes, while Schrock-type complexes have normal covalent bonds

	as a boron delivery agent for neutron capture therapy (NCT) of brain
	tumors. As determined by 125I-cetuximab radioligand binding assays,
	F98 rat glioma cells, which had been transfected with the gene encoding
	EGFR (F98EGFR), expressed 1.60 +/- 0.13 x 10(5) receptor sites/cell
	with a Ka = 1.64 +/- 0.32 x 10(8) M-1). F98 cells transfected with

	a Ka = 2.18 +/- 0.54 x 10(9) M-1 compared to background levels expressed

	column. On the basis of the relative concentration ratios of boron
	and protein, there were approximately 1100 boron atoms per molecule
	of cetuximab with only a slight reduction of Ka. The localization
	of C225-G5-B1100 or G5-B1100 in rats bearing intracerebral implants
	of either F98EGFR or F98WT gliomas was determined 24 h following
	direct intratumoral (i.t.) injection at which time 92.3 +/- 23.3
	micrograms B/g tumor was localized in F98EGFR gliomas versus 36.5
	+/- 18.8 micrograms B/g tumor in F98WT gliomas and 13.4 +/- 6.1 micrograms
	in normal brain. In contrast, only 6.7 +/- 3.6 micrograms B/g tumor
	of G5-B1100 was localized in F98EGFR gliomas following i.t. injection,
	thereby demonstrating specific molecular targeting of EGFR. Based
	on these data, BNCT studies will be initiated in F98EGFR glioma bearing
	rats to evaluate C225-G5-B1100 for the treatment of intracerebral
	brain tumors.},

	powerful in rationalizing small adjustments in structural and electronic
	modification at the metal center. This success has confirmed that
	the entire 59Co chemical shift range may be predicted with reasonable
	confidence. The charge-transfer mechanism has also been established
	on the basis of the correlations between the 59Co chemical shifts
	and the relative contribution of cobalt-3d orbitals to second-order
	interaction energies, as well as structure parameters. The shielding
	tensor results confirmed that the structure distortions occurring
	in these supercomplexes are the direct consequence of the second-sphere
	interaction resulting from site-symmetry being lowered at cobalt.
	Thus, the degeneracy of the electron energy state (1T1g) at cobalt
	has been lifted, resulting in splitting of the energy levels.},

	it occurs between aromatics and divalent metal cations, has been
	successfully differentiated from the normal cation-pi intermolecular
	interactions. Our findings were based on the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
	calculations and Morokuma decomposition analyses on the complexes
	formed by substituted benzenes with alkaline metal and alkaline earth
	metal ions. In comparison with the common cation-pi intermolecular
	interaction, the cation-pi bond in the complexes of either Be2+ or
	Mg2+ with the aromatics has its own characteristics: (a) short bond
	lengths, (b) very strong binding strength, (c) significant nonelectrostatic
	interaction that constitutes more than 50% of the total binding strength,
	(d) obvious cation-pi orbital interaction, and (e) special orbital
	interaction pattern that only the pi orbitals of the aromatics interact
	with the s, p(x), and p(y) atomic orbitals of metal cations for forming
	bonding MOs. While the electrostatic interaction is significantly
	affected by the nature of the substituents attached to the benzene,
	the nonelectrostatic interaction and orbital interaction are not.
	Furthermore, the total binding strength and electrostatic interaction
	are well correlated with the Hammett electronic parameters. This
	structural and thermochemical information is highly useful in identifying
	cation-pi bonds. Moreover, they are equally helpful for modifying
	current force fields in reproducing this unusual chemical bond that
	is commonly encountered in both chemical and biological systems.},

	to create supramolecular systems. The early focus is on host-guest
	chemistry where molecular recognition may occur within the dendrimer
	interior or at its surface. Interior binding may be directed, for
	example, by a specific group at the dendrimer core, or it may be
	a nonspecific hydrophobic effect (e. g., dendrimer as unimolecular
	micelle). Molecular recognition at the "surface" is distinguished
	by the large number of end-groups and the potential for multivalent
	interactions. The nanoscopic size and recognition abilities of dendrimers
	make them ideal building blocks for self-assembly and self-organization
	systems. The review will focus on ways in which dendrimers may be
	formed by self-assembly and ways in which preformed dendrimers may
	interact with one another. Two types of self-organizing systems will
	be illustrated: liquid crystalline dendrimers and dendrimers organized
