                     analysis first subjects the texture to a filter 
                     bank, followed by the computation of energy 
                     measures, e.g. through local variance estimation. 
                     As shown by Unser in 1986, the filter bank 
                     application is equivalent to a linear 
                     transformation of the grey values of neighbouring 
                     pixels. In this contribution, we derive a further 
                     linear relationship between the local variances of 
                     the filter outputs and the autocorrelation 
                     function of the texture process. Furthermore, we 
                     examine how the filter bank approach is related to 
                     another method based on multifiltering, namely 
                     that one using quadrature filter pairs, by means 
                     of which the amplitude envelopes of the filtered 
                     texture signal can be obtained. It is shown that 
                     the texture energy method can be understood as the 
                     equivalent of an envelope detector receiver 
                     commonly used in AM communication techniques. 
                     Feature images provided by the texture energy 
                     method are compared with their counterparts 
                     resulting from the quadrature filter approach, and 
                     criteria helping to decide when to use which one 
                     of the methods are given.",

                     adapted to solve difficult geometric matching

                     mapping between a line segment model and image

                     presented have been used for robot navigation, 
                     photo interpretation, and scene understanding. 
                     This paper explores how local search performs as

                     estimate run-time growth as a function of problem 
                     size. Both polynomial and exponential growth

                     different sensors, or from different viewpoints. 
                     Virtually all large systems which evaluate images 
                     require the registration of images, or a closely 
                     related operation, as an intermediate step. 
                     Specific examples of systems where image 
                     registration is a significant component include 
                     matching a target with a real-time image of a 
                     scene for target recognition, monitoring global

                     and aligning images from diffrent medical 
                     modalities for diagnosis. Over the years, a broad 
                     range of techniques has been developed for various 
                     types of data and problems. These techniques have 
                     been independently studied for several different 
                     applications, resulting in a large body research. 
                     This paper organizes this material by establishing 
                     the relationship between the variations in the 
                     images and the type of registration techniques 
                     which can most appropriately be applied. Three 
                     major types of variations are distinguished. The 
                     first type are the variations due to the 
                     differences in acquisition which cause the images 
                     to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial 
                     transformation is found which will remove these 
                     variations. The class of transformations which 
                     must be searched to find the optimal 
                     transformation is determined by knowledge about 
                     the variations of this type. The transformation 
                     class in turn influences the general technique 
                     that should be taken. The second type of 
                     variations are those which are also due to 
                     differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled 
                     easily such as lighting and atmospheric 
                     conditions. This type usually effects intensity 
                     values, but they may also be spatial, such as 
                     perspective distortions. The third type of 
                     variations are differences in the images that are 
                     of interest such as object movements, growths, or 
                     other scene changes. Variations of the second and 
                     third type are not directly removed by 
                     registration, but they make registration more 
                     difficult since an exact match is no longer 
                     possible. In particular, it is critical that 
                     variations of the third type are not removed. 
                     Knowledge about the characteristics of each type 
                     of variation effect the choice of feature space, 
                     similarity measure, search space, and search 
                     strategy which will make up the final technique. 
                     All registration techniques can be viewed as 
                     different combinations of these choices. This 
                     framework is useful for understanding the merits 
                     and relationships between the wide variety of 
                     existing techniques and for assisting in the 
                     selection of the most suitable technique for a 
                     specific problem.",

                     of t results in minimization of the expected area 
                     of the symmetric difference between the pure 
                     signal and the output of the reconstructed 
                     T-opening applied to the noisy signal. There is no 
                     demand of similarity between filter and image 
                     generators. The general theory does not require 
                     grains to be nonintersecting. When there is grain 
                     intersection, overlapping is statiscally modeled 
                     in a manner compatible with the assumption that 
                     the binary image has resulted from thresholding an 
                     image of touching or partially overlapping blobs. 
                     The watershed is postulated as canonical 
                     segmentation procedure and filtering is performed 
                     relative to the segmented image. Error 
                     minimization is more difficult when there is grain 
                     intersection because the random geometry of the 
                     segmented grains must be described as a function 
                     of input geometry, the intersection model, and the 
                     effect of the segmentation.",

                     developed. It utilizes a neighbourhood graph in 
                     order to control the search for matching edge 
                     pairs. Information about neighbourhood relations 
                     supports the establishment and the reliability of 
                     matches. The matching method does not exploit any 
                     geometric constraints and is therefore applicable 
                     to a wide range of related problems, such as 
                     finding correspondence between images and maps. 
                     The most important advantages of the matching 
                     algorithm are its independence from human 
                     interaction and the use of curved edge segments. 
                     The proposed method was implemented in the form of 
                     a modular software package on a Sun workstation 
                     using the XWindow user interface. The complete 
                     software package forms a softcopy photogrammetric

                     an accurate 3-D model of man-made structures and 
                     natural terrain. Some of the most challenging 
                     problems in cartographic feature extraction occur 
                     in dense urban areas where the level of detail and 
                     scene clutter greatly complicate traditional map 
                     compilation techniques. In this paper, we describe 
                     experiments toward a comprehensive stereo analysis 
                     system to recover the 3-D description of an urban 
                     area using high-resolution aerial imagery. Given 
                     an area of interest in terms of geographic 
                     coverage, our system can automatically find the 
                     appropriate stereo pair using a spatial database, 
                     select control points to register the two images 
                     so that epipolar geometry is satisfied, and 
                     recover disparity information using two 
                     complementary matching techniques. in our 
                     research, we do not assume that the initial input 
                     images satisfy the epipolar geometry constraint 
                     because this is rarely the case in unrectified 
                     aerial imagery, Therefore, we argue that stereo 
                     mapping research must explicitly address error and 
                     uncertainty in both scene registration and stereo 
                     matching and that we need techniques to evaluate 
                     such errors in a rigorous manner. We also argue 
                     that in order to achieve robust behavior, multiple 
                     methods for scene feature extraction should be 
                     utilized, and if possible, their results should be 
                     integrated into a consistent framework. We 
                     describe techniques for scene registration using 
                     five different features that can be automatically 
                     extracted to provide control points for fine image 
                     registration. In the stereo matching process, two 
                     techniques are utilized: an area-based and a 
                     feature-based stereo matcher to generate a 
                     disparity map for scene. We also present some 
                     preliminary results on technique to merge the 
                     results of the stereo matching algorithms to 
                     provide improved information regarding height 
                     estimates. Finally, we describe techniques to 
                     generate rigorous performance analysis metrics to 
                     compare stereo matching algorithms based on a 
                     manually derived 3-D ground truth segmentation. 
                     The analysis includes the error estimation metrics 
                     for both height and delineation accuracy based on

                     tolerant and computationally more efficient than 
                     the conventional correlation methods. The cepstral 
                     peaks revealed linear translations between SAR 
                     image pairs, accurately. Further work is in 
                     progress to isolate the registration peaks from 
                     spurious peaks in a more reliable way than the 
                     present heuristic approach. Removal of speckle 
                     noise from the SAR images is also addressed. 
                     Spatial averaging is a standard technique used on 
                     SAR images to reduce speckle. However, this causes 
                     a loss of resolution. We have employed 
                     mathematical morphology techniques to remove more 
                     speckle than spatial averaging can, with little 
                     loss of resolution. Long, one-dimensional 
                     structuring elements in different orientations are 
                     used to filter speckle while maintaining the 
                     sharpness of region boundaries. Afterward, a 
                     small, two-dimensional structuring element is use 
                     to remove thin line elements. The targets 
                     appearing as small bright spots are separated from 
                     the original images by a thresholding operation 
                     and superimposed on the filtered images. The 
                     computational time required on a sequential 
                     machine is comparable to that spatial averaging. 
                     In addition, like other morphological filters, 
                     this technique could be implemented on real time 
                     parallel architecture. The improvement in 
                     resolution and noise reduction over the spatial 
                     averaging is demosntrated for images acquired at 
                     different wavelengths.",

                     the image transformations of opening and closing, 
                     which are defined in terms of erosion and

                     point-based registration scheme involves matching 
                     feature points that are extracted from sensed 
                     image to their counterparts in the reference 
                     image. This leads to the fundamental problem of 
                     point matching: give two sets of points, find the 
                     affine transformation that transforms one point 
                     set so that its distance from the other point set 
                     is minimized. Because of measurement errors and 
                     the presence of outlying data points, it is 
                     important that the distance measure between two 
                     point sets be robust to these effects. We measure 
                     distances using the generalized Hausdorff 
                     distance. Point matching can be a computationally 
                     intensive task, and there have been a number of 
                     algorithms and approaches proposed for solving 
                     this problem both theoretical and applied. We 
                     present two approaches to the point matching 
                     problem, in an attempt to reduce the computational 
                     complexity of the problem, while still providing 
                     guarantees on the quality of the final match. Our 
                     first method is an approximation algorithm, which 
                     is loosely based on a branch-and-bound approach 
                     due to Huttenlocher and Rucklidge [HR92, HR93]. We 
                     show that by varying the approximation error 
                     bounds, it is possible to achieve a tradeoff 
                     between then quality of the match and the running 
                     time of the algorithm. Our second method involves 
                     a Monte Carlo method for accelerating the search 
                     process used in the first algorithm. With high 
                     probability this method succeeds in finding an 
                     approximately optimal match. We establish the

                     them such that all features in each segment have 
                     the same 3D motion. The method uses local affine

                     field under the assumption of locally rigid

                     image plane by a distinct set of values for six 
                     displacement parameters. To compute the values of 
                     these parameters, the 6D space is split into two 
                     3D spaces, and each is exhaustively searched

                     However, in many instances, this cost can be

                     and sufficient condition for the decomposability 
                     of rank one templates into 3x3 templates. We then 
                     use the invariance of the template rank under 
                     certain transformations in order to develop

                     performing relational graph matching by discrete 
                     relaxation. Our basic aim is to draw on this 
                     framework to provide a comparative evaluation of a 
                     number of contrasting approaches to relational 
                     matching. Broadly speaking there are two main 
                     aspects to this study. Firstly we focus on the 
                     issue of how relational inexactness may be 
                     quantified. We illustrate that several popular 
                     relational distance measures can be recovered as 
                     specific limiting cases of the Bayesian 
                     consistency measure. The second aspect of our 
                     comparasion concerns the way in which structural 
                     inexactness is controlled. We investigate three 
                     different realizations of the matching process 
                     which draw on contrasting control models. The main 
                     conclusion of our study is that the active process 
                     of graph-editing outperforms the alternatives in 
                     terms of its ability of effectively control a 
                     large population of contaminating clutter.",

                     automated extraction of 3-D information through 
                     image matching. This paper presents an image 
                     matching system using Three Line Scanner (TLS) 
                     images. The disparity constraint of the TLS images

                     initial disparity estimation, which is produced by 
                     a relaxation matching. The effectiveness of our 
                     method with TLS is demonstrated by comparing our 
                     results with those of matching only two line 
                     scanner images. It is shown that more accurate and

  abstract =        "A compuational vision approach is presented for 
                     estimation of 2-D translation, rotation, and scale 
                     from two partially overlapping images. The 
                     approach results in a fast method that produces 
                     good results even when large rotation and 
                     translation have occurred between the two frames 
                     and the images are devoid of significant features. 
                     An illuminant direction estimation method is first 
                     used to obtain an initial estimate of camera 
                     rotation. A small number of feature points are 
                     then located based on a Gabor wavelet model for 
                     detecting local curvature discontinuities. An 
                     initial estimate of scale and translation is 
                     obtained by pairwise matching of the feature 
                     points detected from both frames. Finally, 
                     hierarchical feature matching is performed to 
                     obtain an accurate estimate of translation, 
                     rotation and scale. A method for error analysis on 
                     matching results is also presented. Experiments 
                     with synthetic and real images show that this 
                     algorithm yields accurate results when the scale 
                     of the images differs by up to 10%, the overlap 
                     between the two frames is as small as 23%, and the 
                     camera rotation between the two frames is 
                     significant. Experimental results on several 
                     Mojave desert images acquired from balloon are 
                     presented. Applications of the method to texture 
                     and stereo image registration, and satellite image 
                     mosaicking are presented.",
