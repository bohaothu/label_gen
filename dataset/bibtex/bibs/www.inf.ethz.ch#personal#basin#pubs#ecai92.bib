ABSTRACT      = {
We present FINESSE, a system that forms optimal plans
for declarer play in the game of Bridge. FINESSE adapts the
technique of proof-planning, developed at Edinburgh University
in the context of mathematical theorem-proving, to deal
with the disjunctive choice encountered when planning under
uncertainty, and the context-dependency of actions produced
by the presence of an opposition. FINESSE not only demonstrated
how the idea of proof-planning could be generalised, but
also proved to be a very capable bridge system. In its domain
of planning for individual suits, it correctly identified
the proper lines of play found in many examples from the
Bridge literature, supporting its decisions with probabilistic
and qualitative information. Caes were even discovered in
which FINESSE revealed errors in the analyses presented
by recognized authorities.},
