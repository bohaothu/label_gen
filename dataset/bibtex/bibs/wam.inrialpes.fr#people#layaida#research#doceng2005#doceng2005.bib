   ABSTRACT = {In this paper we present a content adaptation system for mobile
    devices. The system enables the presentation of multimedia content and
    considers the problem of small screen display of mobile terminals. The
    approach combines structural and media adaptation with the content
    formatting and proposes a system that handles the user interaction and
    the content navigation.}
