The topological approach to social choice was developed by Graciela Chichilnisky in the beginning of the 1980s. The main result in this area (known as the resolution of the topological social choice paradox) shows that a space of preferences admits of a continuous, anonymous, and unanimous aggregation rule for every number of individuals if and only if this space is contractible. Furthermore, connections between the Pareto principle, dictatorship, and manipulation were established. Recently, Baryshnikov used the topological approach to demonstrate that Arrow's impossibility theorem can be reformulated in terms of the non-contractibility of spheres.
This paper discusses these results in a self-contained way, emphasizes the social choice interpretation of some topological concepts, and surveys the area of topological aggregation.1"

The paper studies two standard properties of rules for aggregating individual into social preferences: non-dictatorship and the Pareto condition. Together with the condition of independence of irrelevant alternatives, these are the three basic axioms of Arrow's social choice paradox.
We prove the topological equivalence between the Pareto condition and the existence of a dictator for continuous rules. The axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives is not required.
The results use a topological framework for aggregation introduced in Chichilnisky (1980), but under different conditions. In Chichilnisky (1980) rules are anonymous and respect unanimity. Since anonymity is strictly stronger than the condition of non-dictatorship, while respect of unanimity is strictly weaker than the Pareto condition, the two sets of conditions are not comparable."

We take as the primary notion of the equivalence between aggregation rules the isotopy between them, that is a continuous family of rules satisfying the same axioms which the terminal rules do. We prove that the homotopic equivalences of Pareto rules to dictatorial ones known before can be made isotopies and give some generalizations to these results. We discuss also some homological properties of Pareto rules and their implications. The main result of the paper, however, is the construction of a Pareto rule which is not Pareto isotopic to a dictatorial rule (while homologically equivalent to it). This is the first example of existence results for the preference spaces with nontrivial topology (without domain restrictions)."

This paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the aggregation of preferences, extending an earlier treatment of aggregation by Stolper, Gorman, Samuelson and Chipman. Such aggregation procedures are intended to deal with the problem of aggregating demand functions in econometrics, where the aggregate is required to be independent to the income distribution. Thus, it is usually assumed in this form of aggregation that all consumers face the same prices, but that the distribution of income is unrestricted.
In order to establish the characterisation result, we present a new approach to preference aggregation which involves summing certain subsets of the graphs of the preferences, viewed as subsets of a Euclidean space. This procedure has a clear geometrical interpretation, and a number of useful applications. In particular, it enables us to analyse the possibility of aggregation when prices are not constrained to be the same for all consumers, a case of possible empirical significance. We also show that the Stolper-Gorman-Samuelson-Chipman construction of community indifference curves coincides with a special case of this procedure.
Finally, this approach allows us to develop the relationship between these forms of aggregation and the preference aggregation problem as it occurs in social choice theory."

abstract = "
We study social aggregation rules that satisfy a Pareto and a decisive majority condition. A rule satisfies the decisive majority condition if whenever the voters can be divided into two internally homogeneous groups (i.e. groups within which all individuals agree about all possible choices) and these groups have opposite preferences, then the majority's preference is respected. No assumptions are made about the outcome when the individuals have more than two different preferences even when a majority agrees on a choice x being preferable to another y. Therefore a decisive majority condition does not imply, i.e., is strictly weaker than, majority rules. The main result is that Pareto decisive majority rules are necessarily structurally unstable, in the sense that the outcome preference, which is a vector field, will undergo major changes in structure in response to small changes in the underlying parameters. The importance of structural instability derives from the fact that small errors of observation will lead to drastically different answers. An example of the result for three voters and with a two-dimensional choice space is also given."

  abstract = {We consider continuous aggregation maps (e.g., social welfare
       functions). By assuming that the voters have preferences over
       social outcomes, we regard the social decision procedure as a
       noncooperative game, with the aggregation map as a game form.
       The map is called strategy-proof if it is a Nash equilibrium
       that the voters report their most preferred outcomes. We give
       sufficient topological conditions on the space of outcomes so
       that only dictatorial maps are strategy-proof.},

  abstract = {Sen's classic social choice result supposedly demonstrates a conflict
       between Pareto and minimal forms of liberalism. By providing
       the first direct mathematical proof of this seminal result, we
       underscore a significantly different interpretation: rather
       than conflicts among rights, Sen's result occurs because the
       liberalism assumption negates the requirement that voters have
       transitive preferences. This explanation enriches
       interpretations of Sen's conclusion by introducing radically
       new kinds of societal conflicts, by suggesting ways to sidestep
       these difficulties, and by providing insight into other
       approaches that have been used to avoid the difficulties.},
