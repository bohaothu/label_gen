                  To handle {\em infinite} traces, Gastin and
                  Petit introduced B{\"u}chi asynchronous
                  automata, which accept precisely the class of
                  $\omega$-regular trace languages. Like their
                  sequential counterparts, these automata need to
                  be non-deterministic in order to capture all
                  $\omega$-regular languages. Thus
                  complementation of these automata is
                  non-trivial. Complementation is an important
                  operation because it is fundamental for
                  treating the logical connective ``not'' in
                  decision procedures for monadic secondorder
                  logics.\bibpar
                  
                  Subsequently, Diekert and Muscholl solved the
                  complementation problem by showing that with a
                  Muller acceptance condition, deterministic
                  automata suffice for recognizing $\omega
                  $-regular trace languages. However, a direct
                  determinization procedure, extending the
                  classical subset construction, has proved
                  elusive.\bibpar
                  
                  In this paper, we present a direct
                  determinization procedure for B{\"u}chi
                  asynchronous automata, which generalizes
                  Safra's construction for sequential B{\"u}chi
                  automata. As in the sequential case, the
                  blow-up in the state space is essentially that

                  concurrency. They arise out of ``independence
                  structures'' which are sets with a symmetric,
                  irreflexive relation. In this paper,
                  independence structures are characterized as
                  certain topological spaces. We show that these

                  generalizing the constructions in the first

                  reflective subcategory, and has moreover a very

                  generalizations based on traditional approaches
                  capturing non-interleaving behaviour, {\it

                  We first study equivalences on Basic Parallel
                  Processes, BPP, a process calculus equivalent
                  to communication-free Petri nets. For this
                  simple process language our two notions of
                  non-interleaving equivalences agree. More
                  interestingly, we show that they are decidable,
                  contrasting a result of Hirshfeld that standard
                  interleaving language equivalence is
                  undecidable. Our result is inspired by a recent
                  result of Esparza and Kiehn, showing the same

                  TCSP. We discover a significant difference
                  between our non-interleaving equivalences. We
                  show that for a certain non-trivial subclass of
                  processes between BPP and TCSP, not only are
                  the two equivalences different, but one ({\it
                  locality}) is decidable whereas the other ({\it

                  abstractions can be described behaviorally.
                  These state-less descriptions can be formulated

                  1994 Dagstuhl Seminar on Specification and

                  behavioral descriptions that we formulate from

                  may span 10 pages or more.\bibpar
                  
                  Such descriptions are a couple of magnitudes
                  larger than usual temporal logic formulas found
                  in the literature on verification. To securely
                  write these formulas, we introduce {\sc Fido}
                  as a reactive system description language. {\sc
                  Fido} is designed as a high-level symbolic

                  about without explicit state-based programming.
                  With {\sc Fido}, we can state temporal

                  bisimilar to a process with finitely many
                  states. We show, that regularity of normed BPP
                  processes is decidable and we provide a

                  that the same result can be obtained for the
                  class of normed BPA processes.\bibpar
                  Regularity can be defined also w.r.t.\ other
                  behavioural equivalences. We define notions of
                  strong regularity and finite characterisation
                  and we examine their relationship with notions
                  of regularity and finite representation. The

                  continuation-passing style, eta-expansion, and
                  a popular transformation called ``The Trick''.
                  We provide a unified view of these binding-time

                  values, a proper treatment of disjoint sums
                  requires moving static contexts across dynamic
                  case expressions. This requirement precisely
                  accounts for the non-standard use of
                  continuation-passing style encountered in
                  partial evaluation. In this setting,
                  eta-expansion acts as a uniform binding-time
                  coercion between values and contexts, be they
                  of function type, product type, or disjoint-sum

                  obtained in the binding-time analysis simply by
                  adding two coercion rules; and we specify and

                  Not only does it induce a congruence (largest

                  computation and settings such as Petri Nets and

                  research within the field, Joyal, Nielsen, and
                  Winskel recently presented an abstract
                  category-theoretic definition of bisimulation.
                  They identify spans of morphisms satisfying
                  certain ``path lifting'' properties, so-called
                  open maps, as a possible abstract definition of

                  show, that they can capture Park and Milner's
                  bisimulation. The aim of this paper is to show
                  that the abstract definition of bisimilarity is
                  applicable ``in practice'' by showing how a
                  representative selection of {\em well-known}
                  bisimulations and equivalences, such as e.g.
                  Hennessy's testing equivalence, Milner and
                  Sangiorgi's barbed bisimulation, and Larsen and
                  Skou's probabilistic bisimulation, are captured
                  in the setting of open maps and hence, that the
                  proposed notion of open maps seems successful.
                  Hence, we confirm that the treatment of strong
                  bisimulation in the LICS~'93 paper is not a

                  is based on new algorithms for minimizing

                  diagrams (BDD's) to represent transition

                  obtained by extending Milner's basic CCS with

                  restricting the first argument to be an atomic

                  the silent nature of $\tau$ and prefix
                  iteration: \begin{eqnarray*} \tau. x & = & \tau

                  single {\sl characteristic} ${\rm L}_{\nu}$
                  formula uniquely characterizing the automaton
                  up to timed bisimilarity. Also, we prove
                  decidability of the {\sl satisfiability}
                  problem for ${\rm L}_{\nu}$ with respect to
                  given bounds on the number of clocks and
                  constants of the timed automata to be
                  constructed. None of these results have as yet
                  been succesfully accounted for in the presence
                  of time (An exception occurs in Alur's thesis
                  in which a decidability result is presented for
                  a {\sl linear} timed logic called MITL).",

                  the Dynamic Word problem for the free group. We
                  present deterministic algorithms and data
                  structures which maintain a string under
                  replacements of symbols, insertions, and
                  deletions of symbols, and language membership
                  queries. Updates and queries are handled in
                  polylogarithmic time. We also give both Las
                  Vegas- and Monte Carlo-type randomised
                  algorithms to achieve better running times, and
                  present lower bounds on the complexity for
                  variants of the problems.",
