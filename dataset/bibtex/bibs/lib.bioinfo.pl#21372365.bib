abstract={Objective : To assess whether measles elimination goal would be feasible for India or not. Methodology: Secondary review of data from WHO Regional Consultative Meet on Measles and Workshop on Rubella. Discussion with stakeholders such as UNICEF experts, PATH, and Government officials. Results: The National Technical Advisory Group of India (NTAGI) has chalked out two broad strategies depending on the routine measles coverage of first dose (MCV1). In 18 states with sustained MCV1 coverage â‰¥80%, a second routine dose of measles would be given, whereas those states with &lt;80% coverage, supplementary immunization will be introduced in a phased manner. There are many challenges at this juncture-unfinished agenda polio eradication, lack of VPD surveillance system, financial and manpower constraints. However, solutions are possible. Conclusion: Before setting an elimination goal in India, a thorough understanding of the regional situation is required. India should opt for the Measles Mortality Reduction before proceeding to the Elimination Goal by 2020.}
