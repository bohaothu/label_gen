%%% A delimited macro \toenglish ... \endtoenglish is NECESSARY here.
%%% The more conventional undelimited form \toenglish{...} has braces

%%% prevent conflicts with language options in packages like Babel.

%%% To suppress output of English translations of non-English titles,
%%% use

                 in each arithmetic operation. Models constructed on
                 this assumption are more tractable than would be the

                 identified two easily tested conditions on programs

                 insensitive to the particular graph model employed. The

                 ATAN2, and CABS, in scalar (28 functions) and vector

                 of the new VS FORTRAN library recently announced along
                 with the IBM 3090 Vector Facility. These algorithms are
                 essentially table-based algorithms. An important
                 feature of these algorithms is that they produce
                 bitwise-identical results on scalar and vector
                 System\slash 370 machines. Of these, for five functions
                 the computed value result is always the correctly
                 rounded value of the infinite-precision result. For the
                 rest of the functions, the value returned is one of the
                 two floating-point neighbors bordering the
                 infinite-precision result, which implies exact results
                 if they are machine-representable. For the five
                 correctly rounded elementary functions, scalar and

                 percentage of time that operations are carried out
                 relative to the time that the operating theater is
                 available. The numerator of the percentage is a
                 weighted sum of the times required to carry out
                 different kinds of operations, where the weights are
                 the numbers of operations of each kind to be performed.
                 Since different kinds of operations have different mean
                 times, this sum has a skewed distribution.\par

                 Based on the Central Limit Theorem, the normal
                 distribution is the most widely used approximation to
                 the distribution of a weighted sum of random variables.
                 However, this approximation is not very good if the sum
                 has a skewed distribution.\par

                 In a separate paper [1], the author derived an
                 alternative approximation based on the first four
                 moments of the sum. In the present paper, he applies
                 this approximation to the operating theater problem by
                 estimating the moments of the times of the different
                 kinds of operations. The paper also contains a Monte
                 Carlo comparison of the normal approximation with the
                 proposed approximation for four underlying
                 distributions of the sum.",

                 the function as well as the base of the number system

                 certain number of correct digits of the function value.

                 Center for the elementary mathematical library using
                 the IEEE standard for binary floating point arithmetic
                 are described. The algorithms are based on the
                 ``accurate tables method.'' This methodology achieves
                 high performance and produces very accurate results. It
                 overcomes one of the main problems encountered in
                 elementary mathematical functions computations:
                 achieving last bit accuracy. The results obtained are
                 correctly rounded for almost all argument values.
                 \par

                 Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use
                 ``nonstandard tables,'' which are different from the
                 natural tables of equally spaced points in which the
                 rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In
                 order to achieve a small error we use the following
                 idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in
                 such a way that the table value (or tables values in
                 case we need several tables) will be very close to
                 numbers which can be exactly represented by the
                 computer (much closer than the usual double precision
                 representation). Thus we were able to control the error
                 introduced by the computer representation of real
                 numbers and extended the accuracy without actually
                 using extended precision arithmetic.",

                 multiprecision computation. The first is a package of
                 Fortran subroutines that perform a variety of
                 arithmetic operations and transcendental functions on
                 floating point numbers of arbitrarily high precision.
                 This package is in some cases over 200 times faster
                 than that of certain other packages that have been
                 developed for this purpose. The second utility is a
                 translator program, which facilitates the conversion of
                 ordinary Fortran programs to use this package. By means
                 of source directives (special comments) in the original
                 Fortran program, the user declares the precision level
                 and specifies which variables in each subprogram are to
                 be treated as multiprecision. The translator program
                 reads this source program and outputs a program with
                 the appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls. This
                 translator supports multiprecision integer, real, and
                 complex datatypes. The required array space for
                 multiprecision data types is automatically allocated.
                 In the evaluation of computational expressions, all of
                 the usual conventions for operator precedence and mixed
                 mode operations are upheld. Furthermore, most of the
                 Fortran-77 intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP

                 arithmetic for floating point numbers. An accurate
                 definition of the four elementary floating-point
                 operations +, -, *, / is given in the IEEE standards
                 for floating-point arithmetic and was well established
                 long before. An increasing number of computers
                 (especially PC's and workstations) feature IEEE
                 arithmetic. In many numerical algorithms, however,
                 compound operations such as the summation of a sequence
                 of numbers or the dot product of two vectors are highly
                 common. A simulation of these compound operations by
                 means of elementary floating-point operations leads to
                 accumulation of rounding errors and may suffer from
                 catastrophic cancellation of leading digits. Existing
                 standards for floating-point arithmetic do not improve
                 this situation. The goal of the proposal is to define
                 vector operations in a manner consistent with the
                 elementary scalar arithmetic operations. The rounding
                 modes and accuracy requirements as well as the data
                 formats of the operands and results of the vector
                 operations described in the proposal are chosen to be

  abstract =     "An algorithm is described which produces exactly
                 rounded results for the functions of reciprocal, square
                 root, 2/sup x/, and log 2/sup x/. Hardware designs
                 based on this algorithm are presented for floating
                 point numbers with 16- and 24-b significands. These
                 designs use a polynomial approximation in which
                 coefficients are originally selected based on the
                 Chebyshev series approximation and are then adjusted to
                 ensure exactly rounded results for all inputs. To
                 reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the
                 input interval is divided into subintervals of equal
                 size and different coefficients are used for each
                 subinterval. For floating point numbers with 16-b
                 significands, the exactly rounded value of the function
                 can be computed in 51 ns on a 20-mm/sup 2/ chip. For
                 floating point numbers with 24-b significands, the
                 functions can be computed in 80 ns on a 98-mm/sup 2/

                 evaluation of elementary functions based on table
                 lookup. They are called ATA (add/table-lookup/add) and

                 single- and double-precision calculations respectively.
                 In this paper, an improvement to these methods that
                 shrinks the size of the table by a factor of about 3/16
                 is presented. Another method called the `split parallel
                 multiplication method', which is characterized by
                 simpler table lookup than ATA-M and by split and
                 parallel use of double-precision floating point
                 circuitry, is also introduced, These new methods fit on
                 to integrated circuits of a size comparable with

                 exactly rounded results for the functions of
                 reciprocal, square-root, 2/sup x/, and log/sub 2/(x).
                 These designs use polynomial approximation in which the
                 terms in the approximation are generated in parallel,
                 and then summed by using a multi-operand adder. To
                 reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the
                 input interval is partitioned into subintervals of
                 equal size, and different coefficients are used for
                 each subinterval. The coefficients used in the
                 approximation are initially determined based on the
                 Chebyshev series approximation. They are then adjusted
                 to obtain exactly rounded results for all inputs.
                 Hardware designs are presented, and delay and area
                 comparisons are made based on the degree of the
                 approximating polynomial and the accuracy of the final
                 result. For single-precision floating point numbers, a
                 design that produces exactly rounded results for all

                 technology is the growth in memory density and speed.
                 It is with this development in mind that we intend to
                 tackle the old problem of computing the elementary
                 functions. Since the dawn of computing, the fast and
                 accurate computation of the elementary functions has
                 been a constant concern of numerical computing. It now
                 seems possible to use tables of sizes in the range of
                 megabits to aid in such computation. To this end, in
                 this paper, we propose a method called ATA-M (Add-Table
                 Lookup-Add with Multiplication) for evaluating
                 polynomials with the aid of tables. When applied to the
                 elementary functions, we obtained a set of algorithms
                 which computes the reciprocal, square root,
                 exponential, sine, cosine, logarithm, are tangent and
                 the hyperbolic functions in about 3 to 4 double
                 precision floating point multiplication time and
                 utilizing about 2 Mbyte of tables.",

                 vital role in scientific computations. Yet due to their
                 inherent nature, they are a considerable computing task
                 by themselves. Not surprisingly, since the dawn of
                 computing, the goal of speeding up elementary function
                 computation has been pursued. This paper describes new
                 hardware based algorithms for the computation of the
                 common elementary functions, namely division,
                 logarithm, reciprocal square root, arc tangent, sine
                 and cosine. These algorithms exploit microscopic
                 parallelism using specialized hardware with heavy use
                 of truncation based on detailed accuracy analysis. The
                 contribution of this work lies in the fact that these
                 algorithms are very fast and yet are accurate. If we
                 let the time to perform an IEEE Standard 754 double
                 precision floating point multiplication be tau /sub */,
                 our algorithms to achieve roughly 3.68 tau /sub */,4.56

                 tau /sub */, and 6.5 tau /sub */, for division,
                 logarithm, square root, exponential, are tangent and
                 complex exponential (sine and cosine) respectively. The
                 trade-off is the need for tables and some specialized
                 hardware. The total amount of tables required, however,
                 is less than 128 Kbytes. We discuss the hardware,

                 supercomputers. It is claimed to be currently the
                 fastest single processor supercomputer. In this paper,
                 we introduce the S-3000 and, using six benchmarks we
                 designed, evaluate a member of this series of
                 supercomputer, the top of the range S-3800, against its
                 predecessor, the Hitachi HITAC S-820. Our purpose is to
                 determine in what areas the S-3800 is an improvement
                 over its predecessor. The suite of benchmarks include
                 kernels for random number generation, elementary
                 function computation, FFT, dense matrix operations,
                 SOR, and list vector (scatter\slash gather) operations.
                 The use of small-to medium-sized kernels, as opposed to
                 large application benchmarks, help to better understand
                 the behavior of the machine. Our findings support the
                 claim that the S-3000 series is at least twice as fast
