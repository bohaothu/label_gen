  abstract =	 "The $\pi$-calculus is a name-passing calculus that allows
		  the description of distributed systems with a dynamically
		  changing interconnection topology.  Name communication,
		  together with the possibility of declaring and exporting
		  local names, gives the calculus a great expressive power.
		  For instance, it was remarkably shown that
		  process-passing calculi, that express mobility at higher
		  order, can be naturally encoded in $\pi$-calculus.\bibpar

		  Since its very first definition, the $\pi$-calculus
		  proliferated in a family of calculi slightly departing
		  the one another either in the communication paradigm
		  (polyadic vs monadic, asynchronous vs synchronous) or in
		  the bisimulation semantics (labelled vs unlabelled, late
		  vs early vs open vs barbed vs \ldots).\bibpar

		  These short notes present a collection of the labelled
		  strong semantics of the (synchronous monadic)
		  $\pi$-calculus.  The notes could not possibly substitute
		  any of the standard references listed in the
		  Bibliography.  They rather represent an attempt to group
		  together, using a uniform notation and the terminology
		  that got assessed over the last years, a few definitions
		  and concepts otherwise scattered throughout the
		  $\pi$-calculus literature.yy

		  Their purpose is to give an introduction to two major
		  proof theoretic techniques: functional interpretation and
		  (modified) realizability.  We focus on the possible use
		  of these methods to extract programs, bounds and other
		  effective data from given proofs.\bibpar 

		  Both methods are developed in the framework of
		  intuitionistic arithmetic in higher types.\bibpar 

		  We also discuss applications to systems based on
		  classical logic. We show that the combination of
		  functional interpretation with the so-called negative
		  translation, which allows to embed various classical
		  theories into their intuitionistic counterparts, can be
		  used to unwind non-constructive proofs.\bibpar 

		  Instead of combining functional interpretation with
		  negative translation one can also use in some
		  circumstances a combination of modified realizability
		  with negative translation if one inserts the so-called
		  A-translation (due to H. Friedman) as an intermediate
		  step.
