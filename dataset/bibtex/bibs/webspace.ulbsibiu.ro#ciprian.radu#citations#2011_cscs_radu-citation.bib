  abstract = {Network-on-Chip (NoC) application mapping is an NP-hard problem, which can be
addressed with heuristic algorithms. This paper presents an Optimized Simulated Annealing
(OSA)  algorithm  that  deals  with  the  topological  placement  of  cores  onto  NoC  nodes.  The
algorithm is derived from a general energy- and performance-aware Simulated Annealing and
employs and adapts some of the best Simulated Annealing practices from the field of task
scheduling. OSA uses an application- and network-based exploration of the search space. The
cores are implicitly and dynamically clustered using knowledge about communication demands.
We  show  that  OSA  is  a  more  feasible  Simulated  Annealing  approach  to  NoC  application
mapping by comparing it with a general Simulated Annealing algorithm and a Branch and
Bound algorithm, too. Our simulations use real applications and show OSA to be more than
98\% faster than a general Simulated Annealing, without giving worse solutions. Also, compared
to a Branch and Bound technique, it gives better solutions, as the problem size increases, while
in terms of speed and memory consumption the two algorithms are comparable.},
