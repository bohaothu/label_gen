                 properties of binary search algorithms for isolating
                 all solutions to nonlinear systems of equations
                 $F(X)=0$ within a given compact domain $D\in \Bbb R\sp
                 n$. We devise a general framework such that any

                 always isolate all solutions $Z\in D$ such that
                 $F(Z)=0$; this framework contains a new idea for
                 handling the occurrence of roots on boundaries. We then

                 approximations to all solutions to a system of
                 nonlinear equations within a region defined by bounds
                 on each of the individual coordinates. Various forms of
                 generalized bisection were proposed some time ago for
                 this task. This paper systematically compares such
                 generalized bisection algorithms to themselves, to
                 continuation methods, and to hybrid steepest
                 descent/quasi-Newton methods. A specific algorithm
                 containing novel ``expansion'' and ``exclusion'' steps
                 is fully described, and the effectiveness of these
                 steps is evaluated. A test problem consisting of a
                 small, high-degree polynomial system that is
                 appropriate for generalized bisection, but very
                 difficult for continuation methods, is presented. This
                 problem forms part of a set of 17 test problems from
                 published literature on the methods being compared;
                 this test set is fully described here.",

  abstract =     "The results are based on the fact that interval
                 methods can be used to find, with the rigor of a
                 mathematical proof, even on a computer, all roots of a
                 nonlinear system of equations within given bounds on
                 the variables. Generalized bisection together with
                 interval Newton methods is considered. The related
                 linear systems may be solved with an interval version
                 of the Gauss--Seidel method. The problem of finding a
                 global minimum for a nonlinear objective function is
                 considered via the system which sets the gradient equal
                 to zero.\par

                 The transfer function corresponding to a single linear
                 controlled ordinary differential equation is a
                 relational function. The above method is applied to
                 study the stability of such systems which depends on
                 the existence of roots in the right half of the complex
                 plane. The problem of how practical such methods are is
                 discussed. It is also suggested that interval methods
                 might be applicable to discretizations of optimal
                 control problems governed by ordinary differential

  abstract =     "Let $F: D\subseteq {\bbfR}\sp n\to {\bbfR}\sp n$ be a
                 differentiable function, let $B$ denote a prescribed
                 box in ${\bbfR}\sp n$. The author thoroughly
                 investigates the problem: Find approximations and small
                 error bounds to all solutions of the equation $F(x) =
                 0$ in the box $B$. A successful approach for treating
                 this problem is generalized bisection in conjunction
                 with interval Newton iteration. Algorithmic
                 descriptions of this method are presented. Hereby the
                 following subproblem has to be considered: $A\cdot Y =
                 R$ with $A \in IA$ and $R \in IR$, where the (unknown)
                 matrix A is contained in a known interval IA of
                 matrices and the (unknown) vector $R$ is contained in a
                 known interval $IR$ of vectors. Bounds on the vector
                 $Y$ are sought as $A$ ranges over $IA$ and $R$ ranges
                 over $IR$. \par

                 One standard technique for solving this subproblem is
                 preconditioning and one sweep of interval Gauss--Seidel
                 elimination. The common preconditioner is the inverse
                 of the midpoint-matrix of IA. The author introduces a
                 new preconditioner that emerges from an optimality
                 condition and that can be obtained by solving a
                 specific linear programming problem. Numerical tests of
                 the new preconditioner in the overall algorithm
                 indicate that it is effective at reducing the number of
                 function and derivative evaluations, and often also
                 results in less CPU time.",

                 routines, standard function routines for interval data
                 and values, and utility routines. The library can be

                 equations. Since INTBIS uses interval computations, its

                 efficiently solve very large nonlinear systems on a

                 effectively utilize the architectural features of the

                 processes driven by operator overloading and code list
                 generation, when the branch condition contains
                 variables. However, this problem can be circumvented

                 of this function, formulas for its use, and
                 implications of its use will be discussed.\par A second
                 issue is: what can be done when derivatives are
                 discontinuous? In fact, simple an meaningful Newton
                 iterations can be set up when even the function itself
                 is discontinuous. Simplified figures and examples are
                 given, as well as references to in-depth explanations.
                 An example of the convergence behavior is given with an

  abstract =     "Interval arithmetic is useful in {\it automatically
                 verified computation}, that is, in computations in
                 which the algorithm itself rigorously proves that the
                 answer must lie within certain bounds. In addition to
                 rigor, interval arithmetic also provides a simple and
                 somewhat sharp method of bounding ranges of functions
                 for global optimization and other tasks. Convenient use
                 of interval arithmetic requires an interval data type
                 in the programming language. Although various packages
                 supply such a data type, previous ones are machine
                 specific, obsolete, and unsupported, for languages
                 other than Fortran, or commercial. The Fortran 90
                 module {INTERVAL\_ARITHMETIC} provides a portable
                 interval data type in Fortran 90. This data type is
                 based on two double-precision real Fortran storage
                 unit. Module {INTERVAL\_ARITHMETIC} uses the Fortran 77
                 library {INTLIB} (ACM TOMS Algorithm 737) as a
                 supporting library. The module has been employed

  abstract =     "Various algorithms can compute approximate feasible
                 points or approximate solutions to equality and bound
                 constrained optimization problems. In exhaustive search
                 algorithms for global optimizers and other contexts, it
                 is of interest to construct bounds around such
                 approximate feasible points, then to verify
                 (computationally but rigorously) that an actual
                 feasible point exists within these bounds. Hansen and
                 others have proposed techniques for proving the
                 existence of feasible points within given bounds, but
                 practical implementations have not, to our knowledge,
                 previously been described. Various alternatives are
                 possible in such an implementation, and details must be
                 carefully considered. Also, in addition to Hansen's
                 technique for handling the underdetermined case, it is
                 important to handle the overdetermined case, when the
                 approximate feasible point corresponds to a point with
                 many active bound constraints. The basic ideas, along
                 with experimental results from an actual

  abstract =     "There exists a wide spectrum of methods for solving
                 $F(x) = 0$, where $F$ is a nonlinear function
                 $\mathbb{R} n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} n$. Fixed point
                 theorems in conjunction with interval-analysis can be
                 used to automatically verify existence and uniqueness
                 of a solution within a given region $D$. Most methods,
                 however, succeed only when the Jacobian of $F$ is
                 regular in $D$. In problems such as bifurcation or
                 surface intersection, the Jacobian may be singular or
                 ill-conditioned at the desired solution. In such cases,
                 arbitrarily small perturbations of $F$ can lead to no
                 solution or many solutions in $D$.\par

                 The present paper provides a special-purpose tool for
                 singular Jacobians in cases where $F$ can be extended
                 to an analytic function $\mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow
                 \mathbb{C}^n$. Existence verification is possible by
                 computing the topological degree of $F$ with respect to
                 a prescribed region. The notion topological degree
                 generalizes the sign-change of a one-dimensional real
                 function and the winding-number of an analytic
                 function. The topological degree gives the number of
                 solutions of $F(z) = 0$, counting multiplicities,
                 within a region in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The authors describe
                 in detail how to compute the topological degree of $F$
                 with respect to a box in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Hereby a
                 sophisticated organization reduces the amount of work
                 considerably, compared to previously known methods.
                 Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the
                 presented algorithm.",

  abstract =     "Given an approximate solution to a nonlinear system of
                 equations at which the Jacobi matrix is nonsingular,
                 and given that the Jacobi matrix is continuous in a
                 region about this approximate solution, a small box can
                 be constructed about the approximate solution in which
                 interval Newton methods can verify existence and
                 uniqueness of an actual solution.\par

                 Recently, we have shown how to verify existence and
                 uniqueness, up to multiplicity, for solutions at which
                 the Jacobi matrix is singular. We do this by efficient
                 computation of the topological index over a small box
                 containing the approximate solution. Since the
                 topological index is defined and computable when the
                 Jacobi matrix is not even defined at the solution, one
                 may speculate that efficient algorithms can be devised
                 for verification in this case, too.\par

                 In this note, however, we discuss, through examples,
                 key techniques underlying our simplification of the
                 calculations that cannot necessarily be used when the
                 function is non-smooth. We also present those parts of
                 the theory that are valid in the non-smooth case, and
                 suggest when degree computations involving non-smooth
                 functions may be practical.\par

                 As a bonus, the examples lead to additional
                 understanding of previously published work on
                 verification involving the topological degree.",

                 \par

                 There are certain problems for which interval
                 dependency leads to overestimation in the enclosures of
                 the individual components, causing the optimization
                 search to become prohibitively inefficient. As {\it E.
                 R. Hansen} has observed earlier [Computing 58, No. 2,
                 187-196 (1997; Zbl 0918.65037)], in other problems,
                 there is no overestimation in the individual
                 components, but overestimation is introduced in the
                 preconditioning in the interval Newton method. \par

                 We examine these issues for a particular nonlinear
                 systems problem that, to date, has defied numerical
                 solution. To reduce overestimation, we use Taylor
                 models. The Taylor models sometimes reduce individual
                 overestimation but, consistent with Hansen's
                 observations, especially reduce the overestimation due
                 to preconditioning. From numerical experiments, we
                 conclude that, in certain instances, Taylor models can
                 greatly reduce both the number of subregions necessary
                 to complete an exhaustive search and the total
                 computational effort.",

                 computational verification that one or more solutions
                 exists within a region in complex space containing the
                 real bounds is possible by computing the topological
                 degree.\par

                 In a previous paper, we presented theory and algorithms
                 for the simplest case, when the rank-defect of the
                 Jacobian matrix at the solution is 1 and the
                 topological index is 2 [cf. {\it R. B. Kearfott, J.
                 Dian}, and {\it A. Neumaier}, ibid. 38, No. 2, 360--379
                 (2000; Zbl 0986.65054)]. Here, we generalize that
                 result to arbitrary topological index $d\ge2$: We
                 present theory, algorithms, and experimental results.
                 We also present a heuristic for determining the degree,
                 obtaining a value that we can subsequently verify with
                 our algorithms. Although execution times are slow
                 compared to corresponding bound verification processes
                 for nonsingular systems, the order with respect to
                 system size is still cubic.",

                 Here, we describe the design of four freely available

                 providing the most practical such system possible
                 without specifying non-general problem structure;
                 Kearfott's system has a Fortran-90 interface. Finally,

  abstract =     "Based on work originating in the early 1970s, a number
                 of recent global optimization algorithms have relied on
                 replacing an original nonconvex nonlinear program by
                 convex or linear relaxations. Such linear relaxations
                 can be generated automatically through an automatic
                 differentiation process. This process decomposes the
                 objective and constraints (if any) into convex and
                 nonconvex unary and binary operations. The convex
                 operations can be approximated arbitrarily well by
                 appending additional constraints, while the domain must
                 somehow be subdivided (in an overall branch-and-bound
                 process or in some other local process) to handle
                 nonconvex constraints. In general, a problem can be
                 hard if even a single nonconvex term appears. However,
                 certain nonconvex terms lead to easier-to-solve
                 problems than others. Recently, Neumaier, Lebbah,
                 Michel, ourselves, and others have paved the way to
                 utilizing such techniques in a validated
                 context.\par

                 In this paper, we present a symbolic preprocessing step
                 that provides a measure of the intrinsic difficulty of
                 a problem. Based on this step, one of two methods can
                 be chosen to relax nonconvex terms. This preprocessing
                 step is similar to a method previously proposed by {\it
                 T. G. W. Epperly} and {\it E. N. Pistikopoulos} [J.
                 Glob. Optim. 11, No. 3, 287--311 (1997; Zbl
                 1040.90567)] for determining subspaces in which to
                 branch, but we present it from a different point of
                 view that is amenable to simplification of the problem
                 presented to the linear programming solver, and within
                 a validated context. Besides an illustrative example,
                 we have implemented general relaxations in a validated
                 context, as well as the preprocessing technique, and we
                 present experiments on a standard test set. Finally, we

  abstract =     "Both theory and implementations in deterministic
                 global optimization have advanced significantly in the
                 past decade. Two schools of thought have developed: the
                 first employs various bounding techniques without
                 validation, while the second employs different
                 techniques, in a way that always rigorously takes
                 account of roundoff error (i.e. with validation).
                 However, convex relaxations, until very recently used
                 without validation, can be implemented efficiently in a
                 validated context. Here, we empirically compare a
                 validated implementation of a variant of convex
                 relaxations (linear relaxations applied to each
                 intermediate operation) with traditional techniques
                 from validated global optimization (interval constraint
                 propagation and interval Newton methods). Experimental
                 results show that linear relaxations are of significant
                 value in validated global optimization, although
                 further exploration will probably lead to more
                 effective inclusion of the technology.",

                 are allowed to vary in a given interval matrix ${\bold
                 A} = [\underline A,\overline A]$ and a corresponding
                 interval vector ${\bold b}$, respectively; $Y$ is a
                 preconditioning point matrix used to reduce the width
                 of overestimation of the unpreconditioned method. The
                 preconditioner can even be chosen such that zero is
                 contained in some of the diagonal entries of $Y{\bold

  abstract =     "The use of interval analysis has steadily increased
                 over the past 40 years. This development was taken into
                 account when writing the present book. It presents the
                 basics in real interval arithmetic and covers
                 elementary methods for verifying and enclosing zeros of
                 functions, global minimizers, solutions of integral and
                 differential equations. It deals with integration of
                 interval functions and shows how interval methods can
                 be applied in various fields of science. Moreover, an
                 introduction into the interval toolbox INTLAB of MATLAB
                 is given in order to understand the many programs which
                 realize the algorithms of the book. Numerous examples
                 illustrate the theory and are spread over more than 220
                 pages.\par

                 The book starts with a short introduction on the
                 necessity of enclosures and on bounding roundoff
                 errors. The interval number system is presented in
                 Chapter 2 including set theoretic operations as well as
                 order relations and operations for intervals, interval
                 vectors, and interval matrices. Some historical
                 references are added. Chapter 3 discusses the problem
                 of computing with inexact initial data and therefore
                 results in first applications of interval arithmetic.
                 It considers outwardly rounded interval arithmetic and
                 gives a first glance to INTLAB. Chapter 4 is devoted to
                 algebraic properties of interval arithmetic, to
                 symmetric intervals and to inclusion isotonicity.
                 Interval functions are introduced in Chapter 5
                 including elementary interval functions and
                 interval-valued extensions of real functions together
                 with fundamental properties.\par

                 The topological side of intervals and of interval
                 arithmetic is considered in Chapter 6. Equipped with
                 the Hausdorff metric the set of intervals turns out to
                 be a complete metric space for which convergence and
                 continuity can be defined in the usual way. Nested
                 interval sequences, finite convergence, refinement of
                 interval extensions, and various centered forms are
                 additional topics of this chapter which is concluded by
                 the Skelboe--Moore algorithm. This algorithm is a
                 prototype of a branch-and-bound algorithm applied in
                 global optimization. Interval matrices form the subject
                 of the succeeding Chapter 7, where linear systems with
                 inexact input data are also discussed. In this
                 connection the Krawczyk method is mentioned as well as
                 the interval Gauss--Seidel method and Gaussian
                 elimination.\par

                 Nonlinear equations are studied in Chapter 8. Here the
                 interval Newton method is commented, and cases are
                 presented which imply the necessity of an extended
                 interval arithmetic. For systems of nonlinear equations
                 the Krawczyk method and multivariate interval Newton
                 methods are applied and safe starting intervals are
                 defined. Chapter 9 is devoted to the integration of
                 interval functions, particularly of interval
                 polynomials since for sufficiently smooth functions $f$
                 a Taylor expansion is used to construct an enclosure
                 for $f$. Therefore, automatic differentiation and
                 automatic generation of Taylor coefficients are also
                 handled in order to find enclosures for definite
                 integrals -- also multiple ones -- over $f$. A short
                 chapter lists some ideas for verifying and enclosing
                 solutions of integral equations, initial value
                 problems, and boundary value problems. Some literature
                 for partial differential equations is added. The final
                 Chapter 11 gives a first impression of how the tool
                 `interval analysis' is applied in practice. Problems
                 are listed which use computer-assisted proofs based on
                 interval arithmetic. A prototypical algorithm is
                 discussed for global optimization. Numerous examples
                 from engineering are mentioned.\par

                 An appendix covers a variety of topics: Sets and
                 functions, a formulary for intervals, hints for
                 selected exercises, Internet resources, and INTLAB
