In particular, we discuss some methods for finding the invariants of loops and specifications of auxiliary tail recursive functions. These methods use techniques from (polynomial) algebra and combinatorics, namely Groebner bases, variable elimination and symbolic summation (the Gosper algorithm, the technique of generating functions). The methods are demonstrated on several examples which have been treated automatically by our mplementation.},

   title = {The {T}heorema System},
   language = {english},
   abstract = {We present the mathematical assistant system ``Theorema'', which---as its ultimate goal---tries to provide computer-support for a mathematician during all phases of mathematical activity, such as ``defining new concepts from given concepts'', ``developing algorithms'', ``conjecture properties of concepts/algorithms'', ``proving properties of concepts/algorithms'', ``publishing results'', etc. Lots of progress has been made in the last 40 years in the development of so-called ``computer algebra systems'' (e.g. Mathematica, Maple, Axiom, Reduce, Derive, etc.) and automated theorem provers (e.g. TPS, HOL, Vampire, Waldmeister, Isabelle, PVS, etc.) but unfortunately the worlds of ``computation'' and ``proving'' have driven apart, at least in the sense of tool-support. Theorema, designed and directed by Bruno Buchberger at RISC, is an approach to re-unite these separated worlds, i.e. to provide machine-support for both computing AND proving in one uniform frame. In addition to that, the Theorema system tries to support common mathematical textbook-like language in both input and output. The talk will give an overview over the main capabilities of the system and will mostly feature live demos.},

   title = {{Computer-supported Proving in ZF Set Theory with the Theorema System}},
   language = {english},
   abstract = {We present the mathematical assistant system ``Theorema'', and therein focus on the set theory prover for ZF. We will give a brief overview on the entire system, how proof search is organized, and how set theory proving is integrated into this framework. Moreover, we will describe precisely the language constructs from ZF that are supported by the prover. An emphasis will be put on the combination of ``proving, computing, and solving'' as a proof search technique. The talk will give an overview over the main capabilities of the system (and the set theory prover in particular!) and will mostly feature live demos of example proofs using the set theory prover. Theorema is designed and directed by Bruno Buchberger at RISC Linz, Austria. In contrast to the lecture on Feb 20, which tried to give an overview over the entire Theorema system philosophy, this talk will concentrate on proving inside Theorema, how proof search is setup in the system and within the set theory prover, and it will show much more examples of automated proofs and little to nothing about ``computation''.},

We present an algorithm for deciding zero equivalence of these sequences, thereby providing a new algorithm for proving identities among combinatorial sequences: in order to prove an identity, decide by the algorithm whether the difference of left hand side and right hand side is identically zero. This algorithm is able to treat mathematical objects which are not covered by any other known symbolic method for proving combinatorial identities. Despite its theoretical flavor and its high complexity, an implementation of the algorithm can be successfully applied to nontrivial examples.},

   title = {Computer Algebra for Special Function Inequalities},
   language = {english},
   abstract = {Computer algebra has, in the past few decades, grown to a valuable tool for answering questions about special functions. We are now in a position that many different kinds of identities can be proven and even discovered automatically, with little to no human assistance. In contrast to identities, inequalities for special functions have long been considered inaccessible to symbolic computation. But they are not. In the talk we will present a recent computer procedure that facilitates the work with special function inequalities. This procedure might fail to arrive at a decision (true or false) for a particular inequality at hand, returning the answer ``I-don't-know''. In this situation, the human may assist the computer by appropriately reformulating the inequality. Which reformulations are appropriate for the proving procedure is, however, not at all clear a priori and has to be investigated via experimenting. We will show some examples of nontrivial inequalities which we were able to prove in this way.},

   abstract = {The technique of determining a generating function for an unambiguous context-free language is known as the Schuetzenberger methodology. For regular languages, Elena Barcucci et al. proposed an approach for inverting this methodology based on Soittola's theorem. This idea allows a combinatorial interpretation (by means of a regular language) of certain positive integer sequences that are defined by C-finite recurrences. In this paper we present a Maple implementation of this inverse methodology and describe various applications. We give a short introduction to the underlying theory, i.e., the question of deciding N-rationality. In addition, some aspects and problems concerning the implementation are discussed; some examples from combinatorics illustrate its applicability.},

Rather than on logical calculi, methods arising from computer algebra are applied to this end. In this talk, we report on some recent progress in the area of algorithms for proving facts about combinatorial sequences. The methods we present in the talk go in two respects beyond the classical algorithms: (1) the class of sequences to which they apply is much larger than for other algorithms, and (2) not only identities but also inequalities can be proven. We will illustrate the methods at examples taken from the literature, which have not been proven automatically before, and we will also comment on theoretical and practical limitiations of our approach.},

A sequence is called P-finite if it satisfies a homogeneous linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. Two sequences are called shift equivalent if shifting one of the sequences $s$ times makes it identical to the other, for some integer~$s$. Our algorithm computes, for any two P-finite sequences, given via recurrence equation and initial values, all integers $s$ such that shifting the first sequence $s$ times yields the second.},

   title = {Algorithms for Nonlinear Higher Order Difference Equations},
   language = {english},
   abstract = {In this thesis, new algorithmic methods for the treatment of special sequences are presented. The sequences that we consider are described by systems of difference equations (recurrences). These systems may be coupled, non-linear, and/or higher order. The class of sequences defined in this way (admissible sequences) contains a lot of sequences which are of interest in various mathematical applications. While some of these sequences can be handled also with known Algorithms, for many others no adequate methods were available up to now. In the center of our interest, there are algorithms for automatically proving known identities of admissible sequences, and for automatically discovering new ones. By ``finding new identities'', we mean in particular solving of difference equations in closed form, finding closed forms for symbolic sums, and finding algebraic dependencies of given sequences. In addition, we present a procedure by which some inequalities of admissible sequences can be proven automatically. For their algorithmic treatment, admissible sequences are represented as elements of certain special difference rings. In these difference rings, computations are then carried out, whose results can be interpreted as statements about the original admissible sequences. Known techniques for commutative multivariate polynomial rings, especially the theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases, are applied to this end. Part of the present thesis is an implementation of the presented algorithms in form of a software package for the computer algebra system Mathematica. With the aid of our software, we succeeded in proving a lot of identities and inequalities from the literature automatically for the first time. Additionally, with the same software, we have found some identities which were probably unknown up to now.},

For regular languages, Barcucci et al. proposed in their paper ``A Technology for Reverse-Engineering a Combinatorial Problem from a Rational Generating Function'' a technology for inverting this methodology, which allows to give a combinatorial interpretation (by means of a regular expression) of certain positive integer sequences that are defined by a linear recurrence. In this thesis, we provide an implementation of this inverse methodology in Maple. Therefore, a detailed introduction to the underlying theory, i.e., the theory of formal power series and especially the question of deciding N-rationality, is given. Further, various aspects and problems concerning the implementation are discussed, and some examples from combinatorics illustrate its applicability.},

Die Algorithmen zur Behandlung solcher Identit{\"a}ten unterscheiden sich voneinander in der Klasse der Folgen und Funktionen, auf die sie sich anwenden lassen. Im Vortrag werden wir einen neuen Algorithmus zum Beweisen von diskreten univariaten Identit{\"a}ten vorstellen, dessen Eingabeklasse einige interessante Folgen enth{\"a}lt, f{\"u}r deren Behandlung bisher keine Algorithmen zur Verf{\"u}gung standen. Beispiele hierf{\"u}r sind bestimmte Identit{\"a}ten von Kettenbr{\"u}chen, nicht-linear rekursiven Folgen oder Folgen mit unbestimmter Anzahl von Variablen. Der Algorithmus reduziert die Frage nach der G{\"u}ltigkeit einer vorgelegten Identit{\"a}t auf ein Membership-Problem in polynomieller Idealtheorie, das sich mit Hilfe von Standardverfahren der kommutativen Algebra l{\"o}sen l{\"a}\sst. Im Vortrag werden wir auf die Funktionsweise des Algorithmus ebenso eingehen wie auf typische Anwendungssituationen.},

   abstract = {A sequence of complex numbers is holonomic if it satisfies a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients. A power series is holonomic if it satisfies a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients, which is equivalent to its coefficient sequence being holonomic. It is well known that all algebraic power series are holonomic. We show that the analogous statement for sequences is false by proving that the sequence $\{\sqrt{n}\}_n$ is not holonomic. In addition, we show that $\{n^n\}_n$, the Lambert $W$ function and $\{\log{n}\}_n$ are not holonomic, where in the case of $\{\log{n}\}_n$ we have to rely on an open conjecture from transcendental number theory.},

It was generalized by Wilf and Zeilberger to the ($q$-)case and to multisums. The talk presents a new generalization of (Wilf and Zeilberger's generalization of) Fasenmyer's algorithm to a larger class of special functions. This class consists of $\partial$-finite functions satisfying certain technical conditions. It includes, in particular, the holonomic functions, and enjoys various closure properties. Applications to certain sums and integrals involving orthogonal polynomials are given, using our Mathematica implementation of our algorithm.},

During their learning process, students are encouraged to engage themselves in various kinds of interactive experiments, both of visual and purely formal mathematical nature. The computer-algebra system Mathematica powers the visualization of mathematical concepts and the tools provided by the theorem proving system Theorema are used for the formal counterparts. We present a case study on the concept of equivalence relations and set partitions, in which we demonstrate the entire bandwidth of computer-support that we envision for modern learning environments for mathematics.},

   abstract = {Collins' Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition method (CAD) can be used to prove geometry theorems that involve order relation (that is, the algebraic form consists of polynomial equalities and inequalities). Unfortu- nately only very simple geometric statements can be proved this way, as the method is very time consuming. To overcome the slowness of Collins' CAD method for complicated polynomials we propose a method (section 4) that combines the area method for computing geometric quantities and the CAD method. We present an implementation of this method as part of the Geom- etry Prover in the frame of the Theorema project.},

The equations to be solved in integers are resonant conditions for nonlinearly interacting waves and their form is defined by the wave dispersion. It is established that for the most common dispersion as an arbitrary function of a wave-vector length two different generic algorithms are necessary: (1) one-class-case algorithm for waves interacting through scales, and (2) two-class-case algorithm for waves interacting through phases. In our previous paper we described the one-class-case generic algorithm and in our present paper we present the two-class-case generic algorithm.},

   language = {english},
   abstract = {Model of laminated wave turbulence allows to study statistical and discrete layers of turbulence in the frame of the same model. Statistical layer is described by Zakharov-Kolmogorov energy spectra in the case of irrational enough dispersion function. Discrete layer is covered by some system(s) of Diophantine equations while their form is determined by wave dispersion function. This presents a very special computational challenge - to solve Diophantine equations in many variables, usually 6 to 8, in high degrees, say 16, in integers of order $10^{16}$ and more. Generic algorithms for solving this problem in the case of {\it irrational} dispersion function have been presented in our previous papers. In this paper we present a new algorithm for the case of {\it rational} dispersion functions. Special importance of this case is due to the fact that in wave systems with rational dispersion the statistical layer does not exist and the general energy transport is governed by the discrete layer alone.},

   abstract = {The structure of exact and quasi-resonances in water-wave turbulence is studied. It is shown the number of exact 4-wave resonances is huge (hundreds million) even in comparatively small spectral domain when both scale and ``angle'' energy transport is taken into account. It is also shown that angle transport can contribute inexplicitly to scale transport. Restrictions for quasi-resonances to start are written out explicitly. The results can contribute to short-term forecast of wave field evolution.},

Numerical simulations of the last few years showed unambiguously the existence of some discrete effects in the short-waves part of the wave spectrum. Newly presented model of laminated turbulence explains theoretically appearance of these effects thus putting a novel problem - construction of fast algorithms for computation of solutions of resonance conditions with integer wave-numbers of order $10^3$ and more. Example of such an algorithm for 4-waves interactions of gravity waves is given. Its generalization on the different types of waves is briefly discussed.},
