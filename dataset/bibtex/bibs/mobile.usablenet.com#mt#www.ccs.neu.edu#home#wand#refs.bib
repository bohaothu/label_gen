To cope with the complexity of today's distributed systems, however, we think that high-level linguistic mechanisms are needed to effectively structure, abstract and reuse object interactions. For example, the conventional object-oriented model does not provide high-level language mechanisms to model layered system architectures. Moreover, we consider the message passing model of the conventional object-oriented model as being too low-level because it can only specify object interactions that involve two partner objects at a time and its semantics cannot be extended easily. This paper introduces Abstract Communication Types (ACTs), which are objects that abstract interactions among objects. ACT s make it easier to model layered communication architectures, to enforce the invariant behavior among objects, to reduce the complexity of programs by hiding the interaction details in separate modules and to improve reusability through the application of object-oriented principles to ACT classes. We illustrate the concept of ACT s using the composition filters model." } @Book{ Allen78, author = "Allen, John R.", title = "Anatomy of LISP", publisher = "McGraw-Hill", year = "1978", address = "New York", } @techreport{ AllenEtAl:tr05fortress, author = {Eric Allen and David Chase and Victor Luchango and Jan-Willem Maessen and Sukyoung Ryu and Guy L.

The analysis proceeds by inferring {\em constraints\/} that characterize the data flow relationships of the analyzed program. Experiences with MrSpidey, a static debugger based on SBA, indicate that SBA can adequately deal with programs of up to a couple of thousand lines of code. SBA fails, however, to cope with larger programs because it generates systems of constraints that are at least linear, and possibility quadratic, in the size of the analyzed program. This article presents theoretical and practical results concerning methods for reducing the size of constraint systems. The theoretical results include of proof-theoretic characterization of the {\em observable behavior\/} of constraint systems for program components, and a complete algorithm for deciding the observable equivalence of constraint systems. In the course of this development we establish a close connection between the observable equivalence of constraint systems and the equivalence of regular-tree grammars. We then exploit this connection to adapt a variety of algorithms for simplifying grammars to the problem of simplifying constraint systems. Based on the resulting algorithms, we have developed {\em componential set-based analysis\/}, a modular and polymorphic variant of SBA. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the simplification algorithms and the componential analysis. The simplified constraint systems are typically an order of magnitude smaller than the original systems.

In particular, our method allows one to write down a bisimulation relation directly in cases where \sp requires an inductive specification, and where the method of Pitts and Stark [1998] is inapplicable. Our method can also express examples with higher-order functions, in contrast with the most widely known previous methods [Sumii-Pierce 2005, Pitts-Stark 1998, Benton-Leperchey 2005], which are limited in their ability to deal with examples containing higher-order functions. The bisimulation conditions are derived by manually extracting proof obligations from a hypothetical direct proof of contextual equivalence.}, source = {papers/popl-06}, } @InProceedings{ KranzEtAl86, author = "Kranz, David~A. and Kel\-sey, Richard and Rees, Jona\-than A. and Hudak, Paul and Philbin, James and Adams, Norman I.", title = "Orbit: An Optimizing Compiler for Scheme", booktitle = "Proceedings SIGPLAN '86 Symposium on Compiler Construction", year = "1986", note = "{\it {SIGPLAN Notices 21}\/}(7), July, 1986, 219-223" } @inproceedings{ KrishnamurthiErlichFelleisen:esop99, author="Shriram Krishnamurthi and Yan-David Erlich and Matthias Felleisen", title="Expressing Structural Properties as Language Constructs", booktitle=esop, year=1999, publisher= springer, address = springeraddr, month=mar, series=lncs, number=1576, pages="258--272"} } @inproceedings{ KrishnamurthiFelleisenDuba:gcse99, author="Shriram Krishnamurthi and Matthias Felleisen and Bruce F.~Duba", title="From Macros to Reusable Generative Programming", booktitle=gcse, year=1999, month=sep, publisher = springer, address = springeraddr, series=lncs, pages="105--120", number=1799} Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories and Some Algebraic Problems in the context of Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories F.

For example, the rng selector chooses the ranges of procedures flowing through an expression. The MrSpidey static debugger for PLT Scheme is based on Flanagan's formalism. In PLT Scheme, a case-lambda is a procedure with possibly several argument lists and clauses. When a case-lambda is applied at a particular call site, at most one clause is actually invoked, chosen by the number of actual arguments. Therefore, an analysis should propagate data only through appropriate case-lambda clauses. MrSpidey propagates data through all clauses of a case-lambda, lessening its usefulness as a static debugger. Wishing to retain Flanagan's framework, we extended it to better analyze case-lambda with rest parameters by annotating selectors with arity information. The resulting analysis gives strictly better results than MrSpidey. Unfortunately, the improved analysis is too expensive because of overheads imposed by the use of selectors. Nonetheless, a closure-analysis style SBA (CA-SBA) eliminates these overheads and can give comparable results within cubic time.}, source = {papers/scheme-01}, OPTannote = {} } @Article{ Meyer82, author = "Meyer, Albert R.", title = "What Is a Model of the Lambda Calculus?", journal = "Information and Control", year = "1982", volume = "52", pages = "87--122", } @InProceedings{ Meyer84, author = {Albert R.

We begin by reviewing the original definition of LISP [20] in an attempt to clarify the source of its metalinguistic power. We find that it arises from a problematic clause in this definition. We then define the abstract syntax and operational semantics of M-LISP, essentially a hybrid of M-expression LISP and Scheme. Next, we tie the operational semantics to the corresponding equational logic. As usual, provable equality in the logic implies operational equality.\par Having established this framework we then extend M-LISP with the metalinguistic {\em eval} and {\em reify} operators (the latter is a nonstrict operator that converts its argument to its metalanguage representation). These operators encapsulate the matalinguistic representation conversions that occur globally in S-expression LISP. We show that the naive versions of these operators render LISP's equational logic inconsistent. On the positive side, we show that a naturally restricted form of the {\em eval} operator is confluent and therefore a conservative extension of M-LISP.

It is motivated by the desire to identify what, if any, are the difficulties created purely by {\em locality\/} of state, independent of other properties such as side-effects, exceptional termination and non-termination due to recursion. We consider a simple language (equivalent to a fragment of Standard ML) of typed, higher order functions that can dynamically create fresh {\em names\/}; names are created with local scope, can be tested for equality and can be passed around via function application, but that is all. Despite the extreme simplicity of the language and its operational semantics, the observable properties of such functions are shown to be very subtle. A notion of `logical relation' is introduced which incorporates a version of {\em representation independence\/} for local names. We show how to use it to establish observational equivalences. The method is shown to be complete (and decidable) for expressions of first order types, but incomplete at higher types.} } @InCollection{ PittsStark98, author = {Andrew Pitts and Ian Stark}, title = {Operational Reasoning for Functions with Local State}, booktitle = {Higher Order Operational Techniques in Semantics}, editor = {Andrew Gordon and Andrew Pitts}, year = {1998}, pages = {227--273}, publisher = {Publications of the Newton Institute, Cambridge University Press}, url = {http://www.ed.ac.uk/~stark/operfl.html}, } @Article{ Plotkin75, author = "Plotkin, Gordon D.", title = "Call-by-Name, Call-by-Value and the {$\lambda$}-Calculus", journal = "Theoretical Computer Science", year = "1975", volume = "1", pages = "125--159", } @Article{ Plotkin76, author = "Plotkin, Gordon D.", title = "A Powerdomain Construction", journal = "SIAM Journal on Computing", year = "1976", } @Article{ Plotkin77, author = "Plotkin, Gordon D.", title = "{LCF} Considered as a Programming Language", journal = "Theoretical Computer Science", year = "1977", volume = "5", pages = "223--255", } @TechReport{ Plotkin81, author = "Plotkin, Gordon D.", title = "A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics", institution = "Aarhus University", year = "1981", number = "DAIMI FN-19", OPTaddress = "", OPTmonth = Sept, OPTnote = "" } @InProceedings{ PlotkinMitchell84, author = "Plotkin, Gordon D. and Mitchell, John C.", title = "Abstract Types have Existential Type", booktitle = "{\popl{12th}}", year = "1985", note = "Revised version to appear in {\it ACM Transactions On Programming Languages and Systems}", } @InProceedings{ PlotkinPower01, author = "Gordon Plotkin and John Power", title = "Adequacy for Algebraic Effects", booktitle = "Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures (FOSSACS)", series = lncs, address = springeraddr, volume = "2030", OPTpages = "1--??", year = "2001", coden = "LNCSD9", ISSN = "0302-9743", bibdate = "Sat Feb 2 13:03:47 MST 2002", url = "http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/series/0558/bibs/2030/20300001.htm; http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/series/0558/papers/2030/20300001.pdf", acknowledgement = ack-nhfb, } @inproceedings{ PlotkinPower:fossacs02, author = "Gordon D.

The translation compiles SML's use of declarations and pattern matching into lambda terms, and transforms the use of environments in the operational semantics into a simpler relation of evaluation to canonical form. The translation is shown to be `fully abstract', in the sense that it both preserves and reflects observational equivalence (also commonly called contextual equivalence). A co-inductively defined notion of applicative bisimilarity for lambda calculi with state is developed to establish this result.} } @Article{ Robinson65, author = "Robinson, J.

For example, the rng selector chooses the ranges of procedures flowing through an expression. The MrSpidey static debugger for PLT Scheme is based on Flanagan's formalism. In PLT Scheme, a case-lambda is a procedure with possibly several argument lists and clauses. When a case-lambda is applied at a particular call site, at most one clause is actually invoked, chosen by the number of actual arguments. Therefore, an analysis should propagate data only through appropriate case-lambda clauses. MrSpidey propagates data through all clauses of a case-lambda, lessening its usefulness as a static debugger. Wishing to retain Flanagan's framework, we extended it to better analyze case-lambda with rest parameters by annotating selectors with arity information. The resulting analysis gives strictly better results than MrSpidey. Unfortunately, the improved analysis is too expensive because of overheads imposed by the use of selectors. Nonetheless, a closure-analysis style SBA (CA-SBA) eliminates these overheads and can give comparable results within cubic time.}, source = {papers/scheme-01}, } @InProceedings{WandWilliamson:ESOP-02, author = {Mitchell Wand and Galen B.

We present an algorithm that takes the least solution to the flow constraints of a program and constructs in linear time the least solution to the flow constraints for the CPS-transformed program. Previous studies of this question used CPS transformations that had the effect of duplicating code, or of introducing flow sensitivity into the analysis. Our algorithm has the property that for a program point in the original program and the corresponding program point in the CPS-transformed program, the flow information is the same. By carefully avoiding both duplicated code and flow-sensitive analysis, we find that the most accurate analysis of the CPS-transformed program is neither better nor worse than the most accurate analysis of the original. Thus a compiler that needed flow information after CPS transformation could use the flow information from the original program to annotate some program points, and it could use our algorithm to find the the rest of the flow information quickly, rather than having to analyze the CPS-transformed program. }, source = {~/papers/jfp-03}, annote = {previously listed as PalsbergWand00, from ~/papers/cps-flow-99.

Similar reasoning techniques for class-based languages don't consider inheritance at all, or forbid the context from extending related classes. Other techniques that do consider inheritance study whole-program equivalence. Our technique also handles public, protected, and private interfaces of classes, imperative fields, and invocations of callbacks. Using our technique we were able to prove equivalences in examples with higher-order behavior, where previous methods for functional calculi admit limitations. Furthermore we use our technique as a tool to understand the exact effect of inheritance on contextual equivalence. We do that by deriving conditions of equivalence for a language without inheritance and compare them to those we get after we extend the language with it. In a similar way we show that adding a cast operator is a conservative extension of the language. } } @article{ Culpepper2010:SCP, author = {Culpepper, Ryan and Felleisen, Matthias}, title = {Debugging hygienic macros}, journal = {Sci.
