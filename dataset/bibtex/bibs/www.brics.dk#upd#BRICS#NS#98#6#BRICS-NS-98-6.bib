                  The topic of the workshop will be on
                  proof-theory with connections to issues of
                  complexity in the widest sense including e.g.:
                  
                  \begin{enumerate}
                  \item Strength (proof-theoretic and
                    mathematical) of subsystems of second-order
                    arithmetic and type theories. 
                  \item Type-free applicative systems (explicit
                    mathematics). 
                  \item Complexity of Proof Transformations
                    (cut-elimination, normalization,
                    epsilon-substitution etc.). 
                  \item Proofs as Programs. 
                  \item Proof Interpretations and their
                    complexity: Realizability and functional
                    interpretations, game theoretic and
                    categorical interpretations. 
                  \item Bounded arithmetic and connections to
                    complexity theory (including feasible
                    arithmetic and analysis). 
                  \item Proof Complexity of propositional proof
                    systems: resolution, Frege systems,
                    Nullstellensatz proofs etc. 
                  \item Interactive and probabilistic proofs. 
                  \end{enumerate}
                  
                  There were two preparatory lectures during the
                  week before the workshop (by E.~Palmgren and
                  V.~Orevkov---abstracts can be obtained from the
                  BRICS homepage), and there are two special
                  lectures in connection with the workshop that
                  take place during this week (by A.~Feferman and
                  A.~Wigderson)",
