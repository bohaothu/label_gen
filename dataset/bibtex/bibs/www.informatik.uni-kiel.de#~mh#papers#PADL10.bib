We describe a framework to support the implementation
of web-based systems to manipulate data stored in relational
databases. Since the conceptual model of a relational database
is often specified as an entity-relationship (ER) model,
we propose to use the ER model to generate
a complete implementation in the declarative programming language
Curry. This implementation contains operations to create and
manipulate entities, supports authentication,
authorization, session handling, and the composition of
individual operations to user processes.
Furthermore and most important, the implementation ensures
the consistency of the database w.r.t.\ the data dependencies
specified in the ER model, i.e., updates initiated by the user
cannot lead to an inconsistent state of the database.
In order to generate a high-level declarative implementation
that can be easily adapted to individual customer requirements,
the framework exploits previous works on declarative
database programming and web user interface construction in Curry.
