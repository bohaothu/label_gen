 abstract       = {The neurons in the intermediate layers of the monkey
                  superior colliculus (SC) that discharge before saccadic
                  eye movements can be divided into at least two types,
                  burst and buildup neurons, and the differences in their
                  characteristics are compatible with different
                  functional contributions of the two cell types. It has
                  been suggested that a spread of activity across the
                  population of the buildup neurons during saccade
                  generation may contribute to the control of saccadic
                  eye movements. The influence of any such spread should
                  be on both the horizontal and vertical components of
                  the saccade because the map of the movement fields on
                  the SC is a two-dimensional one; it should affect the
                  trajectory of saccade. The present experiments used
                  muscimol injections to inactivate areas within the SC
                  to determine the functional contribution of such a
                  spread of activity on the trajectory of the saccades.
                  The analysis concentrated on saccades made to areas of
                  the visual field that should be affected primarily by
                  alteration of buildup neuron activity. Muscimol
                  injections produced saccades with altered trajectories;
                  they became consistently curved after the injection,
                  and successive saccades to the same targets had similar
                  curvatures. The curved saccades showed changes in their
                  direction and speed at the very beginning of the
                  saccade, and for those saccades that reached the
                  target, the direction of the saccade was altered near
                  the end to compensate for the initially incorrect
                  direction. Postinjection saccades had lower peak
                  speeds, longer durations, and longer latencies for
                  initiation. The changes in saccadic trajectories
                  resulting from muscimol injections, along with the
                  previous observations on changes in speed of saccades
                  with such injections, indicate that the SC is involved
                  in influencing the eye position during the saccade as
                  well as at the end of the saccade. The changes in
                  trajectory when injections were made more rostral in
                  the SC than the most active burst neurons also are
                  consistent with a contribution of the buildup neurons
                  to the control of the eye trajectory. The results do
                  not, however, support the hypothesis that the buildup
                  neurons in the SC act as a spatial integrator.},

 abstract       = {Complex visual scenes require that a target for an
                  impending saccadic eye movement be selected from a
                  larger number of possible targets. We investigated
                  whether changing the probability that a visual stimulus
                  would be selected as the target for a saccade altered
                  activity of monkey superior colliculus (SC) neurons in
                  two experiments. First, we changed the number of
                  possible targets on each trial. Second, we kept the
                  visual display constant and presented a single saccade
                  target repeatedly so that target probability was
                  established over time. Buildup neurons in the SC, those
                  with delay period activity, showed a consistent
                  reduction in activity as the probability of the saccade
                  decreased, independent of the visual stimulus
                  configuration. Other SC neurons, fixation and burst,
                  were largely unaffected by the changes in saccade
                  target probability. Because we had monkeys making
                  saccades to many locations within the visual field, we
                  could examine activity associated with saccades outside
                  of the movement field of neurons. We found the activity
                  of buildup neurons to be similar across the SC, before
                  the target was identified, and reduced when the number
                  of possible targets increased. The results of our
                  experiments are consistent with a role for this
                  activity in establishing a motor set. We found,
                  consistent with this interpretation, that the activity
                  of these neurons was predictive of the latency of a
                  saccadic eye movement and not other saccade parameters
                  such as end point or peak velocity.},

 abstract       = {Visual scenes are composed of many elements and
                  although we can appreciate a scene as a whole, we can
                  only move our eyes to one element of the scene at a
                  time. As visual scenes become more complex, the number
                  of potential targets in the scene increases, and the
                  uncertainty that any particular one will be selected
                  for an eye movement also increases. How motor systems
                  accommodate this target uncertainty remains unknown.
                  The activities of neurons in both the cerebral cortex
                  and superior colliculus are modulated by this selection
                  process. We reasoned that activity associated with
                  target uncertainty should be evident in the saccadic
                  motor system at the final stages of neural processing,
                  in the superior colliculus. By systematically changing
                  the number of stimuli from which a selection must be
                  made and recording from superior colliculus neurons, we
                  found that as the target uncertainty increased, the
                  neural activity preceding target selection decreased.
                  These results indicate that neurons within the final
                  common pathway for movement generation are active well
                  in advance of the selection of a particular movement.
                  This early activity varies with the probability that a
                  particular movement will be selected.},

 abstract       = {Many neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) and
                  lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas of cerebral cortex
                  are active during the visual-motor events preceding the
                  initiation of saccadic eye movements: they respond to
                  visual targets, increase their activity before
                  saccades, and maintain their activity during
                  intervening delay periods. Previous experiments have
                  shown that the output neurons from both LIP and FEF
                  convey the full range of these activities to the
                  superior colliculus (SC) in the brain stem. These areas
                  of cerebral cortex also have strong interconnections,
                  but what signals they convey remains unknown. To
                  determine what these cortico-cortical signals are, we
                  identified the LIP neurons that project to FEF by
                  antidromic activation, and we studied their activity
                  during a delayed-saccade task. We then compared these
                  cortico-cortical signals to those sent subcortically by
                  also identifying the LIP neurons that project to the
                  intermediate layers of the SC. Of 329 FEF projection
                  neurons and 120 SC projection neurons, none were
                  co-activated by both FEF and SC stimulation. FEF
                  projection neurons were encountered more superficially
                  in LIP than SC projection neurons, which is consistent
                  with the anatomical projection of many cortical layer
                  III neurons to other cortical areas and of layer V
                  neurons to subcortical structures. The estimated
                  conduction velocities of FEF projection neurons (16.7
                  m/s) were significantly slower that those of SC
                  projection neurons (21.7 m/s), indicating that FEF
                  projection neurons have smaller axons. We identified
                  three main differences in the discharge properties of
                  FEF and SC projection neurons: only 44\% of the FEF
                  projection neurons changed their activity during the
                  delayed-saccade task compared with 69\% of the SC
                  projection neurons; only 17\% of the task-related FEF
                  projection neurons showed saccadic activity, whereas
                  42\% of the SC projection neurons showed such
                  increases; 78\% of the FEF projection neurons had a
                  visual response but no saccadic activity, whereas only
                  55\% of the SC projection neurons had similar activity.
                  The FEF and SC projection neurons had three
                  similarities: both had visual, delay, and saccadic
                  activity, both had stronger delay and saccadic activity
                  with visually guided than with memory-guided saccades,
                  and both had broadly tuned responses for disparity
                  stimuli, suggesting that their visual receptive fields
                  have a three-dimensional configuration. These
                  observations indicate that the activity carried between
                  parietal and frontal cortical areas conveys a spectrum
                  of signals but that the preponderance of activity
                  conveyed might be more closely related to earlier
                  visual processing than to the later saccadic stages
                  that are directed to the SC.},

                  (PPC) and the superior colliculus (SC) was investigated
                  by antidromically activating neurons within the lateral
                  intraparietal (LIP) area with single-pulse stimulation
                  delivered to the intermediate layers of the SC. To
                  dissociate visual and saccade-related responses, the
                  discharge properties of the identified efferent neurons
                  were studied in the delayed visually guided saccade
                  task and the memory guided saccade task. We found that
                  the great majority (74\%) of the identified LIP
                  efferent neurons have a peripheral visual receptive
                  field, typically with a broad spatial tuning. About
                  two-thirds (64\%) exhibited sustained activity during
                  the delay period of the behavioral tasks, during which
                  the monkeys had to withhold eye movements, and 80\% of
                  these increased their activity just before the onset of
                  saccades. Both delay and presaccadic discharges in the
                  delayed visually guided saccade task were higher than
                  in the memory guided saccade task. These results
                  establish that the neuronal signal sent by LIP to the
                  SC carries both visual and saccade-related information.},

                  3331-3333, 1998. Anatomical studies have shown that the
                  frontal eye field (FEF) and superior colliculus (SC) of
                  monkeys are reciprocally connected, and a physiological
                  study described the signals sent from the FEF to the
                  SC. Nothing is known, however, about the signals sent
                  from the SC to the FEF. We physiologically identified
                  and characterized FEF neurons that are likely to
                  receive input from the SC. Fifty-two FEF neurons were
                  found that were orthodromically activated by electrical
                  stimulation of the intermediate or deeper layers of the
                  SC. All the neurons that we tested (n = 34) discharged
                  in response to visual stimulation. One-half also
                  discharged when saccadic eye movements were made. This
                  provides the first direct evidence that the ascending
                  pathway from SC to FEF might carry visual- and
                  saccade-related signals. Our findings support a
                  hypothesis that the SC and the FEF interact
                  bidirectionally during the events leading up to saccade
                  generation.},
