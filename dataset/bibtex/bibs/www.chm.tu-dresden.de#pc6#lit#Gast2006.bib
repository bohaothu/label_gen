  abstract = {{We describe a novel microfluldic perfusion system for high-resolution
	microscopes. Its modular design allows pre-coating of the coverslip
	surface with reagents, biomolecules, or cells. A poly(dimethylsiloxane)
	(PDMS) layer is cast in a special molding station, using masters
	made by photolithography and dry etching of silicon or by photoresist
	patterning on glass or silicon. This channel system can be reused
	while the coverslip is exchanged between experiments. As normal fluidic
	connectors are used, the link to external, computer-programmable
	syringe pumps is standardized and various fluidic channel networks
	can be used in the same setup. The system can house hydrogel microvalves
	and microelectrodes close to the imaging area to control the influx
	of reaction partners. We present a range of applications, including
	single-molecule analysis by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
	(FCS), manipulation of single molecules for nanostructuring by hydrodynamic
	flow fields or the action of motor proteins, generation of concentration
	gradients, trapping and stretching of live cells using optical fibers
	precisely mounted in the PDMS layer, and the integration of microelectrodes
	for actuation and sensing.}},
