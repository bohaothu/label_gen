   abstract = {Starting-up production machines takes a considerable part of time and
      development expenses. Especially in the case of reconfigurable machines a short
      start-up phase is essential. Many activities, which are necessary during the
      start-up, can be automated. These are the configuration of mechatronic modules,
      control- and fieldbus systems as well as the extensive testing of functions.
      This paper presents an approach based on a service- oriented architecture (SOA)
      to automate the start-up of a reconfigurable production machine. Functionality
      for configuration and start-up is provided by an internal middleware system.
      The sequence control for the startup process is realised within a configuration
      system. A new approach to the combination of field-bus and middleware
      communication infrastructure is used to adopt SOA paradigms to existing
      automation technology. Thus, real-time communication can be combined with
      flexible communication for the automatic configuration of production machines.},

   abstract = {The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) is gaining popularity for its
      ability to manage semi-structured data without a predefined database schema. So
      far, most RDF query processors have concentrated on finding complex graph
      patterns in RDF, which typically involves a high number of joins. This works
      very well to query resources by the relations between them. Yet, obtaining a
      record-like view on the attributes of resources, as natively supported by
      RDBMS, imposes unnecessary performance burdens, as the individual attributes
      must be joined to assemble the final result records.
      
      We present an approach to retrieve the attributes of resources efficiently. We
      first determine the resources in question and then retrieve all their
      attributes efficiently at once, exploiting contiguous storage in RDF indexes.
      In addition, we present an index structure which is specifically designed for
      RDF attribute retrieval. In a performance evaluation we show that our approach
      is clearly superior for larger numbers of retrieved attributes.},

   abstract = {Integration efforts in today’s manufacturing environments tend to enable
      service-based communication interfaces between enterprise and manufacturing
      systems. Constantly changing business conditions demand a high level of
      flexibility in business processes as well as an adaptive and fully
      interoperable IT infrastructure. The principles of reusability and
      loosely-coupled services have driven Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to
      become the most used paradigm for software design at the business level. In a
      manufacturing environment, event-driven architectures (EDA) are often employed
      for managing information flows across different production systems. The timely
      propagation of business-relevant events is a fundamental requirement in
      Engineer-to-Order (ETO) enterprises, which require a high level of transparency
      in their supply chains. Agility is one of the top priorities for ETO
      manufacturers in order to react to turbulent scenarios. Therefore, the main
      challenge for ETO supply chains is to identify and propagate events across the
      ETO logistics network and integrate these into the manufacturer business
      processes. We present how an existing service-oriented integration platform for
      manufacturing can be used to fill the gap between EDA-based manufacturing
      environments of an ETO supply chain and SOA-based manufacturer business
      processes. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of the Business Process
      Execution Language (BPEL) as vehicle for this integration. The adoption of BPEL
      will enable an efficient and effective reaction to turbulent manufacturing
      scenarios in an ETO supply chain.},

      design is therefore a major factor in determining the process performance and
      ultimately the success of a business. Despite this importance, the designed
      process is often less than optimal. This is due to two major challenges: First,
      since the design is an a priori ability, no actual execution data is available
      to provide the foundations for design decisions. Second, since modeling
      decision support is typically basic at best, the quality of the design largely
      depends on the ability of business analysts to make the ”right” design choices.

   abstract = {Location-based services (LBS) have gained tremendous popularity with millions
      of simultaneous users daily. LBS handle very large data volumes and face
      enormous query loads. Both the data and the queries possess high locality:
      spatial data is distributed very unevenly around the globe, query load is
      different throughout the day, and users often search for similar things in the
      same places. This causes high load peaks at the data tier of LBS, which may
      seriously degrade performance. To cope with these load peaks, we present DiSCO,
      a distributed semantic cache overlay for LBS. DiSCO exploits the spatial,
      temporal and semantic locality in the queries of LBS and distributes frequently
      accessed data over many nodes. Based on the Content-Addressable Network (CAN)
      peer-to-peer approach, DiSCO achieves high scalability by partitioning data
      using spatial proximity. Our evaluation shows that DiSCO significantly reduces
      queries to the underlying data tier.},

      sensors, constantly access the internet, and almost always accompany the user.
      Consequently, devices manage many different kinds of data about the user's life
      and context. There is considerable overlap in this data, as different
      applications handle similar data domains. Applications often keep this data in
      separated data silos. Web applications, which manage large amounts of personal
      data, hardly share this data with other applications at all. This lack of
      interoperability creates redundancy and impacts usability of mobile devices. We
      present a data management architecture for mobile devices to support
      interoperability between applications, devices and web applications at the data
      management level. We propose a central on-device repository for applications to
      share resource and context data in an integrated, extensible data model which
      uses semantic web technologies and supports location data. A web browser
      interface shares data with web applications, as controlled by a general

      topics to cope with the information explosion intrinsically associated with

      some of the major challenges of data-intensive workflows. Traditionally, the
      descriptions of such workflows focus on their data flow. Nevertheless,
      control-flow-oriented workflow languages are increasingly adapted to the needs
      of data-intensive workflows. This provides a common level of abstraction for
      both data-intensive workflows and classical orchestration workflows, e.g.,
      business workflows, which then enables a comprehensive optimization across all
      workflows. However, the problem still remains that workflows described in
      control-flow-oriented languages tend to be less efficient for data-intensive
      processes compared to specialized data-flow-oriented approaches. In this paper,
      we propose a new kind of optimization targeted at data-intensive workflows that
      are described in control-flow-oriented languages. We show how to improve
      efficiency of such workflows by introducing various techniques that partition
      the local data processing tasks to be performed during workflow execution in an
      improved way. These data processing tasks are either assigned to the workflow
      engine or to the tightly integrated local database engine. We evaluate the
      effectiveness of these techniques by means of various test scenarios.},

      infrastructure in today’s manufacturing environments. The lack of flexibility
      prevents manufacturing companies from improving their responsiveness and
      adapting their workflows to turbulent scenarios. In order to achieve highly
      flexible and adaptive workflows, information systems in digital factories and

      architectures over the last two decades. In order to overcome this issue, the
      authors present a flexible integration platform that allows a loose coupling of
      distributed services in event-driven manufacturing environments. The proposed
      approach enables a flexible communication between digital factory and shop
      floor components by introducing a service bus architecture. This solution
