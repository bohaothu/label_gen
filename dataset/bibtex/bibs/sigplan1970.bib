%%%                        bibliography, there were 1308 entries

%%%                        yearly.  The coverage by this bibliography

%%%                        At version 1.19 [31-Dec-1995], there were

%%%                        At version 3.00 [03-May-1999], the original
%%%                        bibliography had reached more than 4000
%%%                        entries, and it was therefore split into
%%%                        decade-specific files, sigplan19xx.bib, where

                 (running backwards) also attempted. Use of multiple

  abstract =     "A number of preprocessors and other extensions of
                 Fortran have been implemented recently, aimed at adding
                 'disciplined' control structures to the language. In
                 spite of wide variations in the details of these
                 dialects, many common features can be perceived. This
                 paper attempts to identify these common features, and
                 to draw some conclusions concerning their relation to a
                 possible future widely acceptable structured Fortran
                 language. Several different kinds of alternative and
                 iterative structures are described, along with some of
                 the ways they have been implemented. The use of
                 internal procedures for top-down refinement is noted.
                 Few, of the dialects include a general multiple level
                 exit, although in principle this feature is needed for
                 structured programming. Use of labels seems to be
                 preferable to any alternative way of implementing, this
                 feature in Fortran. Because of the importance of
                 compatibility with existing programs, and for other
                 reasons, it is unlikely that the GO TO statement will
                 disappear from Fortran in the forseeable future.
                 However. with the addition of new control structures it
                 should be possible to develop processors that warn
                 against certain particularly awkward usages of GO TO
                 statements. Further efforts are recommended, including
                 continued support of the ANSI X3J3 Fortran standards
                 committee, and the establishment of a separate group
                 charged with predicting trends and making timely
                 recommendations for future extensions to the
                 language.",

                 definitions meet this requirement, but a major obstacle
                 to their wider adoption has been the fact that so many
                 of our algorithms are iterative in nature, and it
                 typically has not been easy to convert an iterative
                 algorithm to one in recursive definition form.\par
                 However, if we look at recursive definitions from a
                 somewhat broader viewpoint and introduce the technique
                 of 'mu-recursion', then iterative algorithms can be
                 expressed fairly naturally in recursive form. This
                 capability opens up possibilities for a practical
                 recursive definition language useful for a wide range
                 of computational tasks. Therefore, in addition to
                 demonstrating how to write practical algorithms with
                 recursive definitions, we will discuss the prospects
                 for a practical language and its compilation. Also
                 covered briefly will be proof techniques and
                 suggestions for further research.",

                 has been to design one language at a time. This
                 approach has led to languages which are syntacticly
                 complex and incompatible with one another. The proposed
                 approach develops a language base, utilizing primitive
                 language forms, upon which new languages may be built
                 for all purposes. The resulting languages may possess
                 diverse vocabulary and characteristics, but they are
                 unified by the grammar of the language base upon which
                 they are built, and they can be translated by one
                 general processor. These languages can possess all the
                 functions and facilities of today's languages and they
                 can be readily extended to accommodate new requirements
                 as they arise. A partial implementation of a general

                 Stanford since, although MORTRAN has been widely
                 distributed in the United States and to a lesser extent
                 in Europe, we have no personal knowledge of its impact
                 elsewhere. The impact is attributed to three factors:
                 (1) portability, (2) compatibility (with existing
                 FORTRAN libraries), and (3) extensibility, which is
                 sub-divided into (a) extension of control structures,
                 and (6) extension of data structures. We divide the
                 impact into an 'initial' impact which we relate to
                 control structure extensions, and a 'secondary' impact
                 which we relate to data structure extensions. MORTRAN
                 is currently being used at SLAC to process large

                 language operand qualifiers is proposed as an addition
                 to current high level programming languages. This
                 language concept allows the programmer to access both
                 past and future values of operands and operators by
                 using natural language tense qualifiers. Current
                 computer languages require explicit array manipulation
                 by the program to maintain and access previous operand
                 values; not the one-to-one mapping of problem
                 quantities to program operands that is desirable.
                 Instead they represent a one-to-many mapping. The
                 control and use of this forced multiple mapping
                 seriously increases the complexity of our algorithms. A
                 BNF for qualifying phrases which may be used to modify
                 operands is presented. Examples of some permissible
                 qualifiers for an operand A are PREVIOUS A, NEXT A,
                 FIRST A, TENTH A, ANY A, ALL A'S, 1ST THROUGH 7TH A'S.
                 These qualifiers provide the computer programmer with
                 the ability to specify algorithms in a computer
                 language which more closely resembles a natural
                 language. Since the concept implies a distinctly
                 non-Von Neuman computer, several possible
                 implementations using current software and hardware

  abstract =     "Through the use of a modified concept of cluster [1,
                 2] we propose the association of the notions of
                 abstract data types and uniform reference to data
                 structures to PL/I. The proposed programming mechanisms
                 enhance PL/I by the addition of two new linguistic
                 dimensions: a specification level and a common base
                 language to handle the implementation of data
                 structures. This report informally describes the syntax
                 and semantics of the added constructs and gives an
                 example of their use.",

                 distributions that have been proposed by Bayer, Zipf,
                 and Zweben. This paper reports a study in which the
                 three models of operator distributions are compared
                 with the measured distributions found in 34 PL/I
                 programs. Two of three models, one by Zipf and one by
                 Zweben, are shown to correlate highly with the measured
                 distributions. Two variations of the Zipf model are
                 then formulated and tested with good results. Also, the

                 and the models is investigated.",

                 be FORTRAN?) are miles and miles apart (about

                 developments proceed, almost implacably, from the
                 primitive to the rococco, e.g. from Algol58 through
                 Algol60 to Algol68 with an appearance of a large number
                 of offshoots (e.g., JOVIAL, MAD, NELIAC and Euler),
                 extensions (FORMULA ALGOL and LCC), virile offspring
                 (PASCAL), etc., occurring enroute. The earliest
                 developments appear clean, surprising us in the new
                 views they reveal. One frets over why the vision that
                 prompted the beginning weakened during the course of
                 future developments. Perhaps it is inevitable that, as
                 unexpected complexity is uncovered, smoothness, equal
                 value if you will, in solutions cannot be maintained.
                 Trivia cannot be identified easily, special cases
                 overwhelm the search for general patterns, custom and
                 habit move performance into the realm of objective
                 concept, experience warps both intuition and reason,
                 fear of instability burdens insight with caution. The
                 elegance of Algol's offspring is a tribute to the grace
                 and power of the original. Algol, a second generation

                 myself, but not otherwise accessible or well known. In
                 addition I have tried to answer the specific questions
                 formulated by the organizers of the Conference on the
                 History of Programming Languages. The notes fall in
                 three freely intermixed groups: those that relate to
                 existing documents, those that reflect my own reasoning
                 as a participant in the development, and those that try
                 to answer the organizers' questions. Where the proper
                 support has been lacking I have left open holes in the
                 presentation. Otherwise I have tried to be specific,
                 giving names, dates, and reasons, as far as I have them
                 available. While this manner of presentation seems to
                 me the best way to support more penetrating historical
                 research into the period, it is also bound to give rise
                 to controversy. First, it is openly one-sided, in the
                 manner that any autobiography is. Further, by being
                 specific the presentation will offer sensitive points
                 of attack to those who see the same development from a
                 different angle and with different eyes. When these
                 circumstances are combined with real events that
                 involved differences of opinion and interest, strong
                 reactions are bound to be provoked. This emerged

  abstract =     "Before 1954 almost all programming was done in machine
                 language or assembly language. Programmers rightly
                 regarded their work as a complex, creative art that
                 required human inventiveness to produce an efficient
                 program. Much of their effort was devoted to overcoming
                 the difficulties created by the computers of that era:
                 the lack of index registers, the lack of built- in
                 floating point operations, restricted instruction sets
                 (which might have AND but not OR, for example), and
                 primitive input- output arrangements. Given the nature
                 of computers, the services which ``automatic
                 programming'' performed for the programmer were
                 concerned with overcoming the machine's shortcomings.
                 Thus the primary concern of some ``automatic
                 programming'' systems was to allow the use of symbolic
                 addresses and decimal numbers (e.g., the MIDAC Input
                 Translation Program [Brown and Carr 1954]). But most of
                 the larger ``automatic. Programming'' systems (with the
                 exception of Laning and Zierler's algebraic system
                 [Laning and Zierler 1954] and the A-2 compiler
                 [Remington Rand 1953; Moser 1954]) simply provided a
                 synthetic ``computer'' with an order code different
                 from that of the real machine. This synthetic computer
                 usually had floating point instructions and index
                 registers and had improved input-output commands; it
                 was therefore much easier to program than its real
                 counterpart.",

                 programming system designed for the simulation of
                 discrete systems. These are systems that can be modeled
                 as a series of state changes that occur
                 instantaneously, usually over a period of time.
                 Complexities in their analysis arise because there are
                 many elements in the system, and there is competition
                 for limited system resources. The simulation technique
                 uses numerical computation methods to follow the system
                 elements through their changes of state, and predicts
                 properties of the system from measurements on the
                 model. GPSS came into existence rapidly, with virtually
                 no planning, and surprisingly little effort. It came
                 rapidly because it filled an urgent need that left
                 little time for exploring alternatives. The lack of
                 planning came from a happy coincidence of a solution
                 meeting its problem at the right time. The economy of

                 type of application for which the language was

                 specification, no acceptable typewriter-based terminals
                 were commercially available, nor was the JOHNNIAC
                 configured to accept multi-user input/output of this
                 type. Therefore, special equipment was designed and
                 built at RAND to meet these needs. The user terminal
                 was based on the IBM model B typewriter, essentially
                 equivalent to those used by RAND secretaries at that
                 time. A special character set was specified to provide
                 the symbols required by the JOSS language. Control and
                 interface of up to eight remote consoles was provided
                 by multiple-typewriter-control-system (MTCS) hardware.
                 The development of these JOSS hardware components
                 overlapped the development of the JOSS language.",

                 Algebraic Language) was one of the first programming
                 languages developed primarily to aid in programming
                 large complex real time systems. Today it remains a
                 major language for these applications and versions of
                 JOVIAL have been implemented on dozens of different
                 computers. The language and its compilers have been
                 developed primarily by the Systems Development
                 Corporation. JOVIAL was based on Algol-58 but includes
                 numerous features not in Algol (58 or 60) which make it
                 particularly useful for programming large scale
                 systems. The most important of these is the COMPOOL

                 and refining the rather incomplete specification of

                 PL/I, and George Radin's paper makes clear the
                 distinctions between these two languages. The
                 characteristics of PL/I were strongly influenced by two
                 factors; what was known (in 1964-65) about commercial,
                 scientific, real-time and system programming
                 applications, and the features of FORTRAN, COBOL, and

  abstract =     "Tartan is an experiment in language design. The goal
                 was to determine whether a 'simple' language could meet
                 substantially all of the Ironman requirement for a
                 common high-order programming language. We undertook
                 this experiment because we believed that all the
                 designs done in the first phase of the DOD effort were
                 too large and too complex. We saw that complexity as a
                 serious failure of the designs: excess complexity in a
                 programming language can interfere with its use, even
                 to the extent that any beneficial properties are of
                 little consequence. We wanted to find out whether the
                 requirements inherently lead to such complexity or
                 whether a substantially simpler language would suffice.
                 Three ground rules drove the experiment. First, no more
                 than two months -- April 1 to May 31 -- would be
                 devoted to the project. Second, the language would meet
                 all the Ironman requirements except for a few points at
                 which it would anticipate Steelman requirements.
                 Further, the language would contain no extra features
                 unless they resulted in a simpler language. Third,
                 simplicity would be the overriding objective. The
                 resulting language, Tartan, is based on all available
                 information, including the designs already produced.
                 The language definition is presented here; a companion
                 report provides an overview of the language, a number
                 of examples, and more expository explanations of some
                 of the language features. We believe that Tartan is a
                 substantial improvement over the earlier designs,
                 particularly in its simplicity. There is, of course, no
                 objective measure of simplicity, but the syntax, the
                 size of the definition, and the number of concepts
                 required are all smaller in Tartan. Moreover, Tartan
                 substantially meets all of the Ironman requirement.
                 (The exceptions lie in a few places where we
                 anticipated Steelman requirements and where details are
                 still missing from this report.) Thus, we believe that
                 a simple language can meet the Ironman requirement.
                 Tartan is an existence proof of that. We must emphasize
                 again that this effort is an experiment, not an attempt
                 to compete with DOD contractors. Tartan is, however, an
                 open challenge to the Phase II contractors: The
                 language can be at least this simple! Can you do
                 better?",

  abstract =     "Forth is a unique threaded language ideally suited for
                 microcomputers. Programs are incredibly compact; e.g.
                 in 5K to 6K bytes you can get the interactive Forth
                 compiler, running stand-alone as its own operating
                 system including I/O drivers and other run-time
                 routines, plus an assembler written in Forth (in case
                 you want to optimize time-critical programs), virtual
                 memory software, and a text editor. Not only does all
                 this fit into 5K to 6K bytes (of which 4K are written
                 in Forth), but it runs in the same space (plus 1K
                 buffer), with no additional symbol table area,
                 overlays, swapping, or use of any other software. And
                 while Forth gives all the convenience of interactive
                 interpreters, it is very fast. For most applications,
                 the run-time overhead is 20 to 30\% for minis and 70 to
                 100\% for micros (compared to 1000\% or more which is
                 common for interpreters). Number-crunching applications
                 may take longer. And when Forth isn't fast enough, the
                 system's own assembler can be used to re-code inner
                 loops. But the best news of all is that software
                 development times are cut by half or more over assembly
                 programming. The programming is entirely structured
                 (there is no GOTO), and the resulting code is
                 re-entrant and can be designed for PROM.Forth has been
                 implemented on many microcomputers. A recommended
                 configuration is 16K bytes and a terminal; a floppy is
                 a good idea for storing source programs (and virtual
                 memory for programs and data is supported). Forth works
                 well with a CRT, so hard copy is less necessary. Forth
                 has existed for several years, and is used commercially
                 in a number of installations, but until recently it has
                 been priced far out of reach of hobbyists, and even
                 most computer experts have never heard of it. However,
                 the language is in the public domain, and today
                 low-cost versions are just becoming available. Also
                 there is a new Forth Interest Group (787 Old County Rd,
                 San Carlos, CA 94070), dedicated to letting the serious
                 hobbyist and the professional know about Forth and how
                 they can get it.",

  abstract =     "The use of complex data structures in most common
                 languages is often unnecessarily confusing to all but
                 the most experienced programmers. ATOL has been
                 designed to include a variety of data structures in a
                 way that is both simple to understand and easy to
                 handle, yet sufficiently general and powerful for a
                 wide range of applications. The syntax of the language
                 is quite simple and suitable for interactive program
                 development at on-line terminals, rather like Basic.
                 The primary data type of the language is a character
                 string or text. Three classes of data structures may be
                 constructed: records, files and sequences. For each of
                 these, the components may be either texts or other
                 structures in any of the three classes. Records may be
                 defined recursively to generate lists or trees of
                 variable size. Arrays are not present in the language,
                 their place being taken by files which are structures
                 containing variable numbers of components selected by
                 text keys. Data from a very wide range of applications
                 may thus be easily and conveniently represented. The
                 method used to denote the components of a structure in
                 a program is significantly simpler than that used in
                 languages like Algol 68 and Pascal. In addition, the
                 need to use pointers explicitly has been kept to a
                 minimum, thus reducing another source of confusion
                 among inexperienced programmers. In general the
                 language has been designed for the beginning programmer
                 whose interests are in non-numerical applications such
                 as occur in the arts and humanities and many areas of
                 commercial data processing.",

                 compiling, executing, editing and saving the program.

                 context of the PQCC Production-Quality
                 Compiler-Compiler project [8]. The approach taken is
                 unusual in several ways. The machine-dependent
                 information for selection of code sequences, register
                 assignments, etc., has been separated throughout, in
                 tabular form, from the machine independent algorithms.
                 This not only greatly simplifies the development of
                 code generators for new machines or languages, but
                 paves the way for automatic generation of these tables
                 from formal machine descriptions such as ISP [1]. A
                 parse-tree-like internal program representation is
                 used, facilitating the use of context and data
                 dependency information about expressions. The code
                 generation process has been broken into several phases.
                 This leads to simplification and better understanding
                 of the code generation process, and also allows
                 important improvements in the quality of generated
                 code. The algorithms for preliminary determination of
                 addressing modes, allocation of registers and other
                 locations, and the code selection case analysis are
                 discussed. The algorithms described in the paper are
                 being implemented and used in the PQCC compiler.",

                 for error recovery in LR parsers. The method is easy to
                 implement in existing parser generators. It uses only
                 the normal parse tables and a small amount of symbol
                 cost information. It is possible to use compressed
                 parse tables with the method, as well as other LR
                 augmentations such as precedence and associativity
                 declarations. The method is efficient enough to be used
                 in environments where space and time are at a premium.
                 Our method utilizes a number of previous error recovery
                 ideas: forward moves in the input after detection of
                 errors to incorporate right context, recovery choice
                 based on eighted costs, and the use of special
                 productions to indicate major productions in the
                 grammar for error recovery. The method also makes use
                 of semantic information in choosing between possible
                 recovery actions. We have implemented the method in a
                 production Pascal translator which has been in use for
                 instruction at a number of universities for two years.
                 We report here on measurements of our system on a
                 standard data base of Pascal programs with errors.",

                 phase may be used before code generation. The language
                 is designed to exclude source and target dependencies
                 (these are specified in a set of auxiliary tables) and
                 has been used to implement a general purpose code
                 optimization module. This module has been incorporated
                 into compilers for several source languages and has
                 resulted in production-quality target code. The paper
                 focuses on the features of the language and reviews the
                 optimizations for which it has been designed. A major
                 benefit of this approach has been to isolate many of
                 the characteristics which lead to code optimization
                 opportunities. Of particular note are numerous facts
                 which can be gathered in a target-independent manner,

                 and known to be production worthy. In this approach an
                 interpreter is used to facilitate testing and the
                 creation of fault tolerant programs. A machine code
                 generator, then applied to tested programs, preserves
                 fault tolerance and provides efficiency. The
                 application of this unique approach to fault tolerant
                 programming, which places the machine code generator
                 remote from the lexical and semantic portions of the
                 compiler, will be examined in this paper. Covered will

                 tolerance: 2) the code optimization techniques employed
