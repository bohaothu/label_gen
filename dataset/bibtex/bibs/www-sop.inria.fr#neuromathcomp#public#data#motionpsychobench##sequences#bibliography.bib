  annote	= {Visual motion is an essential piece of information for both perceiving our environment and controlling our actions. The visual motion system has evolved as an exquisite machinery adapted to reconstruct the direction and speed of the object of interest within a few dozen milliseconds. In the last decade, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of how the outputs of local motion detectors are integrated. In particular, its dynamics are now unveiled at neuronal and behavioral levels. Solutions for fundamental computational problems such as the aperture problem and the interplay between motion segmentation and integration have been proposed from these works and biologically-realistic simulations are been proposed. Such a multi-level approach is rooted in the fact that dynamics of these solutions can be tackled at different scales using similar tasks and stimuli. Dynamics of Visual Motion Processing offers an overview of recent work on the dynamics of motion integration with inter-related examples taken from physiology (both single-neuron and population activity) and psychophysics as well as sensorimotor control or active vision. The last section presents three different approaches for understanding and modeling motion perception of natural scenes, complex 3D layout, and biological motion.},
