 abstract={ In previous papers, we used abstract potential theory, as developed by Fuglede and Ohtsuka, to a systematic treatment of rendezvous numbers. We considered Chebyshev constants and energies as two variable set functions, and introduced a modified notion of rendezvous intervals which proved to be rather nicely behaved even for only lower semicontinuous kernels or for not necessarily compact metric spaces. \par Here we study the rendezvous and average numbers of possibly infinite dimensional normed spaces. It turns out that very general existence and uniqueness results hold for the modified rendezvous numbers in \emph {all} Banach spaces. We also observe the connections of these magical numbers to Chebyshev constants, Chebyshev radius and entropy. Applying the developed notions with the available methods we calculate the rendezvous numbers or rendezvous intervals of certain concrete Banach spaces. In particular, a satisfactory description of the case of $L_p$ spaces is obtained for all $p>0$. }

 abstract={ We show that some results of the Hutchinson--Barnsley theory for finite iterated function systems can be carried over to the infinite case. Namely, if $\{F_i:i\in \N \}$ is a family of Matkowski's contractions on a complete metric space $(X,d)$ such that $(F_ix_0)_{i\in \N }$ is bounded for some $x_0\in X$, then there exists a non-empty bounded and separable set $K$ which is invariant with respect to this family, that is, $K=\bcu \limits _{i\in \N }F_i(K)$. Moreover, given $\si \in \N ^{\N }$ and $x\in X$, the limit $\lim \limits _{n\ra \iy }F_{\si _1}\co F_{\si _n}(x)$ exists and does not depend on $x$. We also study separately the case in which $(X,d)$ is Menger convex or compact. Finally, we answer a question posed by M\'at\'e concerning a finite iterated function system $\{F_1,\ldots ,F_N\}$ with the property that each of $F_i$ has a contractive fixed point. }

 abstract={The recovery of flow curves for non-Newtonian fluids from Couette rheometry measurements involves the solution of a quite simple first kind Volterra integral equation with a discontinuous kernel for which the solution, as a summation of an infinite series, has been known since 1953. Various methods, including an Euler--Maclaurin sum formula, have been proposed for the estimation of the value of the summation. They all involve the numerical differentiation of the observational data. In this paper, the properties of Bernoulli polynomials, in conjunctions with the special structure of the integral equation, are exploited to derive a parametric family of representations for its solution. They yield formulas similar to, but more general than, the previously published Euler--Maclaurin sum formula representations. The parameterisation is then utilised to derive two new classes of approximations. The first yields a family of finite difference approximations, which avoids the direct numerical differentiation of the observational data, while the second generates a framework for the construction of improved power law approximations.}
