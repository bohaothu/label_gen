                  object, inheritance, deadlock, and non-interference,
                  as used in computer security. The approach is very
                  general, and applies not only to concurrent object
                  oriented systems, but also to systems of
                  differential equations, electrical circuits,
                  hardware description languges, and much more. Time
                  can be discrete or continuous, linear or branching,
                  and distribution is allowed over space as well as
                  time. Concepts from category theory help to achieve
                  this generality: objects are modeled by sheaves;
                  inheritance by sheaf morphisms; systems by diagrams;
                  and interconnections by diagrams of diagrams.},

  abstract =	 {The Extended ML specification language provides a
                  framework for the formal stepwise development of
                  modular programs in the Standard ML programming
                  language from specifications. The object of this
                  paper is to equip Extended ML with a semantics which
                  is completely independent of the logical system used
                  to write specifications, building on Goguen and
                  Burstall's work on the notion of an
                  \emph{institution} as a formalisation of the concept
                  of a logical system. One advantage of this is that
                  it permits freedom in the choice of the logic used
                  in writing specifications; an intriguing side-effect
                  is that it enables Extended ML to be used to develop
                  programs in languages other than Standard ML since
                  we view programs as simply Extended ML
                  specifications which happen to include only
                  ``executable'' axioms. The semantics of Extended ML
                  is defined in terms of the primitive
                  specification-building operations of the ASL kernel
                  specification language which itself has an
                  institution-independent semantics. It is not
                  possible to give a semantics for Extended ML in an
                  institutional framework without extending the notion
                  of an institution; the new notion of an
                  \emph{institution with syntax} is introduced to
                  provide an adequate foundation for this
                  enterprise. An institution with syntax is an
                  institution with three additions: the category of
                  signatures is assumed to form a concrete category;
                  an additional functor is provided which gives
                  concrete syntactic representations of sentences; and
                  a natural transformation associates these concrete
                  objects with the ``abstract'' sentences they
                  represent. We use the first addition to ``lift''
                  certain necessary set-theoretic constructions to the
                  category of signatures, and the other two additions
                  to deal with the low-level semantics of axioms.},
