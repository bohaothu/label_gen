    In Bayesian machine learning, conjugate priors are popular, mostly due
    to mathematical convenience. In this paper, we show that there are
    deeper reasons for choosing a conjugate prior. Specifically, we
    formulate the conjugate prior in the form of Bregman divergence and
    show that it is the inherent geometry of conjugate priors that makes
    them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric interpretation allows
    one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the effective
    sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use this
    geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the
    hyperparameters and expression of the prior used to couple the
    generative and discriminative components of a hybrid model for
    semi-supervised learning.
