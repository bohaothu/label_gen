   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a nave Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles.},

   Abstract = {The study of intelligent user interfaces and user modeling and adaptation is well suited for augmenting educational visits to museums. We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.},

This paper examines three key human factors: cognitive styles, levels of expertise and gender differences, and utilizes three individual clustering techniques: k-means, hierarchical clustering and fuzzy clustering to understand user behavior and perception. Moreover, robust clustering, capable of correcting the bias of individual clustering techniques, is used to obtain a deeper understanding. The robust clustering approach produced results that highlighted the relevance of cognitive style for user behavior, i.e., cognitive style dominates and justifies each of the robust clusters created. We also found that perception was mainly determined by the level of expertise of a user. We conclude that robust clustering is an effective technique to analyze user behavior and perception.},

This paper assesses the feasibility of sensor-based prediction of time-sharing, operationalized in terms of the number of glances, the duration of the longest glance, and the total and average durations of the glances to the interaction task. The data used for constructing and validating the predictive models was acquired from a field study (N=28), in which subjects performing mobile browsing tasks were observed for approximately 1&nbsp;h in a variety of environments and situations. The predictive accuracy achieved in binary classification tasks was about 70% (about 20% above default), and the most informative sensors were related to the environment and interactions with the mobile device. Implications to the feasibility of different kinds of adaptations are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Abstract~~We explored the reliability of detecting a learnerâÄôs affect from conversational features extracted from interactions with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that helps students learn by holding a conversation in natural language. Training data were collected in a learning session with AutoTutor, after which the affective states of the learner were rated by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. Inter-rater reliability scores indicated that the classifications of the trained judges were more reliable than the novice judges. Seven data sets that temporally integrated the affective judgments with the dialogue features of each learner were constructed. The first four datasets corresponded to the judgments of the learner, a peer, and two trained judges, while the remaining three data sets combined judgments of two or more raters. Multiple regression analyses confirmed the hypothesis that dialogue features could significantly predict the affective states of boredom, confusion, flow, and frustration. Machine learning experiments indicated that standard classifiers were moderately successful in discriminating the affective states of boredom, confusion, flow, frustration, and neutral, yielding a peak accuracy of 42% with neutral (chance&nbsp;=&nbsp;20%) and 54% without neutral (chance&nbsp;=&nbsp;25%). Individual detections of boredom, confusion, flow, and frustration, when contrasted with neutral affect, had maximum accuracies of 69, 68, 71, and 78%, respectively (chance&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%). The classifiers that operated on the emotion judgments of the trained judges and combined models outperformed those based on judgments of the novices (i.e., the self and peer). Follow-up classification analyses that assessed the degree to which machine-generated affect labels correlated with affect judgments provided by humans revealed that human-machine agreement was on par with novice judges (self and peer) but quantitatively lower than trained judges. We discuss the prospects of extending AutoTutor into an affect-sensing ITS. },

At the core of the investigations presented in this paper lie fundamental questions associated with the role of affective considerations in computer-mediated educational interactions. Theory of linguistic politeness is used as the basis for determining the contextual factors relevant to human tutorsâÄôs actions, with special attention being dedicated to learner affective states. A study was designed to determine what affective states of the learners are relevant to tutoring mathematics and to identify the mechanisms used by tutors to predict such states. Logs of tutor-student dialogues were recorded along with contextual factors taken into consideration by tutors in relation to their specific tutorial dialogue moves. The logs were annotated in order to determine the types and range of student and tutor actions. Machine learning techniques were then applied to those actions to predict the values of three factors: student confidence, interest and effort. Whilst due to limited size and sparsity of data the results are not conclusive, they are very valuable as the basis for empirically derived hypotheses to be tested in further studies. The potential implications of the hypotheses, if they were confirmed by further studies, are discussed in relation to the impact of tutorâÄôs ability to diagnose student affect on the nature of computer-mediated tutorial interactions. },

   Abstract = {Abstract~~An approach for capturing and modeling individual entertainment (âÄúfunâÄù) preferences is applied to users of the innovative Playware playground, an interactive physical playground inspired by computer games, in this study. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from childrenâÄôs physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose childrenâÄôs heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much âÄúfunâÄù particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the Playware playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that childrenâÄôs reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two Playware games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64% of cases on previously unseen data (pâàívalue&nbsp;6 Â· 10âàí5). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed. },

   Abstract = {Abstract~~Self-efficacy is an individualâÄôs belief about her ability to perform well in a given situation. Because self-efficacious students are effective learners, endowing intelligent tutoring systems with the ability to diagnose self-efficacy could lead to improved pedagogy. Self-efficacy is influenced by (and influences) affective state. Thus, physiological data might be used to predict a studentâÄôs level of self-efficacy. This article investigates an inductive approach to automatically constructing models of self-efficacy that can be used at runtime to inform pedagogical decisions. It reports on two complementary empirical studies. In the first study, two families of self-efficacy models were induced: a static self-efficacy model, learned solely from pre-test (non-intrusively collected) data, and a dynamic self-efficacy model, learned from both pre-test data as well as runtime physiological data collected with a biofeedback apparatus. In the second empirical study, a similar experimental design was applied to an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. Self-efficacy models were induced from combinations of static and dynamic information, including pre-test data, physiological data, and observations of student behavior in the learning environment. The highest performing induced naÃ¯ve Bayes models correctly classified 85.2% of instances in the first empirical study and 82.1% of instances in the second empirical study. The highest performing decision tree models correctly classified 86.9% of instances in the first study and 87.3% of instances in the second study. },

The recordings were done in a Wizard-of-Oz scenario: the children believed that AIBO obeys their commands; in fact, AIBO followed a fixed script and often disobeyed. Five labellers annotated each word as belonging to one of eleven emotion-related states; seven of these states which occurred frequently enough are dealt with in this paper. The confusion matrices of these labels were used in a Non-Metrical Multi-dimensional Scaling to display two dimensions; the first we interpret as VALENCE, the second, however, not as AROUSAL but as INTERACTION, i.e., addressing oneself (angry, joyful) or the communication partner (motherese, reprimanding). We show that it depends on the specifity of the scenario and on the subjectsâÄô conceptualizations whether this new dimension can be observed, and discuss impacts on the practice of labelling and processing emotional data. Two-dimensional solutions based on acoustic and linguistic features that were used for automatic classification of these emotional states are interpreted along the same lines. },

   Abstract = {Abstract~~We hypothesize that student affect is a useful predictor of spoken dialogue system performance, relative to other parameters. We test this hypothesis in the context of our spoken dialogue tutoring system, where student learning is the primary performance metric. We first present our system and corpora, which have been annotated with several student affective states, student correctness and discourse structure. We then discuss unigram and bigram parameters derived from these annotations. The unigram parameters represent each annotation type individually, as well as system-generic features. The bigram parameters represent annotation combinations, including student state sequences and student states in the discourse structure context. We then use these parameters to build learning models. First, we build simple models based on correlations between each of our parameters and learning. Our results suggest that our affect parameters are among our most useful predictors of learning, particularly in specific discourse structure contexts. Next, we use the PARADISE framework (multiple linear regression) to build complex learning models containing only the most useful subset of parameters. Our approach is a value-added one; we perform a number of model-building experiments, both with and without including our affect parameters, and then compare the performance of the models on the training and the test sets. Our results show that when included as inputs, our affect parameters are selected as predictors in most models, and many of these models show high generalizability in testing. Our results also show that overall, the affect-included models significantly outperform the affect-excluded models. },

The application is based on the Dramatour methodology for information presentation, which incorporates a dramatic attitude in character-based presentations. The application has been developed for a historical site and is based on a virtual character, âÄúCarlettoâÄù, a spider with an anthropomorphic aspect, who engages in a dramatized presentation of the site. Content items are delivered in a location-aware fashion, relying on a wireless network infrastructure, with visitors who can stroll freely. The selection of contents keeps track of user location and of the interaction history, in order to deliver the appropriate type and quantity of informative items, and to manage the given/new distinction in discourse. The communicative strategy of the character is designed to keep it believable along the interaction with the user, while enforcing dramatization effects. The design of the communicative strategy relies on the fact that the units of the presentation are tagged with metadata concerning their content and communicative function. The description of the application is accompanied by an evaluation study based on a sample of about 300 visitors, carried out in April 2006, when the installation was open to the public for 1&nbsp;week. },

   Abstract = {Abstract~~Modern personalized information systems have been proven to support the user with information at the appropriate level and in the appropriate form. In specific environments like museums and exhibitions, focusing on the control of such a system is contradictory to establishing a relationship with the artifacts and exhibits. Preferably, the technology becomes invisible to the user and the physical reality becomes the interface to an additional virtual layer: by naturally moving in the space and/or manipulating physical objects in our surroundings the user will access information and operate the virtual layer. The LISTEN project is an attempt to make use of the inherent âÄúeverydayâÄù integration of aural and visual perception, developing a tailored, immersive audio-augmented environment for the visitors of art exhibitions. The challenge of the LISTEN project is to provide a personalized immersive augmented environment, an aim which goes beyond the guiding purpose. The visitors of the museum implicitly interact with the system because the audio presentation is adapted to the usersâÄô contexts (e.g. interests, preferences, motion, etc.), providing an intelligent audio-based environment. This article describes the realization and user evaluation of the LISTEN system focusing on the personalization component. As this system has been installed at the Kunstmuseum Bonn in the context of an exhibition comprising artworks of the painter August Macke, a detailed evaluation could be conducted. },

We maintain that web 2.0âÄôs participative features can be exploited by adaptive web-based systems in order to enrich and extend the user model, improve social navigation and enrich information from a bottom-up perspective. Thus our approach stresses social annotation as a new and powerful kind of feedback and as a way to infer knowledge about users. The prototype implementation of our framework in the domain of cultural heritage is named iCITY. It is serving to demonstrate the validity of our approach and to highlight the benefits of this approach specifically for cultural heritage. iCITY is an adaptive, social, multi-device recommender guide that provides information about the cultural resources and events promoting the cultural heritage in the city of Torino. Our paper first describes this system and then discusses the results of a set of evaluations that were carried out at different stages of the systems development and aimed at validating the framework and implementation of this specific prototype. In particular, we carried out a heuristic evaluation and two sets of usability tests, aimed at checking the usability of the user interface, specifically of the adaptive behavior of the system. Moreover, we conducted evaluations aimed at investigating the role of tags in the definition of the user model and the impact of tags on the accuracy of recommendations.

   Abstract = {Abstract~~The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the studyâÄôs results. },

This second category includes, in particular, Web 2.0 social annotations and mixed approaches between social annotations and Semantic Web techniques. While the impact of the Semantic Web on adaptive systems has been discussed in several survey papers, the potential of weak semantic technologies has, so far, received little attention. The aim of this analysis is to fill this gap. Therefore, we will discuss contributions and limits of both approaches, but we will focus special attention on weak semantic adaptive systems.},

The useful information discovered can be used directly by the teacher or author of the course in order to improve instructional/learning performance.

In this paper we propose a system oriented to find, share and suggest the most appropriate modifications to improve the effectiveness of the course. We describe an iterative methodology to develop and carry out the maintenance of web-based courses to which we have added a specific data mining step. We apply association rule mining to discover interesting information through students’ usage data in the form of IF-THEN recommendation rules. We have also used a collaborative recommender system to share and score the recommendation rules obtained by teachers with similar profiles along with other experts in education. Finally, we have carried out experiments with several real groups of students using a web-based adaptive course.

In this paper, we introduce the Collaborative Tutoring Research Lab (CTRL), a research-oriented framework for adaptive collaborative learning support that enables researchers to combine different types of adaptive support, particularly by using domain-specific models as input to domain-general components in order to create more complex tutoring functionality. Additionally, the framework allows researchers to implement comparison conditions by making it easier to vary single factors of the adaptive intervention. We evaluated CTRL by designing adaptive and fixed support for a peer tutoring setting, and instantiating the framework using those two collaborative scenarios and an individual tutoring scenario. As part of the implementation, we integrated pre-existing components from the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA) with custom-built components. The three conditions were then compared in a controlled classroom study, and the results helped us to contribute to learning sciences research in peer tutoring. CTRL can be generalized to other collaborative scenarios, but the ease of implementation relates to the complexity of the existing components used. CTRL as a framework has yielded a full implementation of an adaptive support system and a controlled evaluation in the classroom.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Personalization is considered a powerful methodology for improving the effectiveness of information search and decision making. It has led to the dissemination of systems capable of suggesting relevant and personalized information (or items) to the users, according to their characteristics and preferences, as represented by a User Model (UM). Since the quality of the personalization largely depends on the size and accuracy of the managed UMs, it would be beneficial to enrich the UMs by mediating, i.e., importing and integrating, UMs built by other personalization systems. This work discusses and evaluates a cross-representation mediation of UMs from collaborative filtering to content-based recommender systems. According to this approach, a content-based recommender system, having partial or no UM data, can generate recommendations for users by mediating UM data of the same users, collected by a collaborative filtering system. The mediation process transforms the UMs from the collaborative filtering ratings to the content-based weighted item features. The mediation process exploits the item descriptions that are typically not used by the collaborative filtering recommender systems. An experimental evaluation conducted in the domain of movies shows that for users with small collaborative filtering UMs, i.e., users with few item ratings, the accuracy of the recommendations provided using the mediated content-based UMs is superior to that using the original collaborative filtering UMs. Moreover, it shows that the mediation can be used to improve a content-based recommender system by incrementally mediating collaborative filtering UM data (item ratings) and enriching the available content-based UMs.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;We present a probabilistic model of user affect designed to allow an intelligent agent to recognise multiple user emotions during the interaction with an educational computer game. Our model is based on a probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing a variety of user emotions by combining in a Dynamic Bayesian Network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions. The part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions (diagnostic model) implements a theoretical model of affect, the OCC model, which accounts for how emotions are caused by one’s appraisal of the current context in terms of one’s goals and preferences. The advantage of using the OCC model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions a user feels but also why, thus increasing the agent’s capability to effectively respond to the users’ emotions. The challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them, a form of plan recognition. In this paper, we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain. We then present results on the model’s accuracy, showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions. We also discuss the model’s limitations, to open the ground for the next stage of the work, i.e., complementing the model with diagnostic information.},

Assuming the mapping is universal, that is, the same for all queries in a given domain, we can use it to construct queries even for new topics for which no learning data is available. We constructed a controlled experimental setting to show that when the system has no prior information as to what the user is searching, the eye movements help significantly in the search. This is the case in a proactive search, for instance, where the system monitors the reading behaviour of the user in a new topic. In contrast, during a search or reading session where the set of inspected documents is biased towards being relevant, a stronger strategy is to search for content-wise similar documents than to use the eye movements.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in previous work. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of shilling profiles and describe new approaches to detect malicious collaborative filtering profiles. In particular, we exploit the similarity structure in shilling user profiles to separate them from normal user profiles using unsupervised dimensionality reduction. We present two detection algorithms; one based on PCA, while the other uses PLSA. Experimental results show a much improved detection precision over existing methods without the usage of additional training time required for supervised approaches. Finally, we present a novel and highly effective robust collaborative filtering algorithm which uses ideas presented in the detection algorithms using principal component analysis.},

Its contribution lies in comparing different techniques such as knowledge- and utility-based methods, collaborative filtering, association rule mining as well as hybrid variants when user models consist solely of explicit customer requirements. We examine how this type of user feedback can be exploited for personalization in e-commerce scenarios. Furthermore, examples of actual online shops are developed where such contextual user information is available, demonstrating how more efficient RS configurations can be implemented. Results indicate that, especially for new users, explicit customer requirements are a useful source of feedback for personalization and hybrid configurations of collaborative and knowledge-based techniques achieve best results.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Most e-Learning systems store data about the learner’s actions in log files, which give us detailed information about learner behaviour. Data mining and machine learning techniques can give meaning to these data and provide valuable information for learning improvement. One area that is of particular importance in the design of e-Learning systems is learner motivation as it is a key factor in the quality of learning and in the prevention of attrition. One aspect of motivation is engagement, a necessary condition for effective learning. Using data mining techniques for log file analysis, our research investigates the possibility of predicting users’ level of engagement, with a focus on disengaged learners. As demonstrated previously across two different e-Learning systems, HTML-Tutor and iHelp, disengagement can be predicted by monitoring the learners’ actions (e.g. reading pages and taking test/quizzes). In this paper we present the findings of three studies that refine this prediction approach. Results from the first study show that two additional reading speed attributes can increase the accuracy of prediction. The second study suggests that distinguishing between two different patterns of disengagement (spending a long time on a page/test and browsing quickly through pages/tests) may improve prediction in some cases. The third study demonstrates the influence of exploratory behaviour on prediction, as most users at the first login familiarize themselves with the system before starting to learn.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A critiquing-based recommender system acts like an artificial salesperson. It engages users in a conversational dialog where users can provide feedback in the form of critiques to the sample items that were shown to them. The feedback, in turn, enables the system to refine its understanding of the user’s preferences and prediction of what the user truly wants. The system is then able to recommend products that may better stimulate the user’s interest in the next interaction cycle. In this paper, we report our extensive investigation of comparing various approaches in devising critiquing opportunities designed in these recommender systems. More specifically, we have investigated two major design elements which are necessary for a critiquing-based recommender system: critiquing coverage—one vs. multiple items that are returned during each recommendation cycle to be critiqued; and critiquing aid—system-suggested critiques (i.e., a set of critique suggestions for users to select) vs. user-initiated critiquing facility (i.e., facilitating users to create critiques on their own). Through a series of three user trials, we have measured how real-users reacted to systems with varied setups of the two elements. In particular, it was found that giving users the choice of critiquing one of multiple items (as opposed to just one) has significantly positive impacts on increasing users’ decision accuracy (particularly in the first recommendation cycle) and saving their objective effort (in the later critiquing cycles). As for critiquing aids, the hybrid design with both system-suggested critiques and user-initiated critiquing support exhibits the best performance in inspiring users’ decision confidence and increasing their intention to return, in comparison with the uncombined exclusive approaches. Therefore, the results from our studies shed light on the design guidelines for determining the sweetspot balancing user initiative and system support in the development of an effective and user-centric critiquing-based recommender system.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary teachers across the United States are being asked to use formative assessment data (Black and Wiliam 1998a,b; Roediger and Karpicke 2006) to inform their classroom instruction. At the same time, critics of US government’s No Child Left Behind legislation are calling the bill “No Child Left Untested”. Among other things, critics point out that every hour spent assessing students is an hour lost from instruction. But, does it have to be? What if we better integrated assessment into classroom instruction and allowed students to learn during the test? We developed an approach that provides immediate tutoring on practice assessment items that students cannot solve on their own. Our hypothesis is that we can achieve more accurate assessment by not only using data on whether students get test items right or wrong, but by also using data on the effort required for students to solve a test item with instructional assistance. We have integrated assistance and assessment in the ASSISTment system. The system helps teachers make better use of their time by offering instruction to students while providing a more detailed evaluation of student abilities to the teachers, which is impossible under current approaches. Our approach for assessing student math proficiency is to use data that our system collects through its interactions with students to estimate their performance on an end-of-year high stakes state test. Our results show that we can do a reliably better job predicting student end-of-year exam scores by leveraging the interaction data, and the model based on only the interaction information makes better predictions than the traditional assessment model that uses only information about correctness on the test items.},

   Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of users issue keyword queries to the Web search engines to find information on a number of topics. Since the users may have diverse backgrounds and may have different expectations for a given query, some search engines try to personalize their results to better match the overall interests of an individual user. This task involves two great challenges. First the search engines need to be able to effectively identify the user interests and build a profile for every individual user. Second, once such a profile is available, the search engines need to rank the results in a way that matches the interests of a given user. In this article, we present our work towards a personalized Web search engine and we discuss how we addressed each of these challenges. Since users are typically not willing to provide information on their personal preferences, for the first challenge, we attempt to determine such preferences by examining the click history of each user. In particular, we leverage a topical ontology for estimating a user’s topic preferences based on her past searches, i.e. previously issued queries and pages visited for those queries. We then explore the semantic similarity between the user’s current query and the query-matching pages, in order to identify the user’s current topic preference. For the second challenge, we have developed a ranking function that uses the learned past and current topic preferences in order to rank the search results to better match the preferences of a given user. Our experimental evaluation on the Google query-stream of human subjects over a period of 1&nbsp;month shows that user preferences can be learned accurately through the use of our topical ontology and that our ranking function which takes into account the learned user preferences yields significant improvements in the quality of the search results.},

   Abstract = {Pervasive computing creates possibilities for presenting highly personalised information about the people, places and things in a building. One of the challenges for such personalisation is the creation of the system that can support ontological reasoning for several key tasks: reasoning about location; personalisation of information about location at the right level of detail; and personalisation to match each person’s conceptions of the building based on their own use of it and their relationship to other people in the building. From pragmatic perspectives, it should be inexpensive to create the ontology for each new building. It is also critical that users should be able to understand and control pervasive applications. We created the PERSONAF (personalised pervasive scrutable ontological framework) to address these challenges. PERSONAF is a new abstract framework for pervasive ontological reasoning. We report its evaluation at three levels. First, we assessed the power of the ontology for reasoning about noisy and uncertain location information, showing that PERSONAF can improve location modelling. Notably, the best ontological reasoner varies across users. Second, we demonstrate the use of the PERSONAF framework in Adaptive Locator, an application built upon it, using our low cost mechanisms for non-generic layers of the ontology. Finally, we report a user study, which evaluated the PERSONAF approach as seen by users in the Adaptive Locator. We assessed both the personalisation performance and the understandability of explanations of the system reasoning. Together, these three evaluations show that the PERSONAF approach supports building of low cost ontologies, that can achieve flexible ontological reasoning about smart buildings and the people in them, and that this can be used to build applications which give personalised information that can provide understandable explanations of the reasoning underlying the personalisation.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we propose a query expansion and user profile enrichment approach to improve the performance of recommender systems operating on a folksonomy, storing and classifying the tags used to label a set of available resources. Our approach builds and maintains a profile for each user. When he submits a query (consisting of a set of tags) on this folksonomy to retrieve a set of resources of his interest, it automatically finds further  authoritative  tags to enrich his query and proposes them to him. All  authoritative  tags considered interesting by the user are exploited to refine his query and, along with those tags directly specified by him, are stored in his profile in such a way to enrich it. The expansion of user queries and the enrichment of user profiles allow any content-based recommender system operating on the folksonomy to retrieve and suggest a high number of resources matching with user needs and desires. Moreover, enriched user profiles can guide any collaborative filtering recommender system to proactively discover and suggest to a user many resources relevant to him, even if he has not explicitly searched for them.},

   Abstract = {With many daily tasks now performed on the Internet, productivity and efficiency in working with web pages have become transversal necessities for all users. Many of these tasks involve the inputting of user information, obligating the user to interact with a webform. Research has demonstrated that productivity depends largely on users’ personal characteristics, implying that it will vary from user to user. The webform development process must therefore, include modeling of its intended users to ensure the interface design is appropriate. Taking all potential users into account is difficult, however, primarily because their identity is unknown, and some may be effectively excluded by the final design. Such discrimination can be avoided by incorporating rules that allow webforms to adapt automatically to the individual user’s characteristics, the principal one being the person’s culture. In this paper we report two studies that validate this option. We begin by determining the relationships between a user’s cultural dimension scores and their behavior when faced with a webform. We then validate the notion that rules based on these relationships can be established for the automatic adaptation of a webform in order to reduce the time taken to complete it. We conclude that the automatic webform adaptation to the cultural dimensions of users improves their performance.},

In this paper, we present our experiments and methods, which are used to build automatic skill classifiers for desktop applications. Machine learning algorithms were used to build statistical predictive models of skill. Attribute values were extracted from high frequency user interface events, such as mouse motions and menu interactions, and were used as inputs to our models.

   Abstract = {We developed and evaluated a multimodal affect detector that combines conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The multimodal affect detector uses feature-level fusion to combine the sensory channels and linear discriminant analyses to discriminate between naturally occurring experiences of boredom, engagement/flow, confusion, frustration, delight, and neutral. Training and validation data for the affect detector were collected in a study where 28 learners completed a 32- min. tutorial session with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Classification results supported a channel ? judgment type interaction, where the face was the most diagnostic channel for spontaneous affect judgments (i.e., at any time in the tutorial session), while conversational cues were superior for fixed judgments (i.e., every 20 s in the session). The analyses also indicated that the accuracy of the multichannel model (face, dialogue, and posture) was statistically higher than the best single-channel model for the fixed but not spontaneous affect expressions. However, multichannel models reduced the discrepancy (i.e., variance in the precision of the different emotions) of the discriminant models for both judgment types. The results also indicated that the combination of channels yielded superadditive effects for some affective states, but additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects for others. We explore the structure of the multimodal linear discriminant models and discuss the implications of some of our major findings.},

   Abstract = {Conversation is an essential component of social behavior, one of the primary means by which humans express intentions, beliefs, emotions, attitudes and personality. Thus the development of systems to support natural conversational interaction has been a long term research goal. In natural conversation, humans adapt to one another across many levels of utterance production via processes variously described as linguistic style matching, entrainment, alignment, audience design, and accommodation. A number of recent studies strongly suggest that dialogue systems that adapted to the user in a similar way would be more effective. However, a major research challenge in this area is the ability to dynamically generate user-adaptive utterance variations. As part of a personality-based user adaptation framework, this article describes personage, a highly parameterizable generator which provides a large number of parameters to support adaptation to a user’s linguistic style. We show how we can systematically apply results from psycholinguistic studies that document the linguistic reflexes of personality, in order to develop models to control personage’s parameters, and produce utterances matching particular personality profiles. When we evaluate these outputs with human judges, the results indicate that humans perceive the personality of system utterances in the way that the system intended.},

The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user’s experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users’ emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.},

   Abstract = {Information about interactive virtual environments, such as games, is perceived by users through a virtual camera. While most interactive applications let users control the camera, in complex navigation tasks within 3D environments users often get frustrated with the interaction. In this paper, we propose inclusion of camera control as a vital component of affective adaptive interaction in games. We investigate the impact of camera viewpoints on psychophysiology of players through preference surveys collected from a test game. Data is collected from players of a 3D prey/predator game in which player experience is directly linked to camera settings. Computational models of discrete affective states of fun, challenge, boredom, frustration, excitement, anxiety and relaxation are built on biosignal (heart rate, blood volume pulse and skin conductance) features to predict the pairwise self-reported emotional preferences of the players. For this purpose, automatic feature selection and neuro-evolutionary preference learning are combined providing highly accurate affective models. The performance of the artificial neural network models on unseen data reveals accuracies of above 80% for the majority of discrete affective states examined. The generality of the obtained models is tested in different test-bed game environments and the use of the generated models for creating adaptive affect-driven camera control in games is discussed.},

   Abstract = {Tailoring the linguistic content of automatically generated descriptions to the preferences of a target user has been well demonstrated to be an effective way to produce higher-quality output that may even have a greater impact on user behaviour. It is known that the non-verbal behaviour of an embodied agent can have a significant effect on users’ responses to content presented by that agent. However, to date no-one has examined the contribution of non-verbal behaviour to the effectiveness of user tailoring in automatically generated embodied output. We describe a series of experiments designed to address this question. We begin by introducing a multimodal dialogue system designed to generate descriptions and comparisons tailored to user preferences, and demonstrate that the user-preference tailoring is detectable to an overhearer when the output is presented as synthesised speech. We then present a multimodal corpus consisting of the annotated facial expressions used by a speaker to accompany the generated tailored descriptions, and verify that the most characteristic positive and negative expressions used by that speaker are identifiable when resynthesised on an artificial talking head. Finally, we combine the corpus-derived facial displays with the tailored descriptions to test whether the addition of the non-verbal channel improves users’ ability to detect the intended tailoring, comparing two strategies for selecting the displays: one based on a simple corpus-derived rule, and one making direct use of the full corpus data. The performance of the subjects who saw displays selected by the rule-based strategy was not significantly different than that of the subjects who got only the linguistic content, while the subjects who saw the data-driven displays were significantly worse at detecting the correctly tailored output. We propose a possible explanation for this result, and also make recommendations for developers of future systems that may make use of an embodied agent to present user-tailored content.},
