	Abstract = {In an experiment involving teams of humans playing a cooperative game, we study the effect of local communication policies on the efficiency and the performance of teams and of individuals in different positions within a network.  This design provides an experimental model of human communities, where information may spread from peer to peer by word of mouth.  With this model, we explain the realistic tradeoff between liberal information dumping and targeted information  sharing by human peers.
Human subjects exchanged natural-language messages with relevance to a task, thereby sharing knowledge across a community. Communication took place along the edges of a small-world graph.
Cooperation and individual efforts were incentivized.  In one condition, participants were asked to request specific information and only supply information that they knew was needed.  In another condition, they were asked to supply and forward as much information as possible.  We found that a targeted communication policy was successfully implemented by the participants, increased task success, shortened the time it took to get answers to questions, increased efficiency (task success per communication bandwidth), and may have done so selectively for nodes with fewer connections.},

@article{reitter2011syntacticpriming,
	Abstract = {The psycholinguistic literature has identified two syntactic adaptation effects in language production: rapidly decaying short-term priming and long-lasting adaptation. To explain both effects, we present an ACT-R model of syntactic priming based on a wide-coverage, lexicalized syntactic theory that explains priming as facilitation of lexical access. In this model, two well-established ACT-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies we show that it accounts for (a)~the inverse frequency interaction; (b)~the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c)~the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming. We also present corpus data that verifies a prediction of the model, i.e., that the lexical boost affects all lexical material, rather than just heads.},

@article{reitter2010metacognition,
	Abstract = {We present a cognitive model performing the Dynamic Stocks\&Flows control task, in which subjects control a system by counteracting a systematically changing external variable.  The model uses a metacognitive layer that chooses a task strategy drawn from of two classes of strategies: precise calculation and imprecise estimation.   The model, formulated within the ACT-R theory, monitors the success of each strategy continuously using instance-based learning and blended retrieval from declarative memory.
The model underspecifies other portions of the task strategies, whose timing was determined as unbiased estimate from empirical data.  The model's predictions were evaluated on data collected from novel experimental conditions, which did not inform the model's development and included discontinuous and noisy environmental change functions and a control delay.  The model as well as the data show sudden changes in subject error and general learning of control; the model also correctly predicted oscillations of plausible magnitude.  With its predictions, the model ranked first among the entries to the 2009 Dynamic Stocks\&Flows modeling challenge.},

@article{reitter2010pathplanning,
	Abstract = {Planning a path to a destination, given a number of options and obstacles, is a common task.  We suggest a two-component cognitive model that combines retrieval of knowledge about the environment with search guided by visual perception.  In the first component,  subsymbolic information, acquired during navigation, aids in the retrieval of declarative information representing possible paths to take.  In the second component, visual information directs the search, which in turn creates knowledge for the first component.   The model is implemented using the ACT-R cognitive architecture and makes realistic assumptions about memory access and shifts in visual attention.  We present simulation results for memory-based high-level navigation in grid and tree structures, and visual navigation in mazes, varying relevant cognitive (retrieval noise and visual finsts) and environmental (maze and path size) parameters. The visual component is evaluated with data from a multi-robot control experiment, where subjects planned paths for robots to explore a building.  We describe a method to compare trajectories without referring to aligned points in the itinerary.  The evaluation shows that the model provides a good fit, but also that planning strategies may differ between task loads.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the evolution of a domain vocabulary in small communities.  Empirical data show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language.  We propose that simulations of such cultural evolution incorporate properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay).  A cognitive model is described that encodes abstract concepts with small sets of concrete, related concepts (directing), and that also decodes such signs (matching).  Learning captures conventionalized signs.  Relatedness of concepts is characterized by a mixture of shared and individual knowledge, which we sample from a text corpus.   Simulations show vocabulary convergence of agent communities of varied structure, but idiosyncrasy in vocabularies of each dyad of models.  Convergence is weakened when agents do not alternate between encoding and decoding, predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication.  Convergence is improved by explicit feedback about communicative success.  We hypothesize that humans seek out subtle clues to gauge success in order to guide their vocabulary acquisition.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the evolution of a domain language in small speaker communities.  Data from experiments (Garrod et al., 2007; Fay et al., 2008) show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language even in the absence of feedback about the success of each communication.  We postulate that simulations of such horizontal evolution have to take into account properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay).  We implement a model that can draw abstract concepts through sets of non-abstract, related concepts, and recognize such drawings.  The knowledge base is a network with association strengths randomly sampled from a natural distribution found in a text corpus; it is a mixture of knowledge shared between agents and individual knowledge.  In three experiments, we show that the agent communities converge, but that initial convergence is stronger when communities are structured so that the same pairs of agents interact throughout.  Convergence  is weaker in communities when agents do not swap roles (between recognizing and drawing), predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication in domain language evolution.  Average and ultimate recognition performance depends on how much of the knowledge agents share initially.

@phdthesis{reitter2008thesis,
	Abstract = {This thesis addresses the cognitive basis of syntactic adaptation, which biases speakers to repeat their own syntactic constructions and those of their conversational partners. I address two types of syntactic adaptation: short-term priming and long-term adaptation. 

I develop two metrics for syntactic adaptation within a speaker and between speakers in dialogue: one for short-term priming effects that decay quickly, and one for long-term adaptation over the course of a dialogue. Both methods estimate adaptation in large datasets consisting of transcribed human-human dialogue annotated with syntactic information. Two such corpora in English are used: Switchboard, a collection of spontaneous phone conversation, and HCRC Map Task, a set of task-oriented dialogues in which participants describe routes on a map to each other. I find both priming and long-term adaptation in both corpora, confirming well-known experimental results (Bock, 1986). I extend prior work by showing that syntactic priming effects not only apply to selected syntactic constructions that are alternative realizations of the same semantics, but still hold when a  broad variety of syntactic phrase-structure rules are considered. Each rule represents a cognitive decision during syntactic processing. I show that the priming effect  for a rule is inversely proportional to its frequency.

With this methodology, I test predictions of the Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering & Garrod, 2004). The IAM claims that linguistic and situation-model agreement between interlocutors in dialogue is the result of a cascade of resource-free, mechanistic priming effects on various linguistic levels. I examine task-oriented dialogue in Map Task, which provides a measure of task success through the deviance of the communicated routes on the maps. I find that long-term syntactic adaptation predicts communicative success, and it does so earlier than lexical adaptation. The result is applied in a machine-learning based model that estimates task success based on the dialogue, capturing 14 percent of the variance in Map Task. Short-term syntactic priming differs qualitatively from long-term adaptation, as it does not predict task success, providing evidence against learning as a single cognitive basis of adaptation effects.

I  obtain further evidence for the correlation between semantic activity and syntactic priming through a comparison of the Map Task and Switchboard corpora, showing that short-term priming is stronger in task-oriented dialogue than in spontaneous conversation. This difference is evident for priming between and within speakers, which suggests that priming is a mechanistic rather than strategic effect.

I turn to an investigation of the level at which syntactic priming influences language production. I establish that the effect applies to structural syntactic decisions as opposed to all surface sequences of lexical categories.  To do so, I identify pairs of part-of-speech categories which consistently cross constituent boundaries defined by the phrase-structure analyses of the sentences. I show that such distituents are less sensitive to priming than pairs occurring within constituents. Thus, syntactic priming is sensitive to syntactic structure. 

The notion of constituent structure differs among syntactic models. Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, Steedman, 2000) formalizes flexible constituent structure, accounting a varying degree of incrementality in syntactic sentence planning. I examine whether priming effects can support the predictions of CCG using the Switchboard corpus, which has been annotated with CCG syntax. I confirm the syntactic priming effect for lexical and non-lexical CCG categories, which encode partially satisfied subcategorization frames. I then show that both incremental and normal-form constituent structures exhibit  priming, arguing for language production accounts that support flexible incrementality.

The empirical results are reflected in a cognitive model of syntactic realization in language production. The model assumes that language production is subject to the same principles and constraints as any other form of cognition and follows the ACT-R framework (Anderson, 2004). Its syntactic process implements my empirical results on priming and is based on CCG.  Syntactic planning can take place incrementally and non-incrementally.  The model is able to generate simple sentences that vary syntactically, similar to the materials used in the experimental priming literature.

Syntactic adaptation emerges due to a preferential and sped-up memory retrieval of syntactic categories describing linearization and subcategorization requirements. Long-term adaptation is explained as a form of learning, while short-term priming is the result of a combination of learning and spreading activation from semantic and lexical material. Simulations show that the model produces the adaptation effects and their inverse frequency interaction, as well as cumulativity of long-term adaptation.

@inproceedings{reitter2007against,
	Abstract = {Structural priming, i.e., the tendency to repeat linguistic material, can be explained by two alternative representational assumptions: either as the repetition of hierarchical representations generated by syntactic rules, or as the repetition of lexical sequences. We present two studies that test these explanations by investigating priming effects in a dialogue corpus. We compare syntactic constituents with distituents, i.e., part-of-speech pairs that cross constituent boundaries.

We find a reliable short-term priming effect for constituents, but no priming for distituents. This result supports the rule-based view of priming, which does not predict priming of distituents. The data are incompatible with a sequence priming analysis, which cannot distinguish between constituents and distituents. In a second corpus study, we study long-term priming and find priming effects for both constituents and distituents. This indicates that the mechanism underlying long-term adaptation differs substantially from short-term priming.

@mastersthesis{reitter2004hybrid,
	Abstract = {The output of multimodal human-computer interfaces is what this thesis is concerned with. Rather than hard-coding graphical  and spoken representations, methods are introduced that plan and realize coherent output, appropriate to the situation and the device. The generation system expects a mode- and language-independent representation, as it can be supplied by the dialogue management component of a dialogue system. The generator then assembles mode-specific rendering instructions simultaneously for each mode with the aid of a unification-based functional grammar. 
	
The approach proposed in this thesis abandons the canonical structure of pipelined planning and realization in natural language generation, in favor of hard constraints formulated in a grammar, and soft constraints that allow for the gradual adaptivity of the output. The grammar is constructed to ensure the coherence of output in different modalities, whose output is generated in a synchronized fashion rather than by separate, mode-specific generators. The soft constraints follow some of the Gricean maxims by incorporating two counteracting communicative goals: efficacy and efficiency. A fitness function encoding these goals takes into account situation- and user-specific factors, such as distractions in a single mode or the user's sensory impairments. The function leads to the selection of an appropriate output from the variety of potential outputs generated by the grammar. It is evaluated in a study with human subjects. 

The thesis presents a unification based, hybrid grammar formalism which can combine pre-fabricated phrases and linguistically motivated grammar fragments, and an associated algorithm which integrates the formulation of grammars that lead to cross-modally coherent output. Methods are compared to efficiently implement a control strategy, combining hard and soft constraints as a constraint optimization problem. 

The cross-modal coherence implemented by the grammar formalism is motivated by known phenomena, such as cross-modal priming, or alignment between interlocutors. To optimize discourse coherence, central ideas of Centering Theory are implemented using the grammar formalism. 

Finally, novel methods and a ready-to-use implementation are introduced which allow user interface developers to inspect, maintain and extend grammars. The formalism and generation implementation is demonstrated with a grammar for a mobile, multimodal application, the Virtual Personal Assistant. },

	Abstract = {We describe our ongoing work on an application of XML/XSL technology   to a dictionary, from whose source representation various views for   the human reader as well as for automatic text generation and   understanding are derived. Our case study is a dictionary of   discourse markers, the words (often, but not always, conjunctions)   that signal the presence of a disocurse relation between adjacent spans of text. },

@techmanual{reitter02latex,
	Abstract = {Drawing rhetorical analyses is no fun when you need to change and update diagrams as you refine your work, or, more importantly, if a lot of analyses are to be drawn. Voila, there we go: This package enables us to typeset beautiful diagrams with no hassle. It is oriented towards the style of the diagrams shown in Mann{\&}Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory and subsequent works. This package works perfectly with (LaTeX) and pdfLaTeX and does not require any special postscript capabilities in the output side. },

@inproceedings{reitter-hybrid,
	Abstract = { CyMON-NLU can inform, chat and gather user information using an advanced natural language understanding engine. It combines statistical morphosyntactic disambiguation methods (trigram tagging), a stemming algorithm and a robust parser for a large semantic grammar implemented in an XML formalism. The scalable CyMON-NLU engine is implemented in C++ and provides interfaces to the agent-based CRM platform CyMON. Further features include automatic language detection and dialog tracking using a semantic network interface. A development kit enables language engineers to easily create semantic grammars for the specific domain.},
