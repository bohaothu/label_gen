%X Mobile phone adoption by older adults is radically increasing. As a part of
multiple empirical studies to improve older adults' experiences with mobile
phones, a survey was conducted to investigate a number of specific aspects of
mobile phone use in the older adult population including motives of ownership,
usage patterns, preferences on mobile phone features, and perceived usability
of their own phones. A total of 154 older adults from 20 states of the United
States who owned a mobile phone participated in this study. Results indicated
that participants used a few basic features of mobile phones since they used
them mainly for personal communication and safety reasons. Overall,
participants perceived that their current phones offered marginal 'ease of
use', but they found most usability problems with understanding error messages,
inputting text, and understanding user manuals. The majority of older adults
(over 50%) desired a phone with basic features that include making/receiving a
call, phonebook, emergency call, voice message checking, speed dial, ringer
change, and clock. However, effects of age and gender were found on mobile
phone usage patterns and design preferences, which suggest a need of focusing
on diverse groups within the older adult population.

%X The influence of trust on automation reliance has been examined during
interaction with the automation, but little attention has been paid to
individuals' initial expectation of automation reliability as it affects future
reliance, especially when the cost of not relying on automation is known in
advance. Additionally, whereas automation may help to improve the lives of
older adults, their expectations of automation reliability have not been
thoroughly considered. In this study, 16 older adults and 16 younger adults
were asked about their expectation of the reliability of an automated counting
aid and half were told that they would lose points for verifying the
automation. Subsequent reliance on the decision aid was recorded. The results
indicated that neither age nor the cost of verification appears to have an
effect on reliability expectancy. Furthermore, predictions of reliability had a
negative correlation to reliance. The findings suggest that individuals develop
expectations of automation over the course of experience and interaction with
automation.

and services. Currently, however, an age-related digital divide exists,
especially for lower SES minority elderly. This study examined the ability of a
sample of 40 community dwelling adults aged 50-85 yrs. to use the Internet to
make choices related to Medicare services. Performance data included response
time, accuracy, and search behavior (based on videotape recordings) and ratings
of usability. Overall the data indicate that although most of the of
participants were able to find the needed information many of them made errors,
used inefficient search strategies, and encountered search problems.
Furthermore, most of the sample indicated problems with usability and that they
were frustrated interacting with the website. These findings are discussed in
terms of recommendations for training and website design. The paper will also
discuss how screen capture data can be used in the development of design
guidelines.

%X Internet-based health information may be particularly beneficial for older
adults as this segment of the population is likely to need healthcare
information and services and often experiences problems accessing needed
services and care. In order to effectively design e-health tools for seniors it
is important to understand their health information needs and factors that
enhance or impede their ability to use the Internet. Another important issue is
to determine if in fact health information needs are satisfied to a greater
extent between Internet users and non-users. This study explored these issues
using six focus groups comprised of 35 adults aged 50+ (M = 69.71 years) with
varying levels of Internet-based health information-seeking experience. Results
indicated that the adults who used the Internet were quite satisfied with
finding information from this source; however non-users were also quite
satisfied with the more traditional sources that they rely on for health
information.

%X Human error is pervasive (Kirwan, 1994), and its consequences are often
costly (e.g. time, money) or even deadly (e.g. Neumann, 1995). Yet, many types
of human fallibility are not anomalous occurrences, but instead flow from
psychological processes that normally produce correct behavior (Mach, 1905). It
is therefore reasonable to argue that some types of errors may be predictable
(so long as situational demands and human capabilities/limitations are properly
taken into consideration) and subsequently, amenable to computational modeling
techniques. This research seeks to incorporate and implement psychological
theory of human error in GOMS models of human performance by first classifying
errors under a simplified GEMS schematic (Reason, 1990), then extracting
observed error probabilities from simpler mobile phone tasks, and validating
model predictions in a more complex, mobile phone task. Results revealed no
differences between model predictions and human production of error across all
types of error classification, and models accurately predicted error rates for
younger and older users based upon previously validated, age-informed
processing parameters included in each age-sensitive model.

respect to such information exists. The goal of the current study was to
investigate younger and older adults' ability to draw inferences under
different conditions of prior knowledge, and how confident participants were
about their decisions. Participants read two-sentence text passages, which
either resembled real warnings (real) or were the opposite of real warnings
(reversed). Participants evaluated whether information in a given statement was
consistent (true) or inconsistent (false) with information given in a text
passage. Statements either repeated information explicitly or implied in the
text passage. Participants also rated their confidence in the correctness of
their answer. Data showed no age-related differences in accuracy when the text
passages resembled real warnings. When text passages were reversed, older
adults were less accurate than younger adults, yet more confident when
inferences were required.

%X The age-related accommodation loss of the human eye impairs aging people's
life. A study was conducted to preliminarily investigate the dynamic
accommodative characteristics of the eye for different age groups under various
intensities and chromaticities of light. 4 younger (20-29 years of age), and 4
older (60-69 years of age) participants were recruited, and the accommodation
of their eyes was recorded and analyzed dynamically via the modified
Shin-Nippon SRW-5000 autorefractor. The laboratory experiment was designed to
assess accommodation in a simulated condition where the participant needed to
alternate from viewing outside to reading the dashboard with signals of
different light intensities (2 levels: 100 and 20 cd/m{sup:2}) and light
chromaticities (2 levels: red vs. blue). The results of the study indicated
that aging, light intensity, and light chromaticity all had an impact on the
dynamic accommodative characteristics of the eye. The implications of the study
are discussed.

%X The purpose of this study was to investigate aging effects on the mechanisms
of postural control during upright stance, and specifically the use of
proprioceptive feedback on this control. Thirty-two healthy individuals
participated, equally divided among younger (19-22 years) and older groups
(54-68 years) and genders. Experimental trials involved several sessions of
quiet stance on a firm surface with eyes closed. Center of pressure (COP) data
were obtained from a force platform and processed using a new local maximum
wavelet transform method. The critical time interval (CTI) derived from this
method was proposed to describe the activation period of proprioceptive
function, which is mainly influenced by the proprioceptive feedback loop. A
reduced CTI was assumed to indicate poorer control based on proprioceptive
input. Results showed that younger participants' CTI significantly increased
from the first experimental session to consecutive experimental sessions in
both the mediolateral (ML) and anteroposteriorer (AP) directions. However,
older participates' CTI did not exhibit significant differences between the
first and the consequent experimental sessions in either direction. This result
suggests that the adaptability of proprioceptive function was impaired with
age. Younger adults' CTIs were significantly larger than those of older adults
in both ML and AP directions, indicating that among older adults stance control
based on proprioceptive function was significantly impaired due to aging.

%X Convertible tablet PCs can use a pen or a mouse for input. The pen is better
suited than the mouse for some tasks because of its interaction properties, and
research has shown it may ameliorate age-related decrements in performance.
This study compared the pen and mouse on a series of realistic tasks for older
(55-69) and younger (18-30) adults. Precision tasks were better served by the
mouse, while ballistic tasks with strong analogs to real-world actions were
served equally well by the pen or the mouse. Older adults were slower than
younger adults on both devices, but contrary to the research hypothesis, no
benefits were observed specifically for older adults with the pen. This study
reinforces findings regarding the importance of task demands when selecting
input devices. Younger adults seemed more willing than older adults to embrace
the pen.

%X Manual materials handling safety training programs typically encourage
workers to make judgments regarding manual material handling risk prior to
making attempts to perform the task. The objectives of this effort were to
determine if: a) perceptions of MMH tasks are consistent with consensus-based
lifting hazards, and b) judgments are materially affected by observer age and

origin and final position of a 20 Kg box lift at 0.2, 2 and 5 lifts per minute
were presented to 50 males and 50 females who were distributed among age
decades between 20 and 70 years. Subjects were asked to rate their perceived
risk of musculoskeletal injury using magnitude estimation methods. Results
showed that subjects, regardless of age, were unable to spatially perceive
consensus-based biomechanical indexes of musculoskeletal hazard; this finding
held regardless of age group, gender, stature, body mass, prior safe lifting
practices training, or history of low back injury.

%X The following study examined pilots' performance on in-flight planning tasks
in non-nominal and emergency conditions using autoflight systems capable of
automatically generating a flight plan. The findings revealed that autoflight
systems did not significantly impact replanning, while the scenarios did
significantly affect the primary performance measures of distance flown and
time of flight. Additionally, pilots selected the most direct route when
possible and did not distinguish between emergency and non-nominal flight
conditions. Pilots also favored use of the automatically generated flight
plans. We conclude that: 1) automatic flight path generation benefits in-flight
replanning primarily by reducing workload in emergencies; and 2) such a system
will require real time access to environmental information, including traffic,
weather and terrain, be considered simultaneously.

%X An application for entering a taxiroute into an Electronic Flight Bag, using
either speech input or manual input, has been investigated. The input concepts
are designed such that the number of actions to be performed when using speech
input is the same as when using manual input. A previous evaluation of the
speech input concept in an undisturbed, single-task environment showed that
high route recognition performance is feasible. To compare the concepts in an
operationally realistic environment, two experiments were conducted in a
fixed-base research simulator. Typical disturbances that are present in the
cockpit environment were modeled and used in this simulation-based
evaluation/comparison. Time, efficiency, workload, and pilot preference were
used as criteria. Eight professional pilots, with flight experience varying
from 9 to 27 years, participated. The results indicate a clear performance
benefit in terms of speed and efficiency for the manual input, which also
yielded a lower workload and was the preferred option of the pilots.

%X Research at the Air Force Research Laboratory has focused on determining the
value of combining computer-generated information with live camera video
presented on an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) station display. In a previous
study, a picture-in-picture (PIP) concept (where video imagery is surrounded by
synthetic-generated terrain imagery, increasing the operator's instantaneous
field-of-view) was found to reduce landmark search time and enhance operator
situation awareness. The present study examined whether PIP display size and
symbology overlay registration error impacts performance. Results confirmed
that performance on a landmark search task is better when a PIP display was
used, particularly with the more compressed video imagery, reducing average
designation time by 60%. Also, the registration error between the virtual flags
and landmarks was less critical with the PIP capability enabled. This research
has potential application to a variety of teleoperated control applications.

%X The tremendous expense and inherent dangers of training in the aircraft have
led to the increased use of simulators for practicing and maintaining air
combat skills; However, the advantages and disadvantages of using high or
low-fidelity simulators for such training must be specified. An experiment was
conducted to examine the in-simulator performance differences between pilots
flying lower-fidelity simulators compared to higher-fidelity simulators. The
primary difference between the two simulators is the visual scene
field-of-view. Sixteen U.S. Air Force F-16 pilots flew standard training
missions as an integrated team of four (a "four-ship") with two pilots flying
in the high-fidelity simulators and two pilots flying in the lower-fidelity
simulators. Various subjective and objective measures were collected to assess
the pilots' ability to maintain a briefed formation. Overall, the results
suggest that pilots who practice four-ship employment in the lower-fidelity
simulators can perform at the same level as those who practice in the
high-fidelity simulators. Future analyses should be conducted to examine the
impact of simulator fidelity on other air combat skills and on training
effectiveness.

%X There is a need to develop an effective methodology for generating and
evaluating interventions for reducing accidents due to human error. In this
study, the Human Factors Intervention Matrix (HFIX) was used to evaluate
current/proposed FAA safety programs to determine (1) the types of
interventions typically proposed by this organization and (2) the types of
human error these safety interventions target. Over 600 FAA safety
recommendations were examined and categorized using the HFIX methodology.
Results suggest that FAA safety programs primarily employ
organizational/administrative, technological/engineering and
human/operator-based interventions. Few approaches focus on either task or
environmental changes. There is also a bias toward interventions aimed at pilot
decision-making, rather than other common problems in aviation such as
skill-based errors or violations. Further research is needed to develop HFIX as
a tool for generating, rather than just evaluating, safety programs.

%X Data from certified screeners performing an x-ray inspection task for 4
hours, or 1000 images, were analyzed to identify the nature of the vigilance
decrement. The expected vigilance decrement was found, with performance
measured by probability of detection (PoD) and probability of false alarm
[P(FA)] decreasing from hour 1 to hour 4. Correlations between PoD and P(FA)
indicate that sensitivity between hours remained the same, however a shift in
criterion (Beta) occurred. Significant decreases in both detection and stopping
time were found from the first hour to the second, third, and fourth hour.
Evidence of changes in the search component of the time per item was found to
account for part of the vigilance decrement. As the task continued,
participants spent less time actively searching the image, as opposed to other
activities. Evidence is provided for truncation of active search as security
inspection continues.

%X Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is a flightdeck-based technology
aimed at helping aircraft avoid proximate traffic. TCAS information has
traditionally not been presented to the air traffic controller. A 2002 German
midair collision was triggered, in part, by incompatible air traffic control
(ATC) and TCAS clearances. Largely in response to this accident, attention has
focused in recent years on the potential benefits of "downlinking" to the
controller TCAS Resolution Advisories (RAs) in near real time. Such
presentations, it is thought, could benefit situation awareness and joint
decision making between controller and pilot.
   A cognitive task analysis (CTA) was recently conducted into the present-day
and future RA Downlink (RAD) operational concepts. On the basis of functional
task description and cognitive walkthroughs, CTA assessed the impact of various
specific non-nominal events (e.g. pilot reports RA, but does not initiate an
evasive maneuver). Finally, a set of cognitive elements and potential error
mechanisms was identified.

%X We report in this ongoing study on the resilience of Air Traffic Management
approach operations by considering a collaborative work unit consisting of the
Executive Controller, the Pilot Flying and the Pilot Non-Flying -- the
behaviour of the team is hypothetically structured by, a) the divided labour
strategies of approach control and, b) an adaptiveness to organisational
objectives of efficiency. Normal Accident Theory is used as a framework for
analysing 348 verbal exchanges from five aviation occurrences. We make use of
navigation in hazardous atmospheric situations, as a safety-boundary condition
to inform on the behaviour of operator teams. Five broad activity-related
themes leading to four detailed collaborative themes were obtained: 1)
Monitoring of activities, 2) Redirecting attention to perceived priorities, 3)
Implicit redistribution of responsibilities, and 4) Explicit assignation of
decisional activities. We conclude that the dynamic interactions within the
team during hazardous approaches indicate a functional unit of collaborative
work.

%X The emphasis on network-centric operations for the next generation air
traffic system presages an important opportunity for collaborative work.
However, there is no clear design guidance for collaborative work across such a
large and complex network of users and operators. In this paper we will
describe the Multi-center Traffic Management Advisor, a system which can enable
collaboration on regional air traffic problems. We will describe specific
findings regarding collaborative work from a four-year testing period with six
separate air traffic facilities, including a design feature we believe was
crucial for improving collaborative work. This work has important implications
regarding the future collaborative environment of the U.S. air traffic system
as well as for collaborative work across large, complex organizations.

%X The effects of advanced automation tools on the air traffic control tower
environment were assessed through a real-time simulation study. One focus of
the study was the impact that advanced tools would have on controllers' roles
and work patterns. Participants controlled simulated traffic during 45-minute
scenarios, and reported their perceived workload and experience of using a
prototype automation tool. Perceived workload was significantly reduced in the
advanced automation conditions, more so as the automation assumed more
functions. Participants interacted a great deal with the automation in these
conditions, a notable proportion of which was interface management. Despite
generally liking the tool, controllers reported the automation had assumed all
of their role's decision-making responsibilities and left them with mechanical
tasks. It is concluded that a more artful allocation of functions is required
if controllers are to be engaged in their task when using advanced automation
tools.

%X Although the primary means by which air traffic controllers in airport
towers obtain information is by direct head-up, out-the-window (OTW) viewing,
they spend a considerable amount of head-down time looking at flight strips,
panel-mounted displays, and other information sources in the tower. The U.S.
Air Force sponsored the development of a prototype Near-Eye Augmented Reality
(NE/AR) display to enhance tower controller performance and situation
awareness. The display overlays situation-relevant text (e.g., aircraft call
sign) and graphic images (e.g., runway outline), on real-time, head-tracked
video imagery. Throughout the development process, we performed usability
engineering and assessments using 1) user/task observation, 2) physical
mockups, 3) interactive reviews, and 4) early prototype evaluation. In this
paper we describe our usability efforts, and discuss usability considerations
and human performance issues affecting the functionality and acceptance of a
tower controller NE/AR display.

%X An enduring challenge in management and in military command is ensuring that
subordinates select actions as their leader would, particularly when
circumstances change unexpectedly. An experiment was conducted to test a
measure of shared interpretation of commander's intent and its effects on the
adaptability of subordinates. Performance was measured in the context of a
simulated law enforcement task. A course of action ranking procedure was used
as a measure of interpretation of intent with rank order correlation reflecting
shared interpretation. The study validates a measure of shared interpretation
of commander's intent and supports the hypothesis that making values explicit
enhances shared interpretation and adaptability. The findings indicate that
when missions change in unexpected ways, a commander's intent statement that
presents the values by which actions are to be prioritized produces greater
agreement between commander and subordinates on action preferences than do
intent statements that prescribe command preference for specific actions.

spatial processing load on team performance, workload, and situational
awareness. Sixteen people served as paid participants in this study. Teams of
two participants competed against a computer opponent in a RoboFlag simulation
based on 'capture-the-flag.' Participants either could or could not see their
teammates' simulated vehicles during a trial, and they could send each other
images or annotated images from their RoboFlag display. Results of the
experiment indicated that team performance and situational awareness were
increased, and team communication and workload were decreased when participants
could see teammates' vehicles, and more limitedly, that transmission of spatial
information between teammates is facilitated by the ability to communicate that
information pictorially. Overall, results support the supposition that
distributed team performance may be mediated by spatial processing load.

%X One challenge that faces older adults today is the pervasive trend in
miniaturized technology. This trend has permeated the cellular phone industry
and resulted in technology that has not only become smaller in terms of size,
but slimmer resulting in flat-smooth keypads. The current study examined
differences in dialing performance between keypads with raised-rubber keys and
flat-smooth keys as a function of age. The results revealed that both younger
and older adults performed significantly better in terms of dialing accuracy
and dialing time with the raised-rubber keypad. Furthermore, older adults
improved significantly more with the raised-rubber keypad than did younger
adults. Findings, also, revealed that older adults committed more errors than
younger adults. These findings demonstrate how the trend of miniaturization and
smooth keypads may potentially alienate the largest growing population in the
U.S. (i.e., older adults) with respect to usability.

%X Mediated communication in sociotechnical systems is quite common but the
effects of long audio delays remain unexplored. In the current study,
two-person teams (N=67) completed a modified NASA Multi-Attribute Task Battery
with closed-loop audio communication delays 0 to 16 seconds in length. In
addition to a joint fuel management task, each team member had simultaneous
responsibility for either a compensatory tracking or a system monitoring task.
As communication delay increased, performance on the joint task degraded in a
cubic fashion while individual tasks were unaffected. These results imply that
audio communication delay degrades team performance in a non-linear fashion
while simultaneous tasks not requiring communication are unaffected.
Implications for the design of sociotechnical systems with long audio
communication delays are discussed.

%X Presenting instructional materials with a mixture of media increases the
likelihood that people will learn the information. The hypothesis of this study
is that these learning benefits are primarily the result of multimedia
supporting the integration of instructional materials. For instance, replacing
text with narrations improves learning (the modality effect) by taking
advantage of humans' ability to perceive visual and auditory inputs
simultaneously, allowing faster processing and aiding efficient integration of
multimedia instructional materials. To test this hypothesis, study time will be
manipulated to see if it influences the modality effect when verbal materials
accompany visual images. This paper outlines results of a pilot study, study
results will be presented at the conference.

%X This paper describes an evaluation conducted with a full platoon of 32
Soldiers at Aberdeen Proving Grounds' MOUT site in Aberdeen, MD. The objective
was to assess the cognitive workload classification techniques driven by
neuro-physiological (EEG) and physiological (ECG) sensors. In a first ever
evaluation of real-time cognitive monitoring in the harsh operational
environment, the assessment culminated in a three phase, 24-hour mission
consisting of a coordinated Route Reconnaissance, a Cordon and Search of a
village, and a Hasty Defense operation. Task load levels were manipulated by
introducing unexpected and unplanned events requiring re-planning and extensive
coordination by the leadership (high task load) as well as lulls in the
activity in which part missions were executed flawlessly with little variations
on the preplanned, well versed drill (low task load). Four leaders (Platoon
Leader, Platoon Sergeant, Squad Leader 1, and Squad Leader 2) were equipped
with sensors to measure and output cognitive state in real-time. The fused EEG
and ECG workload classification approach reached 95% accuracy depending on the
individual and the amount of data used to train the classifier. This level of
success implies that Augmented Cognition workload assessment tools enable the
ability to move beyond subjective workload rating scales, such as NASA TLX and
Cooper Harper ratings, to more objective measurements of real-time cognitive
state metrics in almost any conceivable operational environment.

%X Time perception is extremely important to the understanding, design and use
of complex military systems. This experiment focused on differences in time
estimation, navigation performance, and monitoring tasks. In a between-subjects
experiment, participants navigated through a ground scenario while monitoring a
screen and listening to white noise at either 55dBA or 85dBA. Performance data
was collected throughout the task for both the navigation and monitoring tasks.
Participants also completed the NASA-TLX and the DSSQ-S. Statistical analyses
showed that the noise condition did not significantly affect workload,
monitoring abilities, task completion and time estimates for the dual task.
However, the noise did affect subjective state questionnaires. These results
suggest that the dual task was not demanding enough and the stress was not
adequate to push participants out of the comfort range and experience a
performance decrement.

times, friendly target signatures, and varying cognitive load demands. Analysis
of variance revealed significant differences for the memory recall task during
shooting and non-shooting conditions. Furthermore, results showed that workload
increased as a function of task demand, with associated decreases in shooting

%X The present study investigated the effects of five days' cumulative sleep
restriction and two nights' recovery sleep on multiple-task performance and
subjective sleepiness in a controlled laboratory environment. A total of 21
volunteers participated, thirteen in the experimental group and eight in the
control group. Compared to the control group, the sleepiness of the sleep-loss
group gradually increased over the five days, but returned to the baseline
level after an eight hour recovery sleep period. Multiple-task performance
declined selectively in the memory, arithmetic and auditory subtasks, while
visual monitoring results were not affected. After the eight hour recovery
period, the performance of the sleep-restricted participants in the auditory
subtask remained low, although the individuals themselves no longer reported
sleepiness. Performance in the rest of the tasks returned to the baseline
level. Thus the partial cumulative sleep loss selectively impaired cognitive
performance in subtasks of a multiple-task environment, which simulated many
ordinary working environments. This may be due to the slowing of the cognitive
processing during sleep restriction, as well as decline in attention control.

workload of the shifting between levels of automation: from manual to automatic
(forward shift) and from automatic to manual (backward shift). Three levels of
difficulty of the Tetris game were implemented as task load conditions. Two
versions of the game were also implemented: automated and manual. The automated
version provided the participants a projection of the falling block on the
lowest layer for making its placement easier. Results showed that the
commonsense consideration that only shifts toward a lower level of automation
should reflect poor performance and higher workload is unsupported. Forward
shifts may affect performance as well, particularly when workload is moderate.

%X What type of support should be given to an automobile driver when it is
determined, via some monitoring method, that the driver's situation awareness
may not be appropriate to a given traffic condition? With a driving simulator,
the following three conditions were compared: (a) Warning type support in which
an auditory warning is given to the driver to enhance situation awareness, (b)
action type support in which an autonomous safety control action is executed to
avoid an accident, and (c) the no-aid baseline condition. Although the both
types of driver support are effective, the warning type support sometimes fail
to assure safety, which suggests a limitation of the human locus of control
assumption. Efficacy of the action type support can also be degraded due to a
characteristic of human reasoning under uncertainty. This paper discusses
viewpoints needed in the design of systems for supporting drivers in
resource-limited situations.

operational procedures, control systems and ground control stations for
uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). Creating a coherent set of operating
procedures, automatic functions and Ground Control Stations (GCS) requires a
systematic design approach that creates a consistent conceptual thread between
these elements. Following this approach, Cognitive Work Analysis was used to
develop procedures, automatic functions and ground control stations for
continuous target surveillance using a UAV. The importance of the coherence was
subsequently analyzed through human-in-the-loop simulation. The results
indicate that UAV controllers, using coherent designs, achieve significantly
higher mission performance and experience lower workloads than those using
incoherently matched procedures, automatic functions and GCS.

%X Current interactive systems are criticized for having complex interfaces
that overload users with information. Two possible solutions to manage overload
are automatic interfaces that augment user capabilities, and user-controlled
systems that provide support. These two types of interfaces introduce a
trade-off: On the one hand, automatic interfaces alleviate workload but create
performance problems associated with the absence of control. On the other hand,
user-controlled interfaces afford users more control, which may come with
additional workload. Based on the analysis of adaptive user interfaces and
automation, a model is proposed where automatic and user interface adaptation
are in a multidimensional and continuum-based space, allowing for modelling
dynamic changes to the roles the human and machine play at various stages of
interaction.

%X This paper describes an empirical study conducted to validate a
computational model of dynamic task prioritization based on a framework
proposed by Zhang and Feyen (2005). Three key factors in task prioritization
were manipulated: processing time, available time, and task valence. Because
earlier studies did not investigate how people prioritize tasks when valence
and temporal characteristics conflict, this study examined how these conflicts
are resolved. 20 subjects completed 54 time-limited task scenarios. Each
scenario consisted of two or four concurrent tasks, each assigned a point value
for completion. Subjects were instructed to maximize points scored. Results
indicated that, although valence was predominant in determining task selection,
it failed to explain all instances. Instead, a hierarchy of task prioritization
was revealed in which subjects first checked what tasks were doable (e.g.,
self-efficacy), then applied rules first regarding valence, then temporal
characteristics, and then others (e.g., task location).

%X In a naturalistic setting, a large group of U.S. Navy forecasters (N=21)
performed a weather forecasting task and saved copies of the visual displays
that they consulted to complete the task. On the basis of structured interviews
with the forecasters, quantitative analysis of the information content of the
displays they used, and psychometric measures of their spatial ability, we
found two key results. First, forecasters of lower spatial ability populated
their forecasting displays with more extraneous meteorological variables than
did forecasters of higher spatial ability. Second, we found quantitative
support for the previously qualitatively observed trend for more experienced
forecasters to exhibit a different temporal pattern of display use. Experienced
forecasters tend to consult observations before models, and less experienced
forecasters show the reverse trend. This work implies that forecasters of lower
spatial ability may benefit from training that teaches them to display only the
variables they need to complete a task, and that it may be beneficial to
customize forecasting displays to the spatial ability of their users.

%X A full-scope simulation study with licensed nuclear power plant operators
was conducted to evaluate whether displays designed using Ecological Interface
Design (EID) could support improved Situation Awareness over traditional
displays. EID demonstrated performance advantages over traditional displays in
beyond-design basis scenarios where operators were unable to rely on
procedures. The same effects were not seen in within-design basis scenarios
where procedures were available. This suggests that EID has the potential to
improve SA in unanticipated situations, but that ecological interfaces should
be supported with task-based displays in procedure-driven situations.

%X This study used Situation Awareness (SA) as a measure to evaluate two new
functional displays supplementing existing monitor displays in a large
hydropower system control room. Because it was impractical to use traditional
SA measures this paper proposes a novel SA measurement framework, in which
controllers' SA levels are derived from their in-the-loop utterance and viewing
patterns, their context-specific reports of the situations, and their overall
SA reflections. Results indicate that the SA measures not only support and
complement one another, but also are consistent with performance results. This
study offers a novel approach of using convergent lines of evidence to assess
SA in the situations that involve a whole control room or command centre or in
situations constrained by time and resources.

%X Recent research on multimodal information processing has provided evidence
for the existence of crossmodal links in spatial attention between vision,
audition, and touch. The present study examined whether these links can be
exploited to support attention allocation in workplaces that involve competing
task demands and the potential for visual data overload. In particular, the
effectiveness of tactile cues for guiding visual attention to the location of a
critical event was tested in the context of an air traffic control simulation.
Participants monitored a display depicting the flight paths of 40 aircraft and
were presented with tactile cues indicating either just the occurrence, or both
the occurrence and display location, of an event requiring a participant
response. Tactile cuing, especially when combined with location information,
resulted in significantly higher detection rates and faster response times to
these events. These findings indicate that tactile cuing is a promising means
of directing visual attention in a data-driven manner.

qualifications of that information. These qualifications, or meta-information
(e.g., pedigree, recency, uncertainty), play a role in human performance across
work domains (Pfautz et al., 2006). Meta-information contextualizes
information, and therefore can critically influence how a human will process,
understand, and act on that information. This panel will discuss the role of
meta-information in the design and evaluation of visualization and

%X Interruptions and situation awareness recovery are important issues in many
task domains. Here, we explore the extent to which cognitive design principles
for situation awareness recovery that were developed in the air warfare domain
can be applied to team mission execution. We developed a tool, called
team-CHEX, for presenting and managing messages and for helping users recover
situation awareness following interruptions. We report two experiments that
compared team-CHEX with two commonly employed mission execution recovery tools
-- chat and shared whiteboards. The results of the first experiment were used
to refine specific interface features of team-CHEX. The final tool was superior
to common chat designs and equal to, and in some respects superior to, common
whiteboard designs. The revised and extended interruption recovery principles
should be useful for the design of both monitoring tasks, such as air warfare,
and team collaboration tasks, such as mission execution.

%X Research has shown that different types of interruptions can affect their
disruptiveness. However, it is unclear how different features of the
interrupting task determine its disruptive effects. Specifically, some theories
predict that the difficulty of an interruption does not contribute to the
disruptive effects of that interruption alone. Disruptive effects can be
mediated by the extent to which the interrupting task interferes with the
ability to rehearse during the interruption. In this experiment participants
performed a single primary task with three interruptions of different
difficulty. We found that interruptions were more disruptive when the task
minimized the participant's ability to rehearse (as measured by the number of
mental operators required to perform the task) and not just when they were more
difficult. These results suggest that the ability to rehearse during an
interruption is critical in facilitating resumption of a primary task.

%X The research objective was to evaluate cerebral blood flow velocity's (BFV)
sensitivity to performance changes in a multitasking setting and to examine
resulting constraints on multitasking. The research used a Transcranial Doppler
Sonography (TCD) unit and multitask environment simulation. The tasks
represented the diverse nature of the future military environment and included
visual tracking, auditory monitoring, and more complex cognitive tasks
requiring mental manipulations and memory. Participants completed four tasks
simultaneously but with varying priority. BFV and multitask performance were
measured. Results showed that BFV changed during training and paralleled a
performance change. BFV was not sensitive to changes in task load during
multitasking. We did show behavioral consequences to multitasking, specifically
when transitioning between tasks. The data suggest that BFV may not be the most
direct neurophysiological method for measuring complex cognitive performance;
however, the use of this type of portable and relatively low-cost methodology
should be pursued further.

%X Theories accounting for the process of primary task resumption following an
interruption have focused on the suspension and retrieval of a specific goal
(Altmann &amp; Trafton, 2002). The ability to recall the spatial location of
where in the task one was prior to being interrupted may also be important. We
show that being able to maintain a spatial representation of the primary task
facilitates task resumption. Participants were interrupted by an instant
message window that either partially or fully occluded the primary task
interface. Reaction time measures show that participants were faster at
resuming in the partial occlusion condition. In addition, eye track data
suggest that participants were more accurate at returning to where they left
off, suggesting that they were able to maintain a spatial representation of the
task and use this information to resume more quickly.

%X People experience and handle interruptions on a daily basis. One strategy
that people use to manage interruptions is to interleave an interrupting task
with a primary task. Past interruptions research has mostly looked at the
effects of a single interruption on primary task performance. This study sought
to expand on past research by examining primary task performance during a
period of interleaved interruptions. In this study, participants experienced
either a single interruption or a series of interruptions that increased or
decreased in duration. Task resumption in both interleaved interruption
conditions was significantly faster than in the single interruption condition.
The findings suggest that interleaving interruptions leads to more efficient
task resumption than resuming after a single interruption.

%X Computer-based decision support systems are increasingly used to aid human
decision makers in dynamic, uncertain, time-stressed and high-stakes contexts.
The decision of whether, and if so, when to evacuate New Orleans as Hurricane
Katrina approached landfall is a prime example. An evaluation of the "HURREVAC"
decision support system (DSS) used during Katrina is presented. The evaluation
is based on real-time screen-shots of the graphical and numerical information
displayed to emergency response managers and other users. While the system is
clearly an improvement over methods used prior to advances in information
technology and real-time networking, design deficiencies were identified as
well. The most crucial of these concern insufficient resources provided by the
design to support users in reasoning effectively about uncertainty, and about
the interactions among uncertainty and other aspects of the decision situation.
The paper concludes by providing lessons learned and by identifying needs for
cognitive engineering research to improve future DSS design in operational
contexts.

%X In decision-making literature, framing effects have been studied in a wide
number of task and context conditions. In much of these studies, there is
strong support that decision framing can result in inconsistent behavior among
individuals. While much of the literature has been in static, one-time tasks,
there is a dearth of studies in decision framing in complex problem solving
tasks. This dearth in part can be attributed to an assumption that operators in
complex environments are often well trained in decision-making routines, and as
such, may not be vulnerable to framing effects. However, what is still unclear
is whether trained operators are resistant to the effects of framing when they
operate under non-routine conditions, and more importantly, what relation,
information processing changes caused due to framing may have on the task
performance of operators. The study reported here was conducted to answer these
two questions. The outcome of this work is expected to have both theoretical
and practical implication towards understanding individual's adaptive behavior
and design of real time complex systems.

behavior to examine the impact of risk to self, risk to society, and cue
ambiguity on information search strategies and ultimate decision. Participants
completed eight experimental scenarios using a web-based interface. They read
each scenario stem and accessed information until they could make a decision
about whether or not to 'blow the whistle' on the organization. Significant
effects on number of same-type cue boxes accessed were found for ambiguity and
risk to society levels. Risk to self and risk to society impacted participants'
likelihood of reporting the scenario incident. A significant risk to self by
risk to society interaction suggested that low risk to self enhanced
willingness to report incidents especially when risk to society was high.
Results suggest that individuals will respond to this type of risky situation
by a) trying to be more sure of the situation, and b) focusing more on risks to
others than to themselves. Implications are discussed.

%X Mission critical domains (MCDs), such as fire fighting, military combat,
etc., experience periods of nonequilibrium. This typically occurs when extended
periods of low grade activity are punctuated by intense, high stakes actions
unfolding at high velocities (e.g., fighting a fire, engaging in combat, etc.).
These periods of nonequilibrium are typically characterized by volatility,
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Human agents operating under these
conditions experience a variety of reactions, such as emotional modulation of
cognition, recognition primed decision making, among others. To study this
phenomenon a construct named High Velocity Human Factors (HVHF) is defined and
described. On the practical side, the HVHF framework will be used to analyze
demands placed on personnel operating in MCDs and inform the design of systems
and solutions.

%X Modern sonar systems have greatly improved their sensor technology and
processing techniques, but little effort has been put into display design for
sonar data. The enormous amount of acoustic data presented by the traditional
frequency versus time display can be overwhelming for a sonar operator to
monitor and analyze. In addition to their normal sonar tasks, sonobuoy system
operators manage the deployment of sonobuoys and ensure proper functioning of
deployed sonobuoys. This paper describes a work domain analysis carried out as
part of an interface design project targeting the sonobuoy system on board a
maritime patrol aircraft. The domain of sonobuoy management and the domain of
tactical situation awareness were modeled separately to address the two
different aspects of the operator's work. Information requirements were drawn
from the two models. Some of these requirements have significant implications
for new design ideas that were previously overlooked in displays for sonobuoy
systems.

ecological display designs exist, many practitioners have experienced
difficulty in transforming the nested behavior-shaping constraints identified
by CWA into novel EID display forms. We introduce the Form Comparison Matrix
(FCM) as a tool to further structure EID design efforts by leveraging the
outputs of CWA activities. Drawing upon the familiar DURESS mass balance
display form as an example, we discuss typical challenges of ecological display
development and present a practical application of the FCM to support
evaluation of competing ecological design alternatives. This article is
intended to stimulate discussion of methods and tools for further formalizing
EID processes and to serve as a methodological example for future EID

%X Minnesota drivers are over-represented in accidents at rural intersections
and many crashes are attributable to drivers accepting unsafe gaps. In this
context, intersection decision support (IDS) systems are promising technologies
for supporting driver decision-making. A significant activity during IDS
development is to determine the information requirements to display to drivers.
To be effective, an IDS system must present information that helps drivers
successfully negotiate intersections. This paper compares two methods for
identifying information requirements: work domain analysis (WDA) and
hierarchical task analysis (HTA). Results showed that 58% of the requirements
were identified by WDA, 7% by HTA, and 35% by both methods. An analysis of
driver errors at intersections during the HTA activity identified that drivers
can perceive gaps at intersections in different ways. This important nuance was
not captured in the WDA. Therefore, both WDA and HTA are effective methods for
identifying information requirements. Discussion focuses on the importance of
both WDA and HTA in IDS system development.

%X Two new approaches for mitigating the confirmation bias are proposed and
evaluated in the domain of collaborative intelligence analysis. Trainee Naval
intelligence analysts and reservists (N=27) role-played analysts working 10
problems, taking one of two different collaborative roles across problems. Each
problem's hypothesis had an equal proportion of supporting and refuting
evidence. Participants chose and prioritized a subset of available evidence
that would be most important in evaluating a particular hypothesis. Bias
manifested itself as selecting or prioritizing a skewed subset of supporting
evidence to focus on or share. Two new low-workload debiasing methods were
evaluated. First, supporting or refuting evidence was laid out graphically,
instead of in text. Second, other analysts shared their interpretations of
evidence, instead of analysts having to interpret the evidence on their own.
Results showed a significant bias to focus on and share confirming evidence
across all conditions. The highest ranked evidence was also the most supportive
evidence. However, bias was reduced for problems worked with the graphical
evaluation format for one collaborative role. Also, participants were less
biased to accept hypotheses for problems worked in a graphical format when they
had interpreted the evidence-hypothesis relationship themselves. These results
have implications for the basic study of decision bias (conflating support and
importance) and applied design of systems that help to reduce bias.

%X While intelligence analysis has become the focus of much recent research,
there has been a shortage of research in team cognition for analytical tasks
and effective training strategies for analysis. This study investigates the
effectiveness of teams of analysts in a training exercise. In order to capture
the dynamics and nuances of multiple large teams of practitioners concurrently
struggling with a realistic scenario, we used a unique adaptation of
established ethnographic methods. The goal of this qualitative research was to
determine persistent analytical strategies and study the interplay between the
critical support functions of macrocognition for teams of novice analysts.
Findings from this study suggest strategies for improving performance and
training for intelligence analysts.

%X With the recent catastrophic outcomes in U.S. intelligence capabilities we
suggest that current design metaphors are inadequate to address the changing
reality of U.S. intelligence needs. In-depth interviews and concept mapping
efforts with intelligence analysts suggest that the intelligence domain be
characterized as a distributed cognitive work system. Current mechanical or
information processing metaphors that encourage techno-centric system design
solutions neglect the emergent, pluralistic and distributed nature of
information that supports situational awareness and decision making in the
intelligence domain. Instead, we suggest that weather systems are a more
appropriate metaphor for understanding the cognitive activity of intelligence
analysts and to guide the design of cognitive aides, information sharing and
knowledge management systems, and data processing tools used to support
intelligence work.

behind an analysis. The study investigates the challenges that inhibit the
understanding of rigor in intelligence analysis and explores cues used by
analysts to identify analytic rigor -- or lack of rigor. Nine professional
intelligence analysts participated in a modified elicitation by critiquing
method study, embedded in a scenario walkthrough. Findings from the study
indicate that, while professional intelligence analysts can make perceptive
assessments about the quality of an analysis process based on product quality,
these perceptions are apt to change with insight into the analytic process.

elicit feedback on the usefulness of a set of modular design concepts for
dealing with information dynamics in inferential analysis under data overload
conditions. The design concepts were comprised of innovative solutions that
utilized technology to assist in inferential analysis. The findings generally
support the "promisingness" of the design directions for addressing information
dynamics challenges in inferential analysis under data overload. Elicited
feedback provides insight on how the concepts might prove useful to
intelligence analysts in the field. Analysts recommended significant
modifications that would be difficult to change post-implementation of
software, suggesting that the animock technique was useful for exploring how
design concepts could address challenging issues where no current software

%X Whereas knowledge management relies on processes of knowledge elicitation,
there is also a process in which knowledge is "recovered," typically from
archived documents. We conducted a knowledge recovery (KR) effort, going from
documents to a structured set of propositions concerning expert knowledge about
terrain analysis, discussing landforms, soils, rock types, etc. Assertions and
feature associations were recast as over 3,000 propositions. When contrasted
with results from previous evaluations of methods of knowledge elicitation, KR
was costly in terms of time and effort, suggesting that knowledge-based
organizations should make knowledge capture an on-going aspect of work, rather
than finding themselves in the "catch-up mode" to recover lost expertise. For
both knowledge elicitation and recovery, the knowledge has to be represented in
a form that is usable and useful (e.g., instantiation in knowledge bases). We
created from the propositions a navigable knowledge model based on over 150
Concept Maps, which were hyperlinked together and to dozens of resources
(aerial photos, maps, diagrams, etc.). Such knowledge models are intended to
make the "expertise of the past" more useful and usable in training and in
performance support.

%X Aeronautical decision making research has focused almost exclusively on
general and commercial aviation -- with little attention given to the military
aviation domain. This research has also been limited by its lack of realism
and/or inability to probe aviators for additional clarifying information
relevant to their decisions. This study addresses these shortcomings by using
in-depth interviews of critical incidents guided by the critical decision
method to gain a deeper understanding of the decision making process of
experienced naval aviators during novel or unexpected situations in flight.
Through this method, two contextual factors in the military aviation
environment not previously addressed were identified: (a) the purpose of the
flight; and (b) the flight operation environment. These two factors were found
to influence each other in addition to impacting the saliency of certain cues
and factors for the aviators. Implications for military aviator training and
other domains of aviation are discussed.

%X Highly skilled professionals in mission critical work domains communicate
complicated, critical information, frequently under time pressure. For example,
sustained operations require shift work, which results in hand-offs of
responsibilities and need of information transfers. There is a growing interest
to support their communications through advanced information technology. We
observed usage of information artifacts in a pediatric intensive care unit to
study information transfers to guide the design of support technology. In
contrast to published studies, we examined the context of supporting
environment that contains rich information sources gathered or tailored for
verbal discourses. We called the supporting environment "information arena."
Clinicians prepare for their personal information arena as well as the shared
information arena (e.g., paper notes, charts, mobile computers). Patterns of
artifact uses during discourses revealed several distinct roles of artifacts,
as well as constraints on design of such artifacts. For example, artifacts in
shared information arena should be easily manageable to support fluid and
dynamic conversation flow. We also uncover several potential future roles for
information artifacts to support information transfer.

%X Information Analysis and Synthesis (henceforth "IAS") is a type of cognitive
work that plays a key role in many high-performance, complex, and
mission-critical domains. These can range from tactical military intelligence
to scientific or technological forecasting, business and financial intelligence
to national strategic counterterrorism, and include areas as disparate as
geopolitical policy analysis to computer network intrusion detection. The
specific subject of this study is the military intelligence domain as one
instantiation of IAS. Several innovative ethnographic and cognitive task
analysis methods were used to observe team-based distributed work done by
actual domain practitioners. The main investigative effort took the form of a
scaled-world study, leveraging a real world tactical intelligence training
exercise as a natural laboratory for investigating the contrasts between weaker
and stronger IAS. Specifically, we examined the role of instructors in
providing broadening checks to the team analytic process, and mapped the
findings to an existing framework.

%X An experiment was conducted to study differences in workload and performance
of participants when navigating a route. Participants used a mobile device to
navigate a route in a building. Different types of representation were used: a
paper floor plan and three representations presented on a personal digital
assistant (PDA). In the PDA based conditions, an overview of the floor plan was
presented in a picture viewer. Since the plan was much larger than the PDA
screen, participants moved different parts of the plan into view using a
stylus. Floor plans were also presented as a sequence of plan fragments on the
PDA which were advanced by the user according to location. Results show
significantly shorter route completion times for participants using the paper
plan compared with the PDA support. Significant differences in workload, effort
and mental demand were also found between the types of representation. The
paper plan condition elicited the lowest levels of workload and the shortest
route completion times. Implications for the design of location-based
navigation support are discussed.

effectiveness of integrated ground-based warning systems for improved runway
safety. The evaluated warning systems contained technologies to enhance pilot
awareness, as well as warn pilots about runway safety risks. Pilots experienced
simulation scenarios with warning systems that provided either visual or audio
warnings about surface traffic. In addition, pilots experienced simulation
scenarios in a baseline condition, with no warnings. The ground-based warnings
consisted of airport surface lights including Runway Entrance Lights, Take-off
Hold Lights, Arrival Warning Lights, and an Auditory Arrival Runway Incursion
Alerting System. Eye tracking was used to examine where pilots focused their
attention when they are taxiing, departing, and arriving. Results indicate
significant safety benefits of ground-based pilot warnings by reducing the
likelihood of runway safety incidents.

%X When locating target items in information hierarchies, performance depends
much on selecting the right nodes along the path. Two methods for evaluating
category membership, card sorting and a simple statistical approach, are
compared with regard to their predictive capacity of navigation difficulties.
We developed a category structure for a web site and obtained metrics from both
card sorting and a statistical approach based on the word frequencies of
category content items. We then conducted a user study to compare actual user
performance with predictions from the two approaches. Despite the simplicity of
the statistical approach, it produced marginally better predictions. In
particular, it predicted problematic target items that took nearly twice as
much time on average to find than the remaining targets in the web navigation
study. We review these results and discuss usefulness and implications of
predicting navigation problems in information hierarchies for the information
architect.

%X Performance in human-robot interaction is related to the operator's mental
map of the space in which the robot travels. Accordingly, accurate assessment
of mental maps will be important for the design of human-robot interfaces. The
present research used a factorial design experiment to examine two methods for
acquiring spatial knowledge (reading a map vs. navigating in the space), three
methods of testing spatial knowledge (drawing a map, navigating through the
space, and estimating point-to-point distances. The results showed that
performance in the navigation test was influenced by factors unrelated to the
navigated distance, whereas map drawing especially was closely related to the
actual distance. Map drawing resulted in a stronger relation between map
distance and actual distance in the map training condition than in the
navigation training condition. The results are interpreted in terms of transfer
appropriate processing, and are applied to human-robot interface design.

%X Engineering design tasks require designers to compare, weigh and choose
between many complex alternatives throughout the design processes. The
uncertainty in design decisions and the high cost of poor choices has long made
decision methods incorporating representations of uncertainty appealing from a
theoretical standpoint. Yet, such methods have not been widely adopted in
practical settings. This paper describes a study exploring reasons why this is
so. The study found that in task of rank ordering a set of design alternatives
from best to worst, a decision making method which incorporated a
representation of uncertainty produced no better performance than a
deterministic one. However, when compared to the informal methods typically
followed by designers for rank ordering alternatives, both methods resulted in
more consistent rankings for expert designers, but required more time. We will
discuss the practical implications these findings may have for use of these
methods in practice.

%X Three-person teams controlling a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle underwent
different training regimes in order to assess the effect of process-based and
knowledge-based training on team coordination and performance. Coordination and
performance were assessed during training and eight to eleven weeks after
training. Process training consisted of either enforcing a rigid coordination
process or forcing teams to coordinate in different ways through the
introduction of perturbations. Knowledge training consisted of cross-training
teams on each others roles. Results indicate that process training had a
significant effect on team coordination. In addition, the qualitative nature of
coordination flexibility changed from training to retention for process versus
knowledge trained teams, with process teams behaving flexibly at retention.
Perturbation process training led to significantly higher team performance
under high workload. Rigid process training lead to significantly lower
performance in one of the retention missions.

strategies, little attention has been paid to the issues of strategy selection

Forty engineering university students performed a start-up task on a
representative thermal-hydraulic process microworld. Participants were divided
into two groups, each performing the task with a different graphical user
interface. Three different strategies were available to control the simulation:
Single, Decoupled, and Full. The only constraints imposed on strategy selection
were the physical characteristics of the process simulation. A frequency count
for each of the different strategies used by participants was cumulated.
Results show a strong preference towards the Decoupled strategy. Results also
show significant differences between the two interface groups. These results
provided helpful insights on strategy selection and compliance and interface
design.

base rate) have on the transfer of learning in an airline luggage screening
task. Participants (n = 33) were presented with three base rates during the
acquisition (training) phase: 100%, 50%, or 20%; at transfer, all participants
detected novel targets at a base rate of 20%. Performance was measured by hit
rates, false alarm rates, sensitivities, and detection times. Results revealed
that participants receiving higher base rates during training obtained higher
hit rates at transfer compared to participants encountering lower base rates.
However, increasing the training base rate also increased the incidence of
false alarms, leading to a low overall level of sensitivity during transfer.
Relatively higher base rates had mixed effects on response times. These results
have implications for improving training modules for individuals in complex
visual inspection tasks.

%X This paper describes the development and evaluation of an intuitive planning
process as an alternative to the Canadian Forces Operational Planning Process
(CFOPP), a formal planning procedure based on analytical decision theory. The
Intuitive Operations Planning Process (IOPP) is an iterative planning
procedure, developed for this project, in which a single course of action is
continually evaluated and refined. An experimental evaluation of the IOPP was
conducted in which two planning teams performed two simulated planning tasks,
once with the CFOPP and once with the IOPP. Results show that the IOPP
outperformed the CFOPP in terms of efficiency, quality of planning products,
usability, operational effectiveness, and workload, but was rated inferior in
terms of trust and reliability, and the potential to lead to errors. It appears
that the IOPP may be able to provide benefits to operational planning in terms
of both efficiency and effectiveness and its use should therefore be further
examined.

Human Factors construct to a mainstream term in domains as diverse as aviation,
medicine, and defense. Individuals involved in design, training, and policy
consider SA a critical aspect of the success of their organizations. Given this
prominence, accurate measures of SA should be primary indications of
organizational performance. However, many traditional measures of SA disrupt
the flow of work; they are poorly suited for operational organizations.
Alternative methods of SA measurement are needed if accurate feedback is to be
given to team members in working conditions. In this effort, we explore the
potential of unobtrusive process measures of SA. These measures are based on
analyses of the electronic communications media prevalent in modern networked
organizations.

%X Team communications provide a rich source of data on team or macro-
cognition. Efforts to automate team communication analysis are easing the
burden of manual analysis and are facilitating the investigation of a variety
of dimensions of these data. Communications flow is one dimension that has been
tapped and shown to be relevant to team performance. In this study
macrocognitive processes are manually coded in the context of a Noncombatant
Evacuation Exercise. In addition, communication flow patterns are extracted for
a portion of the communication data and mapped onto the manually coded
processes. The human tags of the remaining data are then predicted based solely
on communication flow patterns with flow data predicting 73% of the variance in
human-coded macrocognitive stages and 42% of the variance in the macrocognitive
processes. These results can help inform macrocognitive theory and present
promise for automatic tagging.

%X A model of team collaboration was developed that emphasizes the
macro-cognitive processes entailed in collaboration and includes major
processes that underlie this type of communication: (1) individual knowledge
building, (2) developing knowledge inter-operability, (3) team shared
understanding, and (4) developing team consensus. This paper describes research
conducted to empirically validate this model. Team communications that
transpired during two complex problem solving situations were coded using
cognitive process definitions included in the model. Data was analyzed for
three teams that conducted a Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO) and four
teams that engaged in air-warfare scenarios. MIO scenarios involve a boarding
team that boards a suspect ship to search for contraband cargo (e.g.
explosives, machinery) and possible terrorist suspects. Air-warfare scenarios
involve identifying air contacts in the combat information center of an Aegis
ship. The way the teams' behavior on the two scenarios maps to the model of
team collaboration is discussed.

of using this multimedia communication tool whenever they felt it would help
them to communicate information to commanders in other units. Two of the
messages consisted of one-way communications. The remaining 13 were
asynchronous dialogs. In these messages, the officers:
 * Made extensive use of pointing, drawing and embedded written notes
 * Used these asynchronous dialogs to detect and repair misconceptions that
   arose from live face-to-face briefings (6/13 dialogs)
 * Used these asynchronous dialogs to share expertise while developing a plan

%X This paper addresses theoretical aspects of human responses to warning
systems and applies them to the responses to a clinical reminder system. The
literature on warnings describes a number of responses, such as compliance and
reliance, automation bias, and the "cry-wolf" effect. This paper suggests two
complementary responses to compliance and reliance, named spillover and
reactance, which can be placed within the framework of operators' responses to
warning systems, and which altogether describe a complete set of possible
responses to cues from warning systems. This set of responses is demonstrated
on the example of a clinical reminder system, which mails reminders to primary
care physicians regarding patients who require secondary prevention of clinical
arteriosclerosis. The results mainly show evidence for compliance. Some
theoretical conclusions are drawn.

%X Simulated keyboards on touch screens are becoming the norm for data entry on
mobile and kiosk systems. Since onscreen keyboards compete with other user
interface elements for limited screen space, it is essential that soft keyboard
designs are optimally laid out. This paper describes an experiment in which the
performance and accuracy of data input on soft keyboards with square keys of
two different widths (10 and 15mm) and two inter-key gap distances (1.5 and
4.5mm) were evaluated. Three methods of input were studied: finger, stylus, and
trackball. Entry times were the shortest and most accurate for stylus touch,
although trackball input was the most accurate for the smallest key size. The
spacing between keys did not exhibit a significant effect regardless of key
size and input method. A key size of 15mm appears to be sufficiently large to
provide acceptable accuracy for touch input, although a key size of 10mm was
equally acceptable for trackball input.

%X Current authentication strategies seek to increase security by requiring
users to create more secure alphanumeric passwords. Unfortunately, the inverse
relationship between alphanumeric password security and memorability prevents
users from being able to create a password that is both secure and memorable.
Graphical user authentication mechanisms have been explored as a means to
maintain security while enhancing memorability of passcodes. Current approaches
often use unrelated picture sets from which participants have to remember a
subset, with mixed results. The study outlined in this paper seeks to further
validate the Composite Scene Authentication (CSA) graphical passcode mechanism
(Johnson &amp; Werner, 2006). Extending retention intervals and increasing the
variability of stimuli clearly demonstrated the superiority of CSA over
alphanumerical passwords. In addition, we manipulated the mode of presentation
(serial vs. composite) to assess the memorability of stimuli presented in
different temporal formats. In the current study CSA passcodes consisting of
nine categorical dimensions were compared to nine character alphanumeric
passwords. Participants showed a strong advantage in passcode retention of
graphical passcodes for both modes of presentation. This effect grew larger
with increasing retention intervals. At the longest retention interval (6
weeks), only 10 (12%) participants were able to produce their alphanumerical
password vs. 50 (60%) participants who were still able to produce the correct
graphical passcode.

%X Movement kinematics has been shown useful for characterizing the process of
aiming movement in target acquisition tasks. There are multiple kinematic
measures reported in the literature, but their relationship to eventual
performance is not well documented. To determine the relationship between
various kinematic measures and movement performance, data were collected from
participants aged 21 to 90 years with a wide range of psychomotor ability. When
computed across age groups, time to peak velocity (TPV), time to peak
acceleration (TPA), and time from peak velocity until the end of movement
(TPVEND) were found to correlate with movement performance. However, the
relationships diminished when the correlations were computed within age groups
(except for TPVEND). More interestingly, despite the extensive report, certain
kinematic measures such as peak velocity were found to be uncorrelated with
performance. Thus, when performance is the focus, improvement should be made to
reduce TPV, TPA, and TPVEND.

%X Gravity mouse is a mouse interface that accelerates the cursor towards
potential targets. Its design is based on the premise that as the cursor
approaches a potential selection the system can be more certain of the
selection. Usability studies with multiple buttons, target and distracter
buttons, demonstrate a 100 ms reduction in selection time for 52x41 px buttons
and a 130 ms reduction for 19x15 px buttons. Analysis of the results suggests
that users resist the full benefit of gravity mouse. Gravity mouse's influence
is adaptive and the paper discusses its potential application in intelligent
user interfaces.

however, indicated an advantage for the balanced menu. User attitude did not
vary with the menu structure, but was related to the number of calls needed to
complete the tasks, such that the more calls that were needed, the more
negatively the telephone menu was viewed.

%X Executive dashboards have become popular in enterprise software
applications. Consequently, much advice has been offered by private consulting
firms on how best to design dashboards. This paper details a couple of studies
testing the advice given by the dashboard experts. The results suggest that
some of the notions about how dashboard widgets should be designed might be
incorrect. The results indicate that colored widgets are not necessarily
inferior to simpler, colorless widgets. Similarly, fancy widgets (i.e., those
with three dimensional characteristics) were not demonstrated to be inferior to
plainer widgets. While some methodological challenges must be overcome in
similar future studies, the results of the described studies do not support
some popular ideas about executive dashboards (and data visualization in
general), and suggest that the area of interest is ripe for further
investigation.

concepts or pieces of information. These nodes are connected by lines that
represent relationships between the information.
   Large concept maps are difficult to explore and navigate using current
digital display interfaces. As users zoom in on a desired node, connections
between the node of interest and surrounding nodes become hidden from the user.
A combination of fisheye zooming and semantic zooming mechanisms to maintain
the visual connections between the nodes was implemented, and a user study to
determine whether this technique helps users learn from the map was conducted.
   The user study revealed that participants were able to recall more
information presented in a concept map, with practically no difference in the
amount of time spent using the map, despite the novelty of the semantic fisheye

of a web-based audit management system in aircraft maintenance domain with
emphasis on the persona creation process, the design approach followed, and the

identified to measure the effectiveness of an evaluation. However,
communicating problems is also important to evaluation effectiveness, because a
problem found but poorly explained may not be fixed. This study compared lists
of usability problems from 21 practitioners and 23 students watching a
pre-recorded usability session. Lists were evaluated for the number of problems
reported, and for following six guidelines for describing usability problems:
be clear and avoid jargon, describe problem severity, provide backing data,
describe problem causes, describe user actions, and provide a solution. There
was no difference in the number of problems reported by students and
practitioners, but there was a difference in their ratings for following
several of the guidelines. Using both measures provides a more complete
assessment of usability reports.

students' experiences with and attitudes about the TPCs, physical discomfort
associated with TPC use, and temporal and task-driven patterns of TPC use. Data
were collected via questionnaire. Results showed students' attitudes were
generally quite positive towards the TPCs. However, they did not tend to think
TPCs had improved their grades, few disagreed that TPCs were a distraction in
class, and visual and musculoskeletal discomfort was prevalent. Recognizing the
organizational capacity of the TPC was associated with several positive
attitudes towards the TPC, including aiding interactions with teachers and
feeling more comfortable in class. This type of assessment provides a useful

the world, replacing expensive human operators in many settings. However,
usability issues continue to diminish the economic value of these modules. This
experiment demonstrates how the application of sound usability principles can
be applied to self-service settings to increase the usability of self-service
modules. The study compared the usability of two versions of a self-service
digital photo kiosk. In one version we replicated a kiosk presently in use and
broadly available. The other version of the software incorporated several
design principles, such as the use of a metaphor, intended to increase
usability and learnability, more specifically to allow for easier navigation.
Participant's performance in completing tasks was measured as a function of
speed, accuracy, and the need for human assistance. The results demonstrate
that incorporating usability principles can improve usability of self-service
modules.

proficient users took to navigate virtual hovercrafts through virtual hallways
with corners of various widths and discovered that the time to negotiate
corners is inversely proportional to corner width. We derive and evaluate two
models for the index of difficulty for negotiating corners. Both models fit the
data well, with r{sup:2} greater than 0.85 for the mean time to negotiate
corners verses corner width.

interactions and is largely driven by voice recognition and text-to-speech
software. A custom designed controller manages the VOR functionality, rendering
platform, speech recognition, and text-to-speech generation modules. The VOR
allows instructors and researchers to simulate the physical and social context
in which surgical procedures are performed. The VOR can be used to train
surgical teams and address issues in judgment, decision making, team dynamics,
and interpersonal skills. Most importantly, the VOR allows medical teams to
train the way they operate without putting patients at risk.

%X The modality principle suggests that presenting words via audio-narration
rather than visual-text can improve learning (Mayer, 2001). However, the use of
narrations when verbal materials are lengthy can have cognitive costs, and
learning from text can be improved when materials are self-paced or provide
ample study time. Therefore, there might be circumstances under which using
text would actually be better than using narration. In this experiment we
compare learning from diagrams that accompany text or narration; we manipulated
available study time while also providing learners control over the pace of
presentation. The results show that under these conditions, using narration
instead of text does not improve learning. Some additional study time improves
learning from both narration and text. However, even greater amounts of study
time improve learning from narrations but not text. Implications about when to
apply the modality principle to multimedia instructional design are discussed.

%X Learners bring their unique individual perceptions, preferences, and
abilities to a learning situation. The effect of individual differences on
learning depends in part on how the instructional system accommodates
individual differences. The current study examined the role of individual
differences in verbal ability and structured navigation in hypertext learning.
It was predicted that learning would vary with how well the hypertext
environment supported a learner's individual attributes. Ninety-seven
participants participated in one of four groups of a 2 X 2 between-subjects
factorial design, which focused on the interaction between levels of
navigational structure (unconstrained or expert constrained) and levels of
participants' verbal ability (high or low). Overall, learners with high-verbal
ability performed better on an unconstrained navigation structure than those
with low-verbal ability; whereas in an expert-constrained navigation this
difference between verbal ability levels was smaller. The results have
implications for the design of hypertext-based learning systems.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) laboratory to teach basic components of HCI
concepts to undergraduate students. The objective was to develop a teaching
laboratory so that students would gain the necessary experience to conduct
usability evaluation on local projects. The purpose of this study was to
examine the changes in a student's technique of identifying usability problems
while using the HCI laboratory. Thirteen students in an undergraduate HCI
course participated in the study. During a pre-and post-assessment, we
collected several measures in order to quantify any changes experienced by the
students as they logged usability problems. These measures included attention
focus, number of problems identified, word count, and use of HCI terms in
describing usability problems. Results showed that the metrics of number of
usability problems identified and the use of HCI technical terms were
particularly sensitive to changes over the semester.

assess the degree to which rankings by office workers of different key
attributes of occupancy quality predict worker perceptions of their on-the-job
productivity. Data were collected from a total of 434 workers employed in 10
different office sites. Results show that perceived levels of productivity are
significantly correlated with rankings of perceived overall physical work
environment and job quality. The correlation between perceived levels of
productivity and perceived overall organization quality is marginally
significant. No significant correlations are observed between perceived levels
of productivity with rankings of perceived overall compensation, work station,
and employment quality. The results should benefit employer decision-making
regarding human factors/ergonomic (HF/E) interventions to improve office worker
productivity.

including 3 x 10-minute tasks separated by 2 x 10-minute relaxation tasks,
while sitting on both a static seat (SS) and a rotary dynamic seat (DS) at
fixed speed. Ss torso movement was greater for the DS condition (p=.000) and
while performing active versus passive tasks (p=.000). However, personal
comfort measures for postural stability (p&lt;.000), postural instability
(p&lt;.003), limitations in writing and typing (p&lt;.001), feelings of nausea
(p&lt;.023), and dizziness (p&lt;.024) were worse for the DS condition than for
the SS condition. The DS did not significantly affect task performance or back
pain. Ss without pre-existing back pain made more negative than positive
comments on the chair's motion than those with back pain. Allowing intermittent
use of the DS with personal control of the speed of rotation according to task
demands and comfort level, may afford some benefits.

musculoskeletal discomfort for eleven upper body regions, demographics,
workstation utilization and workstation satisfaction. On-site measurements of
workstation dimensions were taken and posture was observed using the Rapid
Upper Limb Assessments (RULA) method for each survey. Participants reported
that the FPMA allowed them to optimally position their screen and a majority
said it made it easier to share information with colleagues. Total upper
extremity musculoskeletal discomfort and computer vision syndrome symptoms were
significantly reduced for the test group. However, no significant differences
were found for specific body regions or for RULA scores.

%X The purpose of workplace training is to enable workers to successfully
perform activities related to their work tasks so that they can satisfy the
expectations of the company and its customers. Training objectives often
include levels of productivity, effectiveness, and/or safety. Regulatory
requirements can also influence training, either by modifying existing training
needs or adding new requirements. The success of training programs depends on
the design of the training materials, post-training verification and ongoing
validation. When workers are trained to proficiency, they remain safe,
acceptable products and services are produced, and customers are satisfied. But
when disputes lead to lawsuits, the evaluation of training proficiency changes.
The determination of responsibility in a courtroom is based on the
interpretation of the law by a judge and jury in isolation from the complicated
contexts of the real world. The contribution of human factors to this process
can provide a significant benefit to the effective resolution of legal
proceedings in which the effectiveness of training programs and the proficiency
achieved by workers is in question. In fact, human factors insights are
critical to the just resolution of these cases. Human factors practitioners are
uniquely capable to explain how context affects training requirements and how
proficiency should be evaluated in the naturalistic work environment.

%X Instructions on how to avoid hazards are an important aspect of warnings.
Because message brevity is beneficial for effectiveness, the wording ought to
be useful in motivating compliance. Participants (N=132) evaluated 37 single
and two-word emphasis phrases (e.g., "critical" or "absolutely crucial") that
could be added to a directive (or instructions) statement to indicate the
degree of compliance necessity. Manipulated were one or two-word (phrase)
emphasis terms (e.g., "critical," "must," and "absolutely critical").
Participants rated the compliance intent for each of these. Results showed a
wide range of ratings across word/phrase conditions (from "extremely critical"
and "urgent" as the highest to "optional" as the lowest). Linear (additive) and
non linear effects were yielded by the pattern of means for word/phrase
combinations. "Federal Law" was one of the highest rated items confirming
similar previous findings. Implications are discussed including the potential
for matching terms with hazard levels.

which the warning actually affects the behavior that can lead to the hazard.
This study provided such an opportunity. It arose because a person was injured
while climbing onto a commuter rail platform instead of using the stairs that
were at the other end of the platform. It was suggested that a warning may have
deterred the hazardous behavior. Persons were observed by video approaching and
climbing onto the platform at two stations having similar characteristics as
where the accident occurred, both before and after a sign warning of the hazard
was erected. Before and after the sign was in place all who approached the end
without the stairs climbed onto the platform, even those who clearly looked at
the sign. The sign had no effect on changing the behavior.

%X The present study addresses effects of social loafing and social
compensation in automation monitoring. Thirty-six participants performed a
multi-task, consisting of three sub-tasks which simulate work demands of
operators in a chemical plant. One of the tasks involved the monitoring of an
automated process. Participants were randomly assigned to three different
groups: (1) "Non-Redundant": participants worked on all tasks alone. (2)
"Redundant": participants were informed that a second crewmember would work in
parallel on the monitoring task. (3) "Informed-Redundant": like the "redundant"
condition with the additional information that the crewmate's monitoring
performance might be low. Results provide evidence of social loafing and social
compensation effects in automation monitoring. Participants in the "redundant"
condition cross-checked the automation significantly less than participants in
the other groups. This result suggests that human redundancy might not always
be the best solution to enhance safety, but might even lead to riskier operator
behavior.

factors that such technologies involve. The use of biometric applications will
be unfamiliar to many users, who may neither understand nor be comfortable with
the technology. Currently, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers
are critical in communicating and training users in the acquisition of
fingerprints. Since user behavior can affect both the throughput of the system
as well as the quality of the captured images, guidelines for developing
interactions with biometric applications that increase throughput and image
quality would be valuable. This study examines the effect of instructional
modes on user performance. Posters were not as effective in providing
instructions to users as video or verbal instructions.

%X Over the past two decades there has been an escalation in the number of
patient admissions to U.S. hospitals while the number of available hospital
beds has declined. Concurrently, decreasing reimbursements for patient care
services have compelled cost cutting and efficiency measures. Coupled with
other factors such as personnel shortages, this has eroded the capacity of
hospitals to absorb situational increases in demand. Innovative approaches to
monitoring and enhancing capacity management are integral to improving
resilience and reliability. This paper describes the Acute Care Operations
Management Solution (ACOMS), an application designed to enable dynamic
management of demand versus capacity across system scales, and Cognitive
Assessment Indicators, a method for evaluating the impact of system design on
the cognitive functioning of operators.

%X Emergency Departments (EDs) are open systems that routinely cope with highly
variable and uncertain inputs. This paper will use two critical incidents to
explore system adaptations to demand, complexity, unpredictability, and other
threats to performance. We then relate the observations to three recently
proposed graphical representations of organizational resilience: the resilience
state space model; the stress-strain model of adaptation; and a dynamic model
of resilience. We use these graphics to analyze the ED's response to chronic
constraints and unexpected shocks. The models are found to be mutually
reinforcing - each highlights some important aspects of resilience, while none
capture all of the salient features.

%X Application of human factors concepts to high-risk activities has
facilitated reduction in human error. With introduction of laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, the incidence of bile duct injury increased. Seeking ideas for
prevention, we analyzed 300 laparoscopic bile duct injuries within the
framework of human error analysis. The primary cause of error (97%) was a
visual perceptual illusion. The laparoscopic environment contributed to 75% of
injuries, poor visibility 22%. Most injuries involved deliberate major bile
duct transection due to misperception of the anatomy. This illusion was so
compelling that the surgeon usually did not recognize it. Even when irregular
cues were detected, improper rules were employed, eliminating feedback. Since
the complication-causing error occurred at few key steps during laparoscopic
cholecystectomy; we instituted focused training to heighten vigilance, and have
formulated specific rules to decrease the incidence of bile duct injury. In
addition, factors in the laparoscopic environment contributing to this illusion
are discussed.

%X System performance in healthcare pivots on the ability to match demand for
care with the resources that are needed to provide it. High reliability is
desirable in organizations that perform inherently hazardous, highly technical
tasks. However, healthcare's high variability, diversity, partition between
workers and managers, and production pressure make it difficult to employ
essential aspects of high reliability organizations (HROs) such as redundancy
and extensive training. A different approach is needed to understand the nature
of healthcare systems and their ability to perform and survive under duress; in
other words, to be resilient. The recent evolution of resilience engineering
affords the opportunity to configure healthcare systems so that they are
adaptable and can foresee challenges that threaten their mission. Information
technology (IT) in particular can enable healthcare, as a service sector, to
adapt successfully, as long as it is based on cognitive systems engineering
approaches to achieve resilient performance.

%X To be a high-reliability organization, organizations need to continually
assess risks and predict potential failures before even they actually occur. In
this paper, we present a new method to uncover and assess risks and failures
embedded in a work system: systems ambiguity framework. We define systems
ambiguity as uncertainty or vagueness that may prevent a work system from
achieving its purpose. We identified five main types of ambiguity in a work
system: task ambiguity, responsibility ambiguity, expectation ambiguity, method
ambiguity, and exception ambiguity. Examples for each type of ambiguity are
provided from a qualitative study aimed at identifying the underlying causes of
non-compliance to evidence based guidelines in intensive care units. We argue
that systems ambiguity framework can be used alone or in conjunction with
well-known risk assessment methods (e.g., root cause analysis, failure modes
and effects analysis) to uncover systems failures both reactively and
proactively.

%X Teaching novice surgeons to attend to subtle and often misleading haptic
cues in minimally invasive surgery can be challenging. Haptic cues may even be
distracting during initial skill acquisition stage. A controlled experiment
with thirty surgical residents and attendings was conducted to test the
hypothesis that haptic feedback is more useful to the expert than novice
surgeon because of the difference in spare cognitive capacity resulting from
experience. In general, surgeons cannot perform a cognitively demanding task
and laparoscopic surgery at the same time. Haptic feedback not only enhances
performance, but counters the effect of cognitive loading, especially in
accuracy of task performance. Performance is faster with more experience. With
more spare cognitive capacity available, experienced surgeons can better take
advantage of haptic feedback to aid their performance.

%X In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon receives limited haptic feedback and
relies on visual feedback to judge the amount of force applied to tissues. It
has been shown that friction forces inherent in the instrumentation increased
the haptic perception threshold of na&iuml;ve subjects. A controlled experiment
was conducted to examine the effects of experience on force perception
threshold in a simulated tissue-probing task. Fourteen subjects participated in
a mixed design experiment, with friction, vision, and tissue softness as
independent within-subjects factors, experience as an independent
between-subjects factor, and applied force and detection time as dependent
measures. Higher thresholds and longer detection times were observed when
friction was present. Experienced surgeons applied a greater force than
novices, but were quicker to detect contact with tissue, suggesting that
experience allowed surgeons to perform more efficiently while keeping within
the limits of safety.

%X Objectives: To determine if the METI laparoscopic surgical simulator can
discriminate between novices and experts and to assess learning curves among
novices.
   Methods: Twenty novices and 5 experts performed five repetitions on the
following modules: place arrow, retract, dissect, and traverse tube. For each
module, median baseline performance was calculated. Novices performed 35
additional repetitions to assess learning with practice.
   Results: Experts out-performed novices at baseline for completion time of
the dissect, place arrow, and traverse tube modules, as well as for error
frequency on the traverse tube and retract modules. Novices' performance times
improved significantly with practice, approaching the experts' baseline in all
modules.
   Conclusion: The METI simulator exhibits construct validity on three of four
basic-skills modules when considering completion time and on two modules when
considering error frequency. Among novices, learning occurred with additional
repetitions. Whether acquired skills transfer to the actual surgical
environment has yet to be determined.

%X The use of haptic devices to provide force feedback in teleoperation has
been shown to enhance performance. An experiment was conducted to examine
whether artificial force feedback is utilized in the same manner as real force
feedback in a simulated laparoscopic tissue-probing task. Forces in probing a
double-layer silicon gel mass were replicated and exaggerated in a virtual
environment using a haptic device. Ten subjects performed the probing task in
four different conditions: 1) realistic force feedback, 2) exaggerated
feedback, 3) disproportionately exaggerated forces, and 4) reversed and
disproportionately exaggerated forces. Results showed a significantly higher
maximum force, detection time and error rate in virtual probing than in real
probing. Time to task completion was significantly different between the
virtually realistic and exaggerated force feedback conditions. These results
suggest that artificial force information may be processed differently than
real haptic information, leading to higher force application, inefficiency, and
reduced accuracy in tissue probing tasks.

%X Automaticity literature has clearly demonstrated that the mere activation of
stereotypes can have a negative impact on a perceiver's own behavior. If this
finding transfers to the context of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), it is
important to be aware of these effects and fully understand the implications.
The current study looks at the possibility that the behavioral effects of
automatic stereotype activation could occur during MIS. Specifically, will an
elderly prime result in slower performance? Participants that received the
elderly prime were slower and had more errors when completing trials after the
prime than participants that received the young prime. These results suggest
that surgical performance may be affected by stereotypes and the increased
error rates found in the elderly population may not be due solely to the
complexity of their care.

%X Many critical situations in health care correspond to difficulties in
teamwork, communication, and coordination. This study aimed at describing
differences in coordination processes of high and low performing crews during a
simulated anesthetic crisis. We coded the coordination process of 24 anesthesia
crews during a simulated crisis scenario using a predefined set of observation
categories. We compared the coordination patterns of crews with different
clinical performance levels (CPL). During the actual crisis, several
differences can be noted in the coordination processes of crews with different
CPLs. For example, higher performing crews seem to have a more centralized
coordination structure and spent less time on task management. This study
provides empirical insights into the relationship of coordination patterns and
CPLs during a simulated anesthetic crisis. A more comprehensive study including
different types of crisis situations will support the development of specific
coordination trainings to further improve performance.

%X Briefing and debriefing are common practices for safety in high risk
industries but are not systematically done in surgery. Regular debriefing of
performance after operative surgery can greatly assist surgical trainees'
development and help optimize learning from the limited time they spend in the
Operating Room (OR). We developed and tested the NOTSS (Non-Technical Skills
for Surgeons) behaviour rating system with subject matter experts. It allows
surgeons to observe trainees' behaviour in the OR and provide them with
structured feedback for improvement. This paper describes process of debriefing
and the results of a pilot usability trial. The majority of participants
reported that the NOTSS system was useful for debriefing trainees, provided a
common language to discuss non-technical skills, and was a valuable adjunct to
current assessment tools. Some surgeons found interpersonal skills more
difficult to rate than cognitive skills. 73% felt that routine use of the
system would enhance patient safety.

%X Effective communication between clinicians is a crucial component of safe
care. High-quality communication may be especially critical during care
transitions between clinicians (handoffs). In a two-year quasi-experimental
Quality Improvement project, we are using simulation learning to evaluate and
improve communication between anesthesia providers and nurses as care is
transitioned from the operating room to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).
Using a multiple baseline, staggered entry, prospective cohort design with
repeated measures, we are introducing a training intervention and evaluating
its effects on dyadic communication. The primary hypothesis is that
simulation-based communication skills training of PACU personnel will
significantly improve the quality of handoffs. Clinicians' performance is being
compared before and after their training on four dimensions of handoff
effectiveness: information transfer; use of best evidence handoff strategies;
interpersonal skills; and team behaviors. Clinicians also rate their own
handoffs. Lessons learned and results to date will be presented.

inter-professional teamwork is lacking and inter-professional team training is

describe in some detail the "Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery"
(OTAS) that our group has developed. We aim to inform the researcher or

%X Teamwork training is critical for patient safety and has been advocated for
widespread application in many settings. A key challenge for evaluating
teamwork training is measurement. Despite much effort, the team performance
instruments reported thus far suffer from a variety shortcomings that prevent
their wide application in assessing teams in real settings. Based on review of
video recorded trauma team activities in real patient care, a
multi-disciplinary research team developed an instrument based on observable
behaviors (UMTOP). A set of video clips were reviewed by 6 subject matter
experts who were requested to provide "descriptors" about the observed team
activities. The 167 collated descriptors were combined to a reduced list, which
was then sent to the subject matter experts for revision. The revised list was
then categorized into 5 areas of team performance (task and clinical
performance, leadership organization, teamwork organization, social
environment, sterile precaution). UMTOP was developed to be a tradeoff among
four criteria: ease of use, reliability, usefulness for team performance
feedback, and speed of scoring. An initial assessment of reliability was
conducted with surgeon and nursing reviewers.

%X Up to 98,000 patients die annually in U.S. hospitals due to human error.
Despite epidemiological studies demonstrating the severity of this problem it
is still unclear what the contributing factors to human error are. However, in
aviation one contributor to accidents is task interruptions. The present study
examined the frequency and impact of task interruptions in the Intensive Care
Unit.
   Observational data were collected in the ICU by shadowing nurses. During the
34 hours of observation, 1138 nurse activities were observed, of which 29.4%
were interrupted. Consequences of an interruption for the primary task can be
abandoning its completion or omissions of some of the tasks steps. The
conditional probability that an interrupted task was abandoned was p(abandoned
| interrupted)=.12, where the omission of steps of the primary task had a
conditional probability of p(omission | interrupted)=.015. A total of six cases
that created patient hazards were observed where in five of these cases an
interruption preceded directly.
   The results of the present study indicate that interruptions in the ICU are
frequent and are likely to have a negative impact on patient safety.

in health-care environments, but little research has been undertaken to better
understand how coordination occurs and how it might be improved. Using Klein's
(2001) phases of coordination this exploratory study provides a profile of the
contributions of role-based communications to team coordination in an Intensive
Care Unit. All communication events for five patients for five consecutive days
were logged and analysed using a hierarchical loglinear analysis. Nurses to
nurse communications were found to focus mainly on the planning phase of
coordination of short-term time horizons. Doctor to doctor communication events
were characterized as formal and involved the planning and direction phases of
team coordination and informal nurse to doctor communication events focused on
planning and team assessment phases of coordination. Further analysis is
required to determine how these contributions interact and what the
vulnerabilities might be.

%X Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a technology in the context of
the distributed system in which it is working is critical to assessing and
improving the performance of that system. Taking a systems approach requires
knowledge about how all agents in a system work together to achieve the goals
of that system. With these aims, the alerting mechanism of infusion pumps
containing Dose-Error Reduction Software (DERS) was studied to determine its
effectiveness in the Intensive Care Units (ICU's) of three hospitals. In 1,146
of the 9,557 pump alerts (12.0%), the alert caused the clinician to change the
input. Of these, 1,030 were changed to within the hospital's recommended dosing
limits. The alert was overridden for 8,400 (88.0%) of the alerts. The data show
that this technology successfully informed clinicians over 1000 times that
unintended doses had been inputted and stopped those doses from reaching the
patient, thereby averting potential Medication Events. The data also suggest
that, because nearly 90% of the alerts were overridden, a well-intended and
valuable alert may be perceived by the clinicians as a false alarm and may be
overlooked. Another key finding from this analysis was that clinicians may have
used potentially unsafe workarounds to administer intravenous drug boluses
(i.e., more rapid infusion of a defined dose or volume) and to keep the
patient's line active between infusions. In a separate parallel study,
clinician self-report of potentially harmful medication events was studied.
During 559 hours of direct observation, clinicians detected 27 (IV and non-IV)
medication events. All of the reported events were outside of the scope of what
DERS technology was designed to detect. In addition, during the same time
period the technology detected five potentially harmful IV medication events
that the clinicians did not report. The results of these two studies indicate
two possible classes of solutions that could reduce the impact and likelihood
of medication administration errors. One class of solutions involves the
procedures and policies of the hospital, ensuring that process and technology
implementations are optimally tuned, taking human performance and the current
practice of the clinicians into account. The other class of solutions involves
using new strategies and technologies to ensure that each system agent has
access to other agents' perspectives, and the broader system's perspective.
Studies such as these can provide insight into the use of safety technology
during critical care processes and provide direction for future research,
including more effective design of alerting mechanisms of ICU devices.

%X Miller and Sanderson (2003b) presented promising results for a prototype
clinical information design developed according to Ecological Interface Design
principles, but the size of the prototype made it impractical for onscreen
display. This paper replicates the previous study using an onscreen
presentation of the original EID divided according to functional systems. As in
the original study, nurses' ability to detect patient change events was
enhanced using the onscreen EID. However, there are differences between
doctors' performance using the original and using the onscreen EID. Unlike the
original participants, doctors were better able to agree about physiological
systems failure, but also unlike the original participants, showed no
significant differences in their ability to agree about the patients' current
diagnostic state using the onscreen EID or conventional charts. This later
ability is clinically more important. It was concluded that while dividing the
original EID had no appreciable effect on nurses and enhanced some abilities
among doctors, this was at the expense of more clinically significant
abilities. It may be necessary to rethink the appropriateness of limited
real-estate, office style computer terminals in intensive care units.

%X Up to 98,000 patients die annually in U.S. hospitals due to human error. One
of the areas where error occurs frequently is the Intensive Care Unit. Despite
the impact of error, there is very little work that attempts to identify the
human factors contributors to error in the ICU. The current study used the
framework of error producing conditions to identify factors that are
contributing to error. By modifying the method of assessing error producing
conditions we were able to identify the extent to which individual conditions
contribute to the prevalence of error. Also, we were able to identify the
contribution certain devices have in the prevalence of error. Most importantly,
the most critical devices for patient care were also identified as the ones
that were rated the highest in their prevalence of error producing conditions
and potential for hazard. Thus, developing medical devices that are reducing
the device related potential for patient harm has to be a main goal for future
patient safety work. This is a challenge sound human factors engineering should
answer.

%X Quality improvement collaboratives (QIC) are widely used for seeking
improvements in healthcare quality and safety. Nevertheless, the effectiveness
of QICs is variable. In order to support research that identifies critical
elements in running a successful collaborative, we fill a conceptual gap by
moving towards a functional model of QICs. Specifically, we define how QICs are
distinct from traditional quality improvement teams, conceptualize how primary
and secondary functions are accomplished in a means-ends framework, and
illustrate how the functions are dynamically accomplished in a series of
meetings by nested teams within a collaborative. Finally, we discuss
distinctions among QICs.

%X Objective: Design a protocol for conducting preoperative briefings within
the context of cardiovascular surgery.
   Method: A combined questionnaire and semi-structured focus group approach
involving four subspecialties of surgical staff (n = 47) was conducted to
gather information concerning (1) attitudes towards preoperative briefings, (2)
logistical issues related to the conduct and content of briefings and (3)
potential barriers that might impede implementation.
   Results: Analyses revealed consensus among surgical staff concerning
briefing benefits (majority were very positive), duration (&lt; 10 min),
location (in the OR), content (procedure, patient, and equipment issues) and
potential barriers (staff availability, attitudes, case scheduling, and lack of
resources). Differences in opinions arose concerning timing of the brief (e.g.,
before vs. after patient enters OR) and the role of key participants.
   Discussion: A prototype checklist for conducting preoperative briefings was
developed based on these results. Additional research is needed to implement
and validate its effectiveness.

%X The paucity of reliable measures of team coordination and performance
significantly obstructs the assessment of the effects of any technology on
teams to improve decision making in health care. A pilot study was conducted to
determine if measures of coordination and performance could be developed for
teams involved in trauma resuscitation. A video assisted review of cases
enabled evaluation of the use of the tools. Descriptors of coordination were
derived from Klein's five-stage model of team coordination. A scoring system of
team performance was developed from the University of Maryland Team Observable
Performance Metric (UMTOP). After some modification both coordination and
performance could be described. However, four defined stages of resuscitation
were observed which greatly improved coding. More rigorous assessments of these
tools will be required before firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects
of a decision support tool recently introduced into the environment.

%X Older adults' medication nonadherence is an important patient safety issue.
Adherence depends on plans that instantiate treatment guidelines in the context
of patients' daily lives, but the ability to create successful plans is often
undercut by poor collaboration between providers and patients. We investigated
whether external aids can support the provider/patient collaboration needed to
create effective plans for taking multiple medications. We tested whether an
external aid that was designed to reduce cognitive load associated with
collaborative problem solving (("medtable") was more effective than an
unstructured aid (blank paper) in a simulated patient/provider collaboration
task. Findings suggested that pairs of older adults worked together more
efficiently to create accurate schedules when using the medtable.

%X Responding to medical emergencies quickly and effectively is essential. In
remote or hostile environments, fully trained medical personnel are not always
available, so clear and effective guidance is required. This paper reports a
comparison of paper-based and computer-based checklists for just-in-time
training for medical emergencies. In a between-subjects experiment, untrained
participants carried out an emergency airway management task on a patient
simulator either using a paper-based checklist with text and still images or
using a computer-based checklist that included identical text plus video clips.
Participants using the computer-based checklist performed significantly faster
and more proficiently than those using the paper checklist. Subjective
usability and preference measures were also superior for computer checklist.
The results suggest the clear superiority of the computer-based checklist for
untrained responders. We discuss which aspects of the computer-based checklist
may contribute to its superiority.

%X A study was conducted to assess the impact of two different drug label
layouts on pharmacy practitioners' ability to correctly extract critical
information. Labels were shown to 43 participants under time-pressure
conditions, using tachistoscopic presentation. The two layouts did not differ
in terms of recognition accuracy, and the anticipated interference between two
label elements, dosage strength and net quantity (number of tablets/capsules),
when located in close proximity to each other, was not observed. Successive
reduction in exposure time (200, 100 and 50 ms) resulted in an increased dosage
strength recognition error rate, but the effect was independent of the distance
between the dosage strength and net quantity. Possible explanations, as well as
the benefit of using tachistoscopic presentation to assess the impact of design
changes on user performance are discussed.

protocols and tests the hypothesis that if current processes for completing
these tasks are neither easy nor useful, or if there is dissatisfaction with
the tasks, then violations will be more likely. Survey data were collected from
199 nurses in the pediatric intensive care units,
hematology-oncology-transplant units, and medical-surgical units at two
pediatric hospitals. The results of the logistic regressions did not support
the hypothesis, though several significant predictors of violations were found.
The predictors of violations, possible reasons the hypotheses were not

%X In this paper we outline considerations that went into designing and
executing a full-scale simulator-based summative evaluation of four different
display configurations for presenting information about anesthetized patients
to an anesthesiologist. Although patient simulators appear to provide a
"natural laboratory" for evaluating medical device innovations and equipment
interface concepts, the software underlying patient simulators can be unequal
to the challenges posed by the need for good representation of patient
physiology and good experimental control. Moreover, the opportunities that
full-scale patient simulators can offer for completely interactive,
event-driven scenarios can present problems for experimental control and can
promote participant hypervigilance. We describe the design of our experimental
scenarios, the challenges our scenarios posed for simulator software and how we
overcame those challenges, the design of a distractor task, and the methodology
used to ensure we collected behavioral data sensitive to the manipulations of
interest. Our adaptations in the face of challenges posed by the full-scale
simulator context let us design an experiment that was highly informative about
the advantages and disadvantages of the display configurations of interest.

used the internet to answer questions about diabetes. Questions were designed
to be difficult, require reasoning, and lack a single, integrated source with a
packaged answer. Here we report on case analyses of one individual with high
and one with low domain knowledge. Domain knowledge influenced activity in
multiple respects, including initial orienting to the task and supplying facts

%X Designing systems, interfaces, procedures and artifacts in simulated
environments before they are developed and deployed has the potential to
greatly decrease the costs of design and development and, in some cases, can
provide significant safety advantages. Creating realistic models of humans is
an important aspect of the modeling problem, but existing models tend to model
typical humans and fail to account for the significant differences seen from
person to person or even by the same person in different circumstances. In the
modeling literature, models of the factors that lead to such differences
(including personality, affect, training, etc.) are typically called behavior
moderators or performance moderators. This paper describes the MINDS (Modeling
INdividual Differences and Stressors) project, which builds on previous work in
behavior moderator modeling by supporting richer representations of moderators,
moderator dynamics, and moderator interactions and by providing
moderator-integration approaches for common behavior-modeling technologies,
including production rules, fuzzy logic, and Bayesian networks. We provide a
demonstration scenario from a military-operation domain.

%X Given the importance of Situation Awareness (SA) in military operations,
there is a critical need for a real-time, unobtrusive tool that objectively and
reliably measures warfighters' SA in both training and operations. Just as the
requirement for improved access to SA measures has become vital, it is now
commonplace for military team communications to be mediated by technology,
hence easily captured and available for analysis. We believe that team
communications can be used to derive SA measures. To address this issue, we are
developing the Automated Communications Analysis of Situation Awareness (ACASA)
system. ACASA combines the explanatory capacity of the SA construct with the
predictive and computational power of TeamPrints, to assess team and shared SA
as well as other cognitive processes. TeamPrints is a system that combines
computational linguistics and machine learning techniques coupled with Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) to analyze team communication. In this paper, we
present the findings from an exploratory evaluation of how well TeamPrints
predicts SA from the team communications arising during a military training
exercise.

%X A two module computational model of situation awareness is presented. One
module, characterizing stage 1 (noticing) SA is based on the SEEV model of
selective attention in complex environments, and consists of components of
Salience (capturing attention), Effort (inhibiting attention movement),
Expectancy (for events along a channel) and Value (of attending those events).
These are combined additively, and accurately predict visual scanning on the
flight deck and in driving. The second module characterizing stage 2
(understanding) SA, results from the integration of noticed information, and
its decay if unattended. We describe briefly the application and validation of
the attention module to pilot scanning of the synthetic vision system display
suite in aviation, and in more detail, the application to predicting
differences in situation awareness supported by three formats of a wake vortex
display, designed to alert aircraft pilots to dangers in the flight path ahead.

next-generation capabilities. To do this, we will concentrate on four different
domain areas. These are: academic use of cognitive modeling, cognitive model
development, neuroscience-related issues, and practical applications of
cognitive modeling.

%X The objective of this study was to assess the use of a computational
cognitive model for describing human performance with an adaptively automated
system, with and without advance cueing of control mode transitions. A
dual-task piloting simulation was developed to collect human performance data
under auditory cueing or no cueing of automated or manual control. GOMSL models
for simulating user behavior were constructed based on a theory of increased
memory transactions at mode transitions. The models were applied to the same
task simulation and scenarios performed by the humans. Comparison of results on
human and model output demonstrated the model to be generally descriptive of
performance; however, it was not accurate in predicting timing of memory use in
preparing for manual control. Interestingly, the human data didn't reveal
differences between cued and no cue trials. A refined GOMSL model was developed
by modifying assumptions on the timing and manner of memory use, and
considering human parallel processing in dual-task performance. Results
revealed the refined model to be more plausible for representing behavior.
Computational cognitive modeling appears to be a viable approach to represent
operator performance in adaptive systems.

%X Earlier, Zhang and Feyen (2005) proposed a qualitative framework for
predicting how people working in a multitasking scenario switch between
concurrent tasks with dynamically changing priorities. This paper describes a
validation study of a computational model derived from this framework.
Utilizing a general hierarchy of prioritization rules suggested by a companion
empirical study, a model of a multiple task scenario built using a queueing
network approach was compared to the empirical results. On all metrics
considered, no means were found significantly different and the model
replicated all but one of 54 task sequences demonstrated by human subjects.
Comparisons to similar models utilizing only single prioritization rules
revealed that the general hierarchy yielded substantially better predictions.

%X Anderson and Lebiere's (1998) modeling system ACT-R (Adaptive Control of
Thought -- Rational) has been a leading contributor to advances in cognitive
science. Despite the modeling system's success there are areas in which it may
be improved. The present research advocates a suggested approach to improving
ACT-R's predictive capacity by using EEG (electroencephalography) latency data
to predict the time it takes to achieve certain mental steps. A model is
presented which successfully represents EEG data from a simple auditory
experiment. Implications of this modeling approach to ACT-R and to the field of
cognitive science are discussed.

%X Systematic errors in routine procedural tasks present an important problem
for psychologists who study interactions between humans and technological
systems. This paper details an experiment designed to examine systematic error
patterns and evaluate error predictions made by a notable psychological theory
and industry-standard usability tools when performing multiple routine
procedural tasks on a single highly visual interface. Participants completed
three dynamic, computer-based routine procedural tasks involving execution of
multiple steps. Differences were found in error frequencies at particular steps
between the three tasks, a result that is consistent with predictions derived
from Altmann and Trafton's (2002) activation-based model of memory for goals,
but contrary to those of usability guidelines. Error patterns were reminiscent
of several familiar types of systematic error.

%X Error reporting systems have been around for many decades, in domains such
as aerospace, with great success. In contrast, domains such as health care have
resisted broad-based systems, due in part to cultural issues and fear of
litigation. A recurring issue in the development of all of these systems is
usability. Usability affects the development, growth, usage, and sustainability
of error-reporting systems in many ways. As these systems migrate to the
Internet and become more broadly accessible, usability will become a dominant
factor in system success. Whether the system is publicly accessible,
Intranet-based behind a company firewall, or semi-private and managed through a
government agency or non-governmental organization, some usability issues will
apply to all systems and others will shift in importance. This paper applies an
existing knowledge management model to the analysis of error reporting systems,
highlighting the significant impact and necessity of usability on the success
of error-reporting systems, using examples from a variety of domains.

%X Collaborative media are the most rapidly expanding form of communication in
the business and user domains. Channels such as blogs, social networks, and
file sharing sites present exciting opportunities for satisfying consumers'
needs for information, entertainment, and commerce. The objective of this
research was to determine the effects of interface design and context of use on
performance and preference with the most common collaborative media channel,
the web log. Design manipulations modified the amount of information presented
on each page in two orthogonal ways to vary the amount of navigation required
to access desired content. Contextual manipulations modified the subject domain
of the content, the specificity of the tasks that users were assigned, and the
time pressure placed on the user to browse the content. The effects of these
manipulations were assessed by measuring the time users spent navigating the
site and several measures of performance in an immediate recall test. All of
the manipulations affected user performance in a variety of ways. Insights for
the design of collaborative media are provided.

%X Spatial Visualization Ability is a determinant of performance efficiency on
website navigation tasks. It is unclear, however, why this is the case; though
the spatial metaphor for web "navigation" is popular, it is not accurate. We
put forth a hypothesis that strategy use is another important component of web
navigation efficiency that relates to Spatial Visualization Ability. To
investigate this hypothesis, we designed a series of experiments using numeric
indicators instead of verbal labels in model websites. We then characterized
the strategies that participants used on each website into categories based on
their resemblance to prototype strategies. We found that, though strategy
choice does not seem to depend on Spatial Visualization Ability, precise
implementation does seem to depend to some degree on Spatial Visualization
Ability.

%X Mean rule has been popularly used to aggregate consumer ratings of online
products. This study applied social choice theory to evaluate the Condorcet
efficiency of the mean rule, and to investigate the effect of sample size
(number of voters) on the agreement or disagreement between the mean and
majority rules. The American National Election Survey data (1968) were used,
where three candidates competed for the presidency, and the numerical
thermometer scores were provided for each candidate. Random sampling data with
varied sample sizes were drew from the survey, and then were aggregated
according to the majority rule, the mean rule, and other social choice rules.
The results show that the sample winner of the mean rule agrees with the sample
majority winner very well; as sample size increases, the sample mean rule even
converges faster to the correct population majority winner and ordering than
does the sample majority rule. The implications for using aggregation rules for
online product rating were also discussed.

%X Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to competencies in processing and
managing emotion that may be important in security settings; facial emotions
may betray criminals and terrorists. This study tested the hypothesis that high
EI relates to superior detection and processing of facial emotion, in relation
to two tasks: controlled visual search for designated facial emotions, and
identification of micro-expressions of emotion. Participants completed scales
for EI, as well as cognitive intelligence, personality, and coping. EI failed
to predict performance on either task, contrary to the initial hypothesis.
However, performance related to higher cognitive intelligence, the personality
trait of openness, and use of task-focused coping. These measures related to
faster visual search, and to greater accuracy in detecting facial
micro-expressions. Practical considerations suggest selecting security agents
who are high in conventional rather than emotional intelligence, and training
use of task-focused coping. However, EI may be useful for selecting
stress-tolerant agents.

%X Responses to a brief six-min screening battery involving high-workload
tracking, verbal working memory, and line discrimination tasks were used to
predict subsequent performance on a 36-min cognitive vigilance task. Two
predictors of interest were subjective state, as indexed by the Dundee Stress
State Questionnaire (DSSQ), and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), measured
via transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. The results testify to the importance
of assessing task-induced responses for predicting cognitive vigilance
performance. They also indicate that forecasting vigilance performance is a
complex endeavor requiring a set of multidimensional predictors. Specifically,
higher post-battery task engagement scores on the DSSQ in this study and higher
levels of CBFV during performance of the screening battery predicted more
correct detections on the subsequent vigilance task. These findings are
interpreted in the light of the resource-workload model of vigilance, and their
practical significance is discussed.

%X Each year the military loses hundreds of millions of dollars invested in
enlistees whom never make it to their first duty station. Investigators have
reported that the transition process from civilian to military in basic combat
training tends to be very stressful and anxiety provoking for enlistees.
However, little data have been gathered to assess the relationship of
enlistees' stress levels and their attrition rate. A study was conducted of 155
Soldiers during their nine-week basic combat training at Fort Jackson, South
Carolina. It was hypothesized that enlistees with higher levels of stress would
also have a higher level of depression and hostility resulting in performance
degradation. The results showed a statistically significant positive
relationship among perceived stress, hostility and depression levels;
furthermore, participants who were able to modify their coping mechanism tended
to be more confident in successfully completing training and less likely to
receive disciplinary action.

%X Gender differences exist, but the strength and importance of those
differences is debatable. This study examined differences in performance among
men (n = 64) and women (n = 56) on 14 neuro-cognitive temporal tasks. No adult
norms exist for these tasks. Therefore, the goals were to 1) record and compare
scores achieved by men and women, and 2) investigate differences in terms of
performance (grade point average and physical fitness score) during Army Health
Care Specialist Advanced Individual Training (AIT). Descriptive statistics and
t-tests identified and compared scores by gender, while IM scores and
performance relationships were explored with Pearson product-moment
correlations and regression analysis. Men's temporal responses were closer to
the reference beat than women's on 14.3% of tasks (p&lt; 0.05). There were no
significant relationships between temporal responses and physical fitness
performance scores and only two correlations between temporal responses and
grade point average (right hand tapping, Task Average and Super Right On
(percent within &plusmn;15ms of the target beat) (r = 0.189, p = 0.04; and r =
0.20, p = 0.03). While this research upheld findings of differences between men

%X Traditional usability measures such as effectiveness, efficiency, and
satisfaction may not fully describe usability across domains and user groups.
Qualitative Grounded Theory analysis was employed to study children assembling
toys from pictorial instructions. The resulting model showed that usability
problems can have a striking impact beyond just performance, affecting the
user's self-efficacy, particularly among girls who tend to use internal
attributions and equate difficulty with low ability. Without sufficient
self-efficacy, the child will likely choose not to engage with assembly tasks
and may regard him or herself as inadequately skilled in that area. Usability
professionals should consider adding self-efficacy measures to provide more
complete assessments.

%X Typing styles vary among keyboard users; however few studies have
investigated the association between typing style and typing speed. The purpose
of this paper is to describe the differences in typing speed between typists
who rarely assume extreme postures of the wrist, hands, and fingers with
typists who often assume extreme postures. The paper also examines the
association between other typing behaviors, such as using a wrist support, and
typing speed. Forty computer users were videotaped while typing a standardized
text. Their typing postures were rated using the Keyboard Personal Computer
Style instrument (K-PeCS). One-way ANOVA's were used to compare typing speed
between the rating levels of several items on the K-PeCS. Results suggest that
those who frequently isolate their 5{sup:th} digit are significantly faster
than those who always isolate their 5{sup:th} digit. Subjects who "float" their
wrists, translate their wrist/hands, do not change pronation angles, use
moderate to high force, and use more digits appear to type faster than those
who do not.

%X Although alternative keyboards offer ergonomic benefits over the standard
keyboard, the standard QWERTY keyboard is still the most widely used. This
study was performed to quantify learning rate percentages for four alternative
keyboards (chord, contoured split, Dvorak, and fixed split) and understand how
physical, cognitive, and perceptual demands affect learning rate by quantifying
these measures. Sixteen proficient typists participated in five, three-sentence
typing trials on each alternative keyboard, and nine additional subjects
participated in 20 typing trials on one alternative keyboard. Time-to-complete
and error percentage were collected after every trial, and subsequent learning
rates were calculated. Results demonstrated that the learning rate for the
fixed split keyboard was significantly different from the learning rates for
the other three keyboards. Learning rate negatively correlated to all types of
demand (physical, cognitive, and perceptual), so learning rate was slower with
higher demand, regardless of the type of demand. Many alternative keyboards
have been shown to have ergonomic benefits, and the results of this study would
indicate that the learning rates associated with some of the keyboard designs
are such that they can easily be implemented into the workplace without
long-term productivity decrements.

Web-based tools offer a way for users in large organizations to perform an
initial assessment and routine adjustment of their workstations, allowing the
ergonomist to focus on more detailed cases. Twelve male and eight female
subjects used a web-based tool to adjust two standard workstations. The tool
presented information using text, animation and color coding to accommodate as
many learning styles as possible. Afterwards, an ergonomist, blinded to the
adjustments made previously, adjusted each workstation for the subject. Subject
adjustments agreed with the ergonomist's for chair height, seat pan depth,
armrest height, monitor depth and keyboard tray height with moderate
correlation values and mean errors of less than 1.35 cm. The results indicate
computer users are able to adjust their own workstations following this type of

%X This study evaluated the effects of handle grip span and user's hand size on
maximum grip strength and individual finger force using a computerized digital
dynamometer with five various grip spans (45, 50, 55, 60, and 65mm). Forty-six
males participated and were assigned into three hand size groups (small,
middle, large) according to their hand lengths. Results showed that generally
55 and 50mm grip spans had the highest grip strength (433.6N and 430.8N,
respectively), whereas 65mm grip span had the least grip strength. With respect
to the interaction effect of grip span and hand size, small hand sized
participants produced the highest grip forces at the 45mm grip span, followed
by 50 and 55mm, middle hand size participants provided the highest grip force
at the 55mm followed by 50 and 45mm, whereas large hand size participants
exerted the highest grip force at the 55mm followed by 60mm. In the analysis of
individual finger force, the middle finger force was the strongest and the
highest contribution (37.5%) to the total finger force, followed by ring
(28.7%), index (20.2%) and little (13.6%) fingers. In addition, it was noted
that each finger had a different optimal grip span for exerting maximum force,
resulting in a bowed contoured shaped handle (i.e., the grip span of the handle
at the center is larger than that of the handle at the end) for two-handle hand
tools.

%X A 3-dimensional kinematic model of the hand was developed. The model
predicts hand posture using a simple contact algorithm, which detects a contact
between hand segments and the object. Using the 3-dimensional kinematic model
of the hand, we estimated grasp envelopes because the space requirement for a
specific task is an important aspect to be considered in the task's design
stage. For this purpose, two hose insertion methods -- a straight method and a
rotation method -- were simulated. The simulation results were compared
favorably with the experimental studies by the previous researches. The model
can be used to estimate grasp envelopes for varying hand sizes, object sizes,
object shapes, and grip types. The model gives useful and practical information
about the grasp envelope to the engineers who design parts or work space.

%X Existing epidemiological evidence suggests that localized muscle fatigue
might be considered as an intrinsic risk factor that causes lack of balance
control leading to falls. The goal of the study was to examine how localized
muscle fatigue of the knee joint (quadriceps) alters gait parameters that are
related to slip propensity. Sixteen healthy young participants were recruited
to walk across a vinyl floor surface in two different sessions (Fatigue and No
fatigue). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using a three-dimensional
video analysis system and force plates during both sessions. The fatigue
session results indicated a substantial increase in heel contact velocity (HCV)
and required coefficient of friction (RCOF), as well as a decrease in the
transitional acceleration of the whole body COM (TA), walking velocity (WV),
and step length (SL). In addition, a positive correlation was observed between
RCOF and HCV. These findings provide new insights into the biomechanical
relationship between localized muscular fatigue and gait parameters linked with
slip propensity. The study concluded that localized muscular fatigue affects

%X Local dynamic stability was investigated during quiet upright stance with
respect to age and altered sensory conditions. From center of pressure (COP)
trajectories, the largest Lyapunov exponent (&lambda;{sub:max}) was extracted
to directly parameterize local dynamic stability, and the reliability of
&lambda;{sub:max} was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient
(ICC). Thirty two participants volunteered for upright quiet stance trials.
Vision and somatosenstaion were experimentally altered: vision was modified by
eye closure, and somatosensation by using both a hard surface (HS) and a soft
surface (SS). Age and vision had main effects on &lambda;{sub:ma}, and the age
x vision and vision x surface interaction effects were also significant. In
general, older participants were less stable (i.e., higher &lambda;{sub:max})
than younger, and altered sensory information resulted in a decrease in
stability. Reliability was higher for older versus younger participants. Use of
&lambda;{sub:max} enabled a direct assessment of age-related differences in
local dynamic stability and effects of altered sensory conditions. Such
non-linear measures can provide additional information to that available from
traditional COP-based analyses.

%X Slip-initiated falls often cause occupational injuries and deaths,
especially in older workers. Previous slips and falls research has to a large
extent focused on lower extremity reactions, yet arm responses are often part
of postural reactions to such perturbations. It is unclear if arm responses
play a role in balance recovery, are modulated by the severity of the postural
perturbation and/or are a reflex-type response, e.g. reaching for external body
support. In this study, the relationship between slip severity and shoulder
biomechanics was examined. Subjects (17 younger and 12 older adults) were
exposed to two conditions: (1) baseline dry (subjects knew the floor was dry),
and (2) unexpected slip (a diluted glycerol solution was spread on the floor to
slip the leading/left foot). Bilateral sagittal plane kinematics and kinetics
were derived. Slip severity was quantified using a measure of slip
hazardousness based on the peak slip velocity (PSV) measured at the heel of the
slipping foot. Specifically, if PSV &ge; 1 m/s, then the slip was classified as
hazardous. Although arm responses were bilateral, only the biomechanics of the
shoulder ipsilateral to the slipping foot, specifically moment generation rate,
were affected by slip hazardousness. Specifically, a hazardous slip was
associated with an extensor moment at the shoulder ipsilateral to the slipping
foot, whereas a non-hazardous slip was associated with a flexor moment.
Shoulder responses were triggered later than the hip and knee response based on
moment onset data. Finally, overall, older adults appeared to generate a
greater extensor moment at the shoulder compared to the response seen in the
younger group of participants. In conclusion, evidence presented in this study
implies that (1) arm responses play a role in balance recovery but also may be
protective in nature when experiencing a severe slip, (2) a legs-to-arms
response sequence appears to drive the reaction to a slip, and (3) older adults
may use their arms as a protective strategy to a greater extent than their
younger counterparts.

%X Occupational load carrying tasks are considered one of the major factors
contributing to slip and fall injuries. The objective of the current study was
to explore the feasibility to assess the stability changes associated with load
carrying by local dynamic stability measures. Twenty-five young participants
were involved in a treadmill walking study, with their trunk acceleration
profiles measured wirelessly by a tri-axial accelerometer. Finite time local
dynamic stability was quantified by maximum Lyapunov exponents (maxLE). The
results showed a significant increase in long term maxLE in load condition,
indicating the declined local dynamic stability due to the load carrying. Thus,
current study confirmed the discriminative validity and sensitivity of local
dynamic stability measure and its utility in the load carrying scenario.

%X The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of obesity on the
maximum acceptable weights of lift (MAWL) Two obesity levels were considered:
non-obese (18.5 kg/m{sup:2}&le;BMI&le;24.9 kg/m{sup:2}) and extremely obese
(BMI&ge;40 kg/m{sup:2}). Each obesity level had 10 male participants. The
participants determined their MAWL for 18 different lifting task conditions (6
lifting frequencies x 3 lifting heights). An ANOVA was conducted to determine
the effects of obesity level, lifting height, lifting frequency and their
interactions on MAWL. In general, the ANOVA results revealed that obesity does
not reduce MAWL. This indicates that there may not be a need to develop new
psychophysical lifting limits for the obese worker population. However, in
order to develop comprehensive lifting limit guidelines for the obese worker
population, future studies should investigate the biomechanical and
physiological based lifting tolerance limits for them.

%X Many existing optimization based biomechanical models fail to predict
antagonist muscle activity. Some optimization models predict such a
cocontraction, but either lack a compelling physiological basis or are
computationally formidable. The current study takes advantage of the flexible
definition of entropy as a scientific measure, and utilizes it in the objective
function of an optimization formulation to construct a new optimization model
for predicting agonist and antagonist muscle forces. In this model, the
objective function of a nonlinear program consists of a weighted sum of two
components: a linear or nonlinear term favoring agonist muscle exertions
(reciprocal inhibition), and the entropy term enforcing cocontraction. The
concept of the current optimization model is based on recent findings in
neurophysiology that there exist two separate central nervous systems for
generation of two motor patterns: agonist contraction and agonist-antagonist
cocontraction.

%X Posture and external loads such as hand forces have a dominant effect on
ergonomic analysis outcomes. Accurate job analyses require accurate
representation of working postures and knowledge of external loads. The effects
of hand force location, magnitude, and direction on whole-body posture for
standing tasks were quantified in a motion-capture study of 20 men and women
with widely varying body size. A subset of the data was analyzed to study the
relationship between hand force direction and posture during two-handed pushing
tasks performed with and without a constraint on hand force direction. Analyses
demonstrated that force direction is a significant determinant of posture, and
that pushing postures are consistent with several biomechanical principles.

%X Awkward trunk postures and dynamic trunk movements are associated with
increased risk of low back disorders (LBDs). Recent advancements in computing
and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have resulted in high
precision, compact, and relatively inexpensive commercial orientation sensors
that address the workplace usage limitations of the most common kinematics
measurement methods (video analysis, magnetic field sensors, and
electrogoniometers). The purpose of this study is to review the available
body-fixed orientation sensing technology for its use in ergonomics research
and practice. A laboratory study of a custom MEMS accelerometer-based
inclinometer highlights issues of axial orientation, vibration, and
non-gravitational acceleration that affect orientation results from basic
inclinometers. Techniques are presented for correcting for such issues in
advanced sensors using computational methods and combinations of MEMS
accelerometers, gyroscopes, and/or magnetometers. Body-fixed orientation
sensors provide enhanced opportunities to identify and reduce harmful work
postures that may reduce the prevalence and severity of work-related
musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).

%X Identification of spine tolerances has typically involved the complete
destruction of functional spinal units in order to confirm an endplate
fracture. A new method of identifying endplate fractures utilizing the
measurement of acceleration response through accelerometers mounted to the
functional spinal unit was tested on porcine spines. Functional spinal units
were mechanically tested to failure using a cyclic loading protocol modeled
after the expected loading during a lifting task. Over 80% of the segments had
visible endplate fractures upon dissection. Trends in acceleration profiles
revealed increased accelerations when specimens failed, with more pronounced
trends in the specimens that had visible cracks after dissection. While further
analysis is necessary, the results do point to some level of shift in the
biomechanical responses within the vertebral body meaning the methodology may
have the potential to identify endplate structural breakdown prior to ultimate
failure.

workers were assessed wearing the moment monitor. The moment monitor measures
static and dynamic mass of the boxes as well as the trunk kinematics and moment
arms of each manual material handling exertion. The moment monitor analysis
software distinguishes between lifting, lowering, pushing/pulling exertions.
Paired comparison between lifting and lowering were performed on 163 workers.
The results showed no differences in static mass or moment whereas the dynamic
z force and dynamic moment were significantly greater for lifting. Trunk
kinematic results showed greater sagittal velocity for lifting compared to
lowering but greater lateral velocity for lowering compared to lifting.

%X A new dynamometer has been designed that enables the capture of multiple
grip force vectors in a single squeeze. The thumb is completely isolated in the
measurement ensuring these vectors are a result of only forces produced only by
the long fingers. The measured force vectors can be resolved to find the
overall grip force magnitude and direction if a simple measure of grip force is
desired. Alternatively, due to the ability of the dynamometer to easily measure
multiple vector magnitudes and angles, the instrument lends itself well to the
collection of grip data to be used as input into a hand biomechanical model. An
experiment was conducted to measure the maximum grip exertions of sixteen
subjects on a series of cylindrical handles and this data was used for the
model. The results demonstrated that the model can be implemented and that
tendon tension, when normalized by grip force, continues to increase as handle
size increases even though grip force magnitudes decrease.

%X Construction workers performing drywall installation are exposed to a
variety of ergonomic hazards, including heavy material handling, repetitive
motions and awkward postures. The rates of musculoskeletal injuries and
disorders among drywall installers are very high, especially at the low back
and shoulder. The unique characteristics of the work environment in the
construction industry do not allow for applying objective ergonomic assessment
instruments. Thus, biomechanical models and computer simulations were combined
for a more comprehensive evaluation of ergonomic hazards. Utilizing Monte-Carlo
simulation to generate the input for biomechanical models based on information
from PATH (Posture, Activity, Tools, and Handling), a work-sampling based
approach, the present study estimated the required muscle contraction forces
and joint reaction forces at the low back and shoulder during a simulated
8-hour drywall installation workday. The results of this study also provided a
database for future evaluations of ergonomic interventions on drywall
installation work.

%X Objective: A study was conducted to measure the effect that restricted hand
access had on perceived difficulty ratings during simulated hose insertion
tasks.
   Background: Insertion tasks have been identified by workers as physically
demanding. Spatial limitations around the flange may affect the ability of the
workers to successfully perform the insertion task.
   Methods: Six male and six female subjects pushed a rubber hose onto a
stationary flange under conditions of limited hand access during simulated
insertions.
   Results: The highest difficulty ratings were recorded when an obstruction
was lateral to the flange. The overall difficulty rating was positively
correlated with posture and force ratings.
   Conclusion: The location and number of obstructions is an important factor
in how the subjects perceived the difficulty of the task.
   Application: The results of this study can be applied to the future design
of insertion-type tasks and methodologies for subjectively assessing hand
clearance.

associations between upper trapezius muscle activity, as estimated with several
summary measures obtained from surface electromyography (EMG), and
self-reported neck/shoulder pain among a sample of 231 manufacturing workers.
EMG methods used in this study included mean root-mean-square amplitude, the
amplitude probability distribution function (APDF), EMG gaps analysis, and
clustered exposure variation analysis. The observed seven-day prevalence of
neck/shoulder pain was 13.9%. Of the EMG summary measures, only the 90{sup:th}
percentile of the APDF was significantly associated with symptoms, with crude
and adjusted odds ratios of 2.57 (1.02-6.49) and 2.78 (1.07-7.21) per natural
log unit, respectively. This study was largely inconclusive due to the
similarity in the distributions of the summary measures between symptomatic and
nonsymptomatic participants, and explicit measures of posture and repetition
may produce stronger associations with symptoms.

approach or goal setting is effective in promoting "healthy computing" and
reducing self-reported computer-related musculoskeletal discomfort. One hundred

participate in the study for three months. Pilot results suggest that over 26%
of the students self-report musculoskeletal discomfort with notebook computer
use. Students who self-reported general discomfort typed significantly faster
as compared to students who typed at a slower average weekly rate.
Participatory ergonomics training that involved the participants in planning,
developing, and implementing ergonomic solutions to notebook computer
workstations and the use of peripherals, i.e., keyboard and mouse significantly
improved students' "healthy computing" as compared to the control group.

%X Alignment is defined as the proper positioning or adjustment of resources in
relation to each other. Organization alignment involves aligning many different
levels of an organization and its business segments to allow more accurate
predictability of organization performance. To align an organization requires
consideration of many different levels of vertical and lateral alignment of
processes, resources, and information. Alignment research involves interaction
implications, level of coordination implications, and geographic implications
as well as resource and information need, and resource and information
generation. One of the challenges of alignment is directly connecting
deficiencies to their underlying issues. This is due to the weak link between
organization metrics of performance and alignment factors. This study discusses
issues that alignment alleviates in reference to process efficiency, procedure
errors, operator errors, knowledge loss, and forecasting.

has increased due to early detection and treatment improvements. Of the
estimated 10.5 million cancer survivors in the United States, approximately 40%
are of working age (NCI, 2006). Unfortunately, one out of five survivors
experience cancer-related disabilities that affect employment. Survivors may
experience long-term and late-effects (including functional and general health
changes) resulting in less than optimal employment outcomes, including
long-term employment and work productivity. Although employment issues have
been recognized in this area, to date, the majority of research on work
productivity and return to work in human factors and ergonomics has focused on
common occupational injuries and illnesses. The application of theories,
methodologies, and perspectives from human factors research may serve to
optimize employment outcomes for cancer survivors.

%X Laparoscopic surgery greatly benefits the patient: it reduces recovery time,
has a lower cost than other procedures, and has a greater cosmetic benefit.
With every benefit, there is usually a cost. Laparoscopic surgery comes at the
cost of the surgeons. Surgeons must cope with disadvantages caused from
unergonomic handles. The current tools create awkward postures, pressure points
and nerve legions. The purpose of the current study was to determine the best
input device for a hot, powered, laparoscopic surgery tool. The current study
tested four different input devices on a previously designed ergonomic
laparoscopic tool handle using a target acquisition task. The input devices
tested were the: Mouse Button Module, TouchPad, MiniJoystick Module, and
MicroJoystick. Users' provided feedback via a questionnaire. Results show that
the TouchPad and MicroJoystick are the best input devices for a powered tool
with the MicroJoystick leading the pack.

%X Seven male first responders were surveyed about the usability, design, and
comfort of a hand-held commercially available neutron detector. The primary
goal of the questionnaire was to identify the positive and negative features,
and evaluate what could be enhanced on new detectors. Some of the negative
features found on the detector were that it was heavy, unbalanced, too big, and
difficult to handle while wearing gloves. The first responders couldn't use the
controls well while wearing gloves and the force required for the use of the
controls is too hard. Using the recommendations given by the first responders,
a future hand-held neutron detector will be designed and studies will be
conducted after constructing several different physical prototypes.

%X This study assessed the human factors issues associated with wearing a Vital
Sign Detection System (VSDS), a body worn physiological monitoring system.
Experienced combat Soldiers (n = 27) participated in a combat training exercise
of  120 hr while wearing the VSDS. They were then given a questionnaire to
assess comfort, physical impact on the body, and acceptability of the VSDS as
well as questions on fit, impact on performance, and durability of the VSDS.
Comfort was impacted the most by the VSDS when in the prone position, possibly
affecting sleep, and prone position rifle shooting. Skin irritation or
discomfort was reported in 85% of respondents. Sixty-two percent thought the
VSDS was not acceptable to wear for &ge; 8 hr. Yet, at the same time, 92% of
Soldiers approved of the concept for health monitoring, and 89% said they would
wear the VSDS as is if it could help save their life. The VSDS needs to be
modified to be more comfortable before it can be fielded for medical monitoring
of Soldiers in the field.

%X The number of self-checkout systems in stores has increased exponentially in
the past 5 years becoming a common way for consumers to complete their
purchases. Little research has been conducted in this pervasive area, however,
other than market research studies. An online survey found that although
individuals use self-checkout systems a great deal, there are a number of
issues and concerns with these systems. The most cited difficulties that arise
when using self-checkout systems included the barcode not scanning as well as
slow customers ahead in the line. These findings including others noted
throughout this paper highlight a number of opportunities for human factors
professionals to make the design of self-checkout systems more user-friendly.

Dutch subjects never adjust their chair. If the chair is adjusted, it concerns
mostly the seat height. Except for the seat height, other adjustment
possibilities are not used by the majority of the study population. Reasons for
not adapting could be awareness, complexity of the control system and expected

%X Age-rating guidelines for construction toys are based on the physical
characteristics of the toy and not necessarily the attributes of the
accompanying instructions. Many construction toys are intended for children as
young as six years old, but it is unclear how effectively they can use
accompanying pictorial toy assembly instructions. This study examined the
usability of four sets of toy instructions by K'NEX, LEGO, BIONICLE, and
Lincoln Log, as used by six- and nine-year-old boys and girls. Significant
usability problems impacting engagement and performance were evident including:
color inaccuracies, cognitive overload, attention tunneling, bottom-to-top step
sequencing, and complex graphic syntax. The research yielded design guidelines
to enhance the effectiveness of pictorial assembly instructions for young
children. It is important that instructions not discourage children from
interacting with building and construction toys thus depriving them of
important cognitive and motor development opportunities.

%X ANSI Z535 provides guidance to manufacturers regarding the format and
content of labels, signs, and other materials. In laboratory studies, elements
of the standard appear to contribute to the visibility and comprehension of
risk communications, but there is little real-world-based evidence that
adherence to formatting guidelines reduces injuries. In the present study, we
measured both real-world behavior and laboratory behavior using a
within-subject design. Recall of, and compliance with, warnings as a function
of increasing use of ANSI Z535.6 formatting was assessed. Additionally,
self-reported compliance at home was compared to observed compliance behavior
in the laboratory. ANSI formatting increased the likelihood that a warning was
recognized. Rate of compliance was higher in the laboratory setting than
self-reported at-home compliance. However, there was no evidence that
compliance was impacted by the presence, absence or degree of ANSI Z535
formatting.

%X Emotions are evermore present in discussions of product design and are
becoming part of a usability practitioner's repertoire of evaluation criteria.
Nonetheless, emotions in design are far more than simply using satisfaction and
frustration as criteria, noting how pleasant or unpleasant a product is, or
listing a number of emotions elicited during an evaluation. Evaluating the
emotional impact of a user interaction as part of a usability evaluation
requires that emotions be adequately assessed and, most importantly,
interpreted to identify their source. This article aims to present a method and
process of Emotional Profiling to show how emotions may be utilized to aid
usability professionals in further understanding the emotional reactions to
human-system interactions, thereby identifying factors that enhance or detract
from the user experience.

%X This study aimed at determining the effects of three-dimensional product
representations on e-commerce shoppers' purchasing decisions. An experiment was
designed and conducted with twenty graduate student electronic shoppers. Three
representation types were used: 2-Dimensional (2D), 3-Dimensional
Low-Interaction (3DL), and 3-Dimensional High-Interaction (3DH) product
representations. A reliable survey with 0.89 Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was
presented to participants after they completed product viewing tasks on each
product representation type. Results indicated that as interactivity
significantly increased with three-dimensional representation types,
participants became more likely to purchase a product with three-dimensional
representations. Participants were also more satisfied with three-dimensional
representations of the products, and their satisfaction level and likelihood to
purchase a product were more closely related in three-dimensional
representations. Future studies can explore product-specific representation and
purchasing decision issues, as well as cost and connection speed issues
relating to three-dimensional images.

needs, expectations, and desires, provide an explanation of why features of a
product are liked or disliked, as well as add additional structure to the
prioritization of usability shortcomings and related redesign recommendations.

%X Future concepts of operations purport that sophisticated information
technology will significantly enhance mission effectiveness through two
fundamental aspects: "speed of command" and "self synchronization." On one
hand, unlimited availability of information may serve to enhance the overall
awareness of individuals and teams. On the other hand, unrestricted information
push may serve to distract, overwhelm, and overload individuals and teams,
thereby compromising their situation awareness and decision-making
effectiveness. The question remains, how much information is enough? The
purpose of this study was to assess the impact of information availability on
decision-making by utilizing a four-person supply chain management simulation.
View of information and communication were manipulated to constrain information
availability. Results indicated better performance for conditions with more
information availability, including unrestricted information push. Overall,
these results illustrated the importance of capabilities such as anticipation
and redundancy, which seem to be vital to collaborative tasks.

on cognitive and vigilance tasks. However, little research has focused on the
effects of sleep deprivation on team performance. This study examined the
effect of sleep deprivation on a task requiring teamwork to maximize
performance. Twenty-four college students remained awake for one night and
completed a variety of tasks during each of four testing sessions. The Wombat,
a complex cognitive task, required participants to work with a partner to
maximize their overall scores. Results show that performance over the night
increased while performance within each testing session decreased. This
indicates that teamwork can help to improve performance over a night of sleep
deprivation but does not entirely counteract the negative effects seen within
the testing sessions. The current results suggest that team managers should be
aware that teamwork may not counteract all negative effects of sleep
deprivation on performance.

the distribution of workload between team members, procrastination by team
members, and the difficulty of scheduling meetings. Implications for
instructors and recommendations for tools designed to enhance student team

%X The current experiment examined the ability of participants to judge the
passability of a robot through an aperture and to reproduce the width of the
aperture in both Direct Line of Sight (DLS) and Teleoperation (TO) conditions.
Previous research performed in our laboratory has shown that participants
overestimate robot passability in teleoperation conditions (i.e. they state
that the robot can pass when it cannot). The current study aimed to replicate
past findings as well as to determine the cause of overestimation during TO.
Twelve Clemson University undergraduate students participated in both the DLS
and TO conditions. Similar to previous research, participants judged smaller
apertures as passable in the TO condition compared to the DLS condition.
Results showed that participants' reproductions of aperture sizes were
overestimated, which likely leads to the overestimation of robot passability
during TO. Participant estimations of aperture size and judgments of robot
passability help to quantify the differences between direct line of sight and
teleoperation conditions and these results will be useful in the training of
operators for future teleoperation tasks.

%X Many current and emerging systems require human operators to supervise
multiple uninhabited vehicles (UVs) with the support of automation. Automation
is not 100% reliable; ergo it is important to understand the effects of
automation imperfection on performance. This study investigated the effects of
automation reliability on system performance with multiple UVs under different
levels of task load. Twelve participants completed 12 "missions" supervising 3
(low load) or 6 (high load) UVs. Participants used one UV to conduct
Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition. They were assisted with an
automatic target recognition (ATR) system whose reliability was low, medium, or
high. Overall system performance was higher than user or ATR performance alone.
The gain in system performance with the ATR was particularly effective with
medium and high automation reliability. Thus, human-robot teams can benefit
from imperfect automation even under high workload conditions.

surveillance and monitoring, and for enhancing situational awareness of crews
operating vehicles with restricted visual field-of-view. This man-in-the-loop
evaluation is to study the limitations and capabilities of the system, and
enhance its performance for the proposed functions. Two sets of experiments
were designed, and carried out to study the man-machine interface (MMI) issues.
Subjective and objective data were collected, which allowed us to identify two

showed that performance differences between displays were task dependent. Thus,
some tasks can be performed with a smaller display at the same level of
performance by exerting more mental effort. Furthermore, sensitivity to task
difficulty was evident.

%X Automation is a robot's ability to control itself without operator
intervention. Advances in automation have resulted in a phenomenon called robot
neglect (Crandall &amp; Goodrich, 2003) in which a robot operator infrequently
attends to an automated robot. Robot neglect becomes a problem when automation
fails and the robot operator is not attending to the robot. This work outlines
a set of guidelines for aiding an operator faced with robot neglect followed by
automation failure. The guidelines focus on how video replay of the incidents
leading up to the failure may help the operator overcome inattention and regain
situation awareness. Complications with this approach in past research are
addressed.

%X The present study examined the role of minimal features in humans'
attributions for automobiles. This work extends research on minimal features in
drawn stimuli by testing whether the findings extend to real automobiles.
Participants viewed sixteen front ends of cars that varied in terms of the
shape of the headlights and the shape of the grill. Each was rated in terms of
attractiveness and six affective states used to describe human faces. As in
studies with both drawn stimuli and human faces, headlight (eye) shape was
highly associated with attractiveness, whereas grill (mouth) shape was more
predictive of negative ratings. Minimal features lead to anthropomorphic
attributions for automobiles.

"faces" can be predicted based on the way in which people process human faces.
Specifically, this work examined whether consumer ratings are correlated with
the relative size of features on the front end of an automobile. Participants
rated twenty-three cars on a variety of consumer attributes. Greater distance
between headlights, like distance between human eyes, predicted positive
ratings on several consumer attitudes. Results are consistent with the idea
that processes used for perception of faces are involved in the attributions
made for artifacts displaying minimal features.

%X This project involved developing symbols to replace existing text-based
warnings provided on 10 different types of landscaping products. Using symbols
would eliminate the need to translate and print the text in multiple languages,
reducing the amount of non-applicable information and reducing the space
necessary to print the safety information on the product. ANSI Z535.3-2002, ISO
9186-2001, and ISO 3864-2002 were considered in the design, development, and
testing of the symbols, including the use of acceptance criteria for open-ended
comprehension testing of 85 percent correct responses with a maximum of 5
percent critical confusions (assuming a sample of 50 respondents). Seven
hundred and nine participants represented three different spoken languages.
Sixty-one symbols and symbol sets were developed and tested; all except three
symbols (gas/oil mixture, use identical replacement parts, brushcutter
accessories) passed the ANSI Z535.3 acceptance criteria for comprehension. The
process of developing symbols for various types of hazards across products is
discussed as are challenges associated with conforming to recommendations and
requirements of multiple, sometimes conflicting standards.

%X This research examined the connoted danger level for symbols varying on type
of prohibition symbol and depictions showing before- or during-injury
consequences. One prohibition symbol was a red circle with a diagonal slash
intended to show that the depicted event within the circle should not be
performed. A similar, but less commonly used, prohibition symbol is the red
circle without the slash. In the present research, 96 participants evaluated a
set of symbols on two risk perception scales. Eight of the symbols viewed were
manipulated with respect to a base concept depicting before- or during-injury
consequences and type of prohibition. The results showed the symbols depicting
during-consequence (injury) events produced significantly higher ratings than
images showing before-consequence events. Symbols with a circle-slash
prohibition were rated higher than the circle-alone prohibition, but only for
some of the images. Symbols with both the prohibition circle-slash and
during-consequences image tended to produce the highest ratings. In general,
scoring participants' written interpretation of the symbols was relatively high
for the manipulated images and did not differ as a function of condition. Very
few critical confusions were noted (less than 5%) indicating, for example, no
apparent confusions of "double negatives" when combining the during-injury
consequences and the circle-slash prohibition symbol. More people expressed a
negative (don't, no, not, or do not) in the verbal responses for images with
the circle-slash prohibition symbol than with the circle-alone prohibition.
Results and implications are discussed.

%X Motor vehicle crashes involving pedestrians result in 1.8 deaths per 100,000
population annually in the U.S. Most of these fatalities are attributed to
pedestrians not being seen in time for the driver to avoid a collision,
particularly under poor visibility conditions. Previous research shows that
reflective clothing worn at night can substantially increase pedestrians'
visual conspicuity to drivers. The purpose of the present research was to
examine people's desire for reflective trim on their clothing. Findings of
strong desirability for reflective trim could prompt its incorporation into
garments available to the public, and thus, potentially decrease
pedestrian-related motor vehicle accidents. The present study measured the
extent to which people are willing to pay extra or less for clothing with
reflective material compared to the same items without reflective material.
People reported they are willing to pay more for reflective material on
sports-related, children's and inclement-weather clothing. Implications for
safety and future research are discussed.

developments has created opportunities for enhancing the validity of expert
opinions offered in the courtroom by human factors/ergonomics professionals.
Digital surveillance equipment typically yields more information from several
perspectives as well as affords more control than 'old' technologies such as
closed-circuit television, video cassette recorders, and multiplexers. This
poster illustrates three case examples in which human factors/ergonomics
experts used digital surveillance video as part of forensic analyses on cases
retained by attorneys representing both plaintiffs and defendants. The first
case is a rear-end collision on a freeway between a moving bus and a stopped
pickup truck. The second is a collision between a moving bus and falling
pedestrian, while the third is a more common slip-and-fall incident in a retail
grocery store. The implications of improved digital surveillance video for the
practice of forensics human factors/ergonomics are discussed.

%X This paper examines the results of a study conducted to determine if small
changes to a site's primary navigation structure would significantly impact
user performance. Between a user's first visit and their subsequent revisit a
week later, a single task-related link was either consistently present,
consistently absent, or was added or removed between the two visits. Results
show that performance was significantly degraded when the critical navigation
element was removed from the page after the user first visited the site.
Additions to the navigational structure were less disruptive to user
performance and actually enhanced it because the additional link provided
another navigational pathway to the desired information. The one week
re-visitation delay produced results similar to those found in a similar study
where the delay was less than 5 minutes (Scharff, 2006). Further research is
being conducted to determine the between-visit time required in order for
performance to be consistent regardless of the link condition.

%X Synthetic speech is a technology that can be utilized to convey information
and aid people in their tasks. Older adults in particular are a population that
may be able to benefit from synthetic speech, and they are a population that
has been investigated in a limited capacity. The current researchers intended
to elucidate lingering conflicts in previous research on the intelligibility
and recall of word and stories in synthetic speech for older and younger adults
and how that compared to similar conditions in natural speech. Twenty-four
older and 24 younger adults completed intelligibility and recall tasks with
word lists and stories. Results indicated that older adults had a more
difficult time with all speech, natural speech was easier to understand and
remember than synthetic speech, and stories were easier to recall than words.
Results also indicated that older adults had a more difficult time
understanding synthetic words as compared to natural words than younger adults.
In addition, older adults improved differentially with the recall of stories as
opposed to words when compared to the younger adult group. Potential directions
for synthetic speech software design and future research are discussed.

to determine if they performed secondary tasks while on hold, and if so, the
types of activities engaged in and the relative amount of time they spent on
those activities. Results showed that 79% of callers engaged in some form of
secondary activity while on hold. These activities were diverse, with the
majority of participants reporting 8 different types of secondary activities.
The data from this study will help researchers and IVR designers understand the
types of secondary tasks in which callers engage and allow them to design
on-hold stimuli that support multi-tasking and enable them to more accurately
construct experiments to reflect real world conditions.

tactile patterns during the high crawl, which was significantly lower than for
the tires and windows, with 92% and 88% of signals detected, respectively. With

receiving chat messages in different formats for a military command and control
(C2) task. In Experiment 1, participants were prompted with a tactical display
and responded by composing chat messages with an appropriate command. Speed,
accuracy, and subjective workload were compared for three chat messaging
formats: 1) full-text; 2) abbreviated text; or 3) click-chat. Writing full-text
messages took longer, resulted in more typing errors and higher workload
ratings than abbreviated text or click-chat. Although there was no difference
in response times between abbreviated and click-chat messaging, the abbreviated
chat yielded higher error rates. A translation delay was evidenced by slower
initial response times for abbreviations and click-chat compared to full-text.
However, faster message completion, once initiated, compensated for this delay
resulting in faster communication overall. Experiment 2 demonstrated that there
was no difference in the speed, accuracy, or workload for completing commanded
actions when receiving abbreviated compared to full-text chat messages.

%X This study seeks to better understand the aspects of working memory,
particularly spatial processing, involved in memory for visually presented
verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Prior research has suggested that there are
separate memory stores for words and symbols. It is proposed that memory for
the location of words is assisted by the phonological loop, which provides
comprehension, and a contextual basis to use logical reasoning to determine the
location of words. Participants in this study were tested on measures of object
and location memory, spatial relations, spatial visualization, as well as their
memory for the location of words or symbols, and reading comprehension. Results
suggest different processes are involved when remembering the location of words
when compared to remembering the location of symbols. The measure for location
memory was found to have a significant negative relationship with memory for
the location of words, suggesting that subjects with better location memory
(who, presumably, rely on it more), end up suffering on the memory for the
location of words measure by not relying on the more effective method of using
context to deduce the locations. With all measures contributing to a regression
equation, roughly 50% of the variance of both memory for the location of words
and symbols was accounted for.

between map resolution and participants' static spatial abilities was also
considered. Results indicated that learners recalled significantly more route
information and made fewer response errors in the low detail condition than in
the high detail condition. Additionally, participants' spatial visualization
ability significantly correlated with success on these tasks, whereas mental
rotation ability did not. These results suggest that while the addition of high
resolution information is now technologically possible, it is not necessarily
advised for certain situations as it can lead to a detriment in performance.

on the roadway, but between a vehicle which departs from the roadway and a
vehicle parked on the shoulder. In many such cases, the striking party will
maintain that they were in control of their vehicle at all times, but were
simply unable to detect the parked vehicle due to lack of illumination or
inadequate warning of its presence. A search of the available literature has
produced no data which quantifies the relative detectability of such warning
devices compared to reflections from such surfaces as vehicle bodies,
non-illuminated taillight lenses, or retroreflective striping such as that
required on transport trailers and trucks. This study was designed to quantify
the relative detection ranges of each of these surfaces for a vehicle parked

%X Change blindness results from the absence of attention from the source of a
change. Unsurprisingly, change blindness worsens in dual task and high workload
conditions. Such is the environment in which teams of operators in military
command and control missions operate, yet little is known about change
blindness susceptibility in these conditions. A flicker task required
individuals and dyads to detect changes under high and low task difficulty.
Reaction time, accuracy, and eye movements were examined. Scan path analyses
showed that communicating dyads were more efficient at change detection than
individuals and non-communicating dyads, but are just as blind to no change.
Eye movement data also indicate differences in attention allocation and scan
strategies among individuals, communicating, and non-communicating dyads.
Implications for adaptive aids and tasks such as tactical command and control
are discussed.

actually slow the reaction time of individuals during search tasks. Navon
(1977) and Mermelstein, Banks, &amp; Prinzmetal (1979) suggested that
individual components are "hidden" within a larger group formed by borders
because global perception comes before perception of the individual items. This
study tried to identify the minimal visual cues needed to effectively produce
perception of grouping. Different border types, including solid lines, dashed
lines, and simple chevrons were manipulated in order to assess how quickly
subjects can detect targets within groups. Results indicated that the single
character condition was significantly faster than the double and triple
character conditions. In addition, the Full Border condition was also

%X Dual task methodology and eye-tracking were used to examine how attention is
allocated when walking over terrain of varying complexity. Volunteers completed
six test sessions in which they walked for 30 minutes with one of three terrain
conditions (no markings, irregular markings, irregular markings). While
walking, volunteers also performed a secondary vigilance task with targets
placed at either eye level or ground level. Results showed that accuracy on the
secondary task declined as terrain complexity increased. Median RT was also
significantly faster with no markings than either marking condition. In
addition, RTs were faster with the targets at eye level for all marking
patterns except the irregular pattern. These data show that walking over varied
terrain impacts vigilance.

and/or images while conducting browsing and searching tasks on an e-commerce
website. Participants were exposed to two web pages, one image-based and one
text-based, and asked to perform either a search or browse task on each. They
were also asked to perform a search task for a non-existent category on the
image-based page. Results show that users follow a fairly uniform scan path
with greater fixations on images above the fold when browsing through
image-based pages. Fixation counts dramatically dropped on images close to the
fold and below the fold. The users performing the searching task on the
image-based page seemed very efficient. They seemed to employ unique and random
scan paths to successfully accomplish the search. Nielsen's 'F' pattern (2006)

%X The goal of net-centric warfare (NCW) is to give soldiers an information
advantage that leads to a war-fighting advantage. However, the inherent nature
of NCW systems is often quite complex and dynamic, which leads to impaired
situation awareness (SA) and heightened levels of mental workload for the human
operator. The following study investigated the moderating effects of automated
audio-visual alerts on user SA and perceived workload while using a net-centric
warfare system. Twenty-six participants observed battlefield scenarios on a
simulation of the common NCW system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below
(FBCB2), and were required to pay attention and remember critical events (e.g.,
the appearance of an enemy unit). The system was presented with or without an
automated alerting aid that provided combined auditory and visual alerts when
certain critical events occurred (i.e., System to Help Implement and Empower
Leader Decisions; SHIELD). Results revealed that contrary to current
assumptions the use of an automated alerting aid did not impact user SA;
however, perceived workload was significantly lower with the addition of the
alerting aid. This work demonstrates that the automated alerts used in this NCW
experiment do not affect SA (either positively or negatively) and decreased
perceived workload.

%X Mandarins are picked by hand with the use of shears. An average mandarin
picker makes at least 20,000 cuts daily. This daily workload on the upper limbs
is the cause of occupational cervicobrachial disorders (OCD). In order to
improve their working conditions, we devised two types of shears, one with a
soft grip wrapped around the handle and another with shock reducing cushions in
between the handles. The following two experiments were conducted. First we
tested and compared the Borg scale and pinch meter scores of each participant
by having them cut sticks as the same radius as those of mandarin stems using
both the improved and conventional shears. Next, we placed two pressure sensors
on each shear, where the middle finger and thumb contact the handles, to
measure and compare the impact pressure within the hand. The results of the
first experiment suggested that the improved shears reduces workload to the
hand and fingers when comparing results to those of the conventional shears.
The second experiment indicates that the shock reducing cushions reduces impact
pressure to the hand from the handles when cutting.

%X This study quantifies the effect of a simultaneous grip on wrist strength.
It was hypothesized that wrist flexion strength increases with an increasing
grip and wrist extension strength decreases with an increasing grip. Twelve
subjects performed maximum wrist flexion and extension exertions with a
different level of simultaneous grip - minimum, preferred, and maximum. Wrist
flexion strength increased 34% and wrist extension strength decreased 10% from
minimum to maximum grip. This shows that measure of wrist strength for
assessing strength capabilities or the efficacy of hand surgeries or
rehabilitation programs requires control of finger flexor activities to ensure
consistent and relevant results. When opening a bottle in an outward direction
(right hand thread), wrist extension strength may be significantly limited by a
simultaneous grip due to muscle antagonism. When twisting a fragile or
uncomfortable object, reduced finger flexor activities can limit wrist flexion
strength.

%X A substantial number of injuries and fatalities within occupational
environments are due to falls, the majority of which are believed to be a
result of loss of balance. The construction industry has been identified as one
of the most hazardous industries and falls from height are a leading cause of
fatalities in construction operations. This study investigated the effects of
beam condition, foot placement and load on objective and subjective assessment
of postural stability. Twenty-three male participants completed all conditions
with the effect of beam condition significantly affecting both objective and
subjective measures of stability (ANOVA, &alpha;=0.05). While not significantly
affecting postural sway, the load conditions significantly affected the
stability ratings. Correlations between the objective and subjective measures
were very weak (-0.219 &lt; r &lt; 0.01) with the strongest correlation between
mean velocity and the stability ratings. Subjective perceptions of postural
stability should be used with caution, particularly in more realistic task
environments with less variability in difficulty levels.

physiological features as heart rate and vocal inflections (pitch and
intensity). The vocal data were assessed from a first person simulation in
which participants interacted with video-based characters. During the
simulation, the participants' partner (friend, family member, or acquaintance)
completed inventories that asked their perceptions of the participant's
assertiveness and aggressiveness for the scenes. Results found heart rate and
mean intensity of speech were unique indicators of peer-rated aggressiveness.
Also, standard deviation in pitch and heart rate accounted for unique variance
in peer-rated assertiveness. The results suggest that physiological and verbal
measures may be a useful means of distinguishing between assertiveness and
aggressiveness of team members.

%X In this study, biomechanical and physiological analyses (via
electromyography (EMG)) were used to predict the accuracy of non-archers. This
study was designed to provide evidence that biomechanical strain and associated
muscular fatigue will result in unnecessary muscular activation that can be
reduced by technique selection. Correct selection can result in increased
non-archer accuracy. To accomplish this, a group of sixteen participants were
given basic training using two string grip positions and four standard stance
postures. The participant(s) performance (measured in FITA score) were recorded
and analyzed. It was determined that the less physically straining techniques
would result in higher subject performance. Hence, physiological and
biomechanical techniques can be used to accurately make predictions (pertaining
to grip type and archer stance) on non-archer performance. Specifically,
selection of the thumb grip (least straining) and the even stance (least
straining) were found to result in the highest initial performance.

%X In order to be an effective tool for driver evaluation and education,
driving simulators need to be better designed to reduce simulator sickness.
This study investigated driving in four environments (country, suburban, city,
and curves) using a simulator. When driving on straight roads (city and
suburban environments) subjects reported less simulator sickness then driving
in the city environment (which included left and right turns) and on curves. A
mini-SSQ was used to measure the accumulation of simulator sickness over
trials. From trial 1 to trial 5, reported simulator sickness increased
linearly. From trial 5 through 8, the rate of increase in simulator sickness
decreased. We suggest that the rapid and distorted optic flow experienced while
executing turns and driving on curves in driving simulators makes a substantial
contribution to simulator sickness.

%X The present study investigates driving simulator methodologies for inducing
qualitatively different patterns of subjective response. The study tested
Desmond and Hancock's (2001) theory that there may be two types of fatigue:
active and passive. 108 undergraduates participated. There were 3 conditions
(active, passive, control) and 3 durations (10, 30, 50 minutes). The active
condition used simulated wind gusts to increase the required number of steering
and acceleration changes. The passive condition was fully automated. In the
control condition, drivers were in full control of steering and acceleration.
Task engagement (e.g., energy) was lowest in the passive fatigue condition,
followed by the control and active conditions. Distress (e.g., negative mood)
was found to be highest in the active fatigue condition. The time course of
fatigue responses was also determined. The results suggest methods for
developing manipulations to determine the impact of fatigue on performance.

%X Today decision makers may benefit from richer sources of data and a wider
variety of visualization tools than ever. However, the extent to which
individuals make adequate use of a "toolkit" of visualization modes -- choosing
the right formats to support different task demands -- has received relatively
little attention. In the present study, a sample of 43 participants learned to
perform three decision-making tasks with a five geospatial formats or "views."
When allowed to choose their own views prior to beginning different tasks, few
participants spontaneously selected those displays that would provide the
greatest performance support. Most participants fell prey to "na&iuml;ve
realism" (a preference for realistic-looking displays) or "viewpoint inertia"
(a preference for familiar map-like displays). These data suggest that greater
attention needs to be given to the training of basic visualization skills as
well as possibly limiting display choices in some contexts.

%X The Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) represents a
second-generation approach to human reliability analysis (HRA). The method,
however, is very tedious to apply manually and not yet in widespread use and
therefore largely untested. To allow for rapid and systematic evaluation of the
CREAM method, a software tool for its application was developed. Results from
several analyses undertaken to evaluate the method and the tool are also
presented. The simplicity of our CREAM software allowed novices to analyze
events in much detail but also revealed some critical shortcomings in both the
method and the software tool. Several conclusions could be drawn from this
allow for drafting of specific design guidelines for future upgrades of the
CREAM software. These conclusions and recommendations can be further
generalized to all software applications of HRA methods.

%X Cost-value structures associated with different defects play a prominent
role in improving the human inspection performance. Equally, uncertainties also
influence human decision making in the inspection domain and show significant
effect on the operator's performance. Not much research has been done on the
effect of the cost-value structure on human performance combined with the
different levels of uncertainty present in the system. It is worth
understanding and exploring the importance of the relationship between the cost
value structure, uncertainty and human performance in the inspection domain.
The research results reveal that the performance of human inspectors improves
when they are enticed with economic benefits. Furthermore, feedback on economic
gains along with performance feedback aids in the improvement of human
inspection performance.

the classical SDT model. Additionally, they demonstrated that both models
provided statistically equivalent and uncorrelated measures of sensitivity and
bias under ideal conditions. The purpose of this research was to show the
robustness of the a b model for handling extreme responses. We conducted an
empirical evaluation of operators' decision-making and two Monte Carlo
simulations. Results from the empirical study showed that the a b model
provided equivalent yet independent measures of decision-making accuracy and
bias, whereas the classical model failed to provide independent measures in the
presence of extreme responses. The Monte Carlo simulations showed a similar
trend for the superiority of the a b model. Results from this research provide
evidence to support the use of the a b model instead of the classical model.

%X This study focuses on classifying human interactions in healthcare delivery
in terms of the information and resource flows at multiple levels of analysis.
Understanding the characteristic healthcare delivery requirements and
communication patterns among healthcare professionals seems to be necessary to
effectively support information sharing and coordination. We analyzed
communication links between healthcare providers and dissected different types
of information and resource flow. We identified four dimensions of information
and resource flow: spatial proximity, flow requirement, modality, and flow
path. Now that we have set a new methodology to characterize them, we can
easily distinguish the various information and resource flow types. When
applying these finding in simulating healthcare systems in order to analyze
information and resource sharing and coordination, the above four dimensions
would serve as attributes of the flowing entities. Finally, we demonstrate that
the results of this study are the natural first step towards developing an
efficient healthcare quality measurement tool.

%X Patient satisfaction is associated with self-reported treatment compliance
and patient outcomes. One factor that influences patient satisfaction is wait
time- how long a patient waits during a visit to a health care facility. Here,
we measured the time spent at each component of a patient's visit to a cancer
treatment facility and its correlation with patient satisfaction. Results
suggest that reducing the total time of a patient's visit to a health care
facility will improve not only patient satisfaction with how long the entire
visit takes, but also satisfaction with other aspects of the visit not
including waiting. Moreover, results suggest that the time spent in the
examination room waiting for the doctor is highly associated with patient
satisfaction with overall time spent during the entire visit. In short, our
results suggest several ways to improve patient satisfaction at a cancer
treatment facility. The implication is that such improvements will lead to
greater treatment compliance and ultimately to better patient outcomes.

elementary laparoscopic training scenario? Nine volunteers threaded as many
orange, purple, and blue foam rings as possible onto a pegboard during 2-minute
trials. They used a pair of 5mm laparoscopic surgical graspers in an endoscopy
training simulator to perform the task. Ring sizes were identical for all
colors in the first three trials but were of different inner diameters for the
remaining six trials. This switch was never mentioned to participants. Workload
measures were collected for each trial and included a subjective measure
(NASA-TLX) and a secondary-task method (interval productions). Results
indicated that interval productions, but not the NASA-TLX, showed evidence of a
workload spike at the time that situation awareness was first manifested in
performance. These preliminary data suggest that a global implicit measure can
be used for evaluating SA in a relatively simple environment.

flashing high beams at slower traffic, and speeding. According the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2000 report, aggressive driving was a
major cause of traffic accidents and injury. The present study was designed to
systematically examine 5 previously developed scales related to aggressive
driving behavior using a factor analytic approach. A sample of 253 students
were administered these five questionnaires and the data were coded and
statistically analyzed using a principal components analysis with Varimax
rotation on the 81 items of the five combined scales. Nineteen components
accounting for 67.4% of the variance were retained. Component scores were
computed for the 19 components and then correlated with gender. Three
significant (p &lt; .05) positive r's were found between gender; factors 11
(bright lights action), 12 (delaying action), and 19 (driving drunk). Males in
the sample reported performing these actions more than females. There was one
negative r between gender and factor 4 (considerate thoughts), suggesting that
females reported more pleasant thoughts than males when angered or annoyed on
the road.

%X Previous research on altitude maintenance in low-altitude flight has focused
either on cues provided by 2D features in the visual scene (e.g., splay angle)
or on visual cues provided by the presence of 3D objects in the scene (e.g.,
occlusion). Therefore, little is known about the relative importance of 2D and
3D cues in altitude maintenance. We systematically varied the position
variability, height, and pattern of surface elements in a simulated low-level
flight environment to vary the salience of 2D and 3D visual cues. For 2D
objects, altitude variability increased as a function of object position
variability indicating that splay and depression angles are not reliable cues
for terrains with irregularly spaced objects. For 3D objects, altitude
variability increased less (or not at all) as a function of position
variability indicating that the cues provided by 3D objects such as occlusion
and motion parallax are the dominant visual cues for altitude maintenance for
natural terrains with irregularly spaced objects.

%X Using a simulated UAV control task in which a vigilance display warned
observers of the presence of enemy threats, Gunn et al. (2005) reported that
perceived mental workload in relation to the vigilance task was unexpectedly
low. The present study did not confirm that finding. It did show, however, that
vigilance performance was greater and task induced stress was less among
observers who had the opportunity to act upon vigilance signal detections by
destroying the enemy threats than among those who detected threats but had no
opportunity to counter them. Accordingly, the results point to the importance
of a detection-action linkage to enhance signal detection and reduce stress in
the performance of vigilance tasks.

%X Gravity-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) is the second largest human
factors problem facing fighter pilots today. Whinnery, Burton, Boll, and Eddy,
(1987) found that the GLOC event consists of a 24-sec period of total
incapacitation involving unconsciousness and confusion. A study by Tripp, et
al. (2006) found that the GLOC problem was much worse that originally thought
with total performance incapacitation lasting for 87 sec. The two studies
described herein were designed to decrease the time required to recover from
the GLOC event. Toward that end, the first study employed an anti-G suit
inflation technique while the second study exposed participants to accessory
auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation following GLOC. Both procedures
significantly reduced the duration of the GLOC episode but the reductions were
not substantial enough to be functionally effective.

%X The use of continuous zoom in an electro-optical sensor system was
investigated with respect to target tracking. Using a simulation of an
operator-machine interface in an airborne multi-sensor surveillance system,
targets were tracked by manually directing the sensor or by an automated
tracker. It was hypothesized that frequency of using the continuous zoom would
be higher in the manual tracking mode than in auto-tracking, and negatively
correlated with tracking error. Sensor, and targets to be tracked, were either
moving or stationary in three types of tracking scenarios. Results showed that
the zoom function was used more often when tracking manually, although the way
continuous zoom was used differed between the two tracking modes. Also,
tracking error was lower when the zoom function was used in manual mode.
Tracking error was additionally affected by whether or not the target and/or
the sensor were moving or stationary. Results improve our understanding of the
way complex sensor systems are used, and will assist in ascertaining whether
providing a continuous zoom into optical imaging systems is of benefit to
operators.

%X The present research examined novice and expert flight performance in
simulated routine and announced instrument failure flight conditions. Pilots
flew routine flight segments under simulated instrument flight rules, and were
informed there would be an instrument failure at some point. Microsoft Flight
Simulator was used to simulate a slow vacuum failure that impacted the attitude
indicator and the failure was explicitly displayed in large letters on the
instrument panel throughout the failure segment. Although novices and experts
showed minimal axis deviations from optimal during routine flight maneuvers,
the novice deviations increased significantly in the announced failure
condition. The results have implications for the efficacy of instrument failure
indicators for novice pilots with approximately ninety-five hours of flight
experience.

%X Previously, we have shown that shaded perspective view ("3-D") displays are
better for understanding the shape and rough layout of terrain than
conventional 2-D views. We have coined the term Na&iuml;ve Realism for users'
misplaced, blanket faith in these 3-D displays (Smallman &amp; St. John, 2005).
There are hints in the individual difference literature that those of low
spatial ability may be particularly prone to Na&iuml;ve Realism. Here, we
integrate these notions to test several theoretical predictions and to develop
a new terrain simplification concept. Thirty-three participants had their
spatial ability and problem-solving style measured. Then participants predicted
which displays would, and then did, best support them in performing a task of
threading a concealed route through realistic terrain. Depth relief (shading
vs. topographic lines), viewing angle (90&deg; vs. 45&deg;) and terrain
fidelity (high/unfiltered sharp vs. low/spatially smoothed) were all varied. Of
the eight display combinations, Na&iuml;ve Realism correctly predicted the
greatest preference for the highest fidelity, realistic 3-D view (sharp,
shaded, 45&deg;). Yet the routing task was best performed with lower fidelity
views. Spatially filtering terrain unmasks canyons and other gross terrain
features, enabling them to pop-out more easily. Individuals of high spatial
ability had better task performance and better calibrated their post-task
display preferences, suggesting they are generally more savvy about the ways
that display format affects their performance.

%X Increasingly, multiple views on the same scene may be made available via a
network of sensors in security and surveillance applications. Similarly,
virtual reality and gaming applications may provide a user with more than one
view on a scene in an attempt to improve user orientation. Previous work has
demonstrated the utility of 'visual momentum' by showing an advantage in
spatial judgments when users are provided with a transition between 2D and
perspective views. However, no prior research has examined the utility of
smooth transitions between different perspective-rendered views of the same
scene. The present experiment compared two types of smooth transition between
perspective-rendered views, and demonstrated that transitions generally provide
an advantage on a spatial judgment task. Notably, transitions between
perspective views did not need to include a bird's eye view of the scene in
order for users to make improved line-of-sight judgments.

%X At border control, it is the personnel's job to identify possible passport
fraud, in particular to verify whether the photograph in a travel document
matches its bearer. However, as various earlier studies suggest, identity
verification from photographs or CCTV is far from accurate. The aim of this
study was thus to investigate identity verification at border control.
Particularly, we examined the influence of display duration in document
verification. Results showed that performance significantly suffered from time
restrictions, which stresses the importance of working environments at border
control free of time pressure. A second aim was to assess a possible benefit of
inversion of the document on identity verification performance, as was
suggested by anecdotal evidence from security personnel but clearly contradicts
the well known inversion effect in face recognition. Indeed, no such beneficial
influence of inversion was found in this study. The results are discussed in
terms of application-oriented implications.

%X Recently we demonstrated that the aperture illusion is affected by both the
shape of the aperture and by whether the aperture is stationary or moving (Ott
&amp; DeLucia, 2006). We hypothesized that effects of aperture shape and motion
were due to attentional processes. With the use of computer-generated displays
and manipulation of attention instructions, we obtained results consistent with
our hypothesis: When the aperture was a moving circle or moving octagon, the
illusion was smaller when participants divided their attention between the line
and aperture compared with when they focused their attention on the line.
However, when the aperture was a moving rectangle, the illusion was smaller
when participants focused their attention on the line compared with when they
divided their attention. The theoretical implication is that the mechanisms
that underlie the aperture illusion can be influenced by attention. Results
also have potential practical implications for situations in which observers
view moving objects with a limited field of view, as in minimally-invasive
surgery.

%X Soldiers rely on night vision devices to enhance their ability to detect and
identify objects of interest in environments of reduced luminosity. The night
vision device that is currently being used by United States Army Soldiers
deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan is based on Image Intensifying (I{sup:2})
technology. An alternative technology for night vision devices is to use a
fused sensor that combines I{sup:2} technology and a thermal sensor. The
purpose of this study is to compare Soldier performance on detecting and
identifying human targets while using a night vision device with I{sup:2}
technology to their performance while using prototype fused sensors in a field
setting. Five retired Special Forces Soldiers, all of which had experience with
using night vision devices which employed I{sup:2} technology and with thermal
imaging technology participated in the study. Participants were asked to detect
targets at ranges varying from 50-250 meters and to identify targets as
military or civilian at ranges of 25-150 meters. Significant main effects of
type of night vision device type (p&lt;0.0093) and range (p&lt;0.0003) were
found on the ability of the participants to both detect and identify targets.
In addition, a significant interaction was determined (p&lt;0.0219) on the
ability of participants to detect targets. Focused analysis revealed
participants were more able to correctly detect targets with the I{sup:2}
technology than with fused sensors at targets ranging from 200-250 meters, and
were more able to correctly identify targets with I{sup:2} than with fused
sensors. The results from this study clearly indicate the prototype fused
sensor tested here did not outperform a night vision device based solely on
I{sup:2} technology, and in several cases demonstrated poorer performance.

sweeps versus static frequencies. Experiment 1 established baseline performance
for identifying a single stimulus presentation. Experiment 2 examined the

attempting to focus on a single sensory channel. Experiment 1 demonstrates that
identifying the frequency sweep or static signal is relatively easy in both
modalities. Experiment 2 shows the unidirectional domination of auditory
signals over tactile, irrespective of sensory focus modality. Overall findings

%X A flight test was conducted to evaluate how effectively spatialized audio
cues could be used to maneuver a general aviation aircraft through a complex
navigation course. Two conditions were tested: a head-coupled condition, where
audio cues were updated in response to changes in the orientation of the
pilot's head, and an aircraft-coupled condition, where audio cues were updated
in response to changes in the direction of the aircraft. Both cueing conditions
resulted in excellent performance, with the pilots on average passing within
0.25 nm of the waypoints on the navigation course. However, overall performance
was better in the aircraft-coupled condition than in the head-coupled
condition. This result is discussed in terms of an alignment mismatch between
the pilot's frame of reference and that of the aircraft, which is critical when
using spatial audio to cue the desired orientation of the vehicle rather than
the location of an object in space.

intervals. Participants also responded faster to patient problems when

that depicted an urban combat search and rescue mission (CSAR). The
participants' task was to rapidly move through a virtual maze depicted in a

information, which in separate conditions could be a simple realtime indication
of the bearing to the pilot or to intermediate waypoints along the way.
Auditory displays led to faster response times than visual displays (p=.011)
and the waypoint display led to faster response times than the simple bearing
display (p=.002). The results are considered in the context of the target CSAR

the hand (natural prehension) and with a simple grasper held in the hand
(remote prehension). Remote prehension is executed with a longer movement time,
lower movement speed, extended deceleration phase and a relatively larger peak
aperture compared to natural prehension. The kinematic changes in remote
prehension are more pronounced when adults reached and grasped an object placed
on a narrow than a wide base. Results suggested that the indirect and

%X Constructing movement couplings is essential for decreasing
degrees-of-freedom for a compound movement that requires coordination over a
multiple segments. Angular movements of joints in the upper limbs are examined,
the pattern of movement couplings between prehension performed with the hands
(natural prehension) and with a simple grasper held in the hands (remote
prehension). In remote prehension, the shoulder and elbow joint are tightly
associated with a clear in-phase joint to joint movement; the elbow and wrist
display both anti- and in-phase movements due to the change of initial
configuration of the upper limb when holding a tool. In contrast, the
shoulder-elbow bond is mixed in natural prehension, but the elbow and wrist
bond is predominant with an anti-phase pattern. With diversity for joint
couplings, the movement consistency of the hinge is preserved with relatively
smaller path variability. Results support the end-point control notion, i.e.
movement is controlled by extrinsic coordinates close to the end-effectors of
the movement system.

%X Models of visual attention allocation suggest that monitoring is driven
primarily by proximal cues like bandwidth and value. However, these cues might
not always be predictive of the meaningful events an operator is asked to
monitor. The aim of the current study is to extend visual sampling models by
studying whether sampling can be influenced by more distal cues, like detecting
patterns in the monitored signal, when proximal cues, like bandwidth, are not
predictive of the meaningful events the operator is asked to monitor. Ten
participants completed a task based on Senders' (1964) experiment where
operators were asked to monitor a series of four gauges to detect when the
gauges traveled into the alarm region. The performance results suggest that
participants could successfully adapt to the temporal sequence. However,
participants did not show explicit awareness of the sequence, indicating that

%X The effects of variable feedback delays on movement time were examined in a
three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment. The participants' task was to use a
3D controller to position a cursor in targets as they appeared in a cubic
workspace. Both the mean and standard deviation of the delay between the
movement of the controller and the displayed position of the cursor were
manipulated. In addition, the size of the targets and the distance between
targets were varied. The results suggested that movement times are much more
strongly affected by mean delay than by delay variability and that the effect
of both variables is greatest during the closed-loop component of the movement.
The results are discussed in relation to buffering strategies for reducing
delay variability, Fitts' law, and other descriptions of aimed movements.

%X Forty parents participated in structured interviews that explored parental
responses to a warning that proscribed the use of an adult ATV by children
under age 16. Two such labels were evaluated in a between-subjects design --
one with and one without the following statement: "Even youth with ATV
experience have immature judgment and should never drive an adult ATV." Several
dependent measures were considered in relation to these warnings, including
parents' understanding of the label, likelihood of considering the label, and
comfort with not complying with the label. Interview results showed no effect
of the message on any of these measures. There was significant correlation
between the age of the child in question and parents' reported responses to the
labels. Focus groups indicated a negative affective reaction to the added
message with some parents noting that the message was offensive, unnecessary,
and/or that it lacked credibility. Parents also noted variability in maturity
levels among youth of a given age. Implications are discussed.

%X The expectations, attitudes, and perceptions of middle-school-aged children
toward the relative safety of riding bicycles at night, with reflectors and/or
head and tail lights, were examined. Six hundred and twenty-nine children
between grades 6 and 9 were surveyed. More than 50 percent of the children
reported that it was not dangerous to ride a bicycle at night with only
reflectors or only lights. Moreover, 91 percent of the children reported that
it was safe to ride at night if they had both reflectors and lights. Results
indicated that 22% of the children had lights on their bicycles; while 51%
reported riding their bicycles at night at least once in a while. The results
suggest that children riding their bicycles at night without lights are
under-estimating the dangerousness of the activity. That is, a large percentage
of children are underestimating the ease at which drivers can see them while
riding without lights.

%X This investigation tested whether heavily degraded warnings affected gaze
patterns and resulted in longer viewing times than lightly degraded warnings.
The study included sixteen participants who viewed six matched pairs of lightly
and heavily degraded warnings. Eye movements were recorded using an eye
tracking system while the total time on task for each warning was collected.
Fixation times were also collected as participants viewed the various panels of
each warning. In the second part of the experiment, legibility and participant
comprehension of each warning was tested. Paired t-tests showed that total time
on task, total fixation time, and message panel fixation time were consistently
significantly different for three of the six pairs of warnings, such that each
of the three aforementioned times increased significantly when participants
were viewing a highly degraded warning label. Additionally, participants were
able to comprehend all warnings presented. This study also provides evidence
that eye tracking can be a useful tool in warnings research.

%X The impact of notifications on driving performance is a critical safety
concern (Lee &amp; Strayer, 2004). This study examined how interruptions
(including phone calls) impair simulated driving performance, and how
individual differences mediate the effect of those interruptions. Consistent
with our hypothesis, field dependent participants answered phone calls more
quickly and with less consideration of the difficulty of the current driving
situation than more field independent participants. Further, a post-hoc
analysis showed that, on average, field dependents with small operating spans
crashed twice as often as the other drivers. Thus the detrimental effect of a
field dependent style on managing interruptions while driving is likely
worsened for people with low working memory capacity. It is suggested that
future research should investigate the safety implications of individual
differences in interruption handling ability. Such research is needed to
support ongoing efforts to develop guidelines and legislation concerning the
use of distracting information technologies (such as cell phones) in
automobiles.

%X Research conducted at the Navy Postgraduate School, over the past 10 years,
has focused on key organizational factors that may influence the likelihood of
an accident or organizational failure. The concept of
"high-reliability-organizations", originated by Dr. Karlene Roberts and her
colleagues at UC Berkeley, California, and was used as a point of departure for
understanding how different organizations manage the risk of accidents and
other organizational failures. High-reliability organizations are those that
are very successful at reducing the risks of operational hazards that typically
underlie accidents and organizational disasters, such as the Challenger and
Columbia Shuttle accidents. Included in the concept of high-reliability
organizations are factors related to the safety culture of the organization.
The author and his colleagues at the Naval Postgraduate School and UC Berkeley
have developed and validated a web-based safety climate assessment and feedback
system now in use in Naval Aviation and in other aviation, aerospace, and
medical applications. This paper reviews recent findings in the application of
safety climate and culture assessments conducted in naval aviation and US
hospitals.

%X In an effort to reduce operating costs and increase safety and efficiency,
U. S. Class I freight railroads have begun to use remotely controlled
locomotives in and around railroad switching yards. To better understand the
safety implications of implementing this technology, a human reliability
assessment was conducted to compare remotely controlled locomotive operations
with conventional (engineer onboard) yard switching operations. This paper
discusses application of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique
(HEART) with 2 yard switching employee subject matter experts. Each was asked
to assess 11 conventional scenarios and 11 nearly-identical remote control
scenarios. Human error probabilities were calculated for each scenario. The
HEART assessment revealed no overall difference in human error probabilities
between the 2 methods of operation. Additional analyses suggest significant
variability between the two assessors. This paper explores differences in how
assessors used HEART, including differences in selection of generic task types
and error-producing conditions.

%X Remote operation of continuous miners has enhanced the health and safety of
underground miners in many respects; however, numerous fatal and non-fatal
continuous miner struck-by accidents have occurred when using remote controls.
In an effort to prevent these injuries, NIOSH researchers at Pittsburgh
Research Laboratory examined the workplace relationships between continuous
miner operators and various tramming modes of the equipment using motion
captured data, predicted operator response times, and field-of-view data to
determine causes of operator-machine struck-by events in a virtual mine
environment. Factors studied included machine speed, direction of escape,
operator facing orientation relative to the machine, work posture, distance
from machine, and operator anthropometry. Close proximity to the machine, high
machine tramming speeds, a right-facing orientation and operator positioning
near the tail all resulted in high risk of being struck. It is hoped that this
data will provide an improved rationale for operator positioning for remotely
operated continuous miners.

%X Accident and incident reports have indicated that construction workers, who
comprise only a fraction of the industrial work force, suffer more fatal
injuries than in any other industry. Many of these accidents and incidents
involve workers being struck and run over by a reversing vehicle. During
performance of their duties, construction workers are frequently in the
vicinity of backup alarms mounted on a variety of vehicles, each with different
backing speeds. Due to the loud ambient noise prevalent on many construction
sites, workers may wear hearing protection devices, which can affect their
ability to detect these backup alarms. An experiment was conducted in
free-field conditions to determine the distance at which normal-hearing
listeners who wore a high-attenuation earmuff could detect a standard backup
alarm signal. Based on the data collected, a relationship was established
between the minimum-required backup alarm detection distance and the reversing
speeds for several typical vehicles.

%X The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS, Wiegmann &amp;
Shappell, 2003) was developed as an analytical framework for the investigation
of the role of human factors in aviation accidents. HFACS is based upon
Reason's model (1990) of human error in which active failures are associated
with the performance of front-line operators in complex systems and latent
failures are characterized as inadequacies which lie dormant within a system
for a long time, and are only triggered when combined with other factors to
breach the system's defenses. In this research HFACS was used to analyze
accidents occurring in civil aviation aircraft in the Republic of China (ROC).
Forty-one accident reports from the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) were
analyzed. Relationships in the HFACS framework were identified linking fallible
decisions at higher (organizational) levels with supervisory practices, thereby
creating the preconditions for unsafe acts and hence indirectly impairing the
performance of pilots.

advisories. Although human-centered design strives to eliminate accidents,
there are still many unknowns in long term space habitation. Specifically,
during the last fourteen ISS Expeditions, the crew has indicated that cautions

factors and safety personnel reviewed all comments made during ISS debriefs and
a sample set of procedures. Findings included: no human factors input in
procedure development, inconsistencies in procedure development, unclear

%X 'No turn on red' signs have been the subject of traffic research in recent
years because they are violated at higher rates than other signs. One reason
may be due to inadequate conspicuity. This study examined response times and
decision accuracy (proportion correct) following glance exposure to three
different 'No Turn on Red' signs. Two of the 'No Turn on Red' signs tested are
currently being used on U.S. roadways in some jurisdictions; one contains only
text and the other contains a red circle with text. These were compared to a
third new sign (Prohibition Arrow and Text). The three signs and a no-sign
condition (control) were embedded into 12 different traffic scenes. Each sign
and scene condition was presented for a 1 s duration and then participants
responded whether they could turn right in that particular scene or not
(answering yes or no). The new (Prohibition Arrow and Text) sign condition had
significantly faster response times compared to the other two signs. Accuracy
was approximately 90% and did not differ among sign conditions. The no-sign
condition was responded to significantly slower and less accurately than the
sign conditions. The new (Prohibition Arrow and Text) sign yielded better
performance than the other sign conditions in scenes rated as highly cluttered.
Some explanations on why the new sign benefited decision times are discussed.

investigation. The authors of this paper, working as investigators for the
agency, found several pre-existing latent conditions and safety system
deficiencies that affected unit operators' decisions and actions on the day of
the incident. This submission presents a summary of those deficiencies and the
primary human factors issues of the case.

%X The Aircraft Maintenance Intuitive Troubleshooting (AMIT) project was a 3
year endeavor sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Logistics
Readiness Branch. The project's goal was to develop a Job Performance Aid (JPA)
that Air Force maintenance technicians could use at the aircraft, regardless of
experience level, and realize improved technician performance. This paper
describes the AMIT Field Demonstration Test (FDT) and subsequent Cost Analysis
(CA). The FDT demonstrated that using the AMIT JPA could reduce repair times by
41 to 50 minutes. Also, performance of novice specialists using AMIT approached
or exceeded that of expert specialists using current methods. The CA, applying
the FDT results to fleet-wide F-16 Block 40/42 maintenance data, revealed a
potential savings of over 47,000 labor hours annually in repair time,
translating roughly into $3,000,000 in labor costs. Similar savings are likely
across additional airframes pending development and implementation of the AMIT
solution.

%X Human factors professionals strive to create effective system design by
ensuring that the capabilities and limitations of the human operator are a
primary design consideration. By demonstrating the effect of various design
decisions concerning the human operator on system performance early in the
development cycle, resulting recommendations may be adopted to enhance system
performance. To achieve this goal, human performance modeling tools are used.
One of the common misconceptions about modeling is that a model alone will
impact design. A model is merely a building block within an analysis. An
influential analysis incorporates the principles of experimental design, the
power of predictive modeling and the varying system design requirements to
produce results that empower program managers to make informed decisions
regarding system design. Analysts at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory have
successfully influenced the conceptual design of several manned ground vehicles
by recognizing this difference.

%X Systems thinking involves looking beyond events to see patterns of behaviour
and the underlying systemic interrelationships. This is especially important
for teams of planners or decision makers that are required to have a shared
understanding of the systems they are affecting. Soon after 'systems thinking'
emerged, the creation of generic counter-intuitive structures that seem to
occur repeatedly in different systems began. These generic structures (which
have come to be known as Archetypes) are models that can represent systems
across different domains. This paper outlines the most 9 common archetypes that
were first proposed by Senge. Finally, a new archetype is proposed that is
characterized by a critical event triggering a massive increase in some factor.

%X In process control, the ongoing automation and application of new
technologies caused a radical change in the position of the operator. Due to
this change, increasing manning constraints and the pressure to maximize the
operational capability in the Navy, naval operators need personalized and
dynamic support which can differ in time: the system should accommodate the
user with the right task support at the right time. This paper presents the
design and user evaluation of an interface with task allocation support. This
kind of support enables the operator to redirect the alarm (system or operator
initiated). Evaluation with 34 navy students shows positive results on
performance and general usability. Performance increases because the most
important problems are solved faster. However, performance on a less important
task decreases and can be interpreted as 'reallocation costs'. Results on
questionnaires show an increasing insecurity on the predictability of the
system.

%X Previous research has shown that spatial ability is associated with
performance on information retrieval tasks. Age-related changes in spatial
ability may thus explain older adults' tendency to have lower performance on
such tasks. However, previous studies have emphasized hierarchical information
organization. The current study will examine the extent to which a different
information retrieval interface can accommodate age-related changes in
cognitive abilities. Younger and older adult performance in two information
retrieval interfaces will be compared. One interface is meant to simulate
hierarchically organized information systems while the second interface is
specifically designed to reduce demands on age-related abilities while
increasing demands on age-invariant abilities. It is expected that the results
of this study will identify potential methods for improving information
retrieval task performance for older adults.

%X Given the great prevalence of vehicle accidents, collision prevention should
be a priority for ground transportation research. The understanding of such
incidents is critical to the safety of the driver. This study involved
simulations of multiple driving situations variant on Rate of Closure (the
relative speed between two vehicles) and Lead Vehicle Behavior. Useful Field of
View and Test Anxiety measures were used to analyze additional factors related
to driving with little success. The findings show that brake onset times of
younger drivers are significantly related to the behavior of a lead vehicle and
to the rate of closure. As such, any system that only uses time to contact or
distance to contact is fundamentally flawed. These results aid in the general
understanding of driver behavior and could fundamentally change automatic
braking systems.

%X Tactons, or vibrotactile icons, have been proposed as a means to communicate
complex concepts to users and to support multitasking in environments involving
numerous visual and/or auditory tasks and stimuli. This study investigated the
role of processing code in the interpretation of tactons while performing
concurrent visual tasks in such environments. Participants decoded tactons
composed of spatiotemporal patterns of vibrations -- requiring spatial
processing - and interpreted one of two types of visual task stimuli --
requiring either spatial or categorical processing -- in a driving simulation.
Compared to single-task performance, there was a significantly larger dual-task
performance decrement when the tacton task was paired with the visual task
requiring spatial (as compared to categorical) processing. The findings are
consistent with the assertion of Multiple Resource Theory that interference
between concurrent tasks is greater when these tasks involve the same
processing code. They illustrate how distributing task-related information
across modalities is beneficial but not sufficient to avoid task interference.
A direct implication of the findings is to avoid the use of spatiotemporal
tactons in environments which rely heavily on spatial processing resources,
such as car cockpits or flight decks.

%X When people interact with one another, there is a series of conscious and
unconscious evaluations used to judge the situation in order to determine an
emotional response. This research examines whether the emotional appraisals
that individuals use when interacting with other humans, can be applied to
human-agent interactions, and whether the attributes of the non-human agent
affect the nature of these appraisals. Participants work with one of three
non-human teammates to accomplish a series of tasks. These agents are a real
dog, a robotic dog (Sony AIBO), and a nondescript robot (Lego NXT).
Participants' emotional reaction is measured through subjective questionnaires,
physiological data (EKG &amp; galvanic skin response), and vocal analysis.
Taken together this set of measurements forms a detailed picture of how humans
react emotionally to agents during their task interaction. It is predicted that
agent form will influence participants' appraisals and emotional reactions.

%X Perspective displays (e.g., CDTI) are commonly used as decision aids in
environments characterized by periods of high emotional arousal (e.g., terrain
enhanced primary flight displays). However, little attention has been devoted
to understanding how emotional state, independently or in conjunction with
other perceptual factors (e.g., pictorial depth cues), can impact perceptual
judgments. Preliminary research suggests that induced emotional state (positive
or negative) adversely impacts size comparisons in perspective displays (Tran
&amp; Raddatz, 2006). This study further investigated how size comparisons are
affected by emotional state and pictorial depth cues while attenuating the
limitations of the Tran &amp; Raddatz (2006) study. Results confirmed that
observers do make slower judgments under induced emotional state. However,
observers under negative emotional state showed higher sensitivity (d') and
required more evidence to respond that a size difference exists (response bias)
than observers under positive emotional state. Implications for display design
and human performance are discussed.

%X Automation has become increasingly prevalent in modern day society. With
this progress, the shift from operators serving as active controllers (directly
involved with the system) to supervisory controllers (indirect management of a
system) has become more common. Accompanying this evolution of the operator
from their original role, there is a need to explore the components that
influence effective cooperation between operators and semi-autonomous agents.
Two key factors moderating this relationship are operator trust in the agent
and the complexity of the task itself (i.e., number of agents an operator
monitors). This work examines trust and automation theory as it applies to an
operator monitoring a complex, two agent, simulated search-and-rescue task. The
effect of source characteristics of the two automated systems will be evaluated
across reliability conditions for their impact upon reliance and perceived
trust of automation. The purpose of this research is to extend knowledge in the
theory of human-agent trust interaction and offers potential applied benefits
in leveraging the aspects of system design that lead to optimizing human-agent
interaction in a complex and possibly imperfect system.

warnings as a whole. In addition to determining the effectiveness of warnings
at each stage of the warning process, this research will also identify areas in
need of further research, especially those pertaining to behavioral compliance,
and will propose a framework for conducting experiments to adequately and more
fully address behavioral compliance and warning effectiveness for on-product
warnings.

%X The potential safety benefits afforded by emerging automotive crash
avoidance systems may be enhanced by implementing a driver vehicle interface
(DVI) that effectively communicates the direction of a potential crash threat
in a timely, effective, and integrated manner. An in-traffic study by the
authors provided evidence that drivers could spatially map eight haptic seat
vibration areas to the corresponding directions surrounding the vehicle with
86% localization accuracy (Fitch, Kiefer, Hankey, &amp; Kleiner, 2007). This
paper re-analyzed the data from this study to explore the extent to which there
were any notable patterns in the observed localization errors. Results indicate
there was some tendency for subjects to perceive side (i.e., left or right)
seat pan vibration locations as originating somewhat further back than they
actually occurred. Furthermore, the pattern of these errors suggest that a
haptic seat communicating four directions of crash threat (e.g., front, right,
back, and left) may further reduce the low level of localization errors
observed with an eight direction haptic seat design.

%X Twenty-five percent of traffic accidents involve rear-end collisions. One
important factor that may contribute to such collisions is a driver's ability
to detect the deceleration of a lead car. Prior studies of deceleration
judgments involved passive viewing rather than active control of self motion.
The primary purpose of this study was to measure effects of headway and
deceleration rate on the detection of deceleration during (simulated) active
control. We investigated whether the pattern of such effects was similar to
those we reported previously for passive viewing. Consistent with our previous
study, the current results indicated that, during active control, mean response
time to detect deceleration was longer when headway was relatively far or when
deceleration rate was relatively slow. The implication is that
collision-avoidance warning systems may have to utilize different criteria for
providing warnings under different traffic conditions.

whether or not adapting alarm timing to driver's brake timing is more effective

rear-end collisions, and is as acceptable as SDA. Also, the driver adaptive
alarm system may not suffer from driver's over-reliance.

%X We describe an approach to modeling strategic variations in how people might
select media content from an Apple iPod portable music player while driving. An
experiment was conducted to determine the time required to select a target from
a list using the scroll wheel on the iPod. It was found that a linear model
accurately predicted the time to scroll through a list to a target. This model
was then used in conjunction with a previously reported steering control model
to derive a priori predictions for dual-task performance over the entire range
of possible multitasking strategies. From this set of strategies, we then
focused on identifying the fastest and the safest strategies for completing
both a simple selection task and also a more complex selection task. It was
found that the model predictions bracketed the observed human data from a
recent study that investigated the effects of using an iPod while driving.
Moreover, the analysis suggests that in order to compensate for the inherent
risks of using devices that demand longer interaction episodes to complete a
task, people might adjust their multitasking strategy by giving more time up to
steering control while completing the secondary task.

%X Drivers overloaded with information from in-vehicle systems significantly
increase the chance of vehicle collisions. Developing adaptive workload
management systems (AWMS) to dynamically control the rate of messages from
these in-vehicle systems is one of the solutions to this problem. However,
existing AWMS do not use driver models to estimate workload, and only suppress
or redirect messages without changing the rate of messages from the in-vehicle
systems. In this work, we propose a prototype of a new adaptive workload
management system, the Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) AWMS,
which includes a model of driver workload based on the queueing network theory
of human performance that estimates driver workload in different driving
situations and a message controller that dynamically controls the rate of
messages presented to drivers. Corresponding experimental studies were
conducted to validate the potential effectiveness of this system in reducing
driver workload and improving driver performance.

visual-manual distraction potential of in-vehicle devices. A measurement
systems analysis was carried out on TSOT using data on thirteen visual-manual
tasks from the CAMP Driver Workload Metrics Project. TSOT showed low
test-retest reliability but high repeatability when data were averaged across
persons by task. TSOT predicted task completion time, lane keeping, speed
variation, total glance time, and number of glances away from the road while
driving. Tasks were classified into higher and lower workload categories based
on literature, analytical modeling, and engineering judgment. TSOT showed a
high percentage of statistically significant pairwise differences between
higher vs. lower workload tasks. Different classification rules were also
applied to TSOT. The best rule to classify tasks as higher or lower workload
consistent with prior prediction was one in which a mean TSOT&gt;7.5 seconds
implied the task was of higher workload. These results illustrate a general
procedure to assess driver workload measures in general and the usefulness of
TSOT in particular.

%X To understand drivers' decisions and actions at grade crossings, we examined
human factors contributing to noncompliance at grade crossings using a
sociotechnical framework. This perspective allows driver behavior at grade
crossings to be examined not as individual elements but rather as a function of
how each element interacts with other elements within the system. In this
paper, we present a model that addresses driver decision-making at grade
crossings at a systems level. We identify and describe four elements of the
grade crossing system influencing driver compliance: the design of the grade
crossing environment, driver characteristics, the role of organizations and
management, and social and political forces. We then apply the model to
identify how failure to consider safety from a systems perspective contributed
to the grade crossing accident that occurred in Fox River Grove, Illinois, in
1995.

%X Head-on collisions result in a substantial number of fatalities. To detect
head-on collisions, drivers must judge effectively the direction or heading of
their own vehicle in relation to the heading of oncoming vehicles. In our
previous study, we used computer simulations of self-motion through a traffic
scene to measure judgments about whether a head-on collision was imminent.
Results suggested that judgments about head-on collision are affected by both
the optical flow information provided by the centerline and the optical flow
information provided by the oncoming car. The objective of the current study
was to further examine the effect of different components of the optical flow
pattern on judgments of head-on collisions. We measured judgments about head on
collisions while manipulating local optical flow from the oncoming car and
global optical flow from the background scenery. Our results suggest that
visual information about the oncoming car's motion was more effective than
visual information about self motion. The implication is that it may be
beneficial for drivers to focus greater attention on the information about the
oncoming car's motion in order to improve judgments about head-on collisions.
Further research is needed to evaluate this possibility.

maneuvers (i.e., left turn, right turn, and straight across) at two different
rural expressway intersections (i.e., high and low crash areas). Twenty drivers
participated in this study with 10 older drivers (65-80 years old) and 10
middle-aged drivers (35-55 years old) used as a comparison group. Results show
that older drivers used significantly less search time to get ready for all
maneuvers when compared to middle-aged drivers. There was also an interaction
effect with older drivers taking significantly less search time during higher
traffic volumes. Middle-aged drivers would search for potential hazards and
wait for an appropriate gap distance before entering into the intersection.

%X While considerable data indicate that positioning retroreflective markings
on a pedestrian's extremities can dramatically enhance nighttime conspicuity,
most relevant safety devices (vests) limit coverage to the torso. We asked 120
participants to press a button whenever they recognized that a pedestrian was
present during a short drive at night. A test pedestrian wearing different
configurations of retroreflective markings was positioned on the left shoulder
of an unilluminated two-lane roadway. Compared to an ANSI class-II vest alone,
response distances were significantly greater when the vest was supplemented
with ankle markings and when a full biological motion configuration was worn.
Conspicuity was also greater when the pedestrian was walking and when facing
the approaching test vehicle. Relative to a full eleven-element biological
motion configuration, adding just two retroreflective ankle straps to a
conventional safety vest is considerably more practical while still providing
substantial conspicuity benefits.

%X The Air Superiority Knowledge Assessment System (ASKAS) was developed at the
Air Force Research Laboratory as a method for measuring knowledge in fighter
pilots. Differences in ASKAS results have been shown to correspond with the
knowledge level of pilots with different amounts of experience. To further test
this tool, it has recently been integrated into a week-long training program.
ASKAS is given before and after training to measure changes in knowledge as a
result of the training. Our results show that there is a small but measurable
increase in knowledge, as measured by ASKAS, after the training. In addition,
there is a quadratic relationship between pilot experience and performance on
ASKAS, suggesting that mid-level pilots have the highest levels of knowledge.
These results support the validity of ASKAS as a tool to measure changes in
knowledge during training, and provide insight on how to improve ASKAS for
future use.

%X The military training community is developing methods and tools to support
distributed simulation-based training, technological advances that enhance
coordination from different geographical locations and reducing funding and
resource requirements. As the training community evolves to conduct distributed
training exercises frequently, there is a strong need to simultaneously shape
and design the methods and procedures that will be used for these training
events. In this paper, we describe traditional after-action review processes
and roles and identify challenges to the extension of these approaches to
distributed training environments. Two specific challenges are highlighted and
discussed: the increased burden on the instructor to integrate performance and
mission information across geographic locations, and the redefinition of
instructor roles and task responsibilities in the distributed training
environment. Finally, we discuss the implication of these challenges in
developing training methods and in designing the technologies to support these
procedures.

%X Microworlds, simple simulations that strip away tactical details, have been
proposed as tools for training strategic-level command decision making. In
microworlds, scenarios lasting days or weeks play out in a matter of hours.
Though time acceleration has been studied in other training areas, little is
known about its effects on decision making, especially regarding transfer of
training. In the current study, participants were asked to perform a simple
decision task modeled on peace support operations. Before performing the task,
they received training on the task at a time compression ratio of either 15:1
or 5:1. While both groups achieved similar performance in training, the
performance of the 15:1 training group improved when transitioning to the
target task, whereas the 5:1 training group saw its performance decrease. The
results suggest that time acceleration can benefit training for decision
making, but more study is needed to determine optimal acceleration ratios.

%X Twenty novices were trained on either a conventional Cessna display or a
functional flight display over 6 flight sessions in an Elite iGATE flight
simulator. Between flight sessions, participants completed concept maps of the
system state changes required to perform specific maneuvers. When compared to
expert concept maps, novices trained on a functional flight display showed
significantly greater agreement than novices trained on a conventional display.
This indicates that novices exposed to functional displays in training have an
improved conceptual understanding of system dynamics, as well as a more
accurate understanding of proper system operation.

%X Providing trainees with metric feedback improves their metric distance
estimations, but doing so also hinders certain actions. This paper describes a
possible explanation for this hindrance. Based on that explanation, it was
predicted that metric feedback should not hinder actions that are guided by
cognitive processing, i.e., actions guided by the ventral visual system. To
investigate this possibility, participants threw underhanded to specific metric
distances during Pre and Post-Testing, e.g., throwing an object so that it came
to rest 30 feet away. During the intervening Training, participants generated
verbal distance estimates. Half received metric feedback. The results indicated
that throws improved from Pre to Post-Test, but only when participants received
metric feedback during Training. This outcome supports our hypothesis.
Moreover, it suggests that trainees must know whether their distance estimation
training should be applied to untrained tasks. Doing so may benefit certain
tasks. Others, however, may suffer from it.

%X Older adults are joining the technology revolution, as they are the fastest
growing population using computers and the internet. Due to age-related
declines in cognition, they may be at a disadvantage when learning to use new
technologies. Training may ameliorate the impact of such disadvantages;
however, the lingering question is how best to design such training programs.
One limitation of current training models is the lack of integration across
research findings resulting in an inability to determine what constitutes
optimal training. Previous research has identified many components that may
lead to improved performance and it is essential to examine the circumstances
in which specific details of training result in specific learning outcomes. To
begin to accomplish this, the current paper illustrates a conceptual framework
focused on the systematic design of training older adults for technology use.
The framework offers an expanded view of the training development process and
serves as a guide to future research to help in deciphering optimality of
technology training for older adults.

%X The Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) is required to
provide advice to customers for the procurement of future military systems
using the high fidelity human-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) facility housed in
the Air Operations Simulation Centre (AOSC). A program of research is under way
that compares two work analysis techniques (traditional task analysis and
Cognitive Work Analysis) on the basis of whether the human-system performance
measures that they suggest are sensitive to system modifications and so may be
used for system evaluation. In this paper we show that representing aircrew's
tactical environment as a series of concentric "rings" resulted in the
development of HILS requirements that let us evaluate the measures derived from
both work analysis approaches. Using the rings to frame the experiment and
develop simulation requirements was beneficial for several reasons including
participant involvement, validity of the system and operator behaviour
observed, and completeness of the study.

military vehicles. Restraint configurations consisted of a 2{sup:3} (lap and
two shoulder belts), 3+2 (standard 3-point lap/shoulder belt plus secondary
shoulder belt) and 5-point (two shoulder, two lap, and one crotch belt). All
systems had a single point release feature. Human factors evaluation entailed
assessing ingress/egress, functional operation (control reach) and
accommodation (fit). Testing included with and without full gear. Eleven
soldiers with military vehicle driving experience participated in the
evaluation. Results for egress testing showed that the 5-point was slightly
faster than the 3+2 and the 2{sup:3}. Results for the ingress testing showed
that ingress time was directly related to the number of connections with the
3+2, 2{sup:3} and the 5-point reflecting fastest to slowest times. Wearing full
gear significantly increased ingress time but had minimal effects on egress
times. No major accommodation issues were noted.

%X To avoid penetration from chemical agents, U.S. military Aviators wear
chemical-biological (CB) protective clothing, including gloves, while in CB
threat environments. This protective requirement typically increases glove
thickness which could interfere with tactility and dexterity needed to
effectively operate aircraft. An applied laboratory evaluation was conducted to
determine if current CB glove tactility and dexterity could be enhanced by the
introduction of novel glove concepts. Aviator subjects performed objective
tasks based upon standardized tests of tactility and dexterity. They also
self-rated their ability to manipulate cockpit controls on aircraft simulator
panels. A human factors questionnaire was administered following each test
condition and at the conclusion of all conditions. Evidence from all data
sources indicates that three novel glove concepts show promise for enhancing
tactility and dexterity performance. The approach to combining multiple data
sources, the methodological constraints, and lessons learned are discussed.

following a MPPM or PMMP Schedule (M = MSW or P = Placebo, 250ml 120s before
lap-swim). Analyses, adjusted and unadjusted for carryover, revealed
significant (p&lt;0.015) increases in 600s lap-swim distance (&ge;3.3%) and

%X The Army's acquisition process is transforming to meet the needs of a force
that must be agile, adaptive, and responsive to asymmetric threats. Advanced
capabilities and technologies, which are urgently needed to enable rapid
response to evolving military needs, are being developed and pushed out to
troops at unprecedented rates. As a result, not all systems have undergone an
iterative design process, received usability feedback from their target users,
or had design support from human factors engineers to ensure that unit and
Soldier considerations have been addressed. Subsequently, these systems may
possess characteristics that induce high cognitive workload, fatigue,
detectability, or trigger events that lead to fratricide. When human factors
engineers encounter a system that has not derived these benefits, they too must
become more agile, adaptive, and responsive to ensure that Soldier feedback is
collected and that serious issues are identified and resolved before the system
makes its way to the battlefield. Lessons learned while participating in
advanced technology and experimentation programs include techniques that
facilitate working with small Ns, institutional review boards, rapid survey
instrument development, and the collection of qualitative feedback as well as
the importance of having a "usability tool kit" available to facilitate data
collection efforts in an operational field environment.

%X Objective: To examine the effect of input device on performance of a driving
task during uncoupled motion (UM). Background: Muth, Walker &amp; Fiorello
(2006) demonstrated that UM affected performance on a driving task with a
steering wheel input device. However, it was unclear if the effect was due to
general (motion sickness) or specific (interference with motor control) effects
of UM. Methods: Ten participants completed a driving task while in a stationary
and a moving real vehicle using a handheld control pad. Data were combined with
the results of the previous study. Results: Regardless of input device,
performance was significantly affected by UM, F(1,18) = 16.69, p&lt; 0.01,
&eta;{sub:p}{sup:2}=0.48. There was also a condition by input device
interaction, F(1, 18) = 4.81, p&lt;0.05, &eta;{sub:p}{sup:2}=0.21. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated that UM can have both specific and general effects and
that system design can potentially mitigate some of these effects.

%X One of the most frustrating aspects of motion sickness is the apparent lack
of predictability, particularly from one context (seasickness) to another
(cybersickness). It has been postulated that this lack of predictability is
indicative of separate but related disorders. Recent evidence has suggested
that the problem may not lie in the disorder itself, but in the measures used
to predict it. Based on the predictions of Riccio and Stoffregen (1991) and the
findings of Smart, Stoffregen, and Bardy (2002), a secondary analysis was
performed using parameters of postural motion in order to classify participants
who would later become motion sick across three laboratory (four modes of
presentation: moving room (Smart, et al, 2002), high fidelity flight simulator
(Stoffregen, et al, 2000) large screen projection, and head mounted display
(Otten, 2005)) settings. Results suggest that measures of postural instability
may serve as a common, minimally invasive, and predictive index of visually
induced motion sickness.

gaming technology was evaluated during a Battalion staff exercise. The staff
worked through a pre-deployment Stability and Support Operation (SASO) exercise
to a hypothetical Middle-Eastern country, in which they acquired information
about the local situation relevant to their assigned mission, then developed
deployment and contingency plans for that mission. These plans were then
evaluated by the Battalion Commander, and the staff was evaluated on their
performance. Questionnaire information was collected from the staff about the
effectiveness of the simulation, and interviews with the command staff and the
commander provided opinion-based evidence of the value of the simulation system
and simulated exercises of this kind. The results indicate considerable
potential for systems of this nature to expand training and evaluation
opportunities as well as meet new asymmetric training needs while optimizing
Soldiers' training time.

%X Human errors are blamed for nearly 90 percent of traffic accidents; however,
the human driver is only one of the three principal components (driver, vehicle
and road/environment) in driving. Why are so many errors attributed to drivers?
Are drivers inherently error prone? Based on these questions, twelve drivers'
visual behavior and mental stress were investigated through simulated driving
in a virtual environment. A Tobii eye tracker was used to record drivers' eye
gaze activities and a FlexComp biofeedback system was used to record
physiological parameters related to mental stress change. The preliminary
experiment results found that improperly placed traffic signs have a
significant effect on drivers' visual behavior and mental stress. Drivers tend
to simply ignore the signs with poor visibility or poor readability in
simulated driving. Compared with properly placed signs, improperly placed signs
are less effective and cause more stress to the drivers. The decreased
attention and insufficient response to critical traffic facilities indicates
necessity of correction in highway design and management. The current
experiment methods and research results are useful for highway safety
evaluation.

%X As the technological environment is constantly changing and becoming more
global, organizations must continue to find ways to compete advantageously.
Teams are increasingly being used as a mechanism for accomplishing
organizational work yet researchers are still exploring what leads to the
ability to learn as an organization or to exhibit effective knowledge
management. A parallel trend is the dispersion of organizations globally and
the set of virtual teams and even virtual organizations operating in different
places and times. One body of research that may help in understanding how to
improve the functioning of virtual teams focuses on Transactive Memory Systems
(TMSs). Prior studies have indicated that TMS emergence leads to improved team
performance. Therefore, the present research explores and analyzes the roles
that influential factors play in TMS emergence and maintenance in virtual
teams. Specifically, a number of factors will be investigated with a goal of
identifying how best to utilize findings to assemble virtual teams.
