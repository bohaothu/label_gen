    ABSTRACT:: As large numbers of text databases have become available on
               the Internet, it is getting harder to locate the right
               sources for given queries. In this paper we present gGlOSS, a
               generalized Glossary-Of-Servers Server, that keeps statistics
               on the available databases to estimate which databases are
               the potentially most useful for a given query. gGlOSS extends
               our previous work, which focused on databases using the
               boolean model of document retrieval, to cover databases using
               the more sophisticated vector-space retrieval model. We
               evaluate our new techniques using real-user queries and 53
               databases. Finally, we further generalize our approach by
               showing how to build a hierarchy of gGlOSS brokers. The top
               level of the hierarchy is so small it could be widely
               replicated, even at end-user workstations.
