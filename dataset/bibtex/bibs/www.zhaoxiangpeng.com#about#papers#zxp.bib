  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the semantics of BPEL4WS language which
    is a de facto standard for specifying and execution workflow specification
    for web service composition and orchestration. We propose a language
    [mu]-BPEL that includes most primitive and structured activities
    of BPEL4WS, and define its semantics. As the Timed Automata (TA)
    is powerful in designing real-time models with multiple clocks and
    has well developed automatic tool support, we define a map from
    [mu]-BPEL into composable TA. Therefore, the properties we want
    to check can be verified in TA network correspondingly. Furthermore,
    we prove that the mapping from [mu]-BPEL to TA is a simulation,
    which means that the TA network simulates correctly the corresponding
    [mu]-BPEL specification. The case study with model checker Uppaal
    shows that our method is effective, and a Java supporting tool based
    on Uppaal model checker engine has been developed.},
