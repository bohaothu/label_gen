   Abstract = {This paper presents a general framework for computing the asymptotic error probability (i.e., at high average SNRs) of M-ary and binary signaling schemes over Rician and Rayleigh fading diversity channels. A general theorem (Theorem 1) relates the asymptotic error rate of multipath and multichannel receivers (over AWGN, ISI free channels) to the multidimensional integral of the conditional error probability. Two other theorems are presented for the particular cases where the conditional error probability is a function of the sum of received SNRs (Theorem 2) or received amplitudes (Theorem 3). Theorems 2 and 3 are related for linear coherent systems, and closed form expressions are obtained for equal gain combining systems. Detection structures for typical diversity schemes (coherent/noncoherent maximal ratio and equal gain combining, and quadratic noncoherent combining) are considered. We analyze the asymptotic error rates of some M-ary signaling schemes (MPSK/MPAM with Kth order diversity and orthogonal signals with K=1 and with coherent and noncoherent detection). Binary signaling is also considered in our study},

   Abstract = {This paper presents an energy efficient selection of cooperative nodes with respect to their geographical location and the number of nodes participating in cooperative communications in wireless sensor networks. The cooperative communication in wireless sensor networks (WSN) gives us leverage to get the inherent advantages of its random node's locations and the direction of the data flow. Depending on the channel conditions and the transmission distance, the number of cooperative nodes is selected, that participate in an energy efficient transmission/reception. Simulation results show that increasing the cooperative receive diversity, decreases the energy consumption per bit in cooperative communications. It has also been shown that the network backbone capacity can be increased by controlled displacement of antennas at base station at the expense of energy per bit.},

The IEEE 802.11b standard protocol allows the use of multiple channels available at the physical layer but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. The proposed protocol utilizes multiple channels by using single interface and incorporates opportunistic cooperative diversity by using a cross-layer MAC. The new protocol leverages the multi-rate capability of IEEE 802.11b and allows wireless nodes far away from destination node to transmit at a higher rate by using intermediate nodes as a relays. The protocol incorporates opportunistic cooperative diversity by the design of a cross-layer MAC. The protocol improves network throughput and packet delivery ratio significantly and reduces packet delay. The performance improvement is further evaluated by simulation and analysis.},

   Abstract = {Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) consist of mesh routers and mesh clients, where mesh routers have minimal mobility and form the backbone of WMNs. They provide network access for both mesh and conventional clients. The integration of WMNs with other networks such as the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through the gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. Mesh clients can be either stationary or mobile, and can form a client mesh network among themselves and with mesh routers. WMNs are anticipated to resolve the limitations and to significantly improve the performance of ad hoc networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks (WPANs), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). They are undergoing rapid progress and inspiring numerous deployments. WMNs will deliver wireless services for a large variety of applications in personal, local, campus, and metropolitan areas. Despite recent advances in wireless mesh networking, many research challenges remain in all protocol layers. This paper presents a detailed study on recent advances and open research issues in WMNs. System architectures and applications of WMNs are described, followed by discussing the critical factors influencing protocol design. Theoretical network capacity and the state-of-the-art protocols for WMNs are explored with an objective to point out a number of open research issues. Finally, testbeds, industrial practice, and current standard activities related to WMNs are highlighted.},

Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possible future research areas.},

Analytical models capture physical wave propagation and antenna configuration simultaneously by describing the impulse response (equivalently, the transfer function) between the antenna arrays at both link ends. We also review some MIMO models that are included in current standardization activities for the purpose of reproducible and comparable MIMO system evaluations. Finally, we describe a couple of key features of channels and radio propagation which are not sufficiently included in current MIMO models.},

   Abstract = {The functional lifetime of a sensor network is defined as the maximum number of times a certain data collection function or task can be carried out without any node running out of energy. The specific task considered in this paper is that of communicating a specified quantity of information from each sensor to a collector node. The problem of finding the communication scheme which maximizes functional lifetime can be formulated as a linear program, under "fluid-like" assumptions on information bits. This paper focuses on analytically solving the linear program for some simple regular network topologies. The two topologies considered are a regular linear array, and a regular two-dimensional network. In the linear case, an upper bound on functional lifetime is derived, as a function of the initial energies and quantities of data held by the sensors. Under some assumptions on the relative amounts of the energies and data, this upper bound is shown to be achievable, and the exact form of the optimal communication strategy is derived. For the regular planar network, upper and lower bounds on functional lifetime, differing only by a constant factor, are obtained. Finally, it is shown that the simple collection scheme of transmitting only to nearest neighbors, yields a nearly optimal lifetime in a scaling sense.},

   Pages = {4152-4172},
   Abstract = {We propose novel cooperative transmission protocols for delay-limited coherent fading channels consisting of N (half-duplex and single-antenna) partners and one cell site. In our work, we differentiate between the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative multiple-access (CMA) (up-link) channels. The proposed protocols are evaluated using Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. For the relay channel, we investigate two classes of cooperation schemes; namely, amplify and forward (AF) protocols and decode and forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper bound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We then construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed algorithm is then extended to the general case with (N-1) relays where it is shown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Wornell without requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF protocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0/spl les/r/spl les/1/N. Furthermore, with a single relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols for all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be more significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is reversed in the CMA channel where we propose a new AF protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A distinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that they do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of resources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the suboptimality of previously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces rather than the half-duplex constraint.},

   Abstract = {Most ad hoc and sensor network research assumes idealized radio propagation models without considering fading and shadowing effects. Experimental results have shown that many well-designed protocols will fail simply because of fading and shadowing experienced in a realistic wireless environment. While fading and shadowing for radio propagation are well understood in wireless communication community, they are rarely studied in network level research for wireless sensor networks. This paper studies the fading and shadowing effects on the performance of different MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. We show that fading and shadowing can have a significant influence on network performance. We study and compare network performance for three different systems: 1) a multi-channel CDMA system; 2) a pure CDMA system; 3) a contention based system. Through discrete event simulation (using ns-2), we show that the multi-channel CDMA system outperforms the pure CDMA system as well as the contention based system under fading and shadowing environments},

We study adapting the user's transmission rate and power based on the channel state information as well as the buffer occupancy; the objectives are to regulate both the long-term average transmission power and the average buffer delay incurred by the traffic. Two models for this situation are discussed; one corresponding to fixed-length/variable-rate codewords and one corresponding to variable-length codewords. The tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power required for reliable communication is analyzed. A dynamic programming formulation is given to find all Pareto optimal power/delay operating points. We then quantify the behavior of this tradeoff in the regime of asymptotically large delay. In this regime, we characterize simple buffer control policies which exhibit optimal characteristics. Connections to the delay-limited capacity and the expected capacity of fading channels are also discussed},

   Abstract = {We ask a fundamental question concerning the limits of energy efficiency of sensor networks-what is the upper bound on the lifetime of a sensor network that collects data from a specified region using a certain number of energy-constrained nodes? The answer to this question is valuable for two main reasons. First, it allows calibration of real world data-gathering protocols and an understanding of factors that prevent these protocols from approaching fundamental limits. Secondly, the dependence of lifetime on factors like the region of observation, the source behavior within that region, basestation location, number of nodes, radio path loss characteristics, efficiency of node electronics and the energy available on a node, is exposed. This allows architects of sensor networks to focus on factors that have the greatest potential impact on network lifetime. By employing a combination of theory and extensive simulations of constructed networks, we show that in all data gathering scenarios presented, there exist networks which achieve lifetimes equal to or &gt;95% of the derived bounds. Hence, depending on the scenario, our bounds are either tight or near-tight},

   Abstract = {Cooperative diversity has been recently proposed as a way to form virtual antenna arrays that provide dramatic gains in slow fading wireless environments. However, most of the proposed solutions require simultaneous relay transmissions at the same frequency bands, using  distributed space-time coding algorithms. Careful design of distributed space-time coding for the relay channel is usually based on global knowledge of some network parameters or is usually left for future investigation, if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel scheme that eliminates the need for space-time coding and provides diversity gains on the order of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best relay from a set of M available relays and then uses this "best" relay for cooperation between the source and the destination. Information theoretic analysis of outage probability shows that our scheme achieves the same diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff as achieved by more complex protocols, where coordination and distributed space-time coding for M relay nodes is required. Additionally, the proposed scheme increases the outage and ergodic capacity, compared to non-cooperative communication with increasing number of participating relays, at the low SNR regime and under a total transmission power constraint. Coordination among the participating relays is based on a novel timing protocol that exploits local measurements of the instantaneous channel conditions. The method is distributed and allows for fast selection of the best relay as compared to the channel coherence time. In addition, a methodology to evaluate relay selection performance for any kind of wireless channel statistics is provided. Other methods of network coordination, inspired by natural phenomena of decentralized time synchronization, are analyzed in theory and implemented in practice. It was possible to implement the proposed, virtual antenna formation technique in a custom network of single antenna, half-duplex radios.},

   Title = {Cooperative Connectivity Models and Bounds for Wireless Relay Networks},
   Abstract = {Cooperative  communication  is  a  recent  paradigm  for  wireless  relay  networks  wherein multiple wireless  terminals share  their resources  to  jointly  transmit  information  of  which  they  are  not  the  source  in  order  to  achieve  an  improvement  in  overall  performance. This is realized via the application of cooperative diversity techniques that  take advantage of the spatial diversity offered by cooperation between wireless terminals. This  dissertation  addresses  wireless  relay  networks  with  an  arbitrary  number  of cooperating wireless  terminals,  arbitrary  sets  of  communication  links  between  pairs  of   cooperating terminals, and arbitrary numbers of antennas at each cooperating terminal. The starting point for any analysis of wireless relay networks is the development of a  system model that allows comparison of key performance characteristics such as signal to noise  ratio, probability of  error,  and probability  of outage. This dissertation develops  a 
general system model  for arbitrarily connected wireless  relay networks. Since  increased spatial  diversity  is  one  of  the  key  benefits  expected  of  cooperative  connectivity  it  is especially  important  to  understand  the  bounds  on  the  maximum  achievable  diversity 
order of wireless relay networks with arbitrary cooperative connectivity. This dissertation develops upper bounds on the maximum diversity order for arbitrarily connected wireless relay  networks. Each  of  the  cooperative  diversity  techniques  presented  in  the  literature places  different  requirements  on  the  system  resources  that  must  be  available,  and therefore  system  resource  constraints  that  limit  the  connectivity of  individual  terminals also constrain  the cooperative diversity  techniques  that can be applied. This dissertation develops  a  framework  for  modeling  cooperative  connectivity  that  exposes  the relationship between available system resources and achievable cooperative connectivity. },

   Abstract = {Advances in microsensor and radio technology enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. The low-per node cost allows these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed. The nodes in these dense networks coordinate to perform the distributed sensing and actuation tasks. Moreover, as described in this paper, the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density so as to extend overall system lifetime. The large number of nodes deployed in this systems preclude manual configuration, and the environmental dynamics precludes design-time preconfiguration. Therefore, nodes have to self-configure to establish a topology that provides communication under stringent energy constraints. ASCENT builds on the notion that, as density increases, only a subset of the nodes is necessary to establish a routing forwarding backbone. In ASCENT, each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multihop network topology based on the measured operating region. This paper motivates and describes the ASCENT algorithm and presents analysis, simulation, and experimental measurements. We show that the system achieves linear increase in energy savings as a function of the density and the convergence time required in case of node failures while still providing adequate connectivity.},

The objective is to provide a probability density function that completely characterizes the relationship. Furthermore, we study individual link properties and their correlation with respect to common transmitters, receivers and geometrical location. The second objective is to develop a series of wireless network models that produce networks of arbitrary sizes with realistic properties. We use an iterative improvement-based optimization procedure to generate network instances that are statistically similar to empirically observed networks.

   Abstract = {We present practical models for the physical layer behaviors of packet reception and carrier sense with interference in static wireless networks. These models use measurements of a real network rather than abstract RF propagation models as the basis for accuracy in complex environments. Seeding our models requires N trials in an N node network, in which each sender transmits in turn and receivers measure RSSI values and packet counts, both of which are easily obtainable. The models then predict packet delivery and throughput in the same network for different sets of transmitters with the same node placements. We evaluate our models for the base case of two senders that broadcast packets simultaneously. We find that they are effective at predicting when there will be significant interference effects. Across many predictions, we obtain an RMS error for 802.11a and 802.11b of a half and a third, respectively, of a measurement-based model that ignores interference.},

Demodulators with piecewise-linear combining are proposed as an accurate approximation of the nonlinear ML detectors for coherent and noncoherent decode-and-forward (DF). The detectors with piecewise-linear combiner not only have certain implementation advantages over the nonlinear ML detectors, but also can lead to tight closed-form approximations for their error probabilities. High SNR approximations are derived based on the closed-form BER expressions. For noncoherent DF, the approximation suggests a different optimal location for the relay in DF than for the relay in amplify-and-forward (AF). A set of tight bounds of diversity order for coherent and noncoherent DF with multiple relays is also provided, and comparison between DF and AF suggests that DF with more than one relay loses about half of the diversity order of AF},

   Volume = {2},
   Pages = {945-952},
   Abstract = {In ad hoc networks, devices are required to self-organize themselves into a network without previously established infrastructure. The kind of ad hoc network we consider is made up of a multitude of relatively low mobility, short range, wireless devices, pervasively deployed throughout the environment. One of the most important design criteria for this type of network is energy efficiency. This paper looks at the energy efficiency aspect of the system design. Specifically, this paper looks at the optimum one-hop transmission distance that will minimize the total system energy. The analysis assumes that the individual devices do not have power control, but that the transmission range of all the devices as a group can be varied in the design stage. The results show that the optimum one-hop transmission distance is independent of the physical network topology, the number of transmission sources, and the total transmission distance. It only depends on the propagation environment and the device parameters. With this result, some system design trade offs can be made to minimize the total system energy. We discuss what these parameters are, how they interact with each other, and how they can be used to obtain an energy efficient wireless system. We also discuss the implications this result has for future developments of low bit rate, short range, and highly dense wireless devices for ad hoc networks.},

However, the exact and general BER expression of QAM with an arbitrary constellation size has not been derived yet. We provide an exact and general closed-form expression of the BER for one-dimensional and two-dimensional amplitude modulations, i.e., PAM and QAM, under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel when Gray code bit mapping is employed. The provided BER expressions offer a convenient way to evaluate the performance of PAM and QAM systems for various cases of practical interest. Moreover, simple approximations can be found from our expressions, which are the same as the well-known approximations, if only the dominant terms are considered.},

   Title = {CROSS-LAYER OPTIMIZATION IN ENERGY},
   School = {Stanford University},
   Abstract = {In this thesis we consider wireless networks with a hard energy constraint, where each node is powered by a small battery. Under this hard constraint, reducing energy consumption is the most important design consideration for such networks. Since all layers of the protocol stack contribute to the energy per bit consumed in its end-to-end transmission, energy minimization requires a joint design across all these layers as well as incorporating the underlying hardware characteristics.

In this thesis, we show that a joint optimization of the hardware, link, Multiple Access (MAC), and routing designs is a beneﬁcial and feasible approach to implement an energy efficient wireless network. We consider both the interference-free case (with TDMA-based orthogonal MAC) and the interference-limited case (with non-orthogonal MAC). For the ﬁrst case, we start with a point-to-point link, where we show that dramatic energy savings is possible when the tradeoff between the transmission energy and the circuit processing energy is explored by optimizing the transmission time and the constellation size. The results tell us that for short-range applications, bursty transmissions are preferred to minimize total energy consumption. We then consider a multiple access scenario, where multiple sensor nodes are sending data to a central node. By jointly designing the MAC layer and the link layer relative to the hardware power consumption, we propose a variable-length TDMA  cheme to minimize the total energy consumption. We then extend the joint optimization across the MAC and routing in addition to the hardware and link designs. We show that if link adaptation is not allowed, the energy minimization problem is a Linear Programming (LP) problem and can be efficiently solved. The solution tells us how to optimally route the traffic to minimize the total energy consumption across the network. If link adaptation is allowed, the total energy consumption can be further reduced while the optimization problem can be relaxed to a convex problem and efficient algorithms exist to obtain a near-optimal solution. For the interference-limited case with non-orthogonal channel usage, we decompose the cross-layer problem into two subproblems: (1) link scheduling; and (2) optimal rate adaptation and routing. The iteration between the two sub-problems will lead to an energy-efficient solution.

We then investigate cooperation between nodes to further reduce energy consumption. In particular, we show that by allowing multiple nodes to cooperate, we can construct virtual Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems to reduce both energy and delay. We then apply the joint routing, MAC, and link layer design optimization to this cooperative MIMO scheme. This optimization results in signiﬁcantly reduced energy consumption and delay across the network.},

Heuristics to compute approximate solutions and high-complexity algorithms to compute exact solutions have been previously proposed. In this paper, we focus on synchronous small-scale networks with interference-free link scheduling and practical MQAM link transmission schemes. We show that the cross-layer optimization problems can be closely approximated by convex optimization problems that can be efficiently solved. There are two main contributions of this paper. First of all, we minimize the total network energy that includes both transmission and circuit energy consumptions, where we explore the tradeoff between the two energy elements. Specifically, we use interference-free TDMA as the medium access control scheme. We optimize the routing flow, TDMA slot assignment, and MQAM modulation rate and power on each link. The results demonstrate that the minimum energy transmission scheme is a combination of multihop and single-hop transmissions for general networks; including circuit energy favors transmission schemes with fewer hops. Secondly, based on the solved optimal transmission scheme, we quantify the best trade-off curve between delay and energy consumption, where we derive a scheduling algorithm to minimize the worst-case packet delay.},

Assuming that the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is used by the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed, where the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an achievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal power allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum distortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion constraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors, i.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in multiple-input single-output (MISO) multiantenna systems when channel conditions are known to the transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under zero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy efficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the performance of virtual multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels for multi-hop transmission in wireless sensor networks. First, we propose a clustered network topology with sensor nodes grouped in collaborative sets attending to proximity. Then, we propose that all nodes belonging to any given cluster cooperatively transmit and receive data from other clusters, exploiting the diversity advantages of cluster-to-cluster Virtual MIMO channels. In order to construct the cooperative transmission, we arrange each hop into two consecutive time slots: the Intracluster Slot, that accounts for data sharing within the cluster, and the Intercluster Slot for transmission between clusters; and we devise a cooperative reception protocol within the clusters based upon a simpliﬁed selection diversity algorithm. Optimum time assignment and power allocation for both slots are derived taking the cluster-to-cluster probability of outage as the metric. Results for one hop networks and for multi-hop networks are obtained, showing substantial diversity gains and energy savings. Furthermore,  results show that the performance of the proposed virtual MIMO channels is equal to that of real MIMO channels but for a small SNR loss.},

   Abstract = {The large number of network nodes and the energy constraints make Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) one of the most important application fields for Cooperative Diversity. Node cooperation increases the spatial diversity of wireless channels and, thus, reduces the transmitted power. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop WSN with nodes grouped in cooperative clusters that exploits transmit and receive cooperation among cluster nodes. Multi-hop transmission is carried out by concatenating single cluster-to-cluster hops, where every cluster-to-cluster link is defined as a cooperative distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel. Transmit diversity is exploited through a time-division, decoder-and-forward, relaying scheme based upon two time slots: the Intracluster Slot, used for data sharing within the cluster, and the Intercluster Slot, used for transmission between clusters. At the receiver side, a distributed reception protocol is devised based upon a Selection Diversity algorithm. The proposed multi-hop cooperative WSN is optimally designed for minimum end-to-end outage probability by deriving the optimum time and power allocated on the intracluster and intercluster slots of every single hop, given a per-link energy constraint. A simplified suboptimum resource allocation is also proposed, which performs close to the optimal policy. Results show that the proposed scheme achieves diversity equal to the equivalent MIMO system and significantly reduces energy consumption with respect to. the non-cooperative channel},

Several opportunistic relaying strategies are developed to fully utilize the available channel information. Then an explicit expression of the outage probability is developed for each proposed cooperative scheme as well as the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff by using order statistics. Our analytical results show that the more channel information available at the transmitter, the better performance a cooperative system can achieve. When the exact values of the source-relay channels are available, the performance loss at low SNR can be effectively suppressed. When the source node has the access to the source-relay and relay-destination channels, the full diversity can be achieved by costing only one extra channel used for relaying transmission, and an optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be achieved d(r) = (N + 1) (1-2r), where N is the number of all possible relaying nodes.},

   Title = {Wireless Sensor Networks: Energy Efﬁciency, Delay Guarantee and Fault Tolerance},
   School = {UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY},
   Abstract = {Wireless sensor systems contain new types of computing machines and run different kinds of applications in a variety of physical environments, which offers many challenges. The main design constraints of many sensor network applications are energy efﬁciency, delay guarantee and fault tolerance. Since these constraints impact multiple protocol layers, a joint design across all layers becomes indispensable in designing a protocol for sensor networks. In this thesis, we take the cross-layer design approach to improve the performance of protocol layers by taking into account parameters in other layers instead of merging them into one layer to preserve modularity. In addition to the interactions from lower to higher layers, the interactions from higher to lower layers are included to exploit application-speciﬁc characteristics of sensor networks such as many-to-one communication, collaborative processing and asymmetry of constraints.

We ﬁrst illustrate the use of sensor networks in trafﬁc applications. We show that sensor nodes provide a vehicle detection accuracy higher than that of the current standard
vehicle detection scheme, inductive loops. Moreover, the high spatial density associated with the magnetic sensors allows us to classify the vehicles and even re-identify them. We then propose a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) MAC protocol, PEDAMACS, that achieves both energy efﬁciency and delay guarantee. Although it is known that there is a tradeoff between delay and energy, PEDAMACS demonstrates that one can achieve both of them by using special characteristics of sensor networks: many-to-one and asymmetric communication. We then develop TDMA scheduling algorithms that take into account the many-to-one communication characteristic of sensor networks to decrease the delay. 
We formulate the lifetime maximization as a linear programming (LP) problem with the goal of determining optimal routing paths in the network. We extend the energy efﬁcient routing to introduce anytime delay guarantee. We show that the traditional way of introducing delay constraint via capacity constraints only provide average delay performance. Anytime delay guarantee is a restriction on the routing trees after the decomposition of the LP solution. A distributed algorithm is proposed to illustrate the trade-off between delay and energy efﬁciency. We also extend the energy efﬁcient routing to include multiple paths between each source and destination in the network to provide the resiliency of the network to link  failures. We furthermore investigate the effect of physical layer and application layer characteristics on multi-hop routing.

Next we consider energy saving via data compression and relay nodes. We focus on energy efﬁciency and fault tolerance of data compression schemes in multi-hop networks. It has previously been shown that Slepian-Wolf based coding provides higher energy efﬁciency than joint entropy coding based on explicit communication in sensor networks. We show that the fault tolerance of the ﬁrst approach is so low that the latter may be preferred in the presence of link failures. We then generalize the analysis by considering the errors occurring at the analog-to-digital converter, namely, quantization noise, circuit noise, aperture uncertainty and comparator ambiguity. We show that previously proposed sampling schemes fail to decrease a subset of these errors above some ﬁnite sampling rate. An advanced dither-based scheme is proposed with the goal of reducing all of these errors by increasing the density of the nodes. The energy consumption of the proposed scheme is analyzed to understand the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption. Finally, we focus on the interaction between energy efﬁcient routing and topology control. The problem of the best placement of relay nodes has been formulated with the goal of increasing the network lifetime by helping the existing nodes forward the packets. This optimization results in signiﬁcant energy saving across the network.},

For the most part, this is due to the compelling applications that will be enabled once wireless microsensor networks are in place; location-sensing, environmental sensing, medical monitoring and similar applications are all gaining interest. However, wireless microsensor networks pose numerous design challenges. For applications requiring long-term, robust sensing, such as military reconnaissance, one important challenge is to design sensor networks that have long system lifetimes. This challenge is especially difficult due to the energy-constrained nature of the devices. In order to design networks that have extremely long lifetimes, we propose a physical layer driven approach to designing protocols and algorithms. We first present a hardware model for our wireless sensor node and then introduce the design of physical layer aware protocols, algorithms, and applications that minimize energy consumption of the system. Our approach prescribes methods that can be used at all levels of the hierarchy to take advantage of the underlying hardware. We also show how to reduce energy consumption of non-ideal hardware through physical layer aware algorithms and protocols.},

The new scheme uses a linear-prediction-based channel equalization technique to mitigate the effect of asynchronism. The performance of the new scheme is analyzed and demonstrated by simulations.},

   Abstract = {Small, inexpensive sensors with limited memory, computing power and short battery lifetimes are turning into reality. Due to adverse conditions such as high noise levels, extreme humidity or temperatures, or even destructions from unfriendly entities, sensor node failures may become norms rather than exceptions in real environments. To be practical, sensor networks must last for much longer times than that of individual nodes, and have yet to be robust against potentially frequent node failures. This paper presents the design of PEAS, a simple protocol that can build a long-lived sensor network and maintain robust operations using large quantities of economical, short-lived sensor nodes. PEAS extends system functioning time by keeping only a necessary set of sensors working and putting the rest into sleep mode. Sleeping ones wake up now and then, probing the local environment and replacing failed ones. The sleeping periods are self-adjusted dynamically, so as to keep the sensors' wakeup rate roughly constant, thus adapting to high node densities.},

We are given a set of source-destination pairs. Each source may use multiple routes to transport traffic to the destination at specified data rates. The traffic transported on each route between each src-dst pair is subject to an end-to-end delay guarantee. We present a 2-tier hierarchical solution to solve the above problem. At the bottom tier, each link transmits packets to minimize its long-term average power subject to long-term average delay constraints (BE Collins and RL Cruz, 1999). Given this packet transmission policy at every link and the associated energy-delay and energy-rate trade-off relations, we perform a network-wide optimization of traffic flows at the top tier. This problem is framed as a non-differentiable convex optimization problem is and solved using an incremental sub-gradient optimization technique. We implement our algorithm over sample network topologies and compare its performance with alternate algorithms, noting significant insight of the flow allocation policy as well as substantial gains in energy efficiency and throughput.},

   Abstract = {We analyze the lifetime of clustered sensor networks with decentralized binary detection under a physical layer quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, given by the maximum tolerable probability of decision error at the access point (AP). In order to properly model the network behavior, we consider four different distributions (exponential, uniform, Rayleigh, and lognormal) for the lifetime of a single sensor. We show the benefits, in terms of longer network lifetime, of adaptive reclustering. We also derive an analytical framework for the computation of the network lifetime and the penalty, in terms of time delay and energy consumption, brought by adaptive reclustering. On the other hand, absence of reclustering leads to a shorter network lifetime, and we show the impact of various clustering configurations under different QoS conditions. Our results show that the organization of sensors in a few big clusters is the winning strategy to maximize the network lifetime. Moreover, the observation of the phenomenon should be frequent in order to limit the penalties associated with the reclustering procedure. We also apply the developed framework to analyze the energy consumption associated with the proposed reclustering protocol, obtaining results in good agreement with the performance of realistic wireless sensor networks. Finally, we present simulation results on the lifetime of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks, which enrich the proposed analytical framework and show that typical networking performance metrics (such as throughput and delay) are influenced by the sensor network lifetime.},

   Abstract = {We seek to maximize the data throughput of an energy and time constrained transmitter sending data over a fading channel. The transmitter has a fixed amount of energy and a limited amount of time to send data. Given that the channel fade state determines the throughput obtained per unit of energy expended, the goal is to obtain a policy for scheduling transmissions that maximizes the expected data throughput. We develop a dynamic programming formulation that leads to an optimal closed-form transmission schedule. We then extend our approach to the problem of minimizing the energy required to send a fixed amount of data over a fading channel given deadline constraints.},

We present ﬁndings from a large scale empirical study involving over 150 such nodes operated at various transmission power settings. The instrumentation in our experiments permits us to separate effects at the various layers of the protocol  stack. At the link layer, we present statistics on packet reception, effective communication range and link asymmetry; at the MAC layer, we measure contention, collision and latency; and at the application layer, we analyze the structure of trees constructed using ﬂooding. The study reveals that even a simple protocol, ﬂooding, can exhibit surprising complexity at scale. The data and analysis lay a foundation for a much wider set of algorithmic studies in this space.},

   Abstract = {We take a cross-layer optimization approach to study energy efficient data transport in coalition-based wireless sensor networks,  where neighboring nodes are organized into groups to form coalitions and sensor nodes within one coalition carry out cooperative communications. In particular, we investigate two network models: (1) many-to-one sensor networks where data from one coalition are transmitted to the sink directly, and (2) multihop sensor networks where data are transported by intermediate nodes  to reach the sink. For the many-to-one network model, we propose three schemes for data transmission from a coalition to the sink. In scheme 1, one node in the coalition is selected randomly to transmit the data; in scheme 2, the node with the best channel  condition in the coalition transmits the data; and in scheme 3, all the nodes in the coalition transmit in a cooperative manner. Next, we investigate energy balancing with cooperative data transport in multihop sensor networks. Built on the above coalition-aided  data transmission schemes, the optimal coalition planning is then carried out in multihop networks, in the sense that unequal coalition sizes are applied to minimize the difference of energy consumption among sensor nodes. Numerical analysis reveals that  energy efficiency can be improved signiﬁcantly by the coalition-aided transmission schemes, and that energy balancing across the
sensor nodes can be achieved with the proposed coalition structures.},

   Abstract = {Information flow in a telecommunication network is accomplished through the interaction of mechanisms at various design layers with the end goal of supporting the information exchange needs of the applications. In wireless networks in particular, the different layers interact in a nontrivial manner in order to support information transfer. In this text we will present abstract models that capture the cross-layer interaction from the physical to transport layer in wireless network architectures including cellular, ad-hoc and sensor networks as well as hybrid wireless-wireline. The model allows for arbitrary network topologies as well as traffic forwarding modes, including datagrams and virtual circuits. Furthermore the time varying nature of a wireless network, due either to fading channels or to changing connectivity due to mobility, is adequately captured in our model to allow for state dependent network control policies. Quantitative performance measures that capture the quality of service requirements in these systems depending on the supported applications are discussed, including throughput maximization, energy consumption minimization, rate utility function maximization as well as general performance functionals. Cross-layer control algorithms with optimal or suboptimal performance with respect to the above measures are presented and analyzed.

A detailed energy expenditure analysis of not only the physical layer but also the link and network layer provides a basis for developing new energy efficient wireless sensor networks. Regular, coordinated sleeping extends the lifetime of sensor nodes, but systems can only benefit from sleeping in terms of transmitted packets if the data arrival rate to the system is low. Energy efficiency is the driving motivation for it can be considered the most important factor for wireless sensor networks because of the power constraints set by battery operation. Radio solutions in the lower ISM bands are attractive because of their relatively easy implementation and low power consumption. However, the data rates of these commercial radios are also relatively low, limiting transmittable frame sizes to a few tens of octets along with strict duty cycle requirements. From the analysis we extract key parameters of selected MAC protocols and show that some traditional mechanisms, such as binary exponential backoff, have some inherent problems. We also argue that single-hop communications has up to 40% lower energy consumption than multihop forwarding within the feasible transmission distances of an ISM radio.},

Both arguments stem from a simplified analysis based on crude channel models that neglects delay, end-to-end reliability, bias power consumption, the impact of channel coding, mobility, and routing overhead. In this article we shed more light on these issues by listing 18 reasons why short-hop routing is not as beneficial as it seems to be. We also provide experimental evidence to support this claim. The conclusion is that for many networks, long-hop routing is in every aspect a very competitive strategy.},

   Abstract = {Most MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork) research assumes idealized propagation models. Experimental results have shown signiﬁcant divergence from simulation results due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication channels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol performance. We ﬁrst study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show that its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading. We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the  presence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions between the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and make observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example, the criteria for determining the best path should
not only consider the link status but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route failure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them.},

It is shown that the presented results can either be exact or tight lower bounds on the performance of these systems depending on the choice of the relay gain. More specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the moment generating function of the reciprocal of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and we then use this expression to calculate the outage probability via numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. Numerical examples show that regeneration is more crucial at low average SNR and for multihop systems with a large number of hops.},

   Pages = {1999-2004},
   Abstract = {Relayed transmission is a way to attain broader coverage by splitting the communication link from the source to the destination into several shorter links/hops. One of the main advantages of this communication technique is that it distributes the use of power throughout the hops. This implies longer battery life and lower interference introduced to the rest of the network. In this context, this paper investigates the optimal allocation of power over these links/hops for a given power budget. All hops are assumed to be subject to independent Rayleigh fading. Outage probability which is the probability that the link quality from source to destination falls below a certain threshold is used as the optimization criterion. Numerical results show that optimizing the allocation of power enhances the system performance, especially if the links are highly unbalanced in terms of their average fading power or if the number of hops is large. Interestingly, they also show that nonregenerative systems with optimum power allocation can outperform regenerative systems with no power optimization.},

LEACH includes a new, distributed cluster formation technique that enables self-organization of large numbers of nodes, algorithms for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes, and techniques to enable distributed signal processing to save communication resources. Our results show that LEACH can improve system lifetime by an order of magnitude compared with general-purpose multihop approaches.},

Taking into account radio propagation conditions, density of nodes, size of the network, traffic load per node and MAC protocol characteristics, we present a calculation method for the estimation of interference power sum statistics in wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. The accuracy of the calculation method is verified by simulations.

   Abstract = {Cooperative communications have been proposed to exploit the spatial diversity gains inherent in multiuser wireless systems without the need of multiple antennas at each node. This is achieved by having the users relay each others messages and thus forming multiple transmission paths to the destination. In resource constrained networks, such as wireless sensor networks, the advantages of cooperation can be further exploited by optimally allocating the energy and bandwidth resources among users based on the available channel state information (CSI) at each node. In the first part of this article, we provide a tutorial survey on various power allocation strategies for cooperative networks based on different cooperation strategies, optimizing criteria, and CSI assumptions. In the second part, we identify the similarities between cooperative networks and several sensor network applications that utilize collaboration among distributed sensors to achieve the system goal. These applications include decentralized detection/estimation and data gathering. The techniques developed in cooperative communications can be used to solve many sensor network problems},

The idea is to let the nodes in the network act as asynchronous relays to a specific leader, generating an avalanche of signals which we call opportunistic large array (OLA). The accumulation of power in the medium coming from the interfering signals constructs a signal space for each receiver node that can be acquired through training or blindly. The acquisition of the signal space allows the leader to flood the network without higher layer intervention. Compared to other approaches that are based on the network layer and use point-to-point links to flood the network, we show that the proposed flooding algorithm achieves higher efficiency in the end-to-end delay and has a higher delivery ratio due to the accumulation of energy. In fact, a major contribution of this paper is mapping the multiple-access network problem into a single user problem and then using signal processing techniques to solve it instead of networking algorithms.},

The converse is true for shorter transmission range. We illustrate our model by comparing three transmission strategies. Our results show that the network can achieve better performance by suitably controlling the transmission range. One of the transmission strategies, namely transmitting to the nearest forward neighbor by using adjustable transmission power, has desirable features in a high terminal density environment.},

Recently, a  MIMO-based structure has been proposed to offer enhanced energy savings in WSNs. In this paper we examine and compare MIMO-based WSN with a multihop transmission in terms of energy efficiency. The results depend on the network density, the channel conditions and the distance to the destination node. We reach analytical expressions to calculate threshold values of these parameters, which determine the areas where the MIMO-based structure outperforms multihop transmission. Moreover, we present a detailed analysis of the dissipated power during a sensor node’s operation, to prove that as micro-electronics develop the MIMO-based architecture will outperform the equivalent multihop structure for most of the cases examined. Finally, we implement a simple Cooperative Node selection algorithm to achieve higher energy gains in the MIMO approach, and examine how this algorithm affects the calculated thresholds. },

   Abstract = {Coding strategies that exploit node cooperation are developed for relay networks. Two basic schemes are studied: the relays decode-and-forward the source message to the destination, or they compress-and-forward their channel outputs to the destination. The decode-and-forward scheme is a variant of multihopping, but in addition to having the relays successively decode the message, the transmitters cooperate and each receiver uses several or all of its past channel output blocks to decode. For the compress-and-forward scheme, the relays take advantage of the statistical dependence between their channel outputs and the destination's channel output. The strategies are applied to wireless channels, and it is shown that decode-and-forward achieves the ergodic capacity with phase fading if phase information is available only locally, and if the relays are near the source node. The ergodic capacity coincides with the rate of a distributed antenna array with full cooperation even though the transmitting antennas are not colocated. The capacity results generalize broadly, including to multiantenna transmission with Rayleigh fading, single-bounce fading, certain quasi-static fading problems, cases where partial channel knowledge is available at the transmitters, and cases where local user cooperation is permitted. The results further extend to multisource and multidestination networks such as multiaccess and broadcast relay channels.},

   Abstract = {We discuss a statistical model to generate correlated shadow-fading patterns for wireless systems in the absence of detailed propagation and landscape information. The current model of shadow-fading postulates a log-normal marginal distribution for the fading values, and does not address correlations. Subsequent introduction of correlations via autocorrelation models for individual mobiles results in anomalous effects that depend on traffic density and mobility. Our approach involves generating a pre-computed set of fading values with the right marginal distributions and spatial correlations. Motivated from statistical physics, the correlations are introduced in terms of “interaction” parameters, which can be computed from local measurements. The model is efficiently implemented using standard linear-algebra methods and is amenable to a statistical mechanics treatment. Numerical results show that the patterns produced are sufficiently clustered and appear reasonable to visual inspection.},

   School = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
   Abstract = {To effiectively combat multipath fading across multiple protocol layers in wireless networks, this dissertation develops energy-efficient algorithms that employ certain kinds of cooperation among terminals, and illustrates how one might incorporate these algorithms into
various network architectures. In these techniques, sets of terminals relay signals for each  other to create a virtual antenna array, trading of the costs—in power, bandwidth, and complexity—for the greater beneﬁts gained by exploiting spatial diversity in the channel. By contrast, classical network architectures only employ point-to-point transmission and  thus forego these beneﬁts.
After summarizing a model for the wireless channel, we present various practical cooperative diversity algorithms based upon diﬀerent types of relay processing and re-encoding, both with and without limited feedback from the ultimate receivers. Using information-theoretic tools, we show that all these algorithms can achieve full spatial diversity, as if each terminal had as many transmit antennas as the entire set of cooperating terminals. Such diversity gains translate into greatly improved robustness to fading for the same transmit power, or substantially reduced transmit power for the same level of performance. For example, with two cooperating terminals, power savings as much as 12 dB (a factor of
sixteen) are possible for outage probabilities around one in a thousand. Finally, we discuss how the required level of complexity in the terminals makes diﬀerent algorithms suitable for particular network architectures that arise in, for example, current cellular and ad-hoc networks.},

The underlying techniques exploit space diversity available through cooperating terminals' relaying signals for one another. We outline several strategies employed by the cooperating radios, including fixed relaying schemes such as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward, selection relaying schemes that adapt based upon channel measurements between the cooperating terminals, and incremental relaying schemes that adapt based upon limited feedback from the destination terminal. We develop performance characterizations in terms of outage events and associated outage probabilities, which measure robustness of the transmissions to fading, focusing on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Except for fixed decode-and-forward, all of our cooperative diversity protocols are efficient in the sense that they achieve full diversity (i.e., second-order diversity in the case of two terminals), and, moreover, are close to optimum (within 1.5 dB) in certain regimes. Thus, using distributed antennas, we can provide the powerful benefits of space diversity without need for physical arrays, though at a loss of spectral efficiency due to half-duplex operation and possibly at the cost of additional receive hardware. Applicable to any wireless setting, including cellular or ad hoc networks-wherever space constraints preclude the use of physical arrays-the performance characterizations reveal that large power or energy savings result from the use of these protocols.},

In particular, a source initiates transmission to its destination, and many relays potentially receive the transmission. Those terminals that can fully decode the transmission utilize a space-time code to cooperatively relay to the destination. We demonstrate that these protocols achieve full spatial diversity in the number of cooperating terminals, not just the number of decoding relays, and can be used effectively for higher spectral efficiencies than repetition-based schemes. We discuss issues related to space-time code design for these protocols, emphasizing codes that readily allow for appealing distributed versions.},

Multihop networks use some form of cooperation by enabling intermediate nodes to forward the message from source to destination. However, cooperative communication techniques described in this article are fundamentally different in that the relaying nodes can forward the information fully or in part. Also the destination receives multiple versions of the message from the source, and one or more relays and combines these to obtain a more reliable estimate of the transmitted signal as well as higher data rates. The main advantages of cooperative communications are presented.},

   Abstract = {Radio signal strength (RSS) is an attractive property since it can be obtained without additional hardware. Based on various signal propagation models that describe the relationship between RSS and distance, RSS can be employed in network connectivity, localization, and link quality issues. However, the deterministic propagation models, 
in which RSS is only determined by distance, are far from reality. In this paper, we carefully design a series of experiments using MICA2 nodes in real environments to investigate the parameters besides distance––frequency,  variation of transceivers, antenna orientation, battery voltage, temporal-spatial properties of environment, and en-
vironmental dynamics. Their impacts on RSS are measured comprehensively and independently. Based on our experimental results, we build an analytic model of node height, which has the greatest impact in our measurements.  We also derive the log-normal error model of RSS-based distance estimation from the underlying propagation mod-
els and find out that the popular noisy disk error model always underestimates distance error. Some possible solutions to handle the irregularity of RSS are discussed. Our work would be a reference for future work on RSS-based  solutions in sensor networks.},

In this paper, we propose a simple target detection method and analyze its performance for both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. Specifically, we illustrate cooperative diversity when the channels have fading. Based on this analysis, we show that by using medium access control (MAC) protocols, cooperative diversity is enabled. Power consumption, bandwidth efficiency, and performance tradeoffs are considered for different MAC protocols. Simulation results confirm the theoretical claims.},

   Abstract = {We consider a cooperative wireless network where the source broadcasts data to relays, some or all of which cooperatively beamform to forward the data to the destination. The network is subject to an overall outage constraint. We generalize the standard approaches for cooperative communications in two respects: (i) we explicitly model and factor in the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI), and (ii) we consider more general, yet simple, selection rules for the relays and compute the optimal one among them. These rules include as special cases several relay selection criteria proposed in the literature. We present analytical results for the homogeneous case, where the links have identical mean channel gains. For this case, we show that the optimal transmission scheme is simple and can be computed efﬁciently. Numerical results show that while the cost of training and feedback of CSI is signiﬁcant, relay cooperation is still beneﬁcial.},

   Abstract = {We consider the joint optimal design of the physical, medium access control (MAC), and routing layers to maximize the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. The problem of computing lifetime-optimal routing flow, link schedule, and link transmission powers for all active time slots is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem. We first restrict the link schedules to the class of interference-free time division multiple access (TDMA) schedules. In this special case, we formulate the optimization problem as a mixed integerconvex program, which can be solved using standard techniques. Moreover, when the slots lengths are variable, the optimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently and exactly using interior point methods. For general non-orthogonal link schedules, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between adaptive link scheduling and computation of optimal link rates and transmission powers for a fixed link schedule. The performance of this algorithm is compared to other design approaches for several network topologies. The results illustrate the advantages of load balancing, multihop routing, frequency reuse, and interference mitigation in increasing the lifetime of energy-constrained networks. We also briefly discuss computational approaches to extend this algorithm to large networks},

A number of mobility models is considered ranging from the classical Random Direction model to the Virtual World  model based on the mobility measurements of a multi–player game. We introduce
an Attractor model as a simple way to model non–homogeneous node distribution by incorporating viscosity regions in the simulation area.

   Abstract = {Multi-user cooperative diversity is a recent technique promising great improvement of the performance of wireless  communication systems operating in fading environments. Based on combinatorial optimization theory and speciﬁcally on the so-called knapsack problem, this paper presents a method of optimizing the selection among the potential cooperating users, when amplify-and-forward relays are used. In particular, two  optimization problems are studied: the error probability minimization subject to total energy consumption constraints, and the dual one, the energy consumption minimization under error performance constraints. Depending on the frequency of repeating this selection, the above problems are categorized into shortterm and long-term node selection. Numerical examples verify the expected knapsack scheme’s  advantage of adapting the number of cooperating users, depending on the desired performance-consumption tradeoff. Moreover, long-term node selection seems to lead to similar error or consumption performance compared to the short-term one, despite its simplicity.},

   Title = {Spatial Diversity in MIMO Communication Systems with Distributed or Co-located Antennas},
   Abstract = {THE USE OF multiple antennas in wireless communication systems has gained much attention during the last decade. It was shown that  ultiple-antenna systems, called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, oﬀer huge advantages over single antenna systems, both with regard to capacity and error performance. Typically, quite restrictive assumptions are made in the literature on MIMO systems concerning the spacing of the individual antenna elements. On the one hand, it is typically assumed that the antenna elements at the transmitter and the receiver are co-located, i.e., they belong to some sort of antenna array. On the other hand, it is often assumed that the antenna spacings are suﬃciently large, so as to justify the assumption of independent fading on the individual transmission links. From numerous publications it is known that spatially correlated links caused by insuﬃcient antenna spacings lead to a loss in capacity and error performance. In the ﬁrst part of the thesis, it is shown that this is also the case when the individual transmit or receive antennas are spatially distributed on a large scale.  ossible applications include simulcast networks, reach-back links for wireless sensors, as well as wireless networks with cooperating relays. peciﬁcally, it is proven that any spatially correlated MIMO system can be transformed into an equivalent (with regard to the resulting capacity distribution) spatially distributed MIMO system, and vice versa. Moreover, the asymptotic equivalence with regard to the pairwise error probability of space-time codes is proven. Correspondingly, MIMO systems with distributed antennas and MIMO systems with co-located antennas can be treated in a single, unifying framework.

This fact is utilized in the second part of the thesis, where appropriate transmit power allocation strategies are developed for MIMO systems with distributed or co-located transmit antennas. In particular, fading scenarios are taken into account that occur especially in distributed MIMO systems. Focus is on power allocation schemes that require solely statistical channel knowledge at the transmitter side, which can easily be acquired in practical systems. By means of analytical results, it is shown that signiﬁcant performance gains in comparison to equal power allocation are achieved.

The third part of the thesis focuses on two problems that are of particular interest for MIMO systems with distributed transmit antennas. First, due to the distributed nature of the system, independent local oscillators are employed for up-converting the individual transmitted signals. This causes frequency oﬀsets between the transmission links, which results in time-varying channel impulse responses. The impact of frequency oﬀsets on the performance of diﬀerent space-time coding techniques is analyzed, and possible counter measures are considered. Second, if the transmit antennas are spaced very far apart and novitiming advance techniques are employed, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent propagation delays occur that lead to intersymbol interference eﬀects. To this end, suitable space-time coding and equalization techniques are identiﬁed, so as to maintain a diversity advantage in comparison to a single-antenna system.},

   Abstract = {In interference-rich and noisy environment, wireless  communication is often hampered by unreliable communication links. Recently, there has been active research on  cooperative communication that improves the communication reliability by having a collection of radio terminals transmit signals in a cooperative way. This paper proposes a medium access control  (MAC) algorithm, called Cooperative Diversity Medium Access Control (CD-MAC), which exploits the cooperative communication capability to provide robust communication in wireless ad hoc networks. In CD-MAC, each terminal proactively selects a relay and lets it transmit simultaneously whenever necessary, mitigating interference from nearby terminals and thus improving the network performance. The proposed CD-MAC algorithm is designed based on the widely adopted 
IEEE 802.11 MAC for practicality. For accurate evaluation, this study presents and uses a realistic reception model by taking bit error rate (BER), derived from Intersil  HFA3861B radio hardware,  as well as  frame error rate (FER) into consideration. System-level simulation study shows that CD-MAC significantly outperforms the original IEEE 802.11 MAC in terms of packet delivery ratio. },

Space-time block codes are designed to achieve maximum diversity for a given number of transmit and receive antennas with very simple decoding algorithm. In radio fading channel, STBC require less transmission energy than SISO technique for the same bit error rate and can be employed practically in wireless sensor networks by using the cooperative MIMO scheme. Considering Alamouti and Tarokh space-time block codes, the number of antennas at both the transmission and the reception sides are selected with respect to the transmission distance. By using cooperative MIMO transmission instead of SISO, it is shown that the distance between nodes can be increased and a large amount of the total energy can be saved for middle and long distance transmission. The energy efficiency of cooperative MIMO over SISO and multihop SISO is proved by simulations, and a multi-hop technique for cooperative MIMO is also proposed for good energy-efficiency and limited number of available cooperative nodes},

We consider a wireless transmitter which is limited by its finite battery resource.

To achieve this, we exploit two previously unconnected ideas: (i) channel coding can be used to conserve energy by transmitting at reduced power levels over longer durations; (ii) electro-chemical mechanisms in batteries allow them to recover energy during idle periods. While the first idea favors extending transmission durations, the second idea requires the transmitter to be idle to allow for recovery. Therefore, a strategy which is based entirely on either one or the other idea is not optimal. We provide a framework to merge these two ideas. We consider two kinds of delay constraints, one a deadline constraint and the other an average delay constraint and show that energy aware scheduling strategies for both these scenarios can result in significant energy savings.},

In all, four completely different methods for the computation of the coefficients of the simulation model are introduced. Furthermore, the performance of each procedure is investigated on the basis of two quality criteria. All the presented methods have in common the fact that the resulting simulation model has a completely determined fading behavior for all time. Therefore, the simulation model can be interpreted as a deterministic model that approximates stochastic processes such as Rayleigh, log-normal, and Suzuki (1977) processes},

In general it was observed that, the number of clusters to optimize the energy consumption is a non-increasing function of long haul distance. By virtue of this, we conclude that as the long haul distance increases the cooperation among the nodes increases. Also, for large long haul distances the optimal number of clusters is shown to converge to a constant. Next, we propose a provably convergent block coordinate descent algorithm to determine the optimal joint rate and number of clusters. Through our numerical results it was observed that a cluster optimized cooperative MIMO transmission scheme can be more energy efficient than a rate only optimized scheme. Also a joint rate and cluster optimized transmission scheme can yield large scale energy savings for short and medium range applications compared to the rate only or cluster only optimized transmission schemes.},

In this paper, we investigate a binary decentralized detection problem in a dense wireless sensor network. We consider a scenario in which sensor observations, conditioned on the alternate hypothesis, are independent but not identically distributed across the sensor nodes. We consider two different fusion architectures, namely, the parallel fusion architecture and the cooperate fusion architecture. For each architecture, we derive expressions for the probability of decision error at the fusion center. We analyze the impact of a realistic sensing model, and flooding protocol on the system reliability and energy consumption for both architectures. We demonstrate that a trade-off exists among spatial diversity gain, average energy consumption, node density, and POI intensity in the cooperative architecture.},

Unidirectional links may exist in a real network due to variations in transmission power of different nodes, noise or other signal propagation phenomena, and heterogeneity in the transmission hardware of nodes in the network. We introduce a sub-layer called sub routing layer, SRL, between the network and the MAC layer to provide a bidirectional abstraction of the unidirectional network to the routing protocols. We present a scalable and efficient way to provide this abstraction by finding and maintaining multi-hop reverse routes to each unidirectional link. We simulate SRL and a modified version of AODV (ad hoc on demand distance vector) that uses SRL to route packets in a unidirectional network. We observed that with SRL, the packet delivery of AODV in unidirectional networks increases substantially. Further our simulations indicate that reverse routes are often only a few hops long and hence the overhead of using SRL is very low.},

   Title = {Performance analysis of cooperative communication for wireless networks},
   Abstract = {The demand for access to information when and where you need has motivated the transition of wireless communications from a fixed infrastructure based cellular communications technology to a more pervasive adhoc wireless networking technology. Challenges still remain in wireless adhoc networks in terms of meeting higher capacity demands, improved reliability and longer connectivity before it becomes a viable widespread commercial technology. Present day wireless mesh networking uses node-to-node serial multi-hop communication to convey information from source to destination in the network. The performance of such a network depends on finding the best possible route between the source and destination nodes. However the end-to-end performance can only be as good as the weakest link within a chosen route. Unlike wired networks, the quality of point-to-point links in a wireless mesh network is subject to random fluctuations. This adversely affects the performance resulting in poor throughput and poor energy efficiency. 

In recent years, a new paradigm for communication called cooperative communications has been proposed for which initial information theoretic studies have shown the potential for improvements in capacity over traditional multi-hop wireless networks. Cooperative communication involves exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to form virtual antenna arrays out of independent single-antenna network nodes for transmission. In this research we explore the fundamental performance limits of cooperative communication under more practical operating scenarios. Specifically we provide a framework for computing the outage and ergodic capacities of non identical distributed MIMO links, study the effect of time synchronization error on system performance, analyze the end-to-end average bit error rate (ABER) performance under imperfect relaying, and study range extension and energy efficiency offered by the system when compared to a traditional system.},

In sensor networks, the power spent for listening and computing can constitute a significant portion of the total consumed power, and such an overhead can reduce the gains promised by cooperation. In this paper, cooperation gains are investigated by taking into consideration such overheads in the analytical framework. The performance metric considered is the energy efficiency of the system measured by the total power required to achieve a certain quality of service requirement. The analytical and numerical results reveal very interesting threshold behavior below which direct transmission is more energy efficient, and above which cooperation provides more gains. Such a tradeoff is shown to depend on many parameters such as the relative locations of the source and destination, the values of the receive and processing powers, the application, and many other factors. Moreover, there are experimental results conducted to verify the channel model assumed in the paper},

Lifetime can be maximized if and only if a balanced network can be formed. In this research work we first identify the tasks, that a sensor node accomplishes in its life time. Based on those, we define the sensor node life-cycle. Then we characterize the nodes based on their residual energy levels as, SEN - nodes having sufficient energy to perform additional responsibilities other than its own sensing task, or NEN - nodes having only necessary energy to perform its own task. Every node starts as SEN, and at some point it becomes NEN based on a predefined threshold value. Thus the nodes are protected from the early exhaustion. Finally, we developed a virtual clustering technique which is self-configurable and scalable. We apply our approach to a simulation environment and the simulation results justify our assertion.},

   Abstract = {Received signal power in mobile wireless communications is typically modeled as a product of three factors: distance-dependent average path loss law, variation in the local mean power (shadow fading), and small-scale fading. Of these three factors, the least investigated is the shadow fading, which is usually explained as a result of multiplication of large number of random attenuating factors in the radio channel. In this paper, the authors propose an additive model as an alternative physical basis for shadow fading within an "extended local area" where path loss is constant. Starting from a sum-of-sinusoids signal model, they show that under mild statistical assumptions on the powers of the sinusoids, the resulting signal power will have approximately Gaussian distribution in logarithmic scale. A cluster-based model for shadow fading emerges as a special instance of the general result. They present simulation and measurement results that support their theoretical findings. The new physical basis for shadow fading also provides insights into simulation and modeling of radio channels},

   Abstract = {This paper describes Extremely Opportunistic Routing (ExOR), a new unicast routing technique for multi-hop wireless networks. ExOR forwards each packet through a sequence of nodes, deferring the choice of each node in the sequence until after the previous node has transmitted the packet on its radio. ExOR then determines which node, of all the nodes that successfully received that transmission, is the node closest to the destination. That closest node transmits the packet. The result is that each hop moves the packet farther (or average) than the hops of the best possible pre-determined route.The ExOR design addresses the challenge of choosing a forwarding node after transmission using a distributed algorithm. First, when a node transmits a packet, it includes in the packet a simple schedule describing the priority order in which the potential receivers should forward the packet. The node computes the schedule based on shared measurements of inter-node delivery rates. ExOR then uses a distributed slotted MAC protocol for acknowledgements to ensure that the receivers agree who the highest priority receiver was.The efficacy of ExOR depends mainly on the rate at which the reception probability falls off with distance. Simulations based on measured radio characteristics [6] suggest that ExOR reduces the total number of transmissions by nearly a factor of two over the best possible pre-determined route.},

   Abstract = {This paper describes ExOR,an integrated routing and MAC protocol that increases the throughput of large unicast transfers in multi-hop wireless networks. ExOR chooses each hop of a packet's route after the transmission for that hop, so that the choice can reflect which intermediate nodes actually received the transmission. This deferred choice gives each transmission multiple opportunities to make progress. As a result ExOR can use long radio links with high loss rates, which would be avoided by traditional routing. ExOR increases a connection's throughput while using no more network capacity than traditional routine.ExOR's design faces the following challenges. The nodes that receive each packet must agree on their identities and choose one forwarder.The agreement protocol must have low overhead, but must also be robust enough that it rarely forwards a packet zero times or more than once. Finally, ExOR must choose the forwarder with the lowest remaining cost to the ultimate destination.Measurements of an implementation on a 38-node 802.11b test-bed show that ExOR increases throughput for most node pairs when compared with traditional routing. For pairs between which traditional routing uses one or two hops, ExOR's robust acknowledgments prevent unnecessary retransmissions,increasing throughput by nearly 35%. For more distant pairs, ExOR takes advantage of the choice of forwarders to provide throughput gains of a factor of two to four.},

OSA allows both dramatically higher spectrum utilization and near-zero deployment time, with an obvious and significant impact on both civilian and military communications. We discuss two broad classes of challenges to OSA: spectrum agility, which involves wideband sensing, opportunity identification, coordination and use; and policy agility, which enables regulatory policies to be applied dynamically using machine understandable policies. Focusing on spectrum agility, we present an architecture based on an OSA adaptation layer. We describe protocols for OSA, including a hole information protocol, idle channel selection and use, and an access protocol for the coordination channel. We present a simulation study, discuss insights, and show that even a simple protocol for opportunistic spectrum allocation can provide an order-of-magnitude performance improvement in throughput over a legacy system.},

   Volume = {45},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {51-82},
   Abstract = {In order to estimate the signal parameters accurately for mobile systems, it is necessary to estimate a system's propagation characteristics through a medium. Propagation analysis provides a good initial estimate of the signal characteristics. The ability to accurately predict radio-propagation behavior for wireless personal communication systems, such as cellular mobile radio, is becoming crucial to system design. Since site measurements are costly, propagation models have been developed as a suitable, low-cost, and convenient alternative. Channel modeling is required to predict path, loss and to characterize the impulse response of the propagating channel. The path loss is associated with the design of base stations, as this tells us how much a transmitter needs to radiate to service a given region. Channel characterization, on the other hand, deals with the fidelity of the received signals, and has to do with the nature of the waveform received at a receiver. The objective here is to design a suitable receiver that will receive the transmitted signal, distorted due to the multipath and dispersion effects of the channel, and that will decode the transmitted signal. An understanding of the various propagation models can actually address both problems. This paper begins with a review of the information available on the various propagation models for both indoor and outdoor environments. The existing models can be classified into two major classes: statistical models and site-specific models. The main characteristics of the radio channel - such as path loss, fading, and time-delay spread - are discussed. Currently, a third alternative, which includes many new numerical methods, is being introduced to propagation prediction. The advantages and disadvantages of some of these methods are summarized. In addition, an impulse-response characterization for the propagation path is also presented, including models for small-scale fading, Finally, it is shown that when two-way communication ports can be defined for a mobile system, it is possible to use reciprocity to focus the energy along the direction of an intended user without any explicit knowledge of the electromagnetic environment in which the system is operating, or knowledge of the spatial locations of the tr- ansmitter and the receiver.},

The common theme of most research in this area is to optimize physical layer performance measures without considering in much detail how cooperation interacts with higher layers and improves network performance measures. Because these issues are important for enabling cooperative communications to practice in real-world networks, especially for the increasingly important class of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the goals of this article are to survey basic cooperative communications and outline two potential architectures for cooperative MANETs. The first architecture relies on an existing clustered infrastructure: cooperative relays are centrally controlled by cluster heads. In another architecture without explicit clustering, cooperative links are formed by request of a source node in an ad hoc, decentralized fashion. In either case, cooperative communication considerably improves the network connectivity. Although far from a complete study, these architectures provide modified wireless link abstractions and suggest tradeoffs in complexity at the physical and higher layers. Many opportunities and challenges remain, including distributed synchronization, coding, and signal processing among multiple radios; modeling of new link abstractions at higher layers; and multiaccess and routing protocols for networks of cooperative links.},

The synchronization constraints are extremely loose and can be fulfilled in a distributed manner. The key idea is to have the nodes simply echo the leader's transmission operating as active scatterers while using adaptive receivers that acquire the equivalent network signatures corresponding to the echoed symbols. The active nodes in the network operate either as regenerative or nonregenerative relays. The intuition is that each of the waveforms will be enhanced by the accumulation of power due to the aggregate transmission of all the nodes while, if kept properly under control, the random errors or the receiver noise that propagate together with the useful signals will cause limited deterioration in the performance. The avalanche of signals triggered by the network leaders form the so-called opportunistic large array (OLA). The main advantages of the OLA are its great flexibility and scalability.},

   Abstract = {The degree of dynamics with respect to changes of the network's topology strongly affect the performance of a wireless mobile ad hoc network. Main reasons for topological changes are (i) node mobility and (ii) wireless radio fluctuations, e.g., due to fading effects. The impact of node mobility on ad hoc network performance has already been studied intensively. However these studies usually do not consider temporal fluctuations of the wireless channel. We quantitatively study the impact of radio fluctuations on the performance of wireless ad hoc networks. Based on field trial measurements of IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN communication in a static line-of-sight scenario, we derive a basic model for non-deterministic, but temporally dependent, received signal power variations. According to the derived model, we quantify the impact of radio fluctuations on topological change rate (TCR) and link stability as relevant ad hoc network performance metrics via simulation. The effects of pure node mobility and the effects of signal strength fluctuations, as well as the combination of node mobility and fluctuations, are studied. We demonstrate that signal strength fluctuations have a significant impact on ad hoc network performance metrics sometimes 'outperforming' the impact of node mobility. Thus, non-deterministic radio fluctuations cannot be ignored when designing robust ad hoc network protocols based on ad hoc network simulation and analysis.},

Our first approach aggregates packet streams in a robust way, resulting in energy reductions of a factor 2 to 3. Second, we argue that a more uniform resource utilization can be obtained by shaping the traffic flow. Several techniques, which rely only on localized metrics are proposed and evaluated.

To reduce the energy consumption significantly, a node should turn off its radio most of the time, except when it has to participate in data forwarding. We propose a new technique, called sparse topology and energy management (STEM), which efficiently wakes up nodes from a deep sleep state without the need for an ultra low-power radio. The designer can trade the energy efficiency of this sleep state for the latency associated with waking up the node. In addition, we integrate STEM with approaches that also leverage excess network density. We show that our hybrid wakeup scheme results in energy savings of over two orders of magnitude compared to sensor networks without topology management. Furthermore, the network designer is offered full flexibility in exploiting the energy-latency-density design space by selecting the appropriate parameter settings of our protocol.},

   Abstract = {A finite state radio channel model for wireless personal area networks (WPAN) is presented. It is based on a semi-Markov process of the channel impulse response (CIR) energy. To improve the time variant behavior of traditional state models, the proposed process includes the tendency of CIR energy fluctuations. The parameters of the model are extracted from a stochastic radio channel model which takes into account all relevant propagation effects in indoor environments. In a second step, the energy states are mapped to bit error rates. This is done using the physical layer proposal from the future IEEE standard 802.15.3 for high rate WPANs. The proposed model is compared with an existing semi-Markov channel model.},

The results show the energy necessary to transmit one bit, depending on the data rate, the ECC, and the number of retransmissions allowed. Thus, it is possible to determine, which design parameters are important and what values are to be preferred. Another performance measure, the probability of a non-successful transmission of a burst, is evaluated as well.

We address the issue of cross-layer networking, where the physical and MAC layer knowledge of the wireless medium is shared with higher layers, in order to provide efficient methods of allocating network resources and applications over the Internet. In essence, future networks will need to provide "impedance matching" of the instantaneous radio channel conditions and capacity needs with the traffic and congestion conditions found over the packet-based world of the Internet. Furthermore, such matching will need to be coordinated with a wide range of particular applications and user expectations, making the topic of cross-layer networking increasingly important for the evolving wireless buildout.},

This result indicates that, when n is large, even if each node is highly unreliable and the transmission power is small, we can still maintain connectivity with coverage. We also show that the diameter of the random grid (i.e., the maximum number of hops required to travel from any active node to another) is of the order /spl radic/{n/log(n)}. Finally, we derive a sufficient condition for connectivity of the active nodes (without necessarily having coverage). If the node success probability p(n) is small enough, we show that connectivity does not imply coverage.},

   Abstract = {To achieve full cooperative diversity in a relay network, most of the existing space-time coding schemes require the synchronization between terminals. A family of space-time trellis codes that achieve full cooperative diversity order without the assumption of synchronization has been recently proposed. The family is based on the stack construction by Hammons and El Gamal and its generalizations by Lu and Kumar. It has been shown that the construction of such a family is equivalent to the construction of binary matrices that have full row rank no matter how their rows are shifted, where a row corresponds to a terminal (or transmit antenna) and its length corresponds to the memory size of the trellis code on that terminal. We call such matrices as shift-full-rank (SFR) matrices. A family of SFR matrices has been also constructed, but the memory sizes of the corresponding space-time trellis codes (the number of columns of SFR matrices) grow exponentially in terms of the number of terminals (the number of rows of SFR matrices), which may cause a high decoding complexity when the number of terminals is not small. In this paper, we systematically study and construct SFR matrices of any sizes for any number of terminals. Furthermore, we construct shortest (square) SFR (SSFR) matrices that correspond to space-time trellis codes with the smallest memory sizes and asynchronous full cooperative diversity. We also present some simulation results to illustrate the performances of the space-time trellis codes associated with SFR matrices in asynchronous cooperative communications.},

   Abstract = {We consider a cluster-based cooperative transmission scheme where the source node and destination node form clusters for transmission. Instead of using perfect synchronization technique, we assume the cooperative transmission is asynchronous. Each member in transmitting cluster relays signal to the receiving cluster after obtaining information from source node. A general decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is used in the receiving cluster members to equalize the received MISO signal and detect as soft symbols. The receiving cluster members send the softdecision outputs to the destination node. Thus, the decision node combines the soft-decision outputs and makes hard-decision detection for the transmitted information. The performance of proposed system is shown and compared with conventional MIMO system. Major factors for system performance is discussed. The over-sampling rate plays an important role in system performance. We also present a simple capacity analysis for proposed cooperative transmission system. The capacity ratio between cooperative MIMO system and direct transmission (SISO) system is also presented and compared to the capacity ratio of conventional MIMO system and direct transmission (SISO) system. We also extend the analysis to heterogeneous network and show the capacity ratio.},

S-D pairs are randomly located over the network. The scaling behavior of conventional multi-hop transmission that does not employ opportunistic routing is also examined. The results indicate that the opportunistic routing can exhibit better power-delay trade-off than the conventional routing while providing up to a logarithmic boost in the scaling law. The gain comes from the fact that the system with opportunistic routing can tolerate more interference due to increased received signal power from utilizing the multi-user diversity gain. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the total throughput using the cut-set theorem. It is shown that the achievable rates of the conventional and opportunistic routing schemes become close to the upper bound when the number of S-D pairs is large enough.},

The total energy consumption of a cooperative system consists of the transmission energy, the transceiver circuit energy and the local communication energy cost. In virtual-MISO explicit local communication precedes the long-haul cooperative transmission, whereas in decode-and-forward nodes cooperate by overhearing and repeating each other's long-haul transmissions. Our energy analysis shows that decode-and-forward is overall the more energy-efficient cooperative scheme. We also show that cooperation can yield large energy savings compared to traditional SISO (single-input-single-output) communication, even when the local distance between cooperating nodes is increased and becomes comparable to the long-haul distance. Given specific local and long-haul distance ranges, we formulate the recommended cooperation strategy in terms of the number of cooperating partners to employ for optimal energy-efficiency.},

Due to the mobility of the network nodes, the strongly varying radio propagation conditions and the varying data traffic load these networks constitute a very dynamic environment. One essential step in evaluating the true benefit of this new technology consists of estimates and constraints concerning the scalability and performance of such networks. Using a simple model we discuss analytically the effect of interference on the link quality and connectivity of large networks. It turns out that the outage probability rapidly increases with increasing traffic load. Furthermore, we investigate the connectivity of the network under varying traffic load and find a percolation phase transition at a particular value of the traffic load. We discuss the dependence of these effects on parameters characterizing the receiver and the radio propagation conditions.},

The proposed transmission protocol, referred to as Multihop Cooperative Transmission Chain (MCTC), is based on the linear combination of copies of the same message by multiple previous terminals along the route in order to maximize the multihop diversity. Power allocations among transmitting nodes in the route can be obtained according to the average (not instantaneous) node-to-node path attenuation using a recursive power assignment. The latter can be employed locally on each node with limited signalling exchange (for fixed or nomadic terminals) among nodes. In this paper the power assignments for the MCTC strategy employing conventional linear combining schemes at receivers (i.e., selection combining, maximal ratio combining and equal gain combining) have been derived analytically when the power optimization is constrained to guarantee the end-to-end outage probability. In particular, we show that the power assignment that minimize the maximum spread of received power (min-max strategy) can efficiently exploit the multihop diversity. In addition, for ad hoc networks where the energy of each node is an issue, the MCTC protocol with the min-max power assignment increases considerably the network lifetime when compared to non-cooperative multihop schemes},

   Abstract = {Extending lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue that allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributed nodes in wireless networks. Cooperative communications has recently emerged as a new communication paradigm that enables and leverages effective resource sharing among cooperative nodes. In this paper, a general framework for lifetime extension of battery-operated devices by exploiting cooperative diversity is proposed. The framework efficiently takes advantage of different locations and energy levels among distributed nodes. First, a lifetime maximization problem via cooperative nodes is considered and performance analysis for M-ary PSK modulation is provided. With an objective to maximize the minimum device lifetime under a constraint on bit-error-rate performance, the optimization problem determines which nodes should cooperate and how much power should be allocated for cooperation. Since the formulated problem is NP hard, a closed-form solution for a two-node network is derived to obtain some insights. Based on the two-node solution, a fast suboptimal algorithm is developed for multi-node scenarios. Moreover, the device lifetime is further improved by a deployment of cooperative relays in order to help forward information of the distributed nodes in the network. Optimum location and power allocation for each cooperative relay are determined with an aim to maximize the minimum device lifetime. A suboptimal algorithm is developed to solve the problem with multiple cooperative relays and cooperative nodes. Simulation results show that the minimum device lifetime of the network with cooperative nodes improves 2 times longer than the lifetime of the non-cooperative network. In addition, deploying a cooperative relay in a proper location leads up to 12 times longer lifetime than that of the non-cooperative network},

We consider a fusion architecture which allows cooperation among the nodes. In order to allow the nodes to cooperate, we propose a consensus flooding protocol and analyze the average energy consumption when cooperation is present. Unlike similar works, we analyze the effect of a realistic sensing model, flooding protocol and network connectivity on the system reliability and energy consumption. We demonstrate that a trade-off exists among spatial diversity gain, average energy consumption, delivery ratio of the flooding protocol, network connectivity, node density, and POI intensity in the cooperative architecture. Consequently, we are able to determine when the additional performance gain provided by cooperation outweighs the increase in average energy consumption required to cooperate.},

Constraints on the transmission delay limit this gain and result in non-zero outage probability. In this article, in addition to a delay constraint, it is assumed that, while the transmitter and the receiver can estimate the channel perfectly, the transmitter can not know a priori the future channel states. Two transmission schemes are examined. The first scheme performs waterfilling with virtual future channel gains, whereas the second one only allocates power when the channel gain exceeds a threshold. The performance of the two schemes is evaluated in terms of the trade-off between the attainable average rate and the probability of outage for flat i.i.d. Rayleigh fading.},

The system incorporates some relaying schemes based on node cooperation and forward error correction to improve the communication reliability in the presence of fading, and power control to reduce the energy consumed for transmission. We investigate the basic tradeoffs among energy consumption, hop distance and robustness against fading by assuming that routing and multiple access algorithms have already set up a path between source and destination. We address the design of hop distance from the point of view of energy efficiency by introducing a new metric, the energy consumption rate, function of the source-destination distance, and by deriving the optimal hop length that minimizes it. In our numerical results we compare the proposed relaying schemes from the point of view of reliability and energy efficiency. We will show that the use of node selection improves reliability without increasing energy consumption and the use of coding, which usually requires energy consuming processing, is convenient if implemented in a energy adaptive scheme or when long hops are required in low node-density networks.},

We focus on the multiaccess fading channel with Gaussian noise, and define two notions of capacity depending on whether the traffic is delay-sensitive or not. We characterize the throughput capacity region which contains the long-term achievable rates through the time-varying channel. We show that each point on the boundary of the region can be achieved by successive decoding. Moreover, the optimal rate and power allocations in each fading state can be explicitly obtained in a greedy manner. The solution can be viewed as the generalization of the water-filling construction for single-user channels to multiaccess channels with arbitrary number of users, and exploits the underlying polymatroid structure of the capacity region},

   Abstract = {Multiuser diversity is a form of diversity inherent in a wireless network, provided by independent time-varying channels across the different users. The diversity benefit is exploited by tracking the channel fluctuations of the users and scheduling transmissions to users when their instantaneous channel quality is near the peak. The diversity gain increases with the dynamic range of the fluctuations and is thus limited in environments with little scattering and/or slow fading. In such environments, we propose the use of multiple transmit antennas to induce large and fast channel fluctuations so that multiuser diversity can still be exploited. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic beamforming and we show that true beamforming gains can be achieved when there are sufficient users, even though very limited channel feedback is needed. Furthermore, in a cellular system, the scheme plays an additional role of opportunistic nulling of the interference created on users of adjacent cells. We discuss the design implications of implementing. this scheme in a complete wireless system},

   Pages = {574-587},
   Abstract = {Next generation (NG) wireless networks are envisioned to provide high bandwidth to mobile users via bandwidth aggregation over heterogeneous wireless architectures. NG wireless networks, however, impose challenges due to their architectural heterogeneity in terms of different access schemes, resource allocation techniques as well as diverse quality of service requirements. These heterogeneities must be captured and handled dynamically as mobile terminals roam between different wireless architectures. However, to address these challenges, the existing proposals require either a significant modification in the network structure and in base stations or a completely new architecture, which lead to integration problems in terms of implementation costs, scalability and backward compatibility. Thus, the integration of the existing medium access schemes, e.g., CSMA, TDMA and CDMA, dictates an adaptive and seamless medium access control (MAC) layer that can achieve high network utilization and meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, an adaptive medium access control (A-MAC) layer is proposed to address the heterogeneities posed by the NG wireless networks. A-MAC introduces a two-layered MAC framework that accomplishes the adaptivity to both architectural heterogeneities and diverse QoS requirements. A novel virtual cube concept is introduced as a unified metric to model heterogeneous access schemes and capture their behavior. Based on the virtual cube concept, A-MAC provides architecture-independent decision and QoS based scheduling algorithms for efficient multi-network access. A-MAC performs seamless medium access to multiple networks without requiring any additional modifications in the existing network structures. It is shown via extensive simulations that A-MAC provides adaptivity to the heterogeneities in NG wireless networks and achieves high performance.},

We study two implementations regarding the delay constraints: an average delay constraint and a strict delay constraint. We also investigate the performance degradation caused by the imperfect (delayed or erroneous) channel knowledge. The resulting optimal policies are shown to be a function of the channel-state information (CSI), the residual battery energy, and the number of residual information bits in the transmit buffer. It is observed that the probability of successful file transfer increases significantly when the CSI is exploited opportunistically. When the perfect instantaneous CSI is available at the transmitter, the faster channel variations increase the success probability under delay constraints. In addition, when considering the power expenditure in the pilot for channel estimation, the optimal policy shows that the transmitter should use the pilot only if there is sufficient energy left for packet transfer; otherwise, a channel-independent policy should be used.},

The lifetime problem we define is representative, practical, and encompasses other versions of similar problems. We also define a representative physical attack model under which we study and solve the lifetime problem. Our solutions take into account both node constraints and the goal of energy minimization.

We show that as functions of the average SNR, they can both be characterized by two parameters: the diversity and coding gains. They both exhibit identical diversity orders, but their coding gains in decibels differ by a constant. The diversity and coding gains are found to depend on the behavior of-the random SNR's probability density function only at the origin, or equivalently, on the decaying order of the corresponding moment generating function (i.e., how fast the moment generating function goes to zero as its argument goes to infinity). Diversity and coding gains for diversity combining systems are expressed in terms of the diversity branches' individual diversity and coding gains, where the branches can come from any diversity technique such as space, time, frequency, or, multipath. The proposed analysis offers a simple and unifying approach to evaluating the performance of uncoded and (possibly space-time) coded transmissions over fading channels, and the method applies to almost all digital modulation schemes, including M-ary phaseshift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, and frequency-shift keying with coherent or noncoherent detection.},

The energy consumption has taken into account both the transmission energy and the circuit processing energy, and throughout the analysis we emphasized on the capability condition of the cooperative transmission. And the analysis results showed that the cooperative transmission can increase the energy-efficiency when the sink is far away from the CNs, and also this scheme can keep the throughput of the system in a stable level with different values of SNR},

   Abstract = {Synchronization of relay nodes is an important and critical issue in exploiting cooperative diversity in wireless networks. In this paper, two asynchronous cooperative diversity schemes are proposed, namely, distributed delay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes. In terms of the overall diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff function, we show that the proposed independent coding based distributed delay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes achieve the same performance as the synchronous space-time coded approach which requires an accurate symbol-level timing synchronization to ensure signals arriving at the destination from different relay nodes are perfectly synchronized. This demonstrates diversity order is maintained even at the presence of asynchronism between relay node. Moreover, when all relay nodes succeed in decoding the source information, the asynchronous space-time coded approach is capable of achieving better DM tradeoff than synchronous schemes and performs equivalently to transmitting information through a parallel fading channel as far as the DM tradeoff is concerned. Our results suggest the benefits of fully exploiting the space-time degrees of freedom in multiple antenna systems by employing asynchronous space&#x2013;time codes even in a frequency-flat-fading channel. In addition, it is shown asynchronous space-time coded systems are able to achieve higher mutual information than synchronous space&#x2013;time coded systems for any finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when properly selected baseband waveforms are employed. },

   Abstract = {Cooperative diversity, which employs multiple nodes for the simultaneous relaying of a given packet in wireless ad hoc networks, has been shown to be an effective means of improving diversity, and, hence, mitigating the detrimental effects of multipath fading. However, in previously proposed cooperative diversity schemes, it has been assumed that coordination among the relays allows for accurate symbol-level timing synchronization at the destination and orthogonal channel allocation, which can be quite costly in terms of signaling overhead in mobile ad hoc networks, which are often defined by their lack of a fixed infrastructure and the difficulty of centralized control. In this paper, cooperative diversity schemes are considered that do not require symbol-level timing synchronization or orthogonal channelization between the relays employed. In the process, a novel minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver is designed for combining disparate inputs in the multiple-relay channel. Outage probability calculations and simulation results demonstrate the not unexpected significant performance gains of the proposed schemes over single-hop transmission, and, more importantly, demonstrate performance comparable to schemes requiring accurate symbol-level synchronization and orthogonal channelization.},

Using a significantly larger data set than previous experiments, we observed that on the average, the shadow fading components of the signals are not correlated, even at small angles. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom, as expressed in several papers, which says that there is relatively high correlation at small angles. Our results indicate that a mathematically simpler uncorrelated model for the relationship between signals from multiple base stations at small angles can be used in analysis tools. Distance correlation measurements computed by forming the autocorrelation function on a large number of data sets showed that the correlation distance of the shadowing process ranges from about 25 to 100 m},

The spatial diversity of wireless channels is both used to improve the chances that incoming packets are received by some group members (and subsequently by all awake members), and to make sure that the destination receives copies of the packet over several independently faded channels. The goal is hence to provide a combination of spatial and time diversity. Specifically, we investigate a class of schemes in which the group members possess a-priori knowledge about the group but avoid any explicit coordination. We discuss the design of a baseline scheme and of an improved scheme which yields significant improvements in case of high error probabilities for incoming packets.},

These non-ideal characteristics are more problematic with the primitive, low-power radio transceivers found in sensor networks, and raise new issues that routing protocols must address. Link connectivity statistics should be captured dynamically through an efficient yet adaptive link estimator and routing decisions should exploit such connectivity statistics to achieve reliability. Link status and routing information must be maintained in a neighborhood table with constant space regardless of cell density. We study and evaluate link estimator, neighborhood table management, and reliable routing protocol techniques. We focus on a many-to-one, periodic data collection workload. We narrow the design space through evaluations on large-scale, high-level simulations to 50-node, in-depth empirical experiments.

   Abstract = {This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with individual nodes remaining largely inactive for long periods of time, but then becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in almost every way: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses three novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. To reduce energy consumption in listening to an idle channel, nodes periodically sleep. Neighboring nodes form virtual clusters to auto-synchronize on sleep schedules. Inspired by PAMAS, S-MAC also sets the radio to sleep during transmissions of other nodes. Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications that require store-and-forward processing as data move through the network. We evaluate our implementation of S-MAC over a sample sensor node, the Mote, developed at University of California, Berkeley. The experiment results show that, on a source node, an 802.11-like MAC consumes 2-6 times more energy than S-MAC for traffic load with messages sent every 1-10 s.},

   Abstract = {We consider a general multiple-antenna network with multiple sources, multiple destinations, and multiple relays in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). We examine several subcases of this most general problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays (half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or nonclustered). We first study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a full-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in the direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable performance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF) protocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals have one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the degrees of freedom in the direct link are increased, whereas CF continues to perform optimally. We also study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a half-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly be different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for half-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the half-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC) DMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source-destination pair and multiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the ideal assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real MIMO DMT. For cooperative systems with multiple sources and multiple destinations the same limitation remains in effect.},

We first consider the case of B bits of data that must be transmitted by a deadline T and using a novel continuous-time stochastic control formulation obtain the optimal policy. Based on a cumulative curves methodology and a decomposition approach, we then obtain the optimal policy when the queue has packets with variable deadline constraints.

   Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the minimum total power (termed as critical total power) required to ensure asymptotic k-connectivity in heterogeneous wireless networks where nodes may transmit using different levels of power. We show that under the assumption that wireless nodes form a homogeneous Poisson point process with density /spl lambda/ on a unit square region [0, 1]/sup 2/ and the Toroidal model [M.D. Penrose, 1997], the critical total power required for maintaining k-connectivity is /spl theta/((/spl Gamma/(e/2+k))/((k-1)l)/spl lambda//sup 1-e/2/) with probability approaching one as /spl lambda/ goes to infinity, where e is the path loss exponent. Compared with the results that all nodes use a common critical transmission power for maintaining k-connectivity [M.D. Penrose, 1999], [P.-J. Wan and C. Yi, 2004], we show that the critical total power can be reduced by an order of (log /spl lambda/)e/2 by allowing nodes to optimally choose different levels of transmission power. This result is not subject to any specific power/topology control algorithm, but rather a fundamental property in wireless networks.},

   Volume = {3},

   Abstract = {Our objective is to analyze and minimize the amount of energy needed to transmit packets in a multihop wireless network, such as a sensor network or an ad hoc network. The total energy consumed to transmit a packet from a source to a destination is a function of the number of hops along the path and the energy needed to successfully transmit a packet in one hop. Given a path, the number of hops needed depends on the transmission range. The energy consumed for a successful transmission in a hop depends on not only the transmission range but also the medium access strategy. In this paper, we generalize the analysis of the energy consumption on packet transmission in multihop wireless networks. The analysis is applicable to a range of multiaccess schemes from TDM to random access schemes. The results show that typically, there is a transmission range that results in the minimum energy. However, a smaller transmission range does not always lead to less energy consumed by packet transmission. The optimum energy consumption is the result of balancing several factors, including: 1) the ratio of an overhead packet length to a data packet length, where overhead packets refer to the control packets used to reserve the media or the data packets involved in collisions; 2) the number of transmissions of the overhead packets; 3) the number of hops along a path; and 4) the transmission range.},

The primary interest of cooperative MIMO networks, however, has been focused on the cooperative diversity (C-DIV) approaches to achieve spatial diversity gain. Recent work proposed cooperative spatial multiplexing (C-SM) to simplify the transmit and receive processing requirement on the relay nodes while providing significant energy savings. So far C-SM has been only considered for single-hop relaying. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-hop relaying C-SM systems for transmit energy reduction and performance improvement},

   Abstract = {We consider distributed information retrieval for sensor networks with cluster heads or mobile access points. The performance metric used in the design is energy efficiency defined as the ratio of the average number of bits reliably retrieved by the access point to the total amount of energy consumed. A distributed opportunistic transmission protocol is proposed using a combination of carrier sensing and backoff strategy that incorporates channel state information (CSI) of individual sensors. By selecting a set of sensors with the best channel states to transmit, the proposed protocol achieves the upper bound on energy efficiency when the signal propagation delay is negligible. For networks with substantial propagation delays, a backoff function optimized for energy efficiency is proposed. The design of this backoff function utilizes properties of extreme statistics and is shown to have mild performance loss in practical scenarios. We also demonstrate that opportunistic strategies that use CSI may not be optimal when channel acquisition at individual sensors consumes substantial energy. We show further that there is an optimal sensor density for which the opportunistic information retrieval is the most energy efficient. This observation leads to the design of the optimal sensor duty cycle.},

   Title = {A UNIFIED DATA-LINK ENERGY MODEL FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS},
   School = {UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY},
   Abstract = {Low power consumption is themost important requirement in wireless sensor networks. Many questions arise in the design of such low-power wireless networks. How many channels are needed? Is it better to use random access or dedicated channel assignment? What is the proper data rate for the radio? When is power control effective and when should power management be used instead? How low can the power consumption be for given Quality of Service (QoS) requirements?

Analytical models provide deep insight into these key issues. For this reason, a framework of analytical models has been established in this dissertation for wireless sensor networks. Special attention is given to the energy models for the data-link layer, because its energy consumption dominates the overall energy consumption. The data-link layer models and the abstracted models of the interacting layers are integrated in this framework to expose the dependence of the overall power consumption on the design parameters of wireless sensor networks. Being integrated is what makes this framework unique. In fact, this integrated framework is very useful to the designers of wireless sensor networks: it provides venues and guidelines for energy reduction and design improvements. Furthermore, it can be a place to raise and address fundamental questions. However, the existence of the closed feedback loops makes the integration of the models very hard. Methodology of solving this closed-loop problem is given in this dissertation. The conditions imposed by
the convergence on individual parts are also speciﬁed.

The integrated modeling framework presented in this dissertation uses an analytical approach, which provides designers better insight into the low-power design of the data-link layer than simulations or experiments. It is superior to other analytical approaches on that it considers the interactions between the components, enabling designers to reduce the overall power consumption even further. The validity of the models in this framework has been veriﬁed using OMNET++ network simulations. In addition, the guidelines resulting from this framework have already had a real impact on the design of an actual sensor network.},
