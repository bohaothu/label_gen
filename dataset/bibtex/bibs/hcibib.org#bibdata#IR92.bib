%X Researchers have found relevance feedback to be effective in interactive
information retrieval, although few formal user experiments have been made.  In
order to run a user experiment on a large document collection, experiments were
performed at NIST to complete some of the missing links found in using the
probabilistic retrieval model.  These experiments, using the Cranfield 1400
collection, showed the importance of query expansion in addition to query
reweighing, and showed that adding as few as 20 well-selected terms could
result in performance improvements of over 100%.  Additionally it was shown
that performing multiple iterations of feedback is highly effective.

%X Although relevance feedback techniques have been investigated for more than
20 years, hardly any of these techniques has been implemented in a commercial
full-text document retrieval system.  In addition to pure performance problems,
this is due to the fact that the application of relevance feedback techniques
increases the complexity of the user interface and thus also the use of a
document retrieval system.  In this paper we concentrate on a relevance
feedback technique that allows easily understandable and manageable user
interfaces, and at the same time provides high-quality retrieval results. 
Moreover, the relevance feedback technique introduced unifies as well as
improves other well-known relevance feedback techniques.

%X Evaluation of information retrieval systems should be based on measures of
the information provided by the retrieval process, 'informativeness' measures
which take into account the interactive and full-text nature of present-day
systems and the different types of questions which are asked of them. 
Desirable properties for an informativeness measure are developed, including
context sensitivity, user centrality, and logarithmic response.  A
hypergraph-based framework for measuring the informativeness of a retrieval
process is presented and a measure developed which satisfies the desired
properties.  The measure is compared to previously developed information
measures and illustrated via an application.

%X Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have been widely explored as
text representation techniques for text retrieval.  In this paper we study the
properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization
task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query
interpretation issues.  We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using
only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness
peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a
syntactic phase indexing than for word-based indexing.  We also present results
suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide
significantly improved text representations.  An improved probabilistic text
categorization method is also presented.

%X In this paper we describe an automated method of classifying research
project descriptions: a human expert classifies a sample set of projects into a
set of disjoint and pre-defined classes, and then the computer learns from this
sample how to classify new projects into these classes.  Both textual and
non-textual information associated with the projects are used in the learning
and classification phases.  Textual information is processed by two methods of
analysis: a natural language analysis followed by a statistical analysis. 
Non-textual information is processed by a symbolic learning technique.  We
present the results of some experiments done on real data: two different
classifications of our research projects.

%X We describe a method for classifying news stories using Memory Based
Reasoning (MBR) (a k-nearest neighbor method), that does not require manual
topic definitions.  Using an already coded training database of about 50,000
stories from the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a
text retrieval system that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match
engine, codes are assigned to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80%
and precision of about 70%.  There are about 350 different codes to be
assigned.  Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the
information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to
code a story in about 2 seconds.  Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we
achieved these results in about two person-months.  We believe this approach is
effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems
involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message
routing etc.

%X A well constructed thesaurus has long been recognized as a valuable tool in
the effective operation of an information retrieval system.  This paper reports
the results of experiments designed to determine the validity of an approach to
the automatic construction of global thesauri (described originally by Crouch
in [1] and [2]) based on a clustering of the document collection.  The authors
validate the approach by showing that the use of thesauri generated by this
method results in substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness in four
test collections.  The term discrimination value theory, used in the thesaurus
generation algorithm to determine a term's membership in a particular thesaurus
class, is found not to be useful in distinguishing between thesaurus classes
(i.e., in differentiating a "good" from an "indifferent" or "poor" thesaurus
class).  In conclusion, the authors suggest an alternate approach to automatic
thesaurus construction which greatly simplifies the work of producing viable
thesaurus classes.  Experimental results show that the alternate approach
described herein in some cases produces thesauri which are comparable in
retrieval effectiveness to those produced by the first method at much lower
cost.

%X One aspect of world knowledge essential to information retrieval is knowing
when two words are related.  Knowing word relatedness allows a system given a
user's query terms to retrieve relevant documents not containing those exact
terms.  Two words can be said to be related if they appear in the same
contexts.  Document co-occurrence gives a measure of word relatedness that has
proved to be too rough to be useful.  The relatively recent apparition of
on-line dictionaries and robust and rapid parsers permits the extraction of
finer word contexts from large corpora.  In this paper, we will describe such
an extraction technique that uses only coarse syntactic analysis and no domain
knowledge.  This technique produces lists of words related to any word
appearing in a corpus.  When the closest related terms were used in query
expansion of a standard information retrieval testbed, the results were much
better than that given by document co-occurrence techniques, and slightly
better than using unexpanded queries, supporting the contention that
semantically similar words were indeed extracted by this technique.

%X In this paper, we present an approach to the incorporation of object
versioning into a distributed full-text information retrieval system.  We
propose an implementation based on "partially versioned" index sets, arguing
that its space overhead and query-time performance make it suitable for
full-text IR, with its heavy dependence on inverted indexing.  We develop
algorithms for computing both historical queries and tune range queries and
show how these algorithms can be applied to a number of problems in distributed
information management, such as data replication, caching, transactional
consistency, and hybrid media repositories.

%X The first part of this paper briefly describes a mathematical framework
(called the containment model) that provides the operations and data structures
for a text dominated database with a hierarchical structure.  The database is
considered to be a hierarchical collection of contiguous extents each extent
being a word, word phrase, text element or non-text element.  The filter
operations making up a search command are expressed in terms of containment
criteria that specify whether a contiguous extent will be selected or rejected
during a search.  This formalism, comprised of the mathematical framework and
its associated language, defines a conceptual layer upon which we can construct
a well-defined higher level layer, specifically the user interface that serves
to provide a level of functionality that is closer to the needs of the user and
the application domain.
   With the conceptual layer established, we go on to describe the design and
implementation of a versatile interface which handles queries that search and
navigate a heterogeneous collection of structured documents.  Interface
functionality is provided by a set of "worker" modules supported by an
"environment" that is the same for all interfaces.  The interface environment
allows a worker to communicate with the underlying text retrieval engine using
a well-defined command protocol that is based on a small set of filter
operators.  The overall design emphasizes: a) interface flexibility for a
variety of search and browsing capabilities, b) the modular independence of the
interface with respect to its underlying retrieval engine, and c) the
advantages to be accrued by defining retrieval commands using operators that
are part of a text algebra that provides a sound theoretical foundation for the
database.

%X Computer programs that access significant amounts of text usually include
code that manipulates the textual objects that comprise it.  Such programs
include electronic mail readers, typesetters and, in particular, full-text
information retrieval systems.  Such code is often unsatisfying in that access
to textual objects is either efficient, or flexible, but not both.  A
programming language like Awk or Perl provides very general facilities for
describing textual objects, but at the cost of rescanning the text for every
textual object.  At the other extreme, full text information retrieval systems
usually offer access to a very limited number of kinds of textual objects, but
this access is very efficient.  The system described in this paper is a
programming tool for managing textual objects.  It provides a great deal of
flexibility, giving access to very complex document structure, with a large
number of constituent kinds of textual objects.  Further, it provides access to
these objects very efficiently, both in terms of time and auxiliary space, by
being very careful to access secondary storage only when absolutely necessary.

%X Semantic-based approaches to Information Retrieval make a query evaluation
similar to an inference process based on semantic relations.  Semantic-based
approaches find out hidden semantic relationships between a document and a
query, but quantitative estimation of the correspondence between them is often
empiric.  On the other hand, probabilistic approaches usually consider only
statistical relationships between terms.  It is expected that improvement may
be brought by integrating these two approaches.  This paper demonstrates, using
some particular probabilistic models which are strongly related to modal logic,
that such an integration is feasible and natural.  A new model is developed on
the basis of an extended modal logic.  It has the advantages of: (1) augmenting
a semantic-based approach with a probabilistic measurement, and (2) augmenting
a probabilistic approach with finer semantic relations than just statistical
ones.  It is shown that this model verifies most of the conditions for an
absolute probability function.

point of view.  It is shown that both the pseudo-cosine and the standard vector
space models can be viewed as special cases of a generalized linear model. 
More importantly, both the necessary and sufficient conditions have been
identified, under which ranking functions such as the inner-product, cosine,
pseudo-cosine, Dice, covariance and product-moment correlation measures can be
used to rank the documents.  The structure of the solution region for
acceptable ranking is analyzed and an algorithm for finding all the solution
vectors is suggested.

%X Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a technique for representing documents,
queries, and terms as vectors in a multidimensional real-valued space.  The
representations are approximations to the original term space encoding, and are
found using the matrix technique of Singular Value Decomposition.  In
comparison, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a class of data analysis
techniques for representing data points as points in a multidimensional
real-valued space.  The objects are represented so that inter-point
similarities in the space match inter object similarity information provided by
the researcher.  We illustrate how the document representations given by LSI
are equivalent to the optimal representations found when solving a particular
MDS problem in which the given inter-object similarity information is provided
by the inner product similarities between the documents themselves.  We further
analyze a more general MDS problem in which the inter-document similarity
information, although still in inner product form, is arbitrary with respect to
the vector space encoding of the documents.

%X An information retrieval model is presented for the retrieval of speech
documents, i.e. audio recordings containing speech.  The indexing vocabulary
consists of indexing features that have the following characteristics.  First,
they are easy to recognize by speech recognition methods.  Second, the number
of different indexing features is small such that a reasonable amount of
training data is sufficient to train the hidden Markov models that are used by
the speech recognition process.  Third, the retrieval method based on such
indexing features achieves an acceptable retrieval effectiveness as shown by
experiments on text collections.  Fourth, these indexing features cannot only
be identified in speech documents but also in text documents.  From the last
characteristic follows that speech documents and text documents can be
retrieved simultaneously.  Analogously, the queries may contain either speech
or text.  Thus, we have a simple multimedia retrieval model where two different
medias are indexed coherently.  We also describe a prototype retrieval system
under development.

%X This paper is a report of a study investigating the validity of the Multiple
Poisson (nP) model of word distribution in document collections.  An nP
distribution is a mixture of n Poisson distributions with different means.  We
describe a practical algorithm for determining if a certain word is distributed
according to an nP distribution and computing the distribution parameters.  The
algorithm was applied to every word in four different document collections.  It
was found that over 70% of frequently occurring words and terms indeed behave
according to the nP distributions.  The result indicate that the proportion of
nP words depends on the collection size, document length and the frequency of
the individual words.  Most of the nP words recognised are distributed
according to the mixture of relatively few single Poisson distributions (two,
three or four).  There is an indication that the number of single Poisson
components in the mixture depends on the collection frequency of words.

%X Most natural language based document retrieval systems use the syntax
structures of constituent phrases of documents as index terms.  Many of these
systems also attempt to reduce the syntactic variability of natural language by
some normalisation procedure applied to these syntax structures.  However, the
retrieval performance of such systems remains fairly disappointing.  Some
systems therefore use a meaning representation language to index and retrieve
documents.  In this paper, a system is presented that uses Horn Clause Logic as
meaning representation language, employs advanced techniques from Natural
Language Processing to achieve incremental extensibility, and uses methods from
Logic Programming to achieve robustness in the face of insufficient data.

%X The goal of a probabilistic retrieval system design is to rank the elements
of the search universe in descending order of their estimated probability of
usefulness to the user.  Previously explored methods for computing such a
ranking have involved the use of statistical independence assumptions and
multiple regression analysis on a learning sample.  In this paper these
techniques are recombined in a new way to achieve greater accuracy of
probabilistic estimate without undue additional computational complexity.  The
novel element of the proposed design is that the regression analysis be carried
out in two or more levels or stages.  Such an approach allows composite or
grouped retrieval clues to be analyzed in an orderly manner -- first within
groups, and then between.  It compensates automatically for systematic biases
introduced by the statistical simplifying assumptions, and gives rise to search
algorithms of reasonable computational efficiency.

%X In this paper, a model for combining text and fact retrieval is described. 
A query is a set of conditions, where a single condition is either a text or
fact condition.  Fact conditions can be interpreted as being vague, thus
leading to nonbinary weights for fact conditions with respect to database
objects.  For text conditions, we use descriptions of the occurrence of terms
in documents instead of precomputed indexing weights, thus treating terms
similar to attributes.  Probabilistic indexing weights for conditions are
computed by introducing the notion of correctness (or acceptability) of a
condition w.r.t. an object.  These indexing weights are used in retrieval for a
probabilistic ranking of objects based on the
retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (RPI) model, for which a new derivation
is given here.

%X Document management systems are needed for many business applications.  This
type of system would combine the functionality of a database system, (for
describing storing and maintaining documents with complex structure and
relationships) with a text retrieval system (for effective retrieval based on
full text).  The retrieval model for a document management system is
complicated by the variety and complexity of the objects that are represented.
In this paper, we describe an approach to complex object retrieval using a
probabilistic inference net model, and an implementation of this approach using
a loose coupling of an object-oriented database system (IRIS) and a text
retrieval system based on inference nets (INQUERY).  The resulting system is
used to store long, structured documents and can retrieve document components
(sections, figures, etc.) based on their text contents or the contents of
related components.  The lessons learnt from the implementation are discussed.

the SBN project.  Since the SBN database has not been designed to be
efficiently accessed for end-user searches, the DUO database has been designed
to avoid duplication of the SBN database data and to be usable for making
efficient subjects accesses to the catalogue documents.  The DUO design choices
are presented, in particular the main choice of designing a "virtual" document
that corresponds to each SBN document and that has unstructured data usable for
subject search purposes.
   The paper presents a new kind of user-OPAC dialogue that makes available to
the use different search approaches and on-line dictionaries.  In particular
the user during the interaction with the search tool can represent his
information needs with the support of interface capabilities that are based on
retrieval path history, and words and codes on-line dictionaries.
   DUO is the first Italian OPAC that has been made openly available to users
of universities and research institutions.  For this reason, it is also the
first time that OPAC log data is going to be collected in Italy.  This work
mainly intends to make a modern OPAC available to the users of a SBN catalogue
database, but it is going to permit also to build up a knowledge on OPAC usage
in Italy.

%X This paper discusses the application of algorithmic spelling-correction
techniques to the identification of those worlds in a database of 17th century
English text that are most similar to a query word in modern English.  The
experiments have used n-gram matching, non-phonetic coding and dynamic
programming methods for spelling correction, and have demonstrated that
high-recall searches can be carried out, although some of the searches are very
demanding of computational resources.  The methods are, in principle,
applicable to historical texts in many languages and from many different
periods.

%X Our previous research on one-probe access to large collections of data
indexed by alphanumeric keys has produced the first practical minimal perfect
hash functions for this problem.  Here, a new algorithm is described for
quickly finding minimal perfect hash functions whose specification space is
very close to the theoretical lower bound, i.e., around 2 bits per key.  The
various stages of processing are detailed, along with analytical and empirical
results, including timing for a set over 3.8 million keys that was processed on
a NeXTstation in about 6 hours.

%X Full-text retrieval systems often use either a bitmap or an inverted file to
identify which documents contain which terms, so that the documents containing
any combination of query terms can be quickly located.  Bitmaps of term
occurrences are large, but are usually sparse, and thus are amenable to a
variety of compression techniques.  Here we consider techniques in which the
encoding of each bitvector within the bitmap is parameterised, so that a
different code can be used for each bitvector.  Our experimental results show
that the new methods yield better compression than previous techniques.

%X The retrieval capabilities of the signatures file access methods have become
very attractive for many data processing applications dealing with both
formatted and unformatted data.  However, performance is still a problem,
mainly when large flies are used and fast response required.  In this paper, a
high performance signature file organization is proposed, integrating the
latest developments both in storage structure and parallel computing
architectures.  It combines horizontal and vertical approaches to the signature
file fragmentation.  In this way, a new, mixed decomposition scheme,
particularly suitable for parallel implementation, is achieved.  The
organization, based on this fragmentation scheme, is called Fragmented
Signature File.  Performance analysis shows that this organization provides
very good and relatively stable performance, covering the full range of
possible queries.  For the same degree of parallelism, it outperforms any other
parallel signature file organization that has been defined so far.  The
proposed method also has other important advantages concerning processing of
dynamic files, adaptability to the number of available processors, load
balancing, and, to some extent, fault-tolerant query processing.

%X Cognitive abilities of fifty university students were tested using eight
tests from the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests.  All students searched
for references on the same topic using a standard computerized index, and
performance in the searches was analyzed using a variety of measures.  Effects
for cognitive differences, as well as for differences in demographic
characteristics, and knowledge, were identified using multiple regression. 
Perceptual speed had an effect on the quality of searches, and logical
reasoning, verbal comprehension, and spatial scanning abilities influenced
search tactics.  It is suggested that information retrieval systems can made
more accessible to users with different levels of cognitive abilities through
improvements that will assist users to scan lists of terms, choose appropriate
vocabulary for searching, and select useful references.

%X The dominant approaches to information retrieval system design are based on
rational theory and cognitive engineering.  However, these theories as well as
approaches in other disciplines, reviewed in this paper, do not account for
communication, or interaction, among design participants which is critical to
design outcomes.  This research attempts to develop a descriptive design model
that accounts for communication among users, designers, and developers
throughout the design process.  A pilot study has been completed and a
preliminary model that represents a first step in understanding participants'
evolving perceptions and expectations of the design process and its outcomes is
described in this paper.

%X Document clustering has not been well received as an information retrieval
tool.  Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that
clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in
the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably
improve retrieval.
   We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an
attempt to improve conventional search techniques.  However, looking at
clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these
objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm.  We present a document
browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. 
We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this
interactive browsing paradigm.

%X We describe work on the visualization of bibliographic data and, to aid in
this task, the application of numerical techniques for multidimensional
scaling.
   Many areas of scientific research involve complex multivariate data.  One
example of this is Information Retrieval.  Document comparisons may be done
using a large number of variables.  Such conditions do not favour the more
well-known methods of visualization and graphical analysis, as it is rarely
feasible to map each variable onto one aspect of even a three-dimensional,
coloured and textured space.
   Bead is a prototype system for the graphically-based exploration of
information.  In this system, articles in a bibliography are represented by
particles in 3-space.  By using physically-based modelling techniques to take
advantage of fast methods for the approximation of potential fields, we
represent the relationships between articles by their relative spatial
positions.  Inter-particle forces tend to make similar articles move closer to
one another and dissimilar ones move apart.  The result is a 3D scene which can
be used to visualize patterns in the high-D information space.

%X We designed, implemented, and evaluated a new concept for visualizing and
searching databases utilizing direct manipulation called dynamic queries. 
Dynamic queries allow users to formulate queries by adjusting graphical
widgets, such as sliders, and see the results immediately.  By providing a
graphical visualization of the database and search results, users can find
trends and exceptions easily.  User testing was done with eighteen
undergraduate students who performed significantly faster using a dynamic
queries interface compared to both a natural language system and paper
printouts.  The interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find
homes meeting specific search criteria.
