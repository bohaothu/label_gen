   despite (or maybe due to) its success and its
   widespread use, some aspects remain to be clarified
   with respect to its validity and robustness. This might
   be caused by the fact that the Phong method is based on
   geometric arguments, illumination models, and clever
   heuristics. In this article we address some of the
   fundamentals that underlie Phong shading, such as the
   computation of vertex normals for nonmanifold models
   and the adequacy of linear interpolation and we apply a
   new interpolation technique to achieve an efficient and
   qualitatively improved result.",
