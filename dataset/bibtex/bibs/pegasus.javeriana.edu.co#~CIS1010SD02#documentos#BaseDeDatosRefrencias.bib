  abstract = {This paper proposes a classification approach to identify the teamâ€™s
	formation (formation means the strategical layout of the players
	in the field) in the robotic soccer domain for the two dimensional
	(2D) simulation league. It is a tool for decision support that allows
	the coach to understand the strategy of the opponent. To reach that
	goal we employ Data Mining classification techniques. To understand
	the simulated robotic soccer domain we briefly describe the simulation
	system, some related work and the use of Data Mining techniques for
	the detection of formations. In order to perform a robotic soccer
	match with different formations we develop a way to configure the
	formations in a training base team (FC Portugal) and a data preparation
	process. The paper describes the base team and the test teams used
	and the respective configuration process. After the matches between
	test teams the data is subjected to a reduction process taking into
	account the playersâ€™ position in the field given the collective.
	In the modeling stage appropriate learning algorithms were selected.
	In the solution analysis, the error rate (% incorrectly classify
	instances) with the statistic test t-Student for paired samples were
	selected, as the evaluation measure. Experimental results show that
	it is possible to automatically identify the formations used by the
	base team (FC Portugal) in distinct matches against different opponents,
	using Data Mining techniques. The experimental results also show
	that the SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) learning algorithm
	has the best performance.},

	the ball from an opponent or a teammate (receiving, goal-keeping,
	and intercepting), and (3) passing the ball between two players.
	The first two are concerned with single agent skills while the third
	one is related to a simple cooperative behavior. Motivation for these

	can interact with its environment. It is capable of responding to
	other agent and/or its environment to some degree. It has some degree
	of control over its internal state and actions based on its own model.
	The behavior of an agent has been described by BDI theory as a processing
	cycle. According to this theory we have developed the processing
	cycle with software feedback mechanism. Software feedback or loop-back
	control mechanism is capable acting without direct external intervention.
	A feedback mechanism continuously monitors the output of the system
	under control (the target system), compares the result against preset
	values (goals of the feedback control) and feeds the difference back
	to adjust the behavior of the target system in one processing cycle.
	This paper considers the modeling and design of a monitor agent with
	layered control architecture for autonomy and adaptation. The architecture
	consists three layers: schedule layer, optimization layer and regulator
	layer. The regulator layer utilizes software feedback and control
	methods in a process cycle, the optimization layer will help to adapt
	to the changing environment more precisely, the schedule layer generates
	the long-term goal for the agent. Also this paper gives a example
	of the agent for monitoring the mail server running Lotus Notes.
	Such sort of computing systems typically have two competitive control
	goals, namely: maximization of the throughput and minimization of
	the response time. A set of experimental results showing the effectiveness
	of the monitor agent for email server has been presented.},

	motor and information processing functions, the ability to interact
	with them in an ergonomic, real-time and adaptive manner becomes
	an increasingly pressing concern. In this context, the physical characteristics
	of the robotic device should become less of a direct concern, with
	the device being treated as a system that receives information, acts
	on that information, and produces information. Once the input and
	output protocols for a given system are well established, humans
	should be able to interact with these systems via a standardized
	spoken language interface that can be tailored if necessary to the
	specific system.The objective of this research is to develop a generalized
	approach for human-machine interaction via spoken language that allows
	interaction at three levels. The first level is that of commanding
	or directing the behavior of the system. The second level is that
	of interrogating or requesting an explanation from the system. The
	third and most advanced level is that of teaching the machine a new
	form of behavior. The mapping between sentences and meanings in these
	interactions is guided by a neuropsychologically inspired model of
	grammatical construction processing. We explore these three levels
	of communication on two distinct robotic platforms. The novelty of
	this work lies in the use of the construction grammar formalism for
	binding language to meaning extracted from video in a generative
	and productive manner, and in thus allowing the human to use language
	to command, interrogate and modify the behavior of the robotic systems.},

  abstract = {In robotic soccer, teams of autonomous robots play soccer according
	to rules similar to the official FIFA rules. The game is refereed
	by a human and his orders are communicated to the teams using an
	application called â€œReferee Boxâ€?. No human interference is allowed
	during the games except for removing malfunctioning robots and re-entering
	robots in the game. The base station, a software application as described
	in this paper, has a determinant role during the development of a
	robotic soccer team and also during a game. This application must
	control the agents interpreting and sending high level instructions,
	like Start or Stop, and monitor information of the robots, for example
	the position and velocity, allowing easily to attest the feasibility
	of the robots behavior. This paper discusses the importance of the
	control and monitoring of a robotic soccer team, presenting the main
	challenges and the approaches that were used by the CAMBADA team
	in the conception of the base station application. As far as we know,
	no previous work has been published about the study of these important
	problems and the discussion of an efficient architecture to a base
	station application. The results obtained by the team confirms the
	good performance of this software, both during the games and in the

	work on the cooperative multiagent coordination. The focus is on
	highly dynamic environments where the message transfer delay is not
	negligible. Therefore, the agents shall not count on communicating
	their intentions along the time they are making the decisions, because
	this will directly add the communication latencies to the decision
	making phase. The only way for the agents to be in touch is to communicate
	and share their beliefs, asynchronously with the decision making
	procedure. Consequently, they can share similar knowledge and make
	coordinated decisions based on it. However, in a very dynamic environment,
	the shared knowledge may not remain similar due to the communication
	limitations and latencies. This may lead to some inconsistencies
	in the team coordination performance. Addressing this issue, we propose
	to hold another abstraction of the environment, called Virtual World
	Model (VWM), for each agent in addition to its primary internal world
	state. The primary world state is updated as soon as a new piece
	of information is received while the information affects the VWM

	We present YOYO, a highly scalable disagreement-detection algorithm
	which guarantees sound detection in time linear in the number of

	present new upper bounds for the number of agents that must be monitored
	in a team to guarantee disagreement detection. Both YOYO and the
	new bounds are explored analytically and empirically in thousands
	of monitoring problems, scaled to thousands of agents.},

	about moving without ball is a critical factor of success. Here we
	limit our scope to the offensive situation, i.e. when the ball is
	controlled by own team, and propose a systematic method for determining
	the optimal player position. Existing methods for accomplishing this
	task do not systematically balance risks and rewards, as they are
	not Pareto optimal by design. This may result in overlooking good
	opportunities. One more shortcoming of these methods is over simplifications
	in predicting the situation on the field, which may lead to performance

	demonstrate that this results in a substantial increase in the team

  abstract = {In competitive domains, the knowledge about the opponent can give
	players a clear advantage. This idea lead us in the past to propose
	an approach to acquire models of opponents, based only on the observation
	of their input-output behavior. If opponent outputs could be accessed
	directly, a model can be constructed by feeding a machine learning
	method with traces of the opponent. However, that is not the case
	in the Robocup domain. To overcome this problem, in this paper we
	present a three phases approach to model low-level behavior of individual
	opponent agents. First, we build a classifier to label opponent actions
	based on observation. Second, our agent observes an opponent and
	labels its actions using the previous classifier. From these observations,
	a model is constructed to predict the opponent actions. Finally,
	the agent uses the model to anticipate opponent reactions. In this
	paper, we have presented a proof-of-principle of our approach, termed
	OMBO (Opponent Modeling Based on Observation), so that a striker
	agent can anticipate a goalie. Results show that scores are significantly
	higher using the acquired opponentâ€™s model of actions.},

  abstract = {It is cooperation that essentially differentiates multi-agent systems
	(MASs) from single-agent intelligence. In realistic MAS applications
	such as RoboCup, repeated work has shown that traditional machine
	learning (ML) approaches have difficulty mapping directly from cooperative
	behaviours to actuator outputs. To overcome this problem, vertical
	layered architectures are commonly used to break cooperation down
	into behavioural layers; ML has then been used to generate different
	low-level skills, and a planning mechanism added to create high-level
	cooperation. We propose a novel method called Policy Search Planning
	(PSP), in which Policy Search is used to find an optimal policy for
	selecting plans from a plan pool. PSP extends an existing gradient-search
	method (GPOMDP) to a MAS domain. We demonstrate how PSP can be used
	in RoboCup Simulation, and our experimental results reveal robustness,
	adaptivity, and outperformance over other methods.},

	As in real soccer, the recognition and prediction of strategies (e.g.

	and situations (e.g. passing behavior) is important. In 2001, we
	proposed an approach where spatio-temporal relations between objects
	are described and interpreted in order to detect some of the above

	approach that enables us to both interpret and predict complex situations.
	It is based on a qualitative description of motion scenes and additional
	background knowledge. The method is applicable to a variety of situations.
	Our experiment consists of numerous offside situations in simulation
	league games. We discuss the results in detail and conclude that
	this approach is valuable for future use because it is (a) possible
	to use the method in real-time, (b) we can predict situations giving

	this paradigm is not without its challenges brought about by the
	need for autonomy of agents in the system. While some problems can
	be solved by making the interaction protocol either strictly competitive

	incorporate both interaction schemes for improved performance. In

	considering a flexible job shop scheduling problem in a dynamic order
	environment. The system is modeled using federated agent architecture.
	We implement a simple auction mechanism at each processing center
	and a global reinforcement learning mechanism to minimize cost contents
	in the system. Results of simulations using the cooperative-competition
	approach and the strictly competitive model are presented. Simulation
	results show that there were improvements in cost objectives of the
	system when the various processing centers cooperated through the
	learning mechanism, which also provides for adaptation of the system

	execution of plans in the presence of adversaries is a significant
	challenge. In our research, a special â€œcoachâ€? agent works with
	a team of distributed agents. The coach has a global view of the
	world, but has no actions other than occasionally communicating with
	the team over a limited bandwidth channel. Our coach is given a set
	of predefined opponent models which predict future states of the
	world caused by the opponentsâ€™ actions. The coach observes the
	world state changes resulting from the execution of its team and
	opponents and selects the best matched opponent model based on its
	observations. The coach uses the recognized opponent model to predict
	the behavior of the opponent. Upon opportunities to communicate,
	the coach generates a plan for the team, using the predictions of
	the opponent model. The centralized coach generates a plan for distributed
	execution. We introduce (i) the probabilistic representation and
	recognition algorithm for the opponent models; (ii) a multi-agent
	plan representation, Multi-Agent Simple Temporal Networks; and (iii)
	a plan execution algorithm that allows the robust distributed execution
	in the presence of noisy perception and actions. The complete approach
	is implemented in a complex simulated robot soccer environment. We
	present the contributions as developed in this domain, carefully
	highlighting their generality along with a series of experiments

  abstract = {When building a representation of the environment for a robot in a
	multi-agent application, as is the case of robotic soccer, sensor
	and information fusion of several elements of the environment are
	an important task. To build an increasingly better world model, one
	of the aspects that one should consider is the treatment of obstacles.
	This paper gives an insight of the general steps necessary for a
	good obstacle representation in the robot world model. A first step
	is the visual detection of the obstacles in the image acquired by
	the robot. This is done using an algorithm based on radial search
	lines and colour-based blobs detection, where each obstacle is identified
	and delimited. After having the visually detected obstacles, a fusion
	with a-priori known information about the obstacles characteristics
	allows the obstacle separation and filtering, so that obstacles that
	donâ€™t fill the criteria are discarded. With the position information
	shared by team mates, the matching of the obstacles and the team
	mates positions is also possible, thus identifying each of them.
	Finally, and with the purpose of having a team world model as coherent
	as possible, the robots are able to share the obstacle information
	of each other. The work presented in this paper was developed for
	the CAMBADA robotic soccer team. After achieving the 1st place in
	the Portuguese robotics open RobÃ³tica2008 and in the Robocup2008
	world championship, the correct treatment of obstacles was one of
	the new challenges proposed among the team to improve the performance
	for the next competitions.},

  abstract = {A common challenge for agents in multiagent systems is trying to predict
	what other agents are going to do in the future. Such knowledge can
	help an agent determine which of its current action options are most
	likely to help it achieve its goals. Ideally, an agent could learn
	a model of other agents' behavior patterns via direct observation
	of their past actions. However, that is only possible when agents
	have many repeated interactions with one another. We explore the
	use of agent models in an application where extensive interactions
	with a particular agent are not possible, namely robotic soccer.
	In robotic soccer tournaments, such as RoboCup (Kitano et al., 1997),
	a team of agents plays against another team for a single, short (typically
	10-minute) period. The opponents' behaviors are usually not observable
	prior to this game and there are not enough interactions during the
	game to build a useful model. We introduce &ldquo;ideal-model-based
	behavior outcome prediction&rdquo; (IMBBOP). This technique predicts
	an agent's future actions in relation to the optimal behavior in
	its given situation, This optimal behavior is agent-independent and
	can therefore be computed based solely on a model of the world dynamics.
	IMBBOP does not assume that the other agent will act according to
	the theoretical optimum, but rather characterizes its expected behavior

  abstract = {Temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) has become
	a popular reinforcement learning technique in recent years. TD methods,
	relying on function approximators to generalize learning to novel
	situations, have had some experimental successes and have been shown
	to exhibit some desirable properties in theory, but the most basic
	algorithms have often been found slow in practice. This empirical
	result has motivated the development of many methods that speed up
	reinforcement learning by modifying a task for the learner or helping
	the learner better generalize to novel situations. This article focuses
	on generalizing across tasks, thereby speeding up learning, via a
	novel form of transfer using handcoded task relationships. We compare
	learning on a complex task with three function approximators, a cerebellar
	model arithmetic computer (CMAC), an artificial neural network (ANN),
	and a radial basis function (RBF), and empirically demonstrate that
	directly transferring the action-value function can lead to a dramatic
	speedup in learning with all three. Using transfer via inter-task
	mapping (TVITM), agents are able to learn one task and then markedly
	reduce the time it takes to learn a more complex task. Our algorithms
	are fully implemented and tested in the RoboCup soccer Keepaway domain.

	system for the RoboCup simulation league. It consists of a dynamic
	dual behavior-based architecture for an intelligent agent, a behavior-based
	decision algorithm, and a dynamic role-based multi-agent cooperation
	model. A new concept called confidence function is introduced to
	balance reactivity and deliberation. This architecture was implemented
	in a team, and match results demonstrate its validity.},

	recent successful token-based algorithms for task allocation and

	approach to effective coordination of large scale teams. We use tokens
	to encapsulate anything that needs to be shared by the team, including
	information, tasks and resources. The tokens are efficiently routed
	through the team via the use of local decision theoretic models.
	Each token is used to improve the routing of other tokens leading
	to a dramatic performance improvement when the algorithms work together.
	We present results from an implementation of this approach which
	demonstrates its ability to coordinate large teams.},

	a dynamic, real-time environment. For a robot team to play soccer
	successfully, various technologies have to be incorporated including
	robotic architecture, multi-agent collaboration and real-time reasoning.
	A robot is an integrated system, with a controller embedded in its
	plant. A robotic system is the coupling of a robot to its environment.
	Robotic systems are, in general, hybrid dynamic systems, consisting
	of continuous, discrete and event-driven components. Constraint Nets
	(CN) provide a semantic model for modeling hybrid dynamic systems.
	Controllers are embedded constraint solvers that solve constraints
	in real-time. A controller for our robot soccer team, UBC Dynamo98,
	has been modeled in CN, and implemented in Java, using the Java Beans
	architecture. A coach program using an evolutionary algorithm has
	also been designed and implemented to adjust the weights of the constraints
	and other parameters in the controller. The results demonstrate that
	the formal CN approach is a practical tool for designing and implementing
	controllers for robots in multi-agent real-time environments. They
	also demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the evolutionary algorithm
	to the CN-modeled controllers.},
