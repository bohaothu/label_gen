%X As applications "grow together", the integration of legacy applications is
becoming more and more important.  While there are adequate solutions for the
interoperability of non-cooperative, non-hypermedia applications the objectives
and possible solutions for integrating applications from the fields of CSCW and
hypermedia are far more complex.  Looking at existing applications, three basic
characteristics can be identified: "ordinary" (i.e. single user,
non-hypermedia) applications, cooperative applications, and hypermedia
applications.  Considering various combinations of these characteristics, the
poster presents a categorisation of different settings of calling and called
applications -- 14 categories altogether.  Examples for the categories are
given along with problems that arise when aiming at integrating external
applications in these settings.

%D 1997
%X The term hypermedia is currently synonymous with the World Wide Web (Web).
However in its present form the Web is failing to realise the original ethos of
hypermedia systems to augment the users creative and cognitive process.  Our
aim is to address this failure by enabling readers to superimpose their own
organisation onto existing hypermedia collections thus freeing them from the
imposition of inappropriate presentational style and structure.  Our contention
is that such a system would enable us to shift the traditional roles of author
and reader, empowering the reader to determine for themselves the structure and
content of documents.

%X In this poster we present an HTML-like language that supports embedded
timing information that can be used for the construction of a "playback"
schedule for the various media contained in a hypermedia document.  This
language is the core of our model multimedia documents, which preserves the
spatio-temporal presentation of the involved media.  In order to test the
validity and the performance characteristics of the language a pilot
application has been implemented under the UNIX and Windows 95 platforms.  The
network handling routines have been implemented with the use of the RTP/RTCP
protocols.

%T HyperGeo: A Hypermedia-Based Geographical Information System
%S Posters
%A Patrice Boursier
%B Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext -- Posters and

%D 1997
%X If we consider the whole set of spatially-oriented applications, we must
differentiate between two kinds of users, expert users on the one hand and
non-experienced or naive ones on the other hand.  In order to satisfy the
different kinds of user requirements, various approaches have thus been
proposed for querying so-called geographical information systems (GIS).
Following these considerations, we have developed a user interface model which
provides a simple environment for presenting and interacting with geographical
entities through what we have called dynamic maps.  This approach is based on
the HyperGeo data model.

%X The open growth of the Internet, the amount of available information, and
the typical access modality (i.e., browsing) cause the puzzled user to search
for the information of interest in a labyrinth of links.  Web-at-a-Glance (WAG)
is a system allowing the user to query (instead of browsing) the Web.  WAG
performs this ambitious task by constructing a personalized database, pertinent
to the user's interests.  The system semi-automatically gleans the most
relevant information from several Web sites, stores it into a database, and
provides the user with a visual query interface equipped with a powerful
multimedia query language.

%X Storytelling is used to arrange content into meaningful patterns.  But a
narrative includes not only the story being told (content) but also the
conditions of its telling (structure and context).  In a purely tutorial
training programme, the structure of the storytelling is a linear ordering of
parts of the story, organised in a logical and hierarchical structure.  But how
can one keep the linear structure of the tutorial approach and still give the
user keys for cross-reference (context)?  Dividing the story into separate
independent units (e.g. through concept-mapping) and combining it with
hypermedia-techniques provide a possible answer.

%X New forms for structuring information in interactive systems need continual
quality control, above all at the design stage, to maintain and promote
user-computer communication.  We present the quality criteria and metrics
required to be able to evaluate a hypertext and hypermedia application though
the use of Hypermedia Design Model (HDM).  The objective is to elaborate a
method for design- oriented hypertext/hypermedia evaluation.  Knowing the types
of resources in each case study helps the production of our method given that
it clarifies the specific entities to be studied and the type of metric to be
applied (principally in statistical areas).

%X Our research concerns author support for semantic hypermedia systems by
using a terminological conceptual model to automatically infer links.  The
model is managed by the GALEN Terminological Service acting as a link
resolution service in an open hypermedia environment and is represented in the
Description Logic GRAIL.  GRAIL supports the principled composition of complex
descriptions and dynamic auto-classification of those descriptions to act as a)
a typed link system and b) a semantic index capable of supporting imprecise and
exploratory content-based queries.  Exploratory prototypes include a system for
tourist information (TourisT) and standardisation documentation.

%X This poster deals with the problem of automatic cross-referencing in a
hypertext book.  A statistical approach is first introduced, based on the
computation of similarity coefficients between pieces of texts.  After this, a
complementary approach is considered to benefit from a priori information such
as existing manual cross-references.  A semi-automatic method to generate
cross-references is finally outlined.

%X The Pausanian method is a diagrammatic notation for representing the static
and dynamic properties of a single or a collection of hypertext documents in
order to help the designer to visualise their hypertextual structure.  It
employs a wide range of shapes and symbols based on the characteristics that
compose the structure of a document containing hypertext links.  The name
Pausanian derives from Pausanias, a Greek historian, traveller and geographer.
During the 2nd century AD he was travelling around Greece and describing all
the sites and monuments he was seeing.  His work was called "Description of
Greece" which gives a detailed account of the monuments of art and of the
legends connected with them.

independently.  A web server with an SSL-module and a database has been
extended to create a filofax-like user interface.  Project groups can schedule
meetings or personal dates, gather notes and administer lists etc. without
being confined to a single operating system or location.  Confidentiality is

%X The presentation concerns current research into the extent to which
hypermedia is priviledged in the understanding and development of concept-based
art.  The work processes along two strands of inquiry, the precedence of idea
over representation in the history of art and the development of hypermedia
technology as 'idea holding'.  The two are brought together through the
practise of transposing the work of Marcel Duchamp, summated in his piece the
'Large Glass,' into hypermedia.  The work discussed at this event will cover
the pilot study for the project, an Internet piece entitled '4D Duchamp'.

%T Hyperfiction Interfaces

%D 1997
%X In the paper I will address the question of hyperfiction interfaces,
concentrating on two texts: Michael Joyce's 'Afternoon. a story' and Stuart
Moulthrop's 'Victory Garden'.  In the case of these two hyperfictional
narratives the concrete interaction mainly occurs at the level of plot -- the
arrangement of narrative units (lexias).  In addition, the reader's decisions
have effects also at the levels of story and narration.  I suggest that
hyperfiction interfaces might be developed in the direction, where the formal
aspects of interaction were more explicit for the reader, thus making the
effect of interaction stronger, still allowing a high degree of openness for
the text.

%X At the University of Southampton we are carrying out a research project
called SHAPE (Southampton Hypermedia Authoring Paradigm for Education).  The
aim of SHAPE is to aid authors in the development of good quality large-scale
hypermedia applications for education.  In this sense, good quality means easy
reuse and maintenance of information.  We also expect the authoring tool to
influence the authoring process in a positive manner.  We are developing
metrics in order to identify how adequate an authoring tool is for the
maintainability of applications, information reuse in applications as well as
the level of authoring effort required.  The poster will illustrate the results
from the first SHAPE study and discuss their analysis.  It will also show the
methods by which we are collecting data for the quantitative evaluation of
hypermedia authoring.

%X Hypertextual and poststructuralist theory have yet to produce a fully
theorised practice of poststructuralist feminist hyper-textuality in research
writing.  A recent feminist text, Lather and Smithies' Troubling Angels: Women
Living with HIV/AIDS (1995/7) mixes genres and plays with format -- but
struggles to break out of the linear, closed form of the book.  With the
author's consent I have reinscribed it as a hypertext, less a reiteration than
a re-placement of her text(s) and a supplement.  This demonstration does not
seek to raze the disciplines of research, but to raise questions about their
textual conditions of possibility and to open up such texts to further
readings, including the authors.

%X The explosive growth in the volume of information available electronically
continues unabated.  Managing these large quantities of information remains a
challenge for management in both government and industry.  TRW's Digital Media
Systems Lab has been working for five years to address the problems of
information management for a wide range of disciplines.  The prototype system
that has resulted from this research, InfoWeb, can be described as an
'information infrastructure.' The subsystems integrated within InfoWeb
primarily serve to generate and manage descriptive metadata associated with
'content objects' text, complex documents, graphics, images, video, audio,
numeric data, etc.  The metadata add value to the intellectual content of the
content objects and provide for varied retrieval strategies, notably through
complex searches and automatic hyperlinks.  Once a relevant object has been
located through a search, much useful navigation of the data space can be
conducted by following links.

%T Systematic Use of Flexible Process Model to Build Hypermedia Artefacts

%X We propose an innovative, integrated software process model, called Flexible
Process Model, to be applied in the development of hypermedia artefacts.  This
strategy, when instanciated in a specific project, implies a systematic use of
model-based constructors, both logical and physical models. Among the first we
can enumerate plan model as well as requirement, conceptual, navigational,
abstract interfaces and validation models.  Among the second, we use
essentially flexible prototypes as physical model.  We will schematise the
phases, tasks and activities, in a high level of granularity.  Next, we will
stress functional, informational and behavioural perspectives.

%X Our purpose is to provide a hypertext model and authoring methodology that
support the creation of high quality documents and reduce authoring and
maintenance efforts.  The hypertext model consists of the schema, constraint
and quality models.  A schema includes typed nodes and links and
interconnection constraints.  Explicitly specified constraints express further
semantic or structural properties.  The quality model employs constraints and
well-defined primitive metrics, and enables author to define measurements of
high level document characteristics, for example usability, and to control the
conformance of document to the corresponding schema.  The use of constraint and
quality specifications facilitates iterative document evaluation and enables
flexible schema and document evolution.

%X Reformatting information currently held in databases into HTML pages
suitable for the Web requires significant effort both in creating the pages
initially and their subsequent maintenance.  These costs can be avoided by
coupling a Web server to the source data within a database.  The purpose of
this research is to generate automatically Web interfaces to object-relational
databases using metadata from the database catalogue.  A prototype system has
been developed to provide automatic Web interfaces employing a graphical means
of specifying queries.  Hypertext browsing of object-relational databases is
made possible by creating dynamic links that are included automatically within
the query results.  These links are derived from relationships inferred by
referential integrity constraints defined in the metadata.

integrated set of hypertext materials, consisting of subject overviews,
summaries of key texts and, crucially, a 'reading list' of full-text extracts
from key works, were produced for each of three modules ('Postmodernism and

Collaborative Hypermedia Educational Framework (CHEF) for instruction.  The
framework provides a fundamental philosophy for serving students, instructors
and content developers in a principled manner.  This framework also should
provide guidance on how to best utilize new technologies.  As a framework based
on learning theories and principles, we believe it also will serve traditional
classroom activities.  We describe how CHEF meets criteria of several
educational theories: anchored instruction, cognitive flexibility theory,
student centered teaching, scaffolded knowledge integration, and active
learning.

%X Hypermedial learning programs reproduce the cognitive dynamics inherent in
man, allowing students to construct learning paths through exploration.  This
stimulates talented students but tends to penalize those less able to manage
their learning paths alone.  We propose Hyperpro-plus, an intelligent
hypermedia system for learning logic programming and Prolog embodying a tutor
component and a virtual partner component.  The tutor can globally assess the
student's performance and dynamically reconfigure the knowledge accessible, to
contain him within suitable paths.  The virtual partner helps him to solve any
difficulties encountered with structured exercises, guiding him with minimal
suggestions.  It acts as a learning mate, adopting the same level of knowledge
as the student to create a collaborative relationship between peers.

we developed a very simple 'agent' that parses the document supplied by the

document tailored to user's interests.  The agent supports filtering of links
and of semantically tagged parts of the document, as well as multi-ended and
weighted links.  The hypertext provider must just use a very simple HTML
extension, that allow to semantically tag paragraphs and links, and does not
affect the actions taken by an ordinary HTML browser.

%X Although much research effort has been invested to address the "lost in
hyperspace" (LIH) problem, it still remains unsolved.  The LIH problem has
given rise to much controversy itself.  Some think that LIH is one of the most
difficult issues in hypertext research; while others think LIH is not a
significant problem, and that efforts should be channelled to address more
pressing issues such as response times and conventional human factors.  In this
paper, we argue that LIH is real and certainly merits further investigation. 
LIH is not just a psychological problem, it is also an engineering one.

%D 1997
%X The use of the Web as a digital library has been restricted to a
distribution mechanism for documents with little advantage of the power of
hypertext linking.  The Distributed Link Service is being used in the 3-year
Open Journals project to create new ways of using online documentary resources.
This demonstration will show how the DLS can be used to add citation links to
an e-print archive of Cognitive Science journal articles.  The articles,
unlinked in their various native formats, are delivered to a standard WWW
browser via a DLS proxy server.  As it does so it compares their contents
against a citation database and dynamically links citations in the article's
text to the document's bibliography, and links each matching bibliographic item
to information from the citation database.  This technique can either be used
to enhance the hypertext functionality of legacy documents, or as a native
mechanism for providing hypertext navigation on a new environment.  It is
particularly useful for overlaying a choice of navigational views onto
collections of documents which are controlled or delivered by third-party
servers.

assume that only object-oriented DataBase Management Systems (DBMS's) can meet
the persistence requirements of hypermedia applications and that relational
DBMS's are not well suited for this purpose.  However, in this demo, we
demonstrate how a light, personal version of a relational DBMS (in casu Oracle)
*can* be used to support a distributed hypermedia system.  From the database
representation, different sets of hypermedia documents are generated
automatically.  Moreover, when the information in the database is updated, the
corresponding documents are automatically regenerated as well, and a personal
hyperbase can be synchronised with a central server when it is integrated in
the distributed infrastructure.

service consists of a Java applet (DHM/WWW) extending the Netscape Navigator
WWW browser with an interface to create and follow links stored on a DHM

create links to/from web-pages regardless of the ownership of the pages.  The
DHM/WWW applet acts as a filter of HTML documents and as an interface to the
DHM server.  The DHM/WWW inserts links (retrieved from the DHM server) into
documents as they are retrieved by the WWW browser, thus making the
presentation of link transparent to the user.

two weak forms of guided tour that can be implemented in HTML and follow this
with a more sophisticated tour implemented using a scripting language. 
Finally, we describe a full-featured guided tour that provides the user with
complete control over the progress through the tour and excursions from it.

%T Converting TeX Into a PDF-Generating Tool
%S Demonstrations
%A Han The Thanh
%B Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext -- Posters and
Demonstrations
%D 1997
%X The program tex2pdf is a combination of TeX as a formatting and typesetting
system and PDF (Portable Document Format) as an open standard for hypertext
document format designed by Adobe.  tex2pdf tries to take advantages of both
TeX and PDF.  As the result it allows for better integration of hypertext
features introduced by PDF with the level of quality of TeX-formatted output.
Generating PDF-based hypertexts out from sources based on a
programming-language-like description also allows to create complex hypertext
documents with high typographical quality in an easy way.

%T Supporting User-Defined Activity Spaces
%S Demonstrations
%A Weigang Wang
%A Joerg Haake
%B Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext -- Posters and
Demonstrations
%D 1997
%X This demonstration will present the COWFISH (Cooperative Work in Flexible
Information Systems using Hypermedia) system and illustrate its approach to the
common problems in using and creating hypermedia-based task-specific activity
spaces.  Examples will be given to show how an activity space is defined with
an example-based method, what intelligent aid is available for users of
predefined activity spaces, and how an emergent pattern (a schema) is captured
through gradual transformation from informal representations to more formal
representations.

%T Spatial Hypertext and Multiscale Fiction-Pad++, PadDraw, Gray Matters
%S Demonstrations
%A Noah Wardrip-Fruin
%A Jonathan Meyer
%B Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext -- Posters and
Demonstrations
%D 1997
%X Pad++ is a novel zoomable hypermedia system designed for exploring
alternatives to traditional window and icon-based interfaces.  The continuous,
multiscale representation of the Pad surface allows high-level information to
be recognized and manipulated at a distance, while low-level detail remains
embedded in its context.  PadDraw is a sample application built on top of Pad++
which supports the interactive creation, connection, and manipulation of
objects.  Gray Matters is a hypertext fiction created within PadDraw, in which
15 images from Gray's Anatomy form a patchwork body, each containing texts from
four authors.  Multiscale reading and navigation of Gray Matters can be
accomplished with a single-button mouse or touchscreen.

%T Educational Hypertext: Design and Evaluation
%S Demonstrations
%A S. Wilkinson
%A A. Crerar
%A N. Falchikov
%B Proceedings of the Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext -- Posters and
Demonstrations
%D 1997
%X The hypertext system being demonstrated was implemented as an on-line Help
file running under Windows 95. It contains the material of a major HCI text
running to about 800 pages in the paper version and approximately 1,400 nodes
in the hypertext.  The first author will be demonstrating the various features
of the user interface and describing the underlying design decisions made
during system development.  Performance and usability comparisons will be made
between book and hypertext.  More details are reported in a Poster, by the same
authors, at this conference (see 'Document Structure, Individual Differences
and the Learning Process').  The authors are grateful to Addison-Wesley for
supplying an ASCII version of Preece et al. (1994) Human-Computer Interaction.
