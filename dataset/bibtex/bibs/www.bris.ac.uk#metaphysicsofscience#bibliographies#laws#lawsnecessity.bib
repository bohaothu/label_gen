  volume = {144},
  pages = {381–396},
  abstract = {In this paper I discuss and evaluate different arguments for the view
	that the 
	
	laws of nature are metaphysically necessary. I conclude that essentialist
	arguments from 
	
	the nature of natural kinds fail to establish that essences are ontologically
	more basic than 
	
	laws, and fail to offer an a priori argument for the necessity of
	all causal laws. Similar 
	
	considerations carry across to the argument from the dispositionalist
	view of properties, 
	
	which may end up placing unreasonable constraints on property identity
	across possible 
	
	worlds. None of my arguments preclude the possibility that the laws
	may turn out to 
	
	be metaphysically necessary after all, but I argue that this can only
	be established by a 
	
	posteriori scientific investigation. I therefore argue for what may
	seem to be a surpris- 
	
	ing conclusion: that a fundamental metaphysical question – the modal
	status of laws of 
	
	nature – depends on empirical facts rather than purely on a priori
	reasoning.},

	plausibility, try to explain them. One way would be to suppose that
	they are imposed on the world by God. The other would be to suppose
	that they reflect the presence of laws of nature, conceived of as
	forms of natural necessity. But the only way of making sense of the
	notion of a law of nature, thus conceived, is by construing a law
	as the causing of the associated regularity, and the only remotely
	plausible account of such causing would be in terms of the agency
	of God. So, by whichever route, we are led to the conclusion that
	the regularities are brought about by God. So the presence of the
	regularities in nature provides us with a strong case for accepting
	the existence of God.},

	"realist" attempts to provide special facts to ground the laws of

	reduction of nomological necessity are briefly introduced in I. In
	II, Hempel's treatment of the paradoxes is contrasted with a position
	which holds that nomological necessity is a pragmatic dimension of
	laws of nature, and that this pragmatic dimension is of such a type
	that it prevents laws of nature from contraposing. Such a position
	is, however, untenable unless (i) the sense of 'pragmatics' at issue
	is specified, and the possibility of pragmatic differences resulting
	in differences in confirmation is defended, and (ii) a relevant pragmatic
	difference between contrapositives is indicated. III attempts to
	satisfy condition (i) by developing a new sense of pure pragmatics
	and argues that some remarks by Goodman and Scheffler together with
	work on the logic of explanation by Dr. Rescher and myself suggest
	that nomological contrapositives are not pragmatically equivalent
	(i.e. substitutable salva veritate in the pure pragmatics of an ideal
	scientific language). If such is the case, condition (ii) is also
	satisfied.},
