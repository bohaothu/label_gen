  abstract = {Mobile multimedia communication will particularly rely on IP multicasting, as users commonly share frequency bands of limited capacities. This paper is dedicated to the problem of mobile Source Specific Multicast (SSM) senders. We propose extensions to multicast routing for transforming (morphing) previous delivery trees into optimal trees rooted at a relocated source. This extension scheme only requires basic signaling mechanisms, explicit joins and prunes. First evaluations grounded on real-world Internet topologies indicate network performance superior to traditional distribution schemes. As corresponding application we furtheron introduce a videoconferencing and communication software of distributed architecture. It is built as a simple, ready-to-use scheme for distributed presenting, recording and streaming multimedia content over next generation unicast or multicast networks.},
