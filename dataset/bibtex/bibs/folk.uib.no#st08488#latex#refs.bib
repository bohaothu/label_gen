   Journal = {J. Climate},
   Volume = {13},
   Number = {21},
   Pages = {3760-3788},
   Abstract = {The extremes of surface temperature, precipitation, and wind speed and their changes under projected changes in radiative forcing are examined in an ensemble of three transient climate change simulations for the years 1900-2100 conducted with the global coupled model of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis. The evolution of the greenhouse gases and aerosols in these simulations is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1992 scenario A. The extremes are analyzed in three 21-yr time periods centered at years 1985, 2050, and 2090. The model simulates reasonably well the extremes of the contemporary near-surface climate. Changes in extremes of daily maximum and daily minimum temperature are distinctively different and are related to changes in the mean screen temperature, soil moisture, and snow and sea-ice cover. Extreme precipitation increases almost everywhere on the globe. Relative change in extreme precipitation is larger than change in total precipitation. Extreme wind speed in the extratropics changes only modestly. Changes in duration of extended wet and dry periods are consistent with changes in total precipitation. There are temperature-related changes in cooling and heating degree days.},
