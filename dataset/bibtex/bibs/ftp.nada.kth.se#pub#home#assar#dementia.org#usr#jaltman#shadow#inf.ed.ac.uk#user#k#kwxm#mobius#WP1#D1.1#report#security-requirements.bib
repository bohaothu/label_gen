  ABSTRACT =	 {We review the existing literature on Java safety,
                  emphasizing formal approaches, and the impact of
                  Java safety on small footprint devices such as smart
                  cards. The conclusion is that while a lot of good
                  work has been done, a more concerted effort is
                  needed to build a coherent set of machine readable
                  formal models of the whole of Java and its
                  implementation. This is a formidable task but we
                  believe it is essential to building trust in Java
                  safety, and thence to achieve ITSEC level 6 or
                  Common Criteria level 7 certification for Java
                  programs.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {We show how to efficiently obtain linear a priori
                  bounds on the heap space consumption of first-order
                  functional programs. The analysis takes space reuse
                  by explicit deallocation into account and also
                  furnishes an upper bound on the heap usage in the
                  presence of garbage collection. It covers a wide
                  variety of examples including, for instance, the
                  familiar sorting algorithms for lists, including
                  quicksort. The analysis relies on a type system with
                  resource annotations. Linear programming (LP) is
                  used to automatically infer derivations in this
                  enriched type system. We also show that integral
                  solutions to the linear programs derived correspond
                  to programs that can be evaluated without any
                  operating system support for memory management. The
                  particular integer linear programs arising in this
                  way are shown to be feasibly solvable under mild
                  assumptions.}
