  abstract	= {This paper presents the Haggle network architecture and
		  experimental measurements of its performance in a realistic
		  environment. Haggle provides a search-based data
		  dissemination framework for mobile opportunistic
		  communication environments, making it easy to share content
		  directly between intermittently connected mobile devices.
		  
		  Haggle's novel approach is based on its identification of
		  search as a first class operation for data-centric
		  applications. We show how search can be used for resolution
		  (mapping data to interested receivers) and prioritization
		  of sending and receiving data during encounters between
		  nodes. Haggle provides underlying functionality for
		  neighbor discovery, resource management and resolution --
		  thus removing the need to implement such features in
		  applications.
		  
		  Haggle has been implemented for several platforms. This
		  paper presents experimental results, the most interesting
		  of which demonstrates the live operation of Haggle on
		  mobile phones in an office environment.}
