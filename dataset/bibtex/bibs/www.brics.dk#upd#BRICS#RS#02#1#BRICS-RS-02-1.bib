                  project, which aims to design and implement a
                  high-level domain-specific language for
                  programming interactive Web services.\bibpar
                  A fundamental aspect of the development of the
                  World Wide Web during the last decade is the
                  gradual change from static to dynamic
                  generation of Web pages. Generating Web pages
                  dynamically in dialogue with the client has the
                  advantage of providing up-to-date and
                  tailor-made information. The development of
                  systems for constructing such dynamic Web
                  services has emerged as a whole new research
                  area.\bibpar
                  The {\tt<bigwig>} language is designed by
                  analyzing its application domain and
                  identifying fundamental aspects of Web services
                  inspired by problems and solutions in existing
                  Web service development languages. The core of
                  the design consists of a session-centered
                  service model together with a flexible
                  template-based mechanism for dynamic Web page
                  construction. Using specialized program
                  analyses, certain Web specific properties are
                  verified at compile-time, for instance that
                  only valid HTML 4.01 is ever shown to the
                  clients. In addition, the design provides
                  high-level solutions to form field validation,
                  caching of dynamic pages, and temporal-logic
                  based concurrency control, and it proposes
                  syntax macros for making highly domain-specific
                  languages. The language is implemented via
                  widely available Web technologies, such as
                  Apache on the server-side and JavaScript and
                  Java Applets on the client-side. We conclude
                  with experience and evaluation of the project",
