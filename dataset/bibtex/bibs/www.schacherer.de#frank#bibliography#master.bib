Here are ways to breach them: 1. Find the {\em second} right answer. It might be better than the obvious one. 2. Brainstorm, forget about logic, imagine and associate, ask 'What if?'. 3. Play. 4. Explore into areas where you are not a specialist, if you have a trail leading there. 5. Break the rules. Chances are, there is no good reason for them anymore. 6. Allow ambiguity. 7. Do not be afraid of errors. Learn from them, and improve. Finally, judge and organize the results of your creative process. If you came up with a good idea, put work into it and fight for it - since everything new will hit a lot of opposition.

Reduce what you want to tell, but don't rush trough it -- you would not say 'I love you' quickly either, and neither should anything other important be rushed. 3.

Kaltenbach is an adept of Brian Tracy, but his book is much simpler and more practical than Tracy's. My main takeaway is that to be a good salesperson, you must like people, must be confident in yourself and your product, and more than anything must listen rather than talk. Ask questions to lead, instead of making statements. Try to understand what is important for the customer, to know how you can fill his need. When you talk, always focus on the customer and his benefit, don't talk about yourself or your product. Objections are good, because they shows interest, someone without would not bother. Don't talk about price before you have been able to understand the need and show the value. Prepare. There are lots of question lists and sample formulations. All in all a useful read.",

If the answer is no, ask 'What do we have to do to stop wasting resources on it?' Innovation needs to be immediately applicable, or you'll never get there, and besides, the future will not be what you expect it to be. Since change creates opportunities for innovation look for change. Practical sources for innovation are unexpected success or failure, also customer's, suppliers, competitor's. A mismatch between reality as it is, and as it should be according to your assumptions or experience. Look closer and try to understand: what is going on? Investigate.

Positional goods must by definition be limited to the few. Success makes self-assured, radiating security, which females fall for. Meaningful developments have a larger time scale, daily news are too fine-grained and just measure noise. Losses register twice as strong emotionally as gains. So don't look at your stocks often. Decisions needs emotion to feel when getting more information is not worth the effort it any more. Recency bias: thinking things will go on as in the past. Hume, Popper: Theories can only be falsified, never proven. Survivor bias: in any large group there will be winners by chance alone, but as you only see the winners, you believe they have ability (business leaders, hedge fund managers). Path dependency bias: how you get to a point influences how you see it - owning a million after poverty is much different than after a billion. With conditional probabilities people often ignoring the condition. Thinking result implies cause, when cause leads to result, but so can other causes.

According to this biography, he did this by buying on the cheap companies in trouble with good sales channels and customer bases, usually by stock exchange in a kind of merger. Then he cut costs by integrating the back office, streamlined operations and laid off staff, and had them cross-sell. Rinse and repeat. Some of his advise: On goals: Recognize and play on your strengths. Never give in for despair. Dream big. Take risks, and get to the next level. On Acquisitions: They should do one or more of: consolidate business and generate savings on shared functions; add products and diversity enhancing the value offerd to customers; add management talent. Only make acqisitions that do not dilute your rate on equity return. On negotiations: avoid pushing for the absolute cheapest deal. Leave some room for the seller to feel good about the transaction, too. Best enter negotiations from a position of strength. On costs: Keep costs under control during good times and keep a strong capital position to be flexible in bad times. One time large investments are OK, but cost day by day must be kept low. No frivolous spending. Speed of action is a great competitive asset. Manage for continuous short term results, and the long term will take care of itself. Use reporting tools that give you real-time information on each businesses' key drivers, so you can identify anomalies early. Contain operating risks -- manage day-to-day operations conservatively to have a steady base of recurring earnings. On execution: The CEO must focus on execution. Corporate culture, relations to the outside, coprorate and vision are meaningless if you can't execute. Formality and hierarchy slows decision making. Everybody should think on their feet and express what they believe. If you want to be successful, you need to understand the business, develop good instincts and make decisive decisions.

It helps you to learn about your business, and helps you to seize up people. Don't manage from a thirty-thousand feet. Walk the floor and drop in unannounced. Read voraciously. Develop personal relationships with others in the industry. Understand how operations, the back office works. Move ahead right away once you make a decision. On mistakes: surface the errors in judgment, correct the mistake, and move on. Learn the lesson, but don't dwell on past mistkes or missed opportunities. Better ones will come along. On looking ahead: Worry perpetually about the future, do not rest on past accomplishments. Don't get tripped up by clinging to a fixed vision of the future. Read and see changes in the environment early. On people management: Align management objectives with company objectives by using strongly differentiated incentives. Don't humor power struggles, they can debilate the entire company. Effective leadership demands doing what's right and not simply placating executives. Insist on informality, develop personal relationships, include spouses, so people have support from home as their partners can see what they work for and feel part of it.

  synopsis =     "A funny title for a book and a wonderful little book. The rules are: However menial and trivial your early assignments may appear, give them your best efforts. Demonstrate the ability to get things done. In carrying out a project, do not wait passively for anyone -- supliers, sales people, colleagues, supervisors -- to make good on their delivery promises; go after them and keep relentlessly after them. Confirm your instructions and the other person's commitments in writing. When sent on a business trip of any kind, prepare for it, execute the business to completion, and follow up after you return. Develop a >>Let's go see!<< attitude. Avoid the appearance of vacillating. Don't be timid -- speak up -- express yourself and promote your ideas. Strive for conciseness and clarity in oral and written reports. Be extremely careful of the accuracy of your statements. Every manager must know what goes on in his or her domain. One of the first things you owe your supervisor is to keep him or her informed of all significant developments. Do not overlook the steadfast truth that your direct supervisor is your 'boss'. Be as particular as you can in the selection of your supervisor. Whatever your supervisor wants done takes top priority. Whenever your are asked by your manager to do something, your are expected to do exactly that. Do not be too anxious to defer or embrace your manager's instructions. Never invade the domain of any other department without the knowledge and consent of the manager in charge. In all transactions be careful to 'deal in' everyone who has a right to be in. Cultivate the habit of seeking other peoples' opinions and recommendations. Promises, schedules and estimates are necessary and important instruments in a well-ordered business. When you are dissatisfied with the service of another department, make your complaint to teh individual most directly responsible for the function involved. In dealing with customers and outsiders, remember that you represent the company, ostensibly with full responsibility and authority. There are also rules for managers: Every manager must know what goes on in his or her domain. (Yep, a repeat). Cultivate the habit of 'boiling matters down' to their simplest terms. Do not get excited in emergencies -- keep your feet on the ground. Meetings should be neither too large, nor too small. Cultivate the habit of making brisk, clean-cut decisions. Do not overlook the value of suitable 'preparation' before announcing a major decision or policy. Learn project management skills and techniques, then apply them to the activities that you manage. Plan your development work far enough ahead of production, so as to meet schedules without a wild, last minute-rush. Beware the lure of 'playing it safe'. Be content to 'freeze' a project when the development has progressed far enough. Constantly review projects to make certain that actual benefits are in line with costs in money, time, and human resources. Make it a rule to require, and submit, regular periodic progress reports, as well as final reports on completed projects. Make sure that everyone has been assigned definite positions and responsibilities within the organisation. Make sure that everyone has the authority they need to execute their jobs and meet their responsibilities. Make sure all activities and all individuals are supervised by someone competent in the subject matter involved. Never misrepresent a subordinate's performance during performance appraisals. Make it unquestionably clear what is expected of employees. Promote the personal and pfrofessional interests of your employees at all occasions. Do not hang on to employees too selfishly when they are offered a better opportunity elsewhere. Do not short-circuit or override your subordinates if you can possibly avoid it. You owe it to your staff to keep them properly informed. Do not critique a subordinate in front of others, especially his or her own subordinates. Show an interest in what your staff is doing. Never miss a chance to commend or reward subordinates

 done. Always keep full responsibility for your group and the individuals in it. Do all you can to see that your subordinates get all of the salary to which they are entitled. Do all you can to protect the personal interests of your staff and their families. Finally, there's a section about personal considerations: One of the most valuable personal traits is the ability to get along with all kinds of people. Do not be too affable. Regard your personal integrity as one of your most important assets. Never underestimate the extent of your professional responsibility and personal liability. Let ethical behaviour govern your actions and those of your company. Be aware of the effect your personal appearance has on others and, in turn, on you. Refrain from using profanity in the workplace. Take it upon yourself to learn what constitutes harassment and discrimination -- racial, ethnic, sexual, religious -- and tolerate it not at all in yourself, your colleagues, your subordinates, or your company. beare of what you commit in writing, and of who will read it. Beware of using your employer's resources for personal purposes. It may be considered suspicious at best, and larcennous at worst. Maintain your employability and that of your staff.

Everyone has some private information about reality, and individual errors tend to cancel out. Mixed skill levels in a group can also help good decisions by giving more perspectives. Groups of only strong spend too much time exploiting, and not enough exploring. Herding -- copying the behavior or opinions of others (also called groupthink) makes them dumber. For yourself, it may be better to follow the crowd then trust your own judgement, but for all, it is better if each decides for himself. Seqential decision making encourages herd behavior, because you observe others' decisions and they influence your own. Speculation, basing your decisions on the expected decisions of others, who do the same, makes groups unstable. It, like herding can lead to bubbles.",

Therfore you should differentiate the hell out of them, via features and matching pricing for different customer groups. That there is a tendency for lock-in, when information goods get linked with other systems, so that users are stuck with them because of high switching costs. Thus, cautious customers might demand a discount to make up for the pricing power that this gives to you. And that a network economy is characterized by positive feedback, where goods are more valuable the more people use them (demand side economies of scale), which leads to a winner-takes-all outcome.

The intersting parts explain how psychology rather then fundamental value drives valuatiuons: like in a big Ponzi scheme, people see past price increases, extrapolate from there, buy, and thus feed further increases. It works as long as enough do it. There is a psychological process called anchoring which tricks our brain to extrapolate from the current environment, and makes it hard to visualize future drastic changes.

But without storage costs, like for MP3 files in a music site, you can afford to carry obscure things. Even though each of them sells rarely, there are so many that overall this 'long tail' of diverse, low popularity stuff means serious business. For this to work you need ways for people to explore their niche of interest. Common examples are classifications with most popular lists at each level, related-things list based on what other people pick together or like, tagging, and user reviews. Production costs are also falling, creating a lot of user generated content (Wikis, Blogs, Music, Video, Software), some of it great.

Change is needed for succes yet carries risk. People will take risk and show initiative only when they don't fear punishment for mistakes. Be fair, honest, open. Care for your people, protect them. Threats motivate little, destroy trust, can't force people to do the impossible, and must be executed on failure. Pressure wonÂ´t speed up. PEOPLE UNDER PRESSURE DO NOT THINK FASTER. Long term pressure leads to burnout, kills productivity. In hiring trust gut feeling. Have two people at the interview, two guts are better than one. Listen more than you speak. Identify and track risks, cut losses, cancel failed efforts early -- it's more effective than optimizing what works. Use already working teams, and donÂ´t split them. Have a Kassandra, and provide an anonymous way to tell you about problems. A day lost at the start HURTS JUST AS MUCH as at the end. ThereÂ´s always pathological policy, you can't do anything about it. Build models to quantify your instincts. Measure the size of what you build, to gauge the effort ahead. Improving processes costs time now to pay off in the long run, maybe. Be wary, rigid processes can eat productivity. Spend your time to understand and make a sound design. Then implementation is swift, debugging short. Ambiguous specs result from interest conflict. A spec should list all inputs and outputs, and you must be able to understand it. Else it's crap. Negotiation is hard, mediation easier. DonÂ´t overstaff, people will get in each others way. Issue topics before meetings and stick to them, so people can skip them, keeping them efficient.

The rapid growth of the volume of pathway data has spurred the development of databases and computational tools to aid interpretation; however, use of these data is hampered by the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases with incompatible formats. BioPAX, which was created through a community process, solves this problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. Using BioPAX, millions of interactions, organized into thousands of pathways, from many organisms are available from a growing number of databases. This large amount of pathway data in a computable form will support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.",

  synopsis =     "A usual first step in the interpretation of large amount of microarray data is the clustering of the genes by their expression properties. Several unsupervised clustering methods are commonly in use, including K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps and others. Of particular importance are hierarchical clustering schemes, which arrange the data in a tree-like structure, where genes with similar expression patterns occupy neighboring 'leaves' of the tree. The major advantage of this method is that it allows an analysis of the data at different levels of 'granularity': it is possible to look at various 'family sizes' defined by various degrees of expression similarity. The algorithms used for hierarchical clustering are largely the same as used for distance-based phylogenetic reconstruction from sequence data, but restricted to those methods that are fast enough to deal with large numbers of nodes. Provisions for testing the statistical significance of individual 'clades', e.g. by bootstrapping, are commonplace in phylogenetic reconstruction but are not normally used in expression clustering. Thus, a microarray experiments with N genes results in N-1 clusters. It is obvious that not of all these clusters can be scrutinized manually for their biological relevance. We present a method for the automatic re-annotation of hierarchical clustering data by looking for statistically significant 'enrichment' of biological properties in co-expression clusters. The nature of the biological properties used for the re-annotation can be heterogeneous: all classification schemes of genes or gene products are possible. Interesting applications include data from biological pathways, multi-protein complexes, subcellular localization, or pre-established co-expression data coming from other experiments. The significance of the cluster-wide enrichment of the biological properties is assessed by methods of inferential statistics, e.g. by Fisher's exact test. We will demonstrate in a number of example applications how this approach can be used to gain biological insight into co-expression patterns.",

We present several uses of pathway information: When laying out biological networks, they enable hierarchical decomposition of these networks and allow the user to navigate the network and understand its overall structure. They also can be employed to simplify the presentation of complex parts of the network by highlighting key players. When examining expression data, pathway knowledge can be seen as a functional classification for statistical identification of biological processes. Networks also enable us to search key regulators or targets for a group of coregulated or overexpressed genes.

Information in the database is collected using open standards like Gene Ontology with extensive cross-links to public resources to enhance interoperability. All data are available under a common, unified interface that allows convenient querying and browsing.

The complexity created by the cross-talk between pathways makes it virtually impossible to infer by hand all the consequences that follow after one modifies one part of the network. To this end, computer-aided simulation will have to be used. It can only be successful on the basis of a comprehensive and detailed dataset. TRANSPATH is an information system on gene-regulatory pathways, and an extension module to the TRANSFAC database [Wingender et al. 2000]. It focuses on pathways involved in the regulation of transcription factors in different species, mainly human, mouse and rat. Elements of the relevant signal transduction pathways are stored together with information about their interaction and references in an object-oriented database. All information is validated with references to the original publications. Also, references to other databases are provided (TRANSFAC, Swissprot, EMBL, PubMed and others). The database is available over WWW (http://transpath.gbf.de). There are also clickable graphic maps of selected pathways. This site also provides an interface to the CSNDB database on signal transduction [Takai-Igarashi and Kaminuma, 1998]. Transpath provides a knowledge base which goes beyond the approach of traditional gene or sequence databases by focusing on the interactions between the stored data items. By building up the signaling network from single interactions instead of using predefined pathways, it becomes possible to explore the pathways in an unbiased way.",

Molecules and reactions are stored in an object-oriented database, together with information about their location, quality, family relationships and signaling motifs. Also stored are links to other databases and references to the original literature. Transpath differentiates between the states of a signal molecule and can describe the reaction mechanisms. It used to be available over the web through a Servlet-based interface. Nowadays it is distributed by Biobase Gmbh (www.biobase-international.com). Pathway query mechanisms and several kinds of display are provided for the database in addition to text-based queries and information on single entries.",
