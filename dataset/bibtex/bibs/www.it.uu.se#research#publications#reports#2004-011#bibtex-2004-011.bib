  abstract	= {The complexity of solving infinite games, including
		  parity, mean payoff, and simple stochastic games, is an
		  important open problem in verification, automata theory,
		  and complexity theory. In this paper we develop an abstract
		  setting for studying and solving such games, as well as
		  related problems, based on function optimization over
		  certain discrete structures. We introduce new classes of
		  completely local-global (CLG) and recursively local-global
		  (RLG) functions, and show that strategy evaluation
		  functions for parity and simple stochastic games belong to
		  these classes. We also establish a relation to the
		  previously well-studied completely unimodal (CU) and
		  local-global functions. A number of nice properties of
		  CLG-functions are proved.
		  
		  In this setting, we survey several randomized optimization
		  algorithms appropriate for CU-, CLG-, and RLG-functions. We
		  show that the subexponential algorithms for linear
		  programming by Kalai and Matousek, Sharir, and Welzl, can
		  be adapted to optimizing the functions we study, with
		  preserved subexponential expected running time. We examine
		  the relations to two other abstract frameworks for
		  subexponential optimization, the LP-type problems of
		  Matousek, Sharir, Welzl, and the abstract optimization
		  problems of G{\"a}rtner. The applicability of our abstract
		  optimization approach to parity games builds upon a
		  discrete strategy evaluation measure.
		  
		  We also consider local search type algorithms, and settle
		  two nontrivial, but still exponential, upper bounds. As
		  applications we address some complexity-theoretic issues
		  including non-PLS-completeness of the problems studied.}
