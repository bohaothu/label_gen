  abstract = {Mobile devices are able to spontaneously form highly dynamic ad
             hoc networks allowing for communication even when no
             infrastructure exists. Ideally, these networks enable the
             participating devices to share resources and services, thus
             overcoming the often severe limitations of the individual
             devices' capabilities. In order to make this possible, powerful
             semantic service trading is needed. In this paper, we propose a
             semantic overlay of hierarchical service rings to achieve this
             goal. In contrast to existing approaches this method is adapted
             to the specific characteristics of ad hoc networks.}
