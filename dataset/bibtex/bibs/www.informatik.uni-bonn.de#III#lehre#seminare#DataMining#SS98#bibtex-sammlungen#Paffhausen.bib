\emph{Original-Abstract: }
The field of knowledge discovery in databases, or Data
Mining, has received increasing attention during recent 
years as large organizations have begun to realize the 
potential value of the information that is stored 
implicitly in their databases. One specific data mining
task is the mining of Association Rules, particularly from
retail data. The task is to determine patterns (or rules) 
that characterize the shopping behavior of customers from
a large database of previous consumer transactions. The 
rules can then be used to focus marketing efforts such as
product placement and sales promotions.\par Because early 
algorithms required an unpredictably large number of IO
operations, reducing IO cost has been the primary target 
of the algorithms presented in the literature. One of the 
most recent proposed algorithms, called PARTITION, uses a
new TID-list data representation and a new partitioning 
technique. The partitioning technique reduces IO cost to a 
constant amount by processing one database portion at a 
time in memory. We implemented an algorithm called SPTID
that incorporates both TID-lists and partitioning to
study their benefits. For comparison, a non-partitioning 
algorithm called SEAR, which is based on a new prefix-tree
data structure, is used. Our experiments with SPTID and 
SEAR indicate that TID-lists have inherent inefficiencies; 
furthermore, because all of the algorithms tested tend to
be CPU-boundn trading CPU-overhead against I/O operations 
by partitioning did not lead to better performance.\par In
order to scale mining algorithms to the huge databases 
(e.g., multiple Terabytes) that large organizations will 
manage in the near future, we implemented parallel
versions of SEAR and SPEAR (its partitioned counterpart). 
The performance results show that, while both algorithms
parallelize easily and obtain good speedup and scale-up
results, the parallel SEAR version performs better than
parallel SPEAR, despite the fact that it uses more
communication.}

\emph{Original-Abstract: }
From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery
of knowledge, the present-day model of mining association
rules suffers from the following serious shortcomings:
(i) lack of user exploration and control, (ii) lack of 
focus, and (iii) rigid notion of relationships. In effect, 
this model functions as a black-box, admitting little user 
interaction in between. We propose, in this paper, an 
architecture that opens up the black-box, and supports
constraintbased, human-centered exploratory mining of
associations. The foundation of this architecture is a
rich set of constraint constructs, including domain, 
class, and SQL-style aggregate constraints, which enable 
users to clearly specify what associations are to be mined.
We propose \emph{constrained association queries} as a means
of specifying the constraints to be satisfied by the
antecedent and consequent of a mined association.\par In this
paper, we mainly focus on the technical challenges 
in guaranteeing a level of performance that is commensurate
with the selectivities of the constraints in an association
query. To this end, we introduce and analyze two properties
of constraints that are critical to pruning: 
\emph{antimonotonicity} and \emph{succinctness}. We then 
develop characterizations of various constraints into four
categories, according to these properties. Finally, we
describe a mining algorithm called CAP, which achieves a
maximized degree of pruning for all categories of
constraints. Experimental results indicate that CAP can
run much faster, in some cases as much as 80~times, than
several basic algorithms. This demonstrates how important
the succinctness and anti-monotonicity properties are, in
delivering the performance guarantee.}

\emph{Original-Abstract: }
In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association
rules among items in a large database of sales transactions.
The mining of association rules can be mapped into the
problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset
is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of
transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can
be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first
and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those 
itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally
this is done iteratively for each large $k$-itemset in
increasing order of $k$ where a large $k$-itemset is a
large itemset with $k$~items. To determine large itemsets
from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early
iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall
data mining performance. To adress this issue, we propose
an effective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set
generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets
generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of
magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus 
resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the 
generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to 
effectively trim the transaction database size at a much 
earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the
computational cost for later iterations significantly.
Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate 
performance of the proposed algorithm.}

In this paper, we develop an algorithm, called PDM, to

Consider a transaction as a collection of items, and a 
large itemset is a set of items such that the number of
transactions containing it exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
PDM is so designed that the global set of large itemsets
can be identified efficiently and the amount of inter-node
data exchange required is minimized. Specifically, with a
given database partition, each processing node will collect
(count) information on each itemset from its local database
efficiently via a hashing method. The information 
discovered by each node is next shared with other nodes
via some communication schemes. Then, PDM employs a
technique, called \emph{clue-and-poll}, to adress the
uncertainty due to the partial knowledge collected at each
node by judiciously selecting a small fraction of the
itemsets for the exchange of count information among nodes,
thus reducing the communication cost. The global set of
large itemsets can hence be determined based on the 
aggregate count of itemsets. It is experimentally shown
that PDM not only attains very good parallelization
efficiencies, but also provides robust performance for
various input patterns.}

Discovery of association rules is an important database

obviously the role of I/O overhead is very significant for
very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce
the database activity considerably. The idea is to pick a
random sample, to find using this sample all association
rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then
to verify the results with the rest of the database. The
algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not
approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, 
probabilistic, and in those rare cases where our sampling
method does not produce all association rules, the missing
rules can be found in a second pass. Our experiments show
that the proposed algorithms can find association rules
very efficiently in only one database pass.}

Data mining is an emerging research area, whose goal is to
extract significant patterns or interesting rules from
large databases. High-level inference from large volumes
of routine business data can provide valuable information
to businesses, such as customer buying patterns, shelving
criterion in supermarkets and stock trends. However, many
algorithms proposed for data mining of association rules
make repeated passes over the database to determine the 
commonly occurring \emph{itemsets} (or set of items). For 
large databases, the I/O overhead in scanning the database 
can be extremely high.\par In this paper we show that random
sampling of transactions in the database is an effective
method for finding association rules. Sampling can speed
up the mining process by more than an order of magnitude
by reducing I/O costs and drastically shrinking the number 
of transaction to be considered. We may also be able to
make the sampled database resident in main-memory. 
Furthermore, we show that sampling can accurately 
represent the data patterns in the database with high
confidence. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness 
of sampling on three databases.}

of each pass to construct the global patterns, thus
incurring high synchronization cost.\par
In this paper we describe a new parallel association mining
algorithm. Our algorithm is a result of detailed study of
the available parallelism and the properties of
associations. The algorithm uses a scheme to cluster
related frequent itemsets together, and to partition them 
among the processors. At the same time it also uses a
different database layout which clusters related 
transactions together, and selectively replicates the
database so that the portion of the database needed for
the computation of associations is local to each processor. 
After the initial set-up phase, the algorithm eliminates 
the need for further communication or synchronization. The
algorithm further scans the local database partition only
three times, thus minimizing I/O overheads. Unlike previous
approaches, the algorithms uses simple intersection 
operations to compute frequent itemsets and doesn't have to
maintain or search complex hash structures.\par
Our experimental testbed is a 32-processor DEC Alpha
cluster inter-connected by the Memory Channel network. We
present results on the performance of our algorithm on
various databases, and compare it against a well known
parallel algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms it by an
more than an order of magnitude.}

\emph{Original-Abstract: }
Discovery of association rules is an important data mining
task. Several parallel and sequential algorithms have been 
proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Almost 
all of these algorithms make repeated passes over the
database to determine the set of frequent itemsets (a
subset of database items), thus incurring high I/O 
overhead. In the parallel case, most algorithms perform a
sum-reduction at the end of each pass to construct the
global counts, also incurring high synchronization cost.\par
In this paper we describe new parallel association mining 
algorithms. The algorithms use novel itemset clustering
techniques to approximate the set of potentially maximal
frequent itemsets. Once this set has been identified, the
algorithms make use of efficient traversal techniques to
generate the frequent itemsets contained in each cluster. 
We propose two clustering schemes based on equivalence 
classes and maximal hypergraph cliques, and study two
lattice traversal techniques based on bottom-up and hybrid
search. We use a vertical database layout to cluster 
related transactions together. The database is also
selectively replicated so that the portion of the database
needed for the computation of associations is local to each
processor. After the initial set-up phase, the algorithms 
do not need any further communication or synchronization. 
The algorithms minimize I/O overheads by scanning the local
database portion only twice. Once in the set-up phase, and
once when processing the itemset clusters. Unlike previous
parallel approaches, the algorithms use simple intersection 
operations to compute frequent itemsets and do not have to
maintain or search complex hash structures.\par Our 
experimental testbed is a 32-processor DEC Alpha cluster 
inter-connected by the Memory Channel network. We present
results on the performance of our algorithms on various
databases, and compare it against a well known parallel
algorithm. The best new algorithm outperforms it by an
order of magnitude.}
