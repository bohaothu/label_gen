  abstract =     "'Data' is defined as being digital matter having
                 utility. A 'data descriptive language' is a manner of
                 description of how such digital matter can be
                 transformed into a more useful form. Data descriptive
                 languages are characterized as being iconographic,
                 algorithmic, or a mixture of both. File structures are
                 held to be merely a special case of data. An
                 algorithmic data description is always possible, by
                 definition, since otherwise the digital matter under
                 consideration is not 'data'. In a trivial sense, such
                 languages as COBOL or FORTRAN are found to be
                 completely general data descriptive languages, although
                 they are otherwise quite unsuitable because they are so
                 poorly fitted to the descriptive task. A good data
                 descriptive language should be congenial to use,
                 general, transformable, and independent of supporting
                 hardware or software. The value of small one-man
                 projects for the creation of data languages is
                 suggested.",

                 information is any fact which does not physically exist
                 in the data base, but is nonetheless accessible through
                 combinations of algorithms and other data. Physically
                 recorded information is only one of a number of ways to
                 obtain information from a data-base system. Viewing an
                 information system as a collection of functions shows

                 a spectrum of ways function values can be realized,
                 with the middle range being various types of virtual
                 information. Several classes of virtual information are
                 identified, and their usefulness is examined to show
                 the appropriateness of the concept in a data-base
                 system. Finally, the model is evaluated in light of the

                 discipline within computer science. Curriculum 68 did
                 not include database management in its recommended
                 courses. With the advent of large direct access
                 secondary storage devices to hold large volumes of
                 information referred to as a database and with the need
                 to manage that storage efficiently and conveniently,
                 there has developed the computer science discipline of
                 database management. This paper describes a course in
                 database management, including a course catalog
                 overview, course outline, and bibliography. This paper
                 could serve as a guideline for future ACM Curriculum

                 collection of normalized relations (relations in first
                 normal form) and a collection of domains. A normalized
                 relation may be viewed as a table, wherein each row of
                 the table corresponds to a tuple of the relation, and
                 the entries in a given column belong to the set of
                 values constituting the domain underlying that column.
                 The domains of a data base have an abstract existence
                 apart from the data base relations. The data base also
                 includes various types of semantic integrity rules,
                 which specify additional properties of the data in the
                 data base. One such type of semantic integrity rule is
                 the domain definition. A domain definition includes the
                 precise description of the set of values (objects)
                 constituting the domain. In a normalized data base, all
                 domains are sets of atomic data values. A domain
                 definition also includes a specification of the
                 ordering on the values in a domain, for comparability
                 purposes. In addition, a domain definition contains a
                 specification of the action that is to occur if an
                 attempt is made to violate the restriction that every
                 entry in each column of a relation must be from the
                 underlying domain of that column. A nonprocedural
                 language permitting the high level expression of domain
                 definitions is defined. Language details and examples
                 are presented, and the syntax and informal semantics of
                 the domain definition language are given. This approach
                 to domain definition is analyzed in terms of its impact
                 on other aspects of data base semantic integrity. The
                 relationship with the data base system in general is
                 outlined. An analysis of intradomain and interdomain
                 comparability is included. An introduction to relevant
                 implementation issues is also presented. Emphasis is
                 placed on a general approach to implementation and
                 implementation techniques, rather than on a specific

                 programming language research as a device to encourage
                 and facilitate structured and modular programming [1].
                 It separates the abstraction of a data object from its
                 implementation. The user of an abstract data type only
                 concerns himself with the behavioral semantics of the
                 type: what meaningful operations can be applied to
                 objects of the type; the internal representation and
                 structure of the type is unknown to him. In this way,
                 irrelevant detail is suppressed and meaningfulness of
                 programs enhanced. What application does this concept
                 have to the area of data bases? There are some obvious
                 similarities between the principle of abstraction and
                 the concept of data independence of data bases [2].
                 Data independence means that application programs that
                 utilize a data base do not need to know either the
                 physical or the structural organization of the data
                 base, but can relate to it purely on a logical plane.
                 As with data abstractions, the goal is clarity and
                 modifiability of programs, resulting from concentration
                 on semantics rather than representation.",

                 provide conceptual and practical advantages in the

                 provided by procedures in the domain of computational
                 structures. This note explores some of the implications
                 of this metaphor, without attempting to make it
                 precise. I shall use the term capsule to refer to the
                 data analog of procedure. [Those who are familiar with
                 the SIMULA class, the CLU cluster, or the ALPHARD form,
                 may use any of these as an approximation to capsule; I
                 use a neutral term to avoid implying the details of any
                 particular language.] First, what are the advantages
                 provided by procedures (subroutines, functions,
                 macros)? I can think of at least eight (highly
                 interrelated) categories: 1) avoidance of repetition,
                 2) modular program structure, 3) a basis for structured
                 programming, 4) conceptual units for understanding and
                 reasoning about programs, 5) clearly defined interfaces
                 that may be precisely specified, 6) units of
                 maintenance and improvement, 7) a language extension
                 mechanism, and 8) units for separate compilation. Let
                 us consider each of these in turn.",

                 one to conceptualize data representations in which
                 storage addressing is made manifest. In addition, the
                 use of pointer variables allows one to refer to a
                 common data object by a multiplicity of names, a
                 phenomenon we call the alias variable problem, Alias
                 variables make the verification of program behavior
                 substantially more difficult, and frustrate the goals
                 of modular decomposition. In this paper, we consider
                 alternatives to the use of pointer variables in
                 programming. One of these alternatives is the inclusion
                 of a class of data abstractions based on recursively
                 defined data types. The representational power of the
                 proposed data types is characterized formally, and some
                 issues of implementation and efficiency of programs are
                 discussed.",

                 light of what is being learned about construction of
                 reliable software, pointers are desirable in high level
                 programming languages. One side [Hoa73, Hoa75]
                 maintains that 1) Pointers are like the goto in that
                 they are an invitation to create spaghetti in one's
                 program [Hoa75]. 2) In some languages, e.g., PL/1
                 [Wlk71], the use of pointers can lead to serious type
                 violations, for example, the compiler believes that a
                 given pointer will be pointing to an integer when in
                 fact, it will be pointing to a real. 3) The
                 indiscriminate use of pointers may confound the
                 attempts of hardware pipelining and use of cache memory
                 to speed up computations [Hoa73, Hoa75]. 4) A pointer
                 may be left dangling, that is, a pointer may point to a
                 variable or other datum which has been deallocated

                 types should be allowed and so forth. The current

                 with basic operations on that set leads us to conclude
                 that formal parameter types need not be so explicitly
                 stated. Given a formal parameter X with operations
                 {\SGMLsgr}1,...,{\SGMLsgr}n being performed on X within
                 a procedure, one should be able to supply, as actual

                 simplify the structure of procedural programs. The

                 notable early papers include those of Madnick (1) and
                 Meltzer \1. In these early papers, level structures
                 (for example, involving logical and physical levels)
                 were also relatively pragmatic creations. One new
                 aspect of the DIAM I architecture (3) was that it
                 defined a detailed, relatively formal basis for four
                 levels of abstraction and the mappings between these
                 levels. Each level had a small set of primitive
                 generalized building blocks, each with its own small
                 permanent set of parameters. By specifying values for

  abstract =     "What information about data base technology does a
                 manager need to make prudent decisions about using this
                 new technology? To provide this information the
                 National Bureau of Standards and the Association for
                 Computing Machinery established a workshop of
                 approximately 80 experts in five major subject areas.
                 The five subject areas were auditing, evolving
                 technology, government regulations, standards, and user
                 experience. Each area prepared a report contained in
                 these proceedings. The proceedings provide guidance of
                 steps managers should follow to prepare themselves and
                 their organization for the installation of data base
                 management concepts. The auditing working panel noted
                 the increased vulnerability of organizations who
                 integrate their formerly dispersed and redundant files
                 into a data base and suggest actions to address this
                 risk. The technology report noted several promising
                 parallel developments but concluded that the future
                 would see evolving, rather than revolutionary data base
                 progress. Government regulations, particularly the
                 drive for individual privacy rights, were seen to play
                 an important role in determining data base directions
                 and the panel's guidance on cost impact suggest that
                 organizations would experience reduced costs with data
                 base technology. Standards pervaded all issues and were
                 found necessary in several sub-areas of data base
                 technology but the panel saw no immediate likelihood of
                 national data base standards. The user experience
                 working panel noted that data base systems had impacted
                 their organizations to the extent of reconsidering
                 existing data flows, areas of responsibilities, and
                 procedures.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes an approach to solving a major
                 problem in the information processing sciences --- that
                 of searching very large (5-50 billion characters) data
                 bases of unstructured free-text for random queries
                 within a reasonable time and at an affordable price.
                 The need by information specialists and knowledge
                 workers for large, fast low-cost text and document
                 retrieval systems is growing rapidly. Conventional
                 approaches to the problem have usually depended upon
                 expensive, general purpose computers, upon special
                 pre-preprocessing of the textual data (e.g. file
                 inverting, indexing, abstracting, etc.), and upon
                 elaborate, costly software. The resulting retrieval
                 systems often cost hundreds of dollars per query and
                 the full scanning of an uninverted, unstructured
                 billion byte textual data base could take hours of
                 computer services. However, in spite of these
                 restrictions, such full text search systems have proved
                 useful and even indispensible for many applications.
                 Computer technology of the late 1960's and the 1970's,
                 in both hardware and software (e.g., minicomputers,
                 low-cost, high density disk storage, ``chip''
                 electronics, natural language query systems, etc.),
                 have made i t practical to build special purpose,
                 low-cost text retrieval systems. Such a system has been
                 built, tested, and is now in a production stage. The
                 system called the Associative File Processor (AFP),
                 utilizes a conventional minicomputer (DEC's PDP-11/45)
                 for control, off-the-shelf high density disks for
                 storage, a special purpose parallel search module as a
                 text term detector, and query and retrieval software.
                 The AFP is currently being field tested at two sites.
                 Full text, parallel searches on un-preprocessed textual
                 data bases are being performed at the effective
                 matching rates of 4 billion bytes per second (8K byte
                 key memory times 500 Kbyte/second data stream).
                 Estimated costs are 10 to 25 cents per query for a one
                 billion byte data base. The costs per query and the
                 time for searching increase in a linear fashion as data
                 base increases. A basic architecture for the AFP is
                 described and an implemented version is discussed. A
                 more powerful term detector module is also under
                 development. This system is designed around a finite
                 state automaton algorithm.",

                 This is primarily motivate by the pressing needs in the
                 are a of data base management. It has long been
                 recognized that the parallel processing capabilities of
                 an associative processor are fundamentally well suited
                 to this environment. However, the complexity and cost

  abstract =     "The motivation for seeking hardware solutions to
                 database management functions traditionally carried out
                 by software has been apparent to data-base designers
                 for sometime now. Firstly, database management software
                 has grown in complexity and size over the years. This
                 growth is prompted by the increase in user
                 requirements, by the formulation of sophisticated
                 models and by the change in data processing mode from
                 an off-line, batched, single user environment to an
                 on-line, concurrent and multi-user environment. Large
                 and complex software systems tend to be failure-prone.
                 Further-more, practical verification methods for
                 software systems are still not in sight. On the other
                 hand, methods for verifying hardware functionality,
                 design and production have long been available.
                 Advanced technology has also overcome some of the
                 problems of the logic complexity and capacity
                 requirements, making the construction of relatively
                 large and complex computers viable. By incorporating
                 basic database management functions into hardware, not
                 only can we provide more reliable basic functions, but
                 we can also improve the software reliability since the
                 software requirements will be less complex and the
                 system software will be smaller in size.",

  abstract =     "There has been much interest in the use of special
                 purpose processors as the data base management
                 component of data processing systems. The generic terms
                 ``backend'' and ``data management machine'' have been
                 applied to such devices. Examination of the literature
                 reveals a broad cross section of host to backend
                 functional distribution and interconnection
                 methodology. This discussion represents an attempt to
                 examine and classify several of these backend data base
                 management machine configurations in terms of their
                 operational parameters and application constraints. A
                 formal taxonomy of such systems remains yet to be
                 performed. At least three distinct classes of data
                 management machine (DMM) are evidenced in the
                 literature; they are the large host backend,
                 distributed network data node and smart peripheral. The
                 intended classes of problem that the various authors
                 envision amenable to solution by the DMM approach
                 exhibit overlap while the performance envelope in which
                 each DMM architecture would provide a technically
                 acceptable, economically sound solution to a given user
                 requirement set varies. Some of the papers used as
                 source for this work contained no explicit mention of
                 either the problem classes or performance constraints
                 that the described configuration was to address; thus
                 liberty has been taken in interpreting the implicit
                 application goals of these authors.",

  abstract =     "Memory management, database management, and message
                 processing have in the past been defined in a
                 relatively narrow way. With memory management the
                 problem was to obtain cost effective use of real
                 memory. Given a multiprogrammed environment, virtual
                 memory systems allowed more effective use of expensive
                 real memory. Memory management has become even more
                 important with the development of very large and
                 complex memory hierarchies. Database management systems
                 were developed to allow the more effective use,
                 sharing, and control of data resources - objectives
                 which operating systems had previously provided for
                 hardware resources. The driving force behind message
                 processing has been the increased use of data
                 communications and computer networks. This paper will
                 consider the basis of the overlap in these areas, their
                 common data management functions. Data management, as
                 defined in this paper, includes the locating, routing,
                 moving, and translating of data resources and the
                 locating, reserving, and releasing of physical
                 resources, i.e., primary and secondary storage. The
                 analysis performed in this paper is essential because
                 of trends in computer architecture discussed below.
                 Early hardware was designed for general purpose
                 environments with software used to tailor it to
                 specific applications. However, according to Gagliardi9
                 future systems will consist of a set of subsystems,
                 including a storage subsystem at the core surrounded by
                 computational, spooling, and communications subsystems.
                 The computational subsystem is the traditional ``number
                 cruncher'' part of the system. The spooling subsystem
                 provides the I/O interface between the system and the
                 outside world. The communications subsystem links the
                 various subsystems together and provides an interface
                 to the rest of the network if the system is part of a
                 larger distributed system. The storage subsystem
                 consists of all the system's storage resources and
                 their control processes. It controls all levels of the
                 system memory and storage hierarchy. The storage
                 subsystem controls the allocation of the physical
                 storage resources and the movement of the data
                 resources through the system. Depending on how these
                 resources are used, they may be non-conserved or
                 conserved, and if conserved, either serially reusable
                 or sharable. Physical and data resources may be
                 located, and if necessary reserved, independently or
                 jointly.",

                 systems should provide more complete functionality,
                 simplicity of use, and reliability by increasing the
                 amount of hardware present in the system. These goals
                 are accomplished with a simple hardware arrangement
                 within a one-dimensional cellular storage system called
                 INDY. The INDY backend kernel is intended as a powerful
                 tool for implementing all data models. The INDY
                 cellular storage array is intended to provide
                 functionality that is difficult to implement
                 efficiently using a conventional hardware arrangement.
                 It allows a simple implementation of improved data
                 independence at high speeds. INDY simultaneously
                 satisfies the time windows of future hardware
                 technologies and user requirements. The importance of
                 strings as a mechanism for defining abstract data types
                 for data base languages is discussed in more detail in
                 another paper. In that paper, a language called STRING
                 is introduced which allows names of data objects to be
                 semantically defined as variable-length strings and
                 compared based on string pattern membership. This paper
                 is concerned with the implementation of string storage
                 and searching required by the STRING language.

                 the future is their generality. In addition to being
                 capable of carrying out the common database management
                 functions with high reliability and performance, some
                 of these machines are intended to support more than one
                 data model. A specific database machine, known as the
                 DBC, is intended to support several existing data
                 models. Although the DBC supports many data models, we
                 single out the relational data model for this
                 discussion. In particular, we have tried to concentrate
                 mainly on the subject of database representation and
                 query translation of System R-like database management
                 systems. Some estimates of the storage requirements and
                 performance gains are given in this paper. However, due

                 this high level of concurrency is proposed and modelled

                 intended to answer the needs of a rapidly growing user
                 community - the end-user. The underlying computational
                 model is the paper office. BUSINESS instructions
                 manipulate objects within this model in ways analogous
                 to human office workers. The syntax of BUSINESS closely
                 approximates a subset of English. Standard programming
                 functions are embodied in the language in ways that
                 seem natural to first time computer users. For example,
                 to open a file for exclusive read/write access one
                 'Pulls' a 'Folder' (containing 'Forms' and 'Documents')
                 from a 'Drawer' in a 'File Cabinet'. In the
                 computational model, the Folder is seen to actually
                 move from the Drawer to a 'Desk' belonging to an
                 'Aide'(the 'worker' inside the computer).To support the
                 construction of reliable software within this model,
                 BUSINESS contains a rich repertoire of structured
                 control constructs: execute (procedures), do
                 (routines), go through (a set of objects), test and
                 select one (from a set of 'if - then' instructions).
                 Base data types include: whole numbers, decimal
                 numbers, money, dates, times and characters. The set of
                 operators and tests within BUSINESS support a complete
                 range of data manipulations and logical decisions. Data
                 structures include Fillins (collections of Fields) and
                 Tables (having Entries at Row/Column intersections).
                 Permanent data is organized by Form (collections of
                 Fillins and Tables).",

                 been dealt with in sufficient detail in the paper but
                 only in the oral presentation. Thus, the reader of the
                 conference proceedings might get the impression that
                 optimistic CC, as introduced in [KUR79], is very easily
                 adapted to distributed systems. Unfortunately, when
                 looking into the problem more thoroughly, the contrary
                 turns out to be true. This note is meant to highlight
                 the main problems of optimistic CC in distributed
                 database systems. We cannot discuss possible solutions
                 in detail - this will be done elsewhere.",

                 (DBMS) must include a specification of the functions
                 associated with administering the system, so that
                 subsequent activities, such as documentation, training,
                 and staffing, can occur. Therefore, this paper
                 undertakes a careful definition of administrative tasks
                 for a Data Base Management System (DBMS) in a
                 distributed computer environment. The paper first
                 discusses a general framework for administering a
                 distributed DBMS, and then the paper presents a
                 specific listing of administrative functions. While the

                 paper considers the changes necessary to permit a

                 amounts of main memory. Authors evaluate AVL vs. B plus

                 hash-based query processing strategies vs. sort-merge,
                 and study recovery issues when most or all of the
                 database fits in main memory. As expected, B plus
                 -trees are the preferred storage mechanism unless more
                 than 80-90\% of the database fits in main memory. A
                 somewhat surprising result is that hash based query

                 algorithm is general; in particular, it handles
                 referential dependency and temporal assertions.
                 Specialized strategies efficiently treat each class of
                 assertions. The system automatically manages integrity
                 checkpoints. Also, an efficient method is described for
                 processing assertions involving aggregates. An analysis
                 exhibits the value of the algorithms. It is shown that,
                 in general, this method is better than the query
                 modification method for domain assertions. Measures

                 required in computer aided design and geo-data
                 applications, a database system needs an index
                 mechanism that will help it retrieve data items quickly

                 this need, and gives algorithms for searching and
                 updating it. The author presents the results of a

                 views indicates when the domain element can be uniquely
                 determined by the range values of the two complementary
                 views. They consider the relationship between
                 independent and complementary views. In unrestricted
                 domains, a view (but not the identity or empty view)
                 can have more than one complementary, independent view.
                 Databases, however, are more restricted domains: They
                 are finite power sets. A view is monotonic if it
                 preserves inclusion. However, in finite power sets when
                 all views are monotonic, if a given view has another
                 view which is independent and complementary, then this

                 projections of the representative instance to generate
                 the answer for a query. Associated with this approach
                 is the problem of how to generate the total projections
                 of the representative instance efficiently. A
                 generalization is proposed of extension joins, called
                 chase join expressions, as a means to compute the total
                 projections when functional dependencies are given as
                 constraints. In particular, an important subclass of
                 chase join expressions called simple chase join
                 expressions is identified and it is shown that the
                 total projections with respect to a set of functional
                 dependencies can be computed by unions of simple chase
                 join expressions when an independent scheme is assumed.
                 Also a simple and efficient algorithm is found that
                 minimizes the number of join operations in a union of
                 simple chase join expressions.",

                 commitment, concurrency control, and crash recovery.
                 Specifically, a simple two-phase non-blocking commit
                 protocol is given; whereas three phases are required in
                 a point-to-point network. A simplified read-one\slash
                 write-all update algorithm is also given for replicated
                 data and an easily implemented log-based recovery
                 algorithm providing uninterrupted transaction
                 processing. The benefits of performing the atomic
                 broadcast and failure detection at the network level
                 are also discussed. Performing these functions at the
                 network level not only simplifies database protocols
                 but also better utilizes the broadcast network: fewer
                 messages are transmitted. Comparisons between LAMBDA
                 and existing distributed database systems are also
                 made.",

                 They then show how features of Smalltalk, such as
                 operational semantics, its type hierarchy, entity
                 identity and the merging of programming and data
                 language, solve many of those problems. Next they
                 consider what Smalltalk lacks as a database system:
                 secondary storage management, a declarative semantics,
                 concurrency, past states. To address these shortcomings
                 they needed a formal data model. They introduce the
                 GemStone data model, and show how it helps to define
                 path expressions, a declarative semantics and object
                 history in the OPAL language. They summarize similar
                 approaches, and give a brief overview of the GemStone
                 system implementation.",

                 removes the ad hoc mechanisms used for higher order

  abstract =     "Since it has been first introduced, the concept of
                 transaction has become one of the fundamental
                 abstractions used in the design and analysis of
                 information systems that provide concurrent access to
                 share information. The basic idea of transactions is to
                 divide application programs into well defined units
                 that provide semantically correct transitions between
                 consistent states of the information system. In this
                 paper we outline an extended transaction model, which
                 we believe, is much more suitable for computing
                 environments consisting of autonomous systems. The
                 proposed model allows us to utilize knowledge of the
                 semantics of the application that is to be modeled by a
                 transaction. The model allows composition of flexible
                 transactions consisting of mutually dependent
                 substransactions. The execution of these
                 subtransactions may depend on the success of previous
                 subtransactions, and alternative sources of information
                 may be specified. This approach requires redefinition
                 of the notion of successful execution transactions,
                 their scheduling and commitment.",

                 exploit the added semantics of image attributes.

                 better facilitates the rigorous study of graphical
                 database end-user interfaces. In an earlier publication

                 object-oriented and deductive database models.
                 Specifically, they demonstrate how the GOOD model is

                 data model supports data encapsulation, type
                 inheritance, and complex objects. OdeView provides
                 facilities for examining the database schema (i.e. the
                 object type or class hierarchy), examining class
                 definitions, browsing objects, following chains of
                 references starting from an object, synchronized
                 browsing, displaying selected portions of objects
                 (projection), and retrieving objects with specific
                 characteristics (selection). OdeView does not need to
                 know about the internals of Ode objects. Consequently,
                 the internals of specific classes are not hardwired
                 into OdeView and new classes can be added to the Ode
                 database without requiring any changes to or
                 recompilation of OdeView. Just as OdeView does not know
                 about the object internals, class functions (methods)
                 for displaying objects are written without knowing
                 about the specifics of the windowing software used by
                 OdeView or the graphical user interface provided by it.

                 languages, such as DATALOG and stratified DATALOG, is
                 limited in a sense that some useful queries such as
                 functions involving aggregation are not definable in
                 these languages. Our concern in this paper is to
                 provide a uniform logic framework for deductive
                 databases with greater expressive power. We propose a
                 logic for deductive databases which employs the notion
                 of `identifying each tuple in a relation'. Through the
                 use of these tuple-identifications, different linear
                 orderings are defined as a result. This intuitively
                 explains the reason why our logic has greater
                 expressive power. The proposed logic language is
                 non-deterministic in nature. However, non-determinism
                 is not the real reason for the enhanced expressive
                 power. A deterministic subset of the programs in this
                 language is computational complete in the sense that it
                 defines all the computable deterministic queries.
                 Although the problem of deciding whether a program is
                 in this subset is in general undecidable, we do provide
                 a rather general sufficient test for identifying such
                 programs. Also discussed in this paper is an extended
                 notion of queries which allows both the input and the
                 output of a query to contain interpreted constants of
                 an infinite domain. We show that extended queries
                 involving aggregation can also be defined in the
                 language.",

                 have developed for database systems research and
                 education. The uniform interface between operators
                 makes Volcano extensible by new operators. All
                 operators are designed and coded as if they were meant
                 for a single-process system only. When attempting to
                 parallelize Volcano, we had to choose between two
                 models of parallelization, called here the bracket and
                 operator models. We describe the reasons for not
                 choosing the bracket model, introduce the novel
                 operator model, and provide details of Volcano's
                 exchange operator that parallelizes all other
                 operators. It allows intra-operator parallelism on
                 partioned datasets and both vertical and horizontal
                 inter-operator parallelism. The exchange operator
                 encapsulates all parallelism issues and therefore makes
                 implementation of parallel database algorithms
                 significantly easier and more robust. Included in this
                 encapsulation is the translation between demand-driven
                 dataflow within processes and data-driven dataflow
                 between processes. Since the interface between Volcano
                 operators is similar to the one used in `real,'
                 commercial systems, the techniques described here can
                 be used to parallelize other query processing

                 extensively studied in the database and transaction
                 processing literature, but little has been said about
                 the handling of the requests for transaction execution.
                 In commercial TP systems, especially distributed ones,
                 managing the flow of requests is often as important as
                 executing the transactions themselves. This paper
                 studies fault-tolerant protocols for managing the flow
                 of transaction requests between clients that issue
                 requests and servers that process them. We discuss how
                 to implement these protocols using transactions and
                 recoverable queuing systems. Queuing systems are used
                 to move requests reliably between clients and servers.
                 The protocols use queuing systems to ensure that the
                 server processes each request exactly once and that a
                 client processes each reply at least once. We treat
                 request-reply protocols for single-transaction
                 requests, for multi-transaction requests, and for
                 requests that require interaction with the display

                 a paradigm, called data-reduction, for the parallel
                 evaluation of a general datalog program. Several
                 parallelization strategies discussed previously in are
                 special cases of this paradigm. The paradigm
                 parallelizes the evaluation by partitioning among the
                 processors the instantiations of the rules. After
                 presenting the paradigm, we discuss the following
                 issues, that we see fundamental for parallelization
                 strategies derived from the paradigm: properties of the
                 strategies that enable a reduction in the communication
                 overhead, decomposability, load balancing, and

  abstract =     "For next generation information systems, concurrency
                 control mechanisms are required to handle high level
                 abstract operations and to meet high throughput
                 demands. The currently available single level
                 concurrency control mechanisms for reads and writes are
                 inadequate for future complex information systems. In
                 this paper, we will present a new multilevel
                 concurrency protocol that uses a semantics-based notion
                 of conflict, which is weaker than commutativity, called
                 recoverability. Further, operations are scheduled
                 according to relative conflict, a conflict notion based
                 on the structure of operations. Performance evaluation
                 via extensive simulation studies show that with our
                 multilevel concurrency control protocol, the
                 performance improvement is significant when compared to
                 that of a single level two-phase locking based
                 concurrency control scheme or to that of a multilevel
                 concurrency control scheme based on commutativity
                 alone. Further, simulation studies show that our new
                 multilevel concurrency control protocol performs better

                 the evaluation of data queries. In this paper we argue
                 that when this knowledge is of substantial volume and
                 complexity, there is genuine need to query this
                 repository of information. Moreover, since users of the
                 database may not be able to distinguish between
                 information that is data and information that is
                 knowledge, access to knowledge and data should be
                 provided with a single, coherent instrument. We provide
                 an informal review of various kinds of knowledge
                 queries, with possible syntax and semantics. We then
                 formalize a framework of knowledge-rich databases, and
                 a simple query language consisting of a pair of
                 retrieve and describe statements. The retrieve
                 statement is for querying the data (it corresponds to
                 the basic retrieval statement of various knowledge-rich
                 database systems). The describe statement is for
                 querying the knowledge. Essentially, it inquires about
                 the meaning of a concept under specified circumstances.
                 We provide algorithms for evaluating sound and finite

                 logic programming', which includes some abstractions of
                 the object-oriented paradigm, is presented. An ordered
                 program consists of a number of modules (objects),
                 where each module is composed by a number of rules
                 possibly with negated head predicates. A sort of `isa'
                 hierarchy can be defined among the modules in order to
                 allow for rule inheritance. Therefore, every module
                 sees its own rules as local rules and the rules of the
                 other modules to which it is connected by the `isa'
                 hierarchy as global rules. In this way, as local rules
                 may hide global rules, it is possible to deal with
                 default properties and exceptions. This new approach
                 represents a novel attempt to combine the logic
                 paradigm with the object-oriented one in knowledge base
                 systems. Moreover, this approach provides a new ground
                 for explaining some recent proposals of semantics for
                 classical logic programs with negation in the rule
                 bodies and gives an interesting semantics to logic

                 explore the use of triggers and transactions to specify

                 rule engines use a simple combination of hashing and
                 sequential search for this matching. We introduce an
                 algorithm for finding the matching predicates that is
                 more efficient than the standard algorithm when the
                 number of predicates is large. We focus on equality and

                 algorithm is well-suited for database systems, where
                 predicate-testing speed is critical. A key component of
                 the algorithm is the interval binary search tree

                 retrieval of all intervals (e.g. range predicates) that
                 overlap a point, while allowing dynamic insertion and

                 special semantics for resolving ambiguous view updates
                 are simply additional rules. Moreover, procedural data
                 types as proposed in POSTGRES are also efficiently
                 simulated by the same rules system. Lastly, caching of
                 the action part of certain rules is a possible
                 performance enhancement and can be applied to
                 materialize views as well as to cache procedural data

                 graph, and investigate the existence of transformations

                 out to compare the performance of the pointer-based
                 algorithms to their standard, non-pointer-based
                 counterparts. The results of the analysis show that the
                 pointer-based algorithms can provide significant
                 performance gains in many situations. The results also
                 show that the pointer-based nested-loops join
                 algorithm, which is perhaps the most natural
                 pointer-based join algorithm to consider using in an

                 a combinatorial optimization problem, which makes
                 exhaustive search unacceptable as the query size grows.
                 Randomized algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing (SA)
                 and Iterative Improvement (II), are viable alternatives
                 to exhaustive search. We have adapted these algorithms
                 to the optimization of project-select-join queries. We
                 have tested them on large queries of various types with
                 different databases, concluding that in most cases SA
                 identifies a lower cost access plan than II. To explain
                 this result, we have studied the shape of the cost
                 function over the solution space associated with such
                 queries and we have conjectured that it resembles a
                 `cup' with relatively small variations at the bottom.
                 This has inspired a new Two Phase Optimization
                 algorithm, which is a combination of Simulated
                 Annealing and Iterative Improvement. Experimental
                 results show that Two Phase Optimization outperforms

                 rectangles, is based on the heuristic optimization of
                 the area of the enclosing rectangle in each inner node.
                 By running numerous experiments in a standardized
                 testbed under highly varying data, queries and
                 operations, we were able to design the R-tree which
                 incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin
                 and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the
                 directory. Using our standardized testbed in an
                 exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that
                 the R-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree
                 variants: Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and
                 Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the
                 R-tree holds for different types of queries and
                 operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles
                 and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a
                 practical point of view the R-tree is very attractive
                 because of the following two reasons: 1. it efficiently
                 supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2.
                 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than

                 transformed into search regions. The requirement for
                 different data and query representations may prevent
                 the use of parameter-space searching in some
                 applications. Native-space and parameter-space
                 searching are compared in the context of a z

                 is used for the query representation. The result is,

                 When there are multiple query objects, native-space
                 searching is better initially, but as the number of

                 as a means for optimizing query processing in
                 object-oriented database systems. The general idea is
                 to maintain redundant separate structures
                 (disassociated from the object representation) to store
                 object references that are frequently traversed in
                 database queries. The proposed access support relation
                 technique is no longer restricted to relate an object
                 (tuple) to an atomic value (attribute value) as in
                 conventional indexing. Rather, access support relations
                 relate objects with each other and can span over
                 reference chains which may contain collection-valued
                 components in order to support queries involving path

                 hashing methods considered are Linear Hash files and

                 Iris is intended to meet the needs of new and emerging
                 database applications such as office and engineering
                 information systems, knowledged-based systems,
                 manufacturing applications, and hardware and software
                 design. The Iris data model is an object and function
                 model. It provides three basic constructs: objects,
                 types and functions. As with other object systems, Iris
                 objects have a unique identifier and can only be
                 accessed and manipulated through functions. Objects are
                 classified by type.",

                 over 100,000 lines of C source code, and executes an
                 extended form of the SQL Data Definition Language and

                 forward chaining triggers (7) dynamic inclusion of new
                 rules (8) use of the portals interface to couple to a
                 host programming language (9) addition of a new access
                 method to a running system. The videotape will be
                 constructed by recording a DECstation 3100 running

                 TPC council intended for comparing database platforms
                 running a medium complexity transaction processing
                 workload. Some key aspects in which this new benchmark
                 differs from the TPC-A benchmark are in having several
                 transaction types, some of which are more complex than
                 that in TPC-A, and in having data access skew. In this
                 paper we present results from a modeling study of the
                 TPC-C benchmark for both single node and distributed
                 database management systems. We simulate the TPC-C
                 workload to determine expected buffer miss rates
                 assuming an LRU buffer management policy. These miss
                 rates are then used as inputs to a throughput model.
                 From these models we show the following: (i) We
                 quantify the data access skew as specified in the
                 benchmark and show that fraction of the accesses go to
                 what fraction of the data. (ii) We quantify the
                 resulting buffer hit ratios for each relation as a
                 function to buffer size. (iii) We show that close to
                 linear scale-up (about 3\% from the ideal) can be
                 achieved in a distributed system, assuming replication
                 of a read-only table. (iv) We examine the effect of
                 packing hot tuples into pages and show that significant
                 price\slash performance benefit can be thus achieved.
                 (v) Finally, by coupling the buffer simulations with
                 the throughput model, we examine typical disk\slash
                 memory configurations the maximize the overall
                 price\slash performance.",

  abstract =     "Integrated rule and database systems are quickly
                 moving from the research laboratory into commercial
                 systems. However, the current generation of prototypes
                 are designed to work with small rule sets involving
                 limited inferencing. The problem of supporting large
                 complex rule programs within database management
                 systems still presents significant challenges. The
                 basis for many of these challenges is providing support
                 for rule activation. Rule activation is defined as the
                 process of determining which rules are satisfied and
                 what data satisfies them. In this paper we present
                 performance results for the DATEX database rule system
                 and its novel indexing technique for supporting rule
                 activation. Our approach assumes that both the rule
                 program and the database must be optimized
                 synergistically. However, as an experimental result we
                 have determined that DATEX requires very few changes to
                 a standard DBMS environment, and we argue that these
                 changes are reasonable for the problems being solved.
                 Based on the performance of DATEX we believe we have
                 demonstrated a satisfactory solution to the rule
                 activation problem for complex rule programs operating
                 within a database system.",

  abstract =     "We present an optimization for integrity constraint
                 verification in distributed databases. The optimization
                 allows a global constraint, i.e. a constraint spanning
                 multiple databases, to be verified by accessing data at
                 a single database, eliminating the cost of accessing
                 remote data. The optimization is based on an algorithm
                 that takes as input a global constraint and data to be
                 inserted into a local database. The algorithm produces
                 a local condition such that if the local data satisfies
                 this condition then, based on the previous satisfaction
                 of the global constraint, the global constraint is
                 still satisfied. If the local data does not satisfy the
                 condition, then a conventional global verification
                 procedure is required.",

  abstract =     "With the advent of real-time and goal-oriented
                 database systems, priority scheduling is likely to be
                 an important feature in future database management
                 systems. A consequence of priority scheduling is that a
                 transaction may lose its buffers to higher-priority
                 transactions, and may be given additional memory when
                 transactions leave the system. Due to their heavy
                 reliance on main memory, hash joins are especially
                 vulnerable to fluctuations in memory availability.
                 Previous studies have proposed modifications to the
                 hash join algorithm to cope with these fluctuations,
                 but the proposed algorithms have not been extensively
                 evaluated or compared with each other. This paper
                 contains a performance study of these algorithms. In
                 addition, we introduce a family of memory-adaptive hash
                 join algorithms that turns out to offer even better
                 solutions to the memory fluctuation problem that hash
                 joins experience.",

                 optimal processor allocation for pipelined hash joins
                 in a multiprocessor-based database system. A pipeline
                 of hash joins is composed of several stages, each of
                 which is associated with one join operation. The whole
                 pipeline is executed in two phases: (1) the
                 table-building phase, and (2) the tuple-probing phase.
                 We focus on the problem of allocating processors to the
                 stages of a pipeline to minimize the query execution
                 time. We formulate the processor allocation problem as
                 a two-phase mini-max optimization problem, and develop
                 three optimal allocation schemes under three different
                 constraints. The effectiveness of our problem
                 formulation and solution is verified through a detailed
                 tuple-by-tuple simulation of pipelined hash joins. Our
                 solution scheme is general and applicable to any

                 two-phase mini-max problem.",

                 the size of the resulting relation after an equi-join
                 and selection using a regression model. An
                 approximating series representing the underlying data
                 distribution and dependency is derived from the actual
                 data. The proposed method provides an instant and
                 accurate size estimation by performing an evaluation of
                 the series, with no run-time overheads in page faults
                 and space, and with negligible CPU overhead. In
                 contrast, the popular sampling methods incur run-time
                 overheads in page faults (for sampling), CPU time and
                 space. These overheads of sampling methods increase the
                 response time of processing a query. The results of a
                 comprehensive experimental study are also reported,
                 which demonstrate that the estimation accuracy by the
                 proposed method is comparable with that of the sampling
                 methods which are believed to provide the most accurate
                 estimation. The proposed method seems ideal for
                 retrieval-intensive database and information systems.
                 Since the overheads involved in deriving the
                 approximating series are fairly moderate, we believe
                 that this method is also an extremely competent method

  abstract =     "This paper proposes a new approach for supporting
                 reactive capability in an object-oriented database. We
                 introduce an event interface, which extends the
                 conventional object semantics to include the role of an
                 event generator. This interface provides a basis for
                 the specification of events spanning sets of objects,
                 possibly from different classes, and detection of
                 primitive and complex events. This approach clearly
                 separates event detection from rules. New rules can be
                 added and use existing objects, enabling objects to
                 react to their own changes as well as to the changes of
                 other objects. We use a runtime subscription mechanism,
                 between rules and objects to selectively monitor
                 particular objects dynamically. This elegantly supports
                 class level as well as instance level rules. Both
                 events and rules are treated as first class objects.",

                 incremental and full archiving of data bases (e.g.,
                 individual files). Customers archive their data bases
                 quite frequently to minimize the duration of data
                 outage. Because of the growing sizes of data bases and
                 the ever increasing need for high availability of data,
                 the efficiency of the archive copy utility is very
                 important. The method presented here minimizes
                 interferences with concurrent transactions by not
                 acquiring any locks on the data being copied. It
                 significantly reduces disk I/Os by not keeping on data
                 pages any extra tracking information in connection with
                 archiving. These features make the archive copy
                 operation be more efficient in terms of resource
                 consumption compared to other methods. The method is
                 also flexible in that it optionally supports direct
                 copying of data from disks, bypassing the DBMS's buffer
                 pool. This reduces buffer pool pollution and processing
                 overheads, and allows the utility to take advantage of
                 device geometries for efficiently retrieving data. We
                 also describe extensions to the method to accommodate
                 the multisystem shared disks transaction environment.

                 The view definitions can be in SQL or Datalog, and may
                 use UNION, negation, aggregation (e.g. SUM, MIN),
                 linear recursion, and general recursion. We first
                 present a counting algorithm that tracks the number of
                 alternative derivations (counts) for each derived tuple
                 in a view. The algorithm works with both set and
                 duplicate semantics. We present the algorithm for
                 nonrecursive views (with negation and aggregation), and
                 show that the count for a tuple can be computed at
                 little or no cost above the cost of deriving the tuple.
                 The algorithm is optimal in that it computes exactly
                 those view tuples that are inserted or deleted. Note
                 that we store only the number of derivations, not the
                 derivations themselves. We then present the Delete and
                 Rederive algorithm, DRed, for incremental maintenance
                 of recursive views (negation and aggregation are
                 permitted). The algorithm works by first deleting a
                 superset of the tuples that need to be deleted, and
                 then rederiving some of them. The algorithm can also be

  abstract =     "CORAL is a deductive database system that supports a
                 rich declarative language, provides a wide range of
                 evaluation methods, and allows a combination of
                 declarative and imperative programming. The data can be
                 persistent on disk or can reside in main-memory. We
                 describe the architecture and implementation of CORAL.
                 There were two important goals in the design of the
                 CORAL architecture: (1) to integrate the different
                 evaluation strategies in a reasonable fashion, and (2)
                 to allow users to influence the optimization techniques
                 used so as to exploit the full power of the CORAL
                 implementation. A CORAL declarative program can be
                 organized as a collection of interacting modules and
                 this modular structure is the key to satisfying both
                 these goals. The high level module interface allows
                 modules with different evaluation techniques to
                 interact in a transparent fashion. Further, users can
                 optionally tailor the execution of a program by
                 selecting from among a wide range of control choices at
                 the level of each module. CORAL also has an interface
                 with C${}_{++}$, and users can program in a combination
                 of declarative CORAL, and C${}_{++}$ extended with
                 CORAL primitives. A high degree of extensibility is
                 provided by allowing C${}_{++}$ programmers to use the
                 class structure of C${}_{++}$ to enhance the CORAL
                 implementation.",

                 using garbage collection, manipulated using atomic
                 transactions, and accessed using a uniform storage
                 model. These features enhance reliability and simplify
                 programming by preventing errors due to explicit
                 deallocation, by masking failures and concurrency using
                 transactions, and by eliminating the distinction
                 between accessing temporary storage and permanent
                 storage. Stable heap management is useful for
                 programming languages for reliable distributed
                 computing, programming languages with persistent
                 storage, and object-oriented database systems. Many
                 applications that could benefit from a stable heap
                 (e.g., computer-aided design, computer-aided software
                 engineering, and office information systems) require
                 large amounts of storage, timely responses for
                 transactions, and high availability. We present garbage
                 collection and recovery algorithms for a stable heap
                 implementation that meet these goals and are
                 appropriate for stock hardware. The collector is
                 incremental: it does not attempt to collect the whole
                 heap at once. The collector is also atomic: it is
                 coordinated with the recovery system to prevent
                 problems when it moves and modifies objects. The time
                 for recovery is independent of heap size, even if a
                 failure occurs during garbage collection.",

                 a log of database activity on disk. It does not require
                 periodic checkpoints and does not abort lengthy
                 transactions as frequently as traditional firewall
                 logging for the same amount of disk space. Therefore,
                 it is well suited for highly concurrent databases and
                 applications which have a wide distribution of
                 transaction lifetimes. This paper briefly explains EL
                 and then analyzes its performance. Simulation studies
                 indicate that it can offer significant savings in disk
                 space, at the expense of slightly higher bandwidth for
                 logging and more main memory. The reduced size of the
                 log implies much faster recovery after a crash as well
                 as cost savings. EL is the method of choice in some but
                 not all situations. We assess the limitations of our

                 embedded real-time systems. In a real-time database
                 context, transactions must not only maintain the
                 consistency constraints of the database but must also
                 satisfy the timing constraints specified for each
                 transaction. Although several approaches have been
                 proposed to integrate real-time scheduling and database
                 concurrency control methods, none of them take into
                 account the dynamic cost of scheduling a transaction.
                 In this paper, we propose a new cost conscious

  abstract =     "In a federated database environment, different
                 constituents of the federation may use different
                 temporal models or physical representations for
                 temporal information. This paper introduces a new
                 concept, called a temporal module, to resolve these
                 differences, or mismatches, among the constituents.
                 Intuitively, a temporal module hides the implementation
                 details of a temporal relation by exposing its
                 information only through two windowing functions: The
                 first function associates each time point with a set of
                 tuples and the second function links each tuple to a
                 set of time points. A calculus-style language is given
                 to form queries on temporal modules. Temporal modules
                 are then extended to resolve another type of mismatch
                 among the constituents of a federation, namely, the
                 mismatch involving different time units (e.g., month,
                 week and day) used to record temporal information. Our
                 solution relies on `information conversions' provided
                 by each constituent. Specifically, each temporal module
                 is extended to provide several `windows' to its
                 information, each in terms of a different time unit.
                 The first step to process a query addressed to the
                 federation is to select suitable windows to the
                 underlying temporal modules. In order to facilitate
                 such a process, time units are formally defined and
                 studied. A federated temporal database model and its
                 query language are proposed. The query language is an
                 extension of the above calculus-style language.",

  abstract =     "Spatial joins are one of the most important operations
                 for combining spatial objects of several relations. The
                 efficient processing of a spatial join is extremely
                 important since its execution time is superlinear in
                 the number of spatial objects of the participating
                 relations, and this number of objects may be very high.
                 In this paper, we present a first detailed study of
                 spatial join processing using R-trees, particularly
                 R-trees. R-trees are very suitable for supporting
                 spatial queries and the R-tree is one of the most
                 efficient members of the R-tree family. Starting from a
                 straightforward approach, we present several techniques
                 for improving its execution time with respect to both,
                 CPU-and I/O-time. Eventually, we end up with an
                 algorithm whose total execution time is improved over
                 the first approach by an order of magnitude. Using a
                 buffer of reasonable size, I/O-time is almost optimal,
                 i.e., it almost corresponds to the time for reading
                 each required page of the relations exactly once. The
                 performance of the various approaches is investigated
                 in an experimental performance comparison where several

                 efficient support for manipulation of complex objects.
                 In particular, support of queries involving evaluations
                 of set predicates is often required in handling complex
                 objects. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply
                 signature file techniques, which were originally
                 invented for text retrieval, to the support of set
                 value accesses, and quantitatively evaluate their
                 potential capabilities. Two signature file
                 organizations, the sequential signature file and the
                 bit-sliced signature file, are considered and their
                 performance is compared with that of the nested index

                 results clarifying their retrieval, storage, and update

  abstract =     "An important issue that affects response time
                 performance in current OODB and hypertext systems is
                 the I/O involved in moving objects from slow memory to
                 cache. A promising way to tackle this problem is to use
                 prefetching, in which we predict the user's next page
                 requests and get those pages into cache in the
                 background. Current databases perform limited
                 prefetching using techniques derived from older virtual
                 memory systems. A novel idea of using data compression
                 techniques for prefetching was recently advocated in
                 [KrV, ViK], in which prefetchers based on the
                 Lempel--Ziv data compressor (the UNIX compress command)
                 were shown theoretically to be optimal in the limit. In
                 this paper we analyze the practical aspects of using
                 data compression techniques for prefetching. We adapt
                 three well-known data compressors to get three simple,
                 deterministic, and universal prefetchers. We simulate
                 our prefetchers on sequences of page accesses derived
                 from the OO1 and OO7 benchmarks and from CAD
                 applications, and demonstrate significant reductions in
                 fault-rate. We examine the important issues of cache
                 replacement, size of the data structure used by the
                 prefetcher, and problems arising from bursts of `fast'
                 page requests (that leave virtually no time between
                 adjacent requests for prefetching and book keeping). We
                 conclude that prediction for prefetching based on data
                 compression techniques holds great promise.",

  abstract =     "The traditional focus of relational query optimization
                 schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join
                 orders. Restrictions have typically been handled in
                 query optimizers by `predicate pushdown' rules, which
                 apply restrictions in some random order before as many
                 joins as possible. These rules work under the
                 assumption that restriction is essentially a zero-time
                 operation. However, today's extensible and
                 object-oriented database systems allow users to define
                 time-consuming functions, which may be used in a
                 query's restriction and join predicates. Furthermore,
                 SQL has long supported subquery predicates, which may
                 be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. Thus
                 restrictions should not be considered zero-time
                 operations, and the model of query optimization must be
                 enhanced. In this paper we develop a theory for moving
                 expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total
                 cost of the plan --- including the costs of both joins
                 and restrictions --- is minimal. We present an
                 algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results
                 of our implementation in POSTGRES. Our experience with
                 the newly enhanced POSTGRES query optimizer
                 demonstrates that correctly optimizing queries with
                 expensive predicates often produces plans that are
                 orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a
                 traditional query optimizer. The additional complexity
                 of considering expensive predicates during optimization
                 is found to be manageably small.",

                 optimizer for TI's Open OODB system. To the best of our
                 knowledge, it is the first working object query
                 optimizer to be based on a complete extensible
                 optimization framework including logical algebra,
                 execution algorithms, property enforcers, logical
                 transformation rules, implementation rules, and
                 selectivity and cost estimation. Our algebra
                 incorporates a new materialize operator with its
                 corresponding logical transformation and implementation
                 rules that enable the optimization of path expressions.
                 Initial experiments on queries obtained from the object
                 query optimization literature demonstrate that our
                 optimizer is able to derive plants that are as
                 efficient as, and often substantially more efficient
                 than, the plans generated by other query optimization
                 strategies. These experiments demonstrate that our
                 initial choices for populating each part of our
                 optimization framework are reasonable. Our experience
                 also shows that having a complete optimization
                 framework is crucial for two reasons. First, it allows
                 the optimizer to discover plans that cannot be revealed
                 by exploring only the alternatives provided by the
                 logical algebra and its transformations. Second, it
                 helps and forces the database system designer to
                 consider all parts of the framework and to maintain a
                 good balance of choices when incorporating a new
                 logical operator, execution algorithm transformation
                 rule, or implementation rule. The Open OODB query
                 optimizer was constructed using the Volcano Optimizer
                 Generator, demonstrating that this second-generation
                 optimizer generator enables rapid development of
                 efficient and effective query optimizers for

  abstract =     "This paper introduces a new approach to database disk
                 buffering, called the LRU-K method. The basic idea of
                 LRU-K is to keep track of the times of the last K
                 references to popular database pages, using this
                 information to statistically estimate the interarrival
                 times of references on a page by page basis. Although
                 the LRU-K approach performs optimal statistical
                 inference under relatively standard assumptions, it is
                 fairly simple and incurs little bookkeeping overhead.
                 As we demonstrate with simulation experiments, the
                 LRU-K algorithm surpasses conventional buffering
                 algorithms in discriminating between frequently and
                 infrequently referenced pages. In fact, LRU-K can
                 approach the behavior of buffering algorithms in which
                 page sets with known access frequencies are manually
                 assigned to different buffer pools of specifically
                 tuned sizes. Unlike such customized buffering
                 algorithms however, the LRU-K method is self-tuning,
                 and does not rely on external hints about workload
                 characteristics. Furthermore, the LRU-K algorithm
                 adapts in real time to changing patterns of access.",

                 However, writes must be performed by both disks,

                 This reduces the cost of a random logical write to 1/3
                 of the cost of a read. Moreover, much of the write cost
                 can be absorbed in the rotational latency of the reads,

                 provide high throughput for transaction processing
                 applications. When a single disk in a redundant array
                 fails, the array continues to operate, albeit in a
                 degraded mode with a corresponding reduction in
                 performance. In addition, the lost data must be rebuilt
                 to a spare disk in a timely manner to reduce the
                 probability of permanent data loss. Several researchers
                 have proposed and examined algorithms for rebuilding
                 the failed disk in a disk array with parity. We examine
                 the use of these algorithms to rebuild a mirrored disk
                 array and compare the rebuild time and performance of
                 the RAID5 and mirrored arrays. Redirection of Reads
                 provides comparable average response times and better
                 rebuild times than Piggybacking for a mirrored array,
                 whereas these two algorithms perform similarly for a
                 RAID5 array. In our experiments comparing the two
                 architectures, a mirrored array has more disks than a
                 RAID5 array and can sustain 150\% more I/Os per second
                 during the rebuild process. Even if the size of the
                 RAID5 array is increased to match the mirrored array,
                 the mirrored array reduces response times by up to 60\%

                 storage, which means that they need distributed search
                 structures for fast and efficient access to the data.
                 In this paper, we present an approach to maintaining
                 distributed data structures that uses lazy updates,
                 which take advantage of the semantics of the search
                 structure operations to allow for scalable and
                 low-overhead replication. Lazy updates can be used to
                 design distributed search structures that support very
                 high levels of concurrency. The alternatives to lazy
                 update algorithms (eager updates) use synchronization
                 to ensure consistency, while lazy update algorithms
                 avoid blocking. Since lazy updates avoid the use of
                 synchronization, they are much easier to implement than
                 eager update algorithms. We demonstrate the application
                 of lazy updates to the dB-tree, which is distributed
                 B$^+$ tree that replicates its interior nodes for
                 highly parallel access. We develop a correctness theory

                 languages have been proposed to facilitate easy
                 database access. Although these languages have
                 introduced some very useful paradigms, a number of
                 these have some severe limitations, such as: (a) not
                 extending beyond the relational model (b) not
                 considering negation and safety, formally (c) using ad
                 hoc constructs, with no analysis of expressivity or
                 complexity done, etc. Note that visual database access
                 is an important issue being revisited, with the
                 emergence of different flavors of object-oriented
                 databases. We believe that there is a need for

                 a few core constructs using which `expert-users' can
                 define new (derived) constructs easily (ii) `Normal
                 users' can use easily either the core or the derived
                 constructs for database querying (iii) It can implement
                 representative constructs of other (textual or visual)
                 query language straightforwardly, and (iv) It has
                 formal semantics, with its theoretical properties, such
                 as complexity, analyzed. We believe that we make a
                 first step towards the above goal by introducing a new
                 logical construct called restricted universal
                 quantifier and combining it with the hierarchical
                 structure of windows to develop a Visual Query
                 Language, called VQL. The core constructs of VQL can
                 encode easily a number of representative constructs of
                 different (about six visual and four non-visual)
                 relational, nested and object-oriented query languages.
                 We also study the theoretical aspects such as safety,
                 complexity, etc., of VQL.",

                 the domain of data values is sufficiently large. The
                 method extends recent theoretical results that use
                 extended relation representations to answer domain
                 dependent queries, without the use of auxiliary
                 variables or invented constants or an explicit
                 enumeration of the active domain. The method is shown
                 to be logically correct and to have polynomial data
                 complexity. By identifying relational algebra
                 operations with relational calculus queries this

                 non-recursive algebra, or an algebra with a fixed point
                 operation, and the corresponding class of deductive
                 queries is that defined by stratified programs. We

                 allow non-restricted use of negation. It turns out that
                 recursion and negation in the algebraic paradigm need
                 to be studied together. The semantics used for the
                 comparison is the valid semantics, although other
                 well-known declarative semantics can also be used to
                 derive similar results. We show that the class of

                 technologies that will soon be available to a wide
                 variety of computer users. Unlike earlier generations
                 of laptop computers, the new generation of mobile
                 computers can be an integrated part of a distributed
                 computing environment, one in which users change
                 physical location frequently. The result is a new
                 computing paradigm, nomadic computing. This paradigm
                 will affect the design of much of our current systems
                 software, including that of database systems. This
                 paper discusses in some detail the impact of nomadic
                 computing on a number of traditional database system
                 concepts. In particular, we point out how the reliance
                 on short-lived batteries changes the cost assumptions
                 underlying query processing. In these systems, power
                 consumption competes with resource utilization in the
                 definition of cost metrics. We also discuss how the
                 likelihood of temporary disconnection forces
                 consideration of alternative transaction processing
                 protocols. The limited screen space of mobile computers
                 along with the advent of pen-based computing provides
                 new opportunities and new constraints on database
                 interfaces and languages. Lastly, we believe that the
                 movement of computers and data among networks
                 potentially belonging to distinct, autonomous
                 organizations creates serious security problems.",

                 autonomy, and availability to multidatabase systems.
                 Database research can make a significant impact on
                 global computing by providing fast selection queries in
                 search spaces of tens of thousands of database
                 partitions. New wide area techniques for query
                 processing parallelism, caching, and partially delayed
                 queries are necessary. Name service applications
                 provide a good initial arena for wide area research,
                 because they require a simpler model of consistency
                 than traditional serializability. As we develop name
                 services for global computing, we can develop an
                 understanding of different measures and models of
                 consistency, their interrelationships, and their
                 effects on performance. It is reasonable to expect that
                 the semantics of query processing will be significantly
                 different in the global computing environment. The new
                 semantics will rely on weaker forms of consistency, new
                 models of cooperation, and visible scale, availability
                 and consistency information.",

                 provide a schema incrementally as we process the data.

                 environment is a collection of heterogeneous software
                 packages and hardware platforms. Its network consists
                 of IBM mainframes and workstations that are scattered
                 to different countries leading to the subsequent rise
                 in self-controlled or autonomous computing services.
                 However, problems still exist in such environments. In
                 response, the Purdue University's InterBase Lab
                 designed an environment for global application. They
                 call it InterBase (BCD + 92), which maintains a
                 toll-based interface that facilitates application
                 development in a distributed environment of
                 heterogeneous software. BNR has foreseen the
                 realization of two major benefits. These are: cost
                 reduction and convenience. Its success led BNR to
                 pursue a better and broader development of the
                 project.",

                 transform data to information in a three-layer,
                 mediated architecture. The layers can be characterized
                 from the top down as information-consuming
                 applications, mediators which perform intelligent
                 integration of information (I3), and data, knowledge
                 and simulation resources. The objective of modules in
                 the I3 architecture is to provide end user's
                 applications with information obtained through
                 selection, abstraction, fusion, caching, extrapolation,
                 and pruning of data. The data is obtained from many
                 diverse and heterogeneous sources. The I3 objective
                 requires the establishment of a consensual information
                 system architecture, so that many participants and
                 technologies can contribute. An attempt to provide such

                 see a logical model of objects connected to objects,
                 with atomic transactions and propagating methods, even
                 if composite objects are split among multiple
                 databases, each under separate administrative control,
                 on multiple, heterogeneous platforms, operating
                 systems, and network protocols. Support for production
                 environments includes multiple schemas, which may be
                 shared among databases, private, or encrypted, dynamic
                 addition of schemas, and schema evolution. Finally, the
                 logical view must remain valid, and applications must
                 continue to work, as the mapping to the physical
                 environment changes, moving objects and databases to

                 processing techniques to achieve scalability and

                 running multiple instances of the DBMS and partitioning

                 have a reliable distributed computing environment.
                 Various components of that environment may be supplied

                 requires interoperability. Today, Interoperability is
                 no more just an idea but a reality. There is also a

                 consistency between interrelated data. In industrial
                 environments, lack of consistent data creates
                 difficulties in interoperation between systems and
                 often requires manual interventions to restart
                 operations that fail due to inconsistent data. We
                 report the results of a study to understand
                 applicability, adequacy and advantages of a framework
                 we had proposed earlier to specify interdatabase
                 dependencies in multidatabase environments. We studied
                 several existing Bellcore systems and identified
                 examples of interdependent data. The examples
                 demonstrate that the framework allows precise and
                 detailed specification of complex interdependencies
                 that lead to efficient strategies to enforce the
                 consistency requirements among the corporate data

                 time consuming and costly manual operations, and

                 permits smooth interaction between service, support,
                 and sales business areas thereby enhancing the
                 efficiency of the overall business application
                 development. There are five stages of growth in the
                 business development model namely: application
                 identification stage, application prototyping, market
                 trial deployment, limited deployment, and wide
                 deployment. Analysis must evolve in each of these
                 stages. An effective analysis requires the right people
                 to supervise and ensure its success. Successful
                 handling of interoperability issues is said to be the

  abstract =     "The Carnot Project at MCC is addressing the problem of
                 logically unifying physically-distributed,
                 enterprise-wide, heterogeneous information. Carnot will
                 provide a user with the means to navigate information
                 efficiently and transparently, to update that
                 information consistently, and to write applications
                 easily for large, heterogeneous, distributed
                 information systems. A prototype has been implemented
                 which provides services for (a) enterprise modeling and
                 model integration to create an enterprise-wide view,
                 (b) semantic expansion of queries on the view to
                 queries on individual resources, and (c) inter-resource
                 consistency management. This paper describes the Carnot
                 approach to transaction processing in environments
                 where heterogeneous, distributed, and autonomous
                 systems are required to coordinate the update of the
                 local information under their control. In this
                 approach, subtransactions are represented as a set of
                 tasks and a set of intertask dependencies that capture
                 the semantics of a particular relaxed transaction
                 model. A scheduler has been implemented which schedules
                 the execution of these tasks in the Carnot environment
                 so that all intertask dependencies are satisfied.",

                 data that has been archived and manipulated by
                 computer-based information systems. Such computer-based
                 medical record systems improved the accessibility of
                 clinical information and made several studies of such
                 information possible. Unfortunately, the care
                 provider's task of retrieving, integrating, and
                 interpreting only those portions of the patient's
                 record that are relevant to a specific clinical problem
                 is actually becoming increasingly difficult. This
                 difficulty can be attributed primarily to the large
                 variety of minimum data sets, the heterogeneous formats
                 used to store the data, the heterogeneous data access
                 methods and procedures, the varying granularity of
                 access to data, the different rigid views of the data,
                 and the lack of inter-operability among the information
                 repositories of such data sets. Recognizing the
                 aforementioned issues, we are engaged in a project to
                 build a multi-database environment tailored for the
                 interoperability of medical information systems. The
                 main building blocks of such a system are a
                 multi-disciplinary minimum data set and a catalogue for
                 the support of interoperability and customization
                 functions. In this paper, we report on the design

  abstract =     "CoBase, a cooperative database, is a new type of
                 distributed database that integrates knowledge base
                 technology with database systems to provide cooperative
                 (approximate and conceptual) query answering. Based on
                 the database schema and application characteristics,
                 data are organized into conceptual (type abstraction)
                 hierarchies. The higher levels of the hierarchy provide
                 a more abstract data representation than the lower
                 levels. Generalization (moving up in the hierarchy),
                 specialization (moving down in the hierarchy) and
                 association (moving between hierarchies) are the three
                 key operations in deriving cooperative query answers.
                 Relaxation in CoBase can also be specified explicitly
                 in the query by the user or calling program through
                 cooperative operators. We have extended SQL to CSQL by
                 adding cooperative primitives. We describe the CoBase
                 software implementation, including an inter-module data
                 protocol that provides a uniform module interface. This
                 modular approach provides flexibility in adding new
                 relaxation modules and simplifies software maintenance.
                 CoBase uses LOOM as its knowledge representation and
                 inference system and supports relational data bases
                 (e.g. Oracle and Sybase). We have demonstrated the
                 feasibility and functionality of CoBase on top of a
                 Transportation Database. The CoBase methodology has
                 also been adopted in multimedia medical distributed
                 database project at UCLA, which provides approximate
                 query answers to medical queries.",

                 posed by multi-user parallel database systems are

                 tools provided by the Papyrus system, a number of
                 specialized data managers can be integrated and users
                 or applications may pose queries that span the
                 integrated data managers' functions. Through a series

                 cost-based query optimization strategy is essential to
                 achieving high performance. A simple Geographic

  abstract =     "Rapid advancements in positioning systems and wireless
                 communications enable accurate tracking of continuously
                 moving objects. This development poses new challenges
                 to database technology since maintaining up-to-date
                 information regarding the location of moving objects
                 incurs an enormous amount of updates. There have been
                 many efforts to address these challenges, most of which
                 depend on the use of a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR)
                 in a multi-dimensional index structure such as R-tree.
                 The maintenance of MBRs causes lock contention and
                 association of moving speeds with the MBRs cause large
                 overlap between them. This problem becomes more severe
                 as the number of concurrent operations increases. In
                 this paper, we propose a 'new' simple variant of the
                 Buddy-tree, in which we enlarge the query rectangle to
                 account for object movement rather than use an enlarged
                 MBR. The result is not only elegant, but also
                 efficient, particularly in terms of lock contention. An
                 extensive experimental study was conducted and the
                 results show that our proposed structure outperforms

                 or MICS) is one of several research initiatives
                 sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation to
                 promote long term research projects in areas of vital
                 strategic importance for the evolution of science in
                 Switzerland, for the country's economy and for Swiss
                 society. NCCR-MICS covers a wide spectrum of topics in
                 the area of mobile information and communication
                 systems ranging from information theory related to
                 ad-hoc sensor networks to business models for pervasive
                 computing, including network and routing issues,
                 software and application development, and actual
                 deployments of sensor networks (from architecture to
                 geology). In this paper, we briefly present MICS as a
                 whole and discuss in some detail two ambitious projects
                 in the area of data management. The first project,
                 XTream, addresses the whole life cycle of sensor based
                 applications from the acquisition by sensors,
                 aggregation and integration in gateways, storage in
                 databases, generation of events that are relevant to
                 users and applications, up to the subscription and
                 consumption of events in a distributed architecture.
                 The second project is Global Sensor Networks (GSN),
                 which aims at enabling the rapid and efficient
                 publication, sharing and interoperability of
                 heterogeneous sensor data sources over large networks
                 such as the Internet and P2P overlays.",

                 series database to find the similar time series of the
                 given one. In this process, similarity measure plays a
                 very important part. The previous methods do not
                 consider the relation between point correspondences and
                 the importance (role) of the points on the content of
                 time series during measuring similarity, resulting in
                 their low accuracies in many real applications. In the
                 paper, we propose a General Hierarchical Model (GHM),
                 which determines the point correspondences by the
                 hierarchies of points. It partitions the points of time
                 series into different hierarchies, and then the points
                 are restricted to be compared with the ones in the same
                 hierarchy. The practical methods can be implemented
                 based on the model with any real requirements, e.g. FFT
                 Hierarchical Measures (FHM) given in this paper. And
                 the hierarchical filtering methods of GHM are provided
                 for range and k-NN queries respectively. Finally, two
                 common data sets were used in k-NN query and clustering
                 experiments to test the effectiveness of our approach
                 and others. The time performance comparisons of all the
                 tested methods were performed using the synthetic data
                 set with various sizes. The experimental results show
                 the superiority of our approach over the competitors.
                 And we also give the experimental powers of the
                 filtering methods proposed in the queries.",

                 standard in many application domains. An increasing
                 number of researchers and professionals, who are not
                 computer scientists (although they may have a strong
                 technical background), needs to query and transform XML
                 data during their working activities. Such tasks
                 typically require simple queries and partial awareness
                 of the XML data model, in the context of a given,
                 domain-specific XML-based protocol.\par

                 The W3C community has proposed XQuery as the standard
                 query language for XML [9]. XQuery has a huge
                 expressive power --- as it encompasses features
                 belonging both to query and functional languages, but
                 it may be considered as too complex for the above user
                 profiles; well-designed subsets of XQuery are
                 sufficient to satisfy their needs.\par

                 In this paper, we propose six layered subsets of
                 XQuery, targeted to cover user communities with
                 increasing needs. The initial layers are based upon
                 XQBE (XQuery By Example), a visual XML query language,
                 strictly less expressive than XQuery. We argue that the
                 first layers are easier to learn and to master than the
                 full language, also thanks to the availability of
                 simple visual interfaces, and that these layers cover
                 most of the needs of many user communities.",

                 estimation of queries on ontology models of data is

                 queries into query pattern paths, where each path
                 produces a set of values for each variable within the
                 result form of the query. In order to estimate the
                 total number of result set parameters for each path, a
                 set of statistics is compiled on the properties of the

                 DTDs obsolete, research on practical XML optimization
                 is mostly biased towards DTDs and tends to largely
                 ignore XSDs (some notable exceptions non-withstanding).
                 One of the underlying reasons is most probably the
                 perceived simplicity of DTDs versus the alleged
                 impenetrability of XML Schema. Indeed, optimization
                 w.r.t. DTDs has a local flavor and usually reduces to
                 reasoning about the accustomed formalism of regular
                 expressions. XSDs, on the other hand, even when
                 sufficiently stripped down, are related to the less
                 pervious class of unranked regular tree automata [6,
                 19, 20, 21]. Recent results on the structural
                 expressiveness of XSDs [19], however, show that XSDs
                 are in fact much closer to DTDs than to tree automata,
                 leveraging the possibility to directly extend
                 techniques for DTD-based XML optimization to the realm
                 of XML Schema. The goal of the present paper is to
                 present the results in [19] in an easy and accessible
                 way. At the same time, we discuss possible
                 applications, related research, and future research

                 information and visualizations they might find useful
                 for their current task. Mash Maker uses structured data
                 from existing web sites to create new 'mashed up'
                 interfaces combining information from many
                 sources.\par

                 The Intel{\reg} Mash Maker client is currently
                 implemented as an extension to the FireFox web browser.
                 Mash Maker adds a toolbar to the browser that shows
                 buttons representing enhancements that Mash Maker
                 believes the user might want to apply to the current
                 page. An enhancement might combine the data on the page
                 with data from another source, or visualize data in a
                 new way. Mash Maker is intended to be an integral part

                 being a special tool that a user uses when they want to

                 In order to create mashups from normal websites, Mash
                 Maker must first extract structured data from them. If

                 extracts structured data from the raw HTML using a
                 community-maintained database of extractors, where each

                 Uncertainty in Databases [dKvK06]. The TDM is a
                 bi-annual workshop organized by the Database group of
                 the University of Twente, for which each time a
                 different topic is chosen. The participants of TDM 2006
                 were enthusiastic about the topic 'Uncertainty in
                 Databases' and strongly expressed the wish for a
                 follow-up co-located with an international conference.
                 To fulfill this wish, we organized the MUD-workshop at
                 VLDB.",

  abstract =     "An increasing number of database applications today
                 require sophisticated approximate string matching
                 capabilities. Examples of such application areas
                 include data integration and data cleaning. Cosine
                 similarity has proven to be a robust metric for scoring
                 the similarity between two strings, and it is
                 increasingly being used in complex queries. An
                 immediate challenge faced by current database
                 optimizers is to find accurate and efficient methods
                 for estimating the selectivity of cosine similarity
                 predicates. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
                 known methods for this problem. In this paper, we
                 present the first approach for estimating the
                 selectivity of tf.idf based cosine similarity
                 predicates. We evaluate our approach on three different
                 real datasets and show that our method often produces
                 estimates that are within 40\% of the actual
                 selectivity.",

  abstract =     "The need for large-scale data sharing between
                 autonomous and possibly heterogeneous decentralized
                 systems on the Web gave rise to the concept of P2P
                 database systems. Decentralized databases are, however,
                 not new. Whereas a definition for a P2P database system
                 can be readily provided, a comparison with the more
                 established decentralized models, commonly referred to
                 as distributed, federated and multi-databases, is more
                 likely to provide a better insight to this new P2P data
                 management technology. Thus, in the paper, by
                 distinguishing between db-centric and P2P-centric
                 features, we examine features common to these database
                 systems as well as other ad-hoc features that solely

                 business activities undertaken by one or more
                 organizations in pursuit of some particular goal. It
                 often interacts with other BPs of the same or other
                 organizations and the software implementing it is
                 rather complex. Two complementary instruments
                 facilitate the design, development, and management of
                 this complex software. The first is the use of
                 standards. In particular, the recent BPEL standard
                 (Business Process Execution Language [5]) provides an
                 XML-based language to describe the operational logic
                 and execution flow of the BP, as well as the interfaces
                 it exposes to other BPs. A BP specification written in
                 BPEL can be automatically compiled into an actual code
                 that implements the BP, and can be executed on a BPEL
                 server. The second instrument is the use of supporting
                 BP management tools for (1) designing the BP BPEL
                 specifications, (2) analyzing the design, (3)
                 monitoring the BPs at run time, and (4) analyzing,
                 posteriorly, the process execution traces (logs).
                 Together they provide an essential infrastructure for
                 companies to design business processes, optimize them,
                 reduce operational costs, and ultimately increase
                 competitiveness.",

                 industry and academia.\par

                 The original idea for an 'image server' happened in the
                 early 1990s when Jim was at Digital. Jim had met Jeff
                 Dozier while working on the National Research Council's
                 'Computing the Future' committee [NRC 1994]. Jeff
                 became Dean of the Bren School of Environmental
                 Sciences and chair of UC Santa Barbara's Alexandria
                 Digital Library advisory board. Jeff asked Jim to serve
                 on the board.\par

                 During an Alexandria board meeting, Jeff and Jim
                 discussed the idea for a 'geospatial image server'. All
                 they needed was a lot of accessible imagery, someone
                 that wanted it done, and someone foolish enough to load
                 a few tera-bytes of data. The cold war ended enabling
                 the high resolution imagery marketplace. Microsoft SQL
                 Server wanted a scalability Internet demonstration. And
                 I walked into Jim Gray's lab looking for a reason to
                 move back to San Francisco. And that's where my 10 year

                 about the data needs of ocean scientists. The
                 conversations ultimately led to the development of a
                 unique portal for exploring multidisciplinary data
                 sets, which we call the Metadata Oriented Query
                 Assistant (MOQuA). At the time, we were working with an
                 extremely rich data set which included measurements
                 from ships, satellites, aircraft, moorings, and a
                 variety of underwater robots. The data set also
                 included output from both atmospheric and ocean models.
                 We initially made the data available via a
                 state-of-the-art data server. However, serious users
                 did not use the server, instead approaching us for
                 copies of the relevant portions. Our experience
                 convinced us that we needed a far more capable portal,

                 scientists in a way which could be satisfied via an
                 intuitive interface was challenging. In the course of
                 many conversations and interactions with Jim, we

                 around questions rather than visualizations, and this

                 both to an explosion of data and usage scenarios, and
                 to major shifts in computing hardware and platforms.
                 Given these forces, we are at a time of opportunity for
                 research impact, with an unusually large potential for
                 influential results across computing, the sciences and
                 society. This report details that discussion, and
                 highlights the group's consensus view of new focus
                 areas, including new database engine architectures,
                 declarative programming languages, the interplay of
                 structured and unstructured data, cloud data services,
                 and mobile and virtual worlds. We also report on
                 discussions of the community's growth, including
                 suggestions for changes in community processes to move
                 the research agenda forward, and to enhance impact on a

                 encounter increasing volumes of unstructured data,
                 there has been renewed interest in the area of
                 information extraction (IE) -- the discipline concerned
                 with extracting structured information from
                 unstructured text. Classical IE techniques developed by
                 the NLP community were based on cascading grammars and
                 regular expressions. However, due to the inherent
                 limitations of grammar-based extraction, these
                 techniques are unable to: (i) scale to large data sets,
                 and (ii) support the expressivity requirements of
                 complex information tasks. At the IBM Almaden Research
                 Center, we are developing SystemT, an IE system that
                 addresses these limitations by adopting an algebraic
                 approach. By leveraging well-understood database
                 concepts such as declarative queries and costbased
                 optimization, SystemT enables scalable execution of
                 complex information extraction tasks. In this paper, we
                 motivate the SystemT approach to information
                 extraction. We describe our extraction algebra and
                 demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization

  abstract =     "Text documents often embed data that is structured in
                 nature. This structured data is increasingly exposed
                 using {\em information extraction systems}, which
                 generate structured relations from documents,
                 introducing an opportunity to process expressive,
                 structured queries over text databases. This paper
                 discusses our SQoUT1 project, which focuses on {\em
                 processing structured queries over relations extracted
                 from text databases}. We show how, in our
                 extraction-based scenario, query processing can be
                 decomposed into a sequence of basic steps: retrieving
                 relevant text documents, extracting relations from the
                 documents, and joining extracted relations for queries
                 involving multiple relations. Each of these steps
                 presents different alternatives and together they form
                 a rich space of possible query execution strategies. We
                 identify {\em execution efficiency\/} and {\em output
                 quality\/} as the two critical properties of a query
                 execution, and argue that an optimization approach
                 needs to consider both properties. To this end, we take
                 into account the user-specified requirements for
                 execution efficiency and output quality, and choose an
                 execution strategy for each query based on a
                 principled, cost-based comparison of the alternative
                 execution strategies.",

                 searchable, large-scale, highly accurate knowledge base
                 of common facts. YAGO harvests info boxes and category
                 names of Wikipedia for facts about individual entities,
                 and it reconciles these with the taxonomic backbone of
                 WordNet in order to ensure that all entities have
                 proper classes and the class system is consistent.
                 Currently, the YAGO knowledge base contains about 19
                 million instances of binary relations for about 1.95
                 million entities. Based on intensive sampling, its
                 accuracy is estimated to be above 95 percent. The paper

                 construct a unified Web knowledge base. Information
                 extraction techniques have shown good results on Web
                 inputs, but even most domain-independent ones are not
                 appropriate for Web-scale operation. In this paper we
                 describe three recent extraction systems that can be
                 operated on the entire Web (two of which come from
                 Google Research). The TextRunner system focuses on raw
                 natural language text, the WebTables system focuses on
                 HTML-embedded tables, and the deep-web surfacing system
                 focuses on 'hidden' databases. The domain,
                 expressiveness, and accuracy of extracted data can
                 depend strongly on its source extractor; we describe

                 the three extractors. Finally, we discuss a series of

                 predicates associated with an exact temporal
                 constraint. A set of such predicates forms a buffer
                 query or a Spatio-temporal Pattern (STP) Query with
                 time. In the more general case of an STP query, the
                 temporal dimension is introduced via the relative order
                 of the spatial predicates (STP queries with order).
                 Therefore, the efficient processing of a spatiotemporal
                 predicate is crucial for the efficient implementation
                 of more complex queries of practical interest. We
                 propose an extension of a known approach, suitable for
                 processing spatial predicates, which has been used for
                 the efficient manipulation of STP queries with order.
                 The extended method is supported by efficient indexing
                 structures. We also provide experimental results that

                 model for representing information about resources in
                 the web. With the increasing amount of RDF data which
                 is becoming available, efficient and scalable
                 management of RDF data has become a fundamental
                 challenge to achieve the SemanticWeb vision. The RDF
                 model has attracted the attention of the database
                 community and many researchers have proposed different
                 solutions to store and query RDF data efficiently. This
                 survey focuses on using relational query processors to
                 store and query RDF data. We provide an overview of the
                 different approaches and classify them according to
                 their storage and query evaluation strategies.",

                 challenges that arise in energy-aware computing in a
                 cluster of servers running data-intensive workloads. We
                 leverage the insight that servers in a cluster are
                 often underutilized, which makes it attractive to
                 consider powering down some servers and redistributing
                 their load to others. Of course, powering down servers
                 naively will render data stored only on powered down
                 servers inaccessible. While data replication can be
                 exploited to power down servers without losing access
                 to data, unfortunately, care must be taken in the
                 design of the replication and server power down schemes
                 to avoid creating load imbalances on the remaining
                 'live' servers. Accordingly, in this paper we study the
                 interaction between energy management, load balancing,
                 and replication strategies for data-intensive cluster
                 computing. In particular, we show that Chained
                 Declustering -- a replication strategy proposed more
                 than 20 years ago -- can support very flexible energy
                 management schemes.",
