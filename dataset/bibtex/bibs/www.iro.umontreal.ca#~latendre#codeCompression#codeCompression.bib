 abstract = "Program code compression is an emerging research activity
 that is having an impact in several production areas such as
 networking and embedded systems. This is because the reduced-sized
 code can have a positive impact on network traffic and embedded
 system costs such as memory requirements and power
 consumption. Although code-size reduction is a relatively new
 research area, numerous publications already exist on it. The methods
 published usually have different motivations and a variety of
 application contexts. They may use different principles and their
 publications often use diverse notations. To our knowledge, there are
 no publications that present a good overview of this broad range of
 methods and give a useful assessment. This article surveys twelve
 methods and several related works appearing in some 50 papers
 published up to now. We provide extensive assessment criteria for
 evaluating the methods and offer a basis for comparison. We conclude
 that it is fairly hard to make any fair comparisons of the methods or
 draw conclusions about their applicability."

neglected, in favor of performance tuning.  With this work we aim at
determining the weakpoints of GCC concerning its optimization
capability for space. We compare (1) GCC with two non-free ARM
cross-compiler toolchains, (2) how GCC evolved from release 3.2.2 to
version 3.3, and (3) two runtime libraries for the Linux kernel. All
tests were performed using the C front end and for the ARM target both
as standalone and as Linux executables. The test suite is comprised of
applications from well-known benchmark suites such as SPEC and
Mediabench.  An optimal combination of compiler (and linker) options
with respect to minimal code size is elaborated as well. We conclude
that GCC 3.3 steadily improves with respect to version 3.2.2 and that
it is only about 11% behind a high-performance non-free compiler. At
the same time, we were able to document a number of issues that
deserve further investigation in order to improve code generation for
space."

  abstract =     "Despite the apparent success of the Java Virtual
                 Machine, its lackluster performance makes it ill-suited
                 for many speed-critical ap- plications. Although the
                 latest just-in-time compilers and dedicated Java
                 processors try to remedy this situation, optimized code
                 compiled directly from a C program source is still
                 orders of magnitude faster than software transported
                 via Java byte-codes. This is true even if the Java
                 byte-codes are subsequently further translated into
                 native code. In this paper, we claim that these
                 performance penalties are not a neces- sary consequence
                 of machine-independence, but related to Java's partic-
                 ular intermediate representation. We have constructed a
                 prototype and are further developing a software
                 transportability scheme founded on a tree-based
                 alternative to Java byte-codes. This tree-based
                 intermediate representation is not only twice as
                 compact as Java byte-codes, but also contains more
                 detailed semantic information, some of which is
                 critical for advanced code optimizations. Our
                 architecture not only provides on-the-fly code
                 generation from this intermediate representation, but
                 also continuous re-optimization of the existing
                 code-base by a low-priority background process. The
                 re-optimization process is guided by up-to-the-minute
                 profiling data, leading to superior optimization
                 results.",

                 popular methodology has been peephole refinement of a
                 canonical instruction set. By this we mean the addition
                 of extra opcodes over the minimum necessary for a
                 viable machine in order to handle particular common
                 cases more efficiently. Such machines by the use of
                 ``escape'' sequences often have hundreds of different
                 opcodes. By comparison, modern ``Reduced Instruction
                 Set'' computers, which do not take the byte stream
                 approach, have a very small number of opcodes. We argue
                 that in theact there is not significant benefit to be
                 achieved by having byte stream instructions sets of
                 more than around 100 opcodes. A formal basis for the

                 opcodes means less microcod, and more silicon for
                 hardware assistance. It also makes the compiler

                 systeme embarque doit repondre a des contraintes en
                 taille de memoire et en temps de reponse. Dans cet
                 article, nous montrons qu'il est possible de factoriser
                 automatiquement des sequences d'instructions communes
                 pour du code intermediaire Java. Sur un ensemble de
                 programmes Java representatifs, nous avons obtenu un
                 taux moyen de compression de la taille du code
                 intermediare de 30\%, ceci avec un temps d'execution
                 augmente au plus de 30\%. L'implementation de la
                 factorisation requiert des modifications mineures au
                 sein d'une machine virtuelle Java. Nous decrivons ces
                 modifications pour la machine virtuelle d'Harissa et
                 presentons un algorithme permettant de factoriser le
                 code intermediaire. A program executing on an embedded
                 system or similar environment faces limited memory
                 resources and fixed time constrains. We demonstrate how
                 factorization of common instruction sequences can be
                 automatically applied to Java bytecode programs. Based
                 on a series of experiments, we argue that program size
                 is reduced by 30\% on the average, typically with an
                 execution time penalty of less than 30\%. The one-time,
                 minor modifications necessary to make a standard Java
                 interpreter compatible with this factorized code are
                 presented on the Harissa virtual machine, together with
                 an algorithm for performing the factorization of Java
                 bytecode.",

  abstract =     "DSP architectures typically provide indirect
                 addressing modes with autoincrement and decrement. In
                 addition, indexing mode is generally not available, and
                 there are usually few, if any, general-purpose
                 registers. Hence, it is necessary to use address
                 registers and perform address arithmetic to access
                 automatic variables. Subsuming the address arithmetic
                 into autoincrement and decrement modes improves the
                 size of the generated code. In this article we present
                 a formulation of the problem of optimal storage
                 assignment such that explicit instructions for address
                 arithmetic are minimized. We prove that for the case of
                 a single address register the decision problem is
                 NP-complete, even for a single basic block. We then
                 generalize the problem to multiple address registers.
                 For both cases heuristic algorithms are given, and
                 experimental results are presented.",
