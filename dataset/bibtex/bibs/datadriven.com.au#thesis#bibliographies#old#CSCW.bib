abstract       = {Notes is a hypertext application developed to   investigate the effects of computers on the writing   process, in particular, on the processes of acquiring   and structuring knowledge when writing from source   texts. Notes is designed to help writers record their   own ideas (e.g., reactions, inferences, plausibility   assessments), recover the context for those ideas   easily and view ideas from multiple perspectives. In   this paper we outline the theoretical basis for the   design of the Notes program. Then we briefly describe   the program itself and its relation to relevant   research. Finally we describe our experience with   users.

The authors of this paper   attempt to make Web pages dynamic. They describe the   BSCW shared workspace s^ystem, which sits on a Web   browser and allows authorized users to update   documents and upload the revisions to the server. It   also helps with version control of Web pages, in that   it supports archiving, keeping a history of the   collaborative process, and synchronization. The   authors describe two approaches, namely, RFC 1867, an   experimental protocol for form-based file upload in   HTML, and HTTP "put" document publishing.      

The paper should be useful to researchers concerned   with the Internet in general and with Web management   using dynamic pages in particular. Graduate students   may use it as a hint about possible research   directions in Web management.      

The authors should have explained the many acronyms   used in the paper (only CSCW is explained). Out of the   six references provided, three are associated with the   authors. The paper would be more useful if references   to the work of other authors had been included.

However, the rigid   structures of hierarchical schemes do not mesh well   with the more fluid nature of everyday document   practices. This paper describes Presto, a prototype   system that allows users to organise their documents   entirely in terms of the properties those documents   hold for users. Properties provide a uniform mechanism   for managing, coding, searching, retrieving and   interacting with documents. We concentrate in   particular on the challenges that property-based   approaches present and the architecture we have   developed to tackle them.  Strangely enough the   authors does not talk about RDF or webDAV.
