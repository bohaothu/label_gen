    abstract={During the Spring 2008 semester at Olin College, 
we introduced the programming language occam-pi to undergraduates as part of their first course in robotics. Students were 
able to explore image processing and autonomous behavioral 
control in a parallel programming language on a small mobile 
robotics platform with just two weeks of tutorial instruction. 
Our experiences to date suggest that the language and tools we 
have developed allow the concise expression of complex robotic 
control systems, and enable the integration of events from the 
environment in a consistent and safe model for parallel control 
that is directly expressed in software.},

@inproceedings{SimpsonJacobsen:2008,
    abstract={When teaching concurrency, using a process-oriented language, it is often 
introduced through a visual representation of programs in the form of process network 
diagrams. These diagrams allow the design of and abstract reasoning about programs, 
consisting of concurrently executing communicating processes, without needing any 
syntactic knowledge of the eventual implementation language. Process network diagrams are usually drawn on paper or with general-purpose diagramming software, 
meaning the program must be implemented as syntactically correct program code before it can be run. This paper presents POPed, an introductory parallel programming 
tool leveraging process network diagrams as a visual language for the creation of 
process-oriented programs. Using only visual layout and connection of pre-created 
components, the user can explore process orientation without knowledge of the underlying programming language, enabling a ``processes first'' approach to parallel programming. POPed has been targeted specifically at basic robotic control, to provide a 
context in which introductory parallel programming can be naturally motivated.},

@inproceedings{RitsonSimpson-2008,
    abstract={While we strive to create robust language constructs and design patterns which
  prevent the introduction of faults during software development, an inevitable
  element of human error still remains. We must therefore endeavor to ease and
  accelerate the process of diagnosing and fixing software faults, commonly
  known as debugging. Current support for debugging occam-pi programs is
  fairly limited. At best the developer is presented with a reference to the
  last known code line executed before their program abnormally terminated.
  This assumes the program does in fact terminate, and does not instead
  live-lock. In cases where this support is not sufficient, developers must
  instrument their own tracing support, "printf style". An exercise which
  typically enlightens one as to the true meaning of concurrency... In this
  paper we explore previous work in the field of debugging occam programs and
  introduce a new method for run-time monitoring of occam-pi applications, based
  on the Transterpreter virtual machine interpreter. By adding a set of
  extensions to the Transterpreter, we give occam-pi processes the ability to
  interact with their execution environment. Use of a virtual machine allows us
  to expose program execution state which would otherwise require non-portable
  or specialised hardware support. Using a model which bears similarities to
  that applied when debugging embedded systems with a JTAG connection, we
  describe debugging occam-pi by mediating the execution of one execution
  process from another.},

@inproceedings{DimmichJacobsen05,
    abstract={occam-pi is a programming language based on the CSP process algebra and 
the pi-calculus, and has a powerful syntax for expressing concurrency. occam-pi does 
not however, come with interfaces to a broad range of standard libraries (such as those 
used for graphics or mathematics). Programmers wishing to use these must write their 
own wrappers using occam-pi's foreign function interface, which can be tedious and 
time consuming. SWIG offers automatic generation of wrappers for libraries written in 
C and C++, allowing access to these for the target languages supported by SWIG. This 
paper describes the occam-pi module for SWIG, which will allow automatic wrapper 
generation for occam-pi, and will ensure that occam-pi's library base can be grown 
in a quick and efficient manner. Access to database, graphics and hardware interfacing 
libraries can all be provided with relative ease when using SWIG to automate the bulk 
of the work.},
