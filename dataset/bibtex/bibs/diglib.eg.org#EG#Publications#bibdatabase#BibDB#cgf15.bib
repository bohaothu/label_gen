   annote = {The motion of a human platform diver was simulated
using a dynamic model and a control system. The dynamic model
has 32 actuated degrees of freedom and dynamic parameters within
the range of those reported in the literature for humans. The
control system uses algorithms for balance, jumping, and
twisting to initiate the dive, sequences of desired values for
proportional-deritvative servos to perform the aerial portion of
the dive, and a state machine to sequence the actions throughout
the dive. The motion of the simulated diver closely resembles
video footage of dives performed by human athletes. The control
and simulation techniques presented in this paper are useful for
providing realistic motion for synthetic actors in computer
animations and virtual environments and may someday be useful
for analysis of sports performance. },

   annote = {Scattered data is, by definition, irregularly
spaced. Uniform surface schemes are not well adapted to the
locally varying nature of such data. Conversely, Triangular
B-Spline surfaces are more flexible in that they can be built
over arbitrary triangulations and thus can be adapted to the
scattered data. This paper discusses the use of {DMS} spline
surfaces for approximation of scattered data. A method is
provided for automatically triangulating the domain containing
the points and generating basis functions over this
triangulation. A surface approximating the data is then found by
a combination of least squares and bending energy minimization.
This combination serves both to generate a smooth surface and to
accommodate for gaps in the data. Examples are presented which
demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for mathematical,
geographical and other data sets. },

facilitating the use of physically based models by animators.
The idea is to let the user guide motion at a high level of
control by giving approximate desired trajectories and
synchronization constraints between the objects over time, while
a simulation module computes the final motion, dealing with
collision detection and response, and enhancing realism. The
objects, which are either isolated or components of an
articulated structure, are guided through the specification of
key-positions and orientations, defined by coordinates that can
be fixed or relative to another object. The animation sequence
is scripted by specifying a graph of synchronization constraints
between objects over time. During the animation, objects
automatically regulate their speed in order to meet these
constraints. },

   annote = {Box splines are a multivariate extension of uniform
univariate B-splines. Direct evaluation of a box spline basis
function can be difficult, but they have a relatively simple
Fourier transform and can therefore be evaluated with an inverse
FFT. Symmetry, recursive evaluation of the coefficients, and
parallelization can be used to improve absolute performance. A
windowing function can also be used to reduce truncation
artifacts. We explore all these options in the context of a
high-performance parallel implementation. Our goal is the
provision of an empirical touchstone for the inverse {FFT}
evaluation of box spline basis functions,for eventual
application to forward projection (splat-based) volume
rendering. },

problem that arises increasingly as new {3D} scanning technology
is able to produce large and complex databases of full {3D}
information. Huge efforts put into segmenting entire sets of {2D}
images demand robust tools that are then able to reconstruct any
arbitrary {3D} surface segmented from the images. In this paper we
propose an algorithmic methodology that automatically produces a
surface from a set of points in R3 about which we have no
topological knowledge. Our method uses a spatial decomposition
and a surface tracking algorithm to produce a rough
approximation S' of the unknown manifold S. The produced surface
\bfS' serves as a robust initialisation for a physically based
modeling technique that yields the fine details of S and so
improves the quality of the reconstruction. },

requirement for a system to support the production of models for
training simulator visual systems and other vislialisation
applications. To reduce the labour involved in generating such
models, it was decided to develop a technique whereby models
could be generated by a high-level language. For these models
there is a requirement to generate 2-D plans showing, for
example, the locations of roads and buildings, subsequently 3-D
models of the buildings are placed at the defined locations. The
2-D plans can be created through the use of the Layout Design
Language (LD-Language). LD-Language has been formulated
particularly for designing urban area street plans. The
primitive elements of the LD-Language, plots, are assembled into
patterns which can be.further combined into a layout plan, with
some support provided by the system. The work reported has
successfully demonstrated that a complex layout plan can he
developed using this language. },

In the second part the connection between individual optical

phenomenological theories of multiple scattering in absorbing
media. Progressively, it appears that pertinent data in
realistic modelling are always in relation with true or

hierarchical meshes - and general visualization routines. It is
based on a procedural approach managing a collection of
arbitrary elements and a set of functions describing each
element type. No mapping of (an in general enormous amount of)
numerical data onto new data structures is necessary; a user may
use his own data structures and only has to provide this small
set of procedures and functions. The visualization tools will
then use these routines to access (temporarily and locally) data
of interest, like information about a single element. Compared
with display routines on a specialized data structure, this
general interface does not produce much cpu overhead. },

volume data include: large-memory overheads, the requirement of
expensive rendering hardware, and high speed processing ability.
The rendering algorithm presented here overcomes these problems
by making use of the efficient Shear-Warp Factorisation method
which does not require specialised graphics hardware. However
the original Shear-Warp algorithm suffers from a high memory
overhead and does not provide for incremental rendering which is
required should rapid user feedback be maintained. Our algorithm
represents the volumetric data using a hierarchical data
structure which providesfor the incremental classfication and
rendering of volume data. This exploits the multiscale nature of
the octree data structure. The algorithm reduces the memory foot
print of the original Shear-Warp Factorisation algorithm by a
factor of more than two, while maintaining good rendering
performance. These factors make our octree algorithm more
suitable for implementation on average desktop workstations for
the purposes of interactive exploration of volume models over a
network. Results from tests using typical volume datasets will
be presented which demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to
achieve high rendering rates for both incremental rendering and

of images is desired. Often this stylized display is
accomplished by the addition of semi-structured artifacts. In
current applications the designer processes the image using

show that the processes of controlled artifact introduction and
half-toning can successfully be combined. By combining these two

intended. We present a brief overview of the current
error-diffusion half-toning techniques. We then propose several
ways in which artifacts can be introduced to the image. This

Using computer graphics, designers can easily compare the effect

due to sky light, however, all calculation must be performed
from scratch if such conditions undergo change. Therefore, to
compare the architectural designs under different conditions, a
great deal of time has to be spent on generating the images.
This paper proposes a new method of quickly generating images of
an outdoor scene, taking into account glossy specular
reflection, even if such conditions change. In this method,
luminance due to sky light is expressed by a series of basis
functions, and basis luminances corresponding to each basis
function are precalculated and stored in a compressed form in
the preprocess. Once the basis luminances are calculated, the
luminance due to sky light can be quickly calculated by the
weighted sum of the basis luminances. Several examples of an

essence interpolate between shapes. We present here work which
uses a representation of objects as union of circles to define a
distance between two objects and to base a method to interpolate
between the two. This method can be used in a totally automatic
fashion (that is, without any user intervention), or users can
guide a pre-registration phase as well as a segmentation phase,
after which the matched segments are interpolated pair-wise. The
union of circles representation of the two objects is obtained
from the Delaunay triangulation of their boundary points. The
circles can be simplified to obtain smaller data sets. The
circles are then optimally matched according to a distance
metric between circles which is a function of their position,
size, and feature, that is, a local configuration of circles.
The interpolation between the two objects is then obtained by
interpolating between the matched pairs of circles (the
interpolations can be affine or non-affine). Examples with
simple and more complex objects show how the technique can give
results which correspond closely to the human notion of shape
interpolation. The interpolations shown include some between a
calf and a cow and between a cow and a giraffe. The examples

Eventually, we characterize the intermediate distance and field
functions; we describe a set of interpolation methods and
propose to use a restricted class of parametrized distance and
field functions so as to preserve coherence and speed-up
computations. We show that we can easily extend those results to
achieve a B{\'{e}}zier like metamorphosis where control points
are replaced by control soft objects; in this scope, we have
adapted existing accelerated techniques that build a
B{\'{e}}zier transformation from a set of convex polyhedra to
any kind of convex polygonal shapes. Eventually, we point out
that matching all components of the initial and the final shapes
generates amorphous intermediate shapes based on an overwhelming

constant volume deformation, displacement constraints (fixed or

is described by a set of mass points on its contour. The
evolution algorithm runs in two phases dealing successively with
forces and constraints (which are presented as reaction forces).
The main contribution of the method is the control of object
volumes during evolution. We define a function that explicitly
gives the inside volume of an object in order to use it as a
constraint. Thus, the volume can be kept exactly constant during

Modeling by direct manipulation of the control points is a
tedious task. In particular, it is very difficult to maintain a
generally pleasant looking surface shape. It becomes therefore
increasingly important to build tools that allow the designer to
specify only a few geometric constraints while automatically
determining the explicit representation of the surface. The
basic concept of such a tool is simple. In a first step one has
to somehow measure the &quot;fairness&quot; (=quality) of a surface. Once
this is achieved, an optimization process selects the one
surface with optimal fairness from all surfaces satisfying the
user specified geometric constraints. To measure the fairness,
thin plate energy functionals [deleted] are a good choice.
However, for interactive use these functionals are far too
complex. We will present appropriate approximations to these
functionals that allow an optimization nearly in real time. The
functionals are obtained by introducing reference surfaces thus
leading to data dependent, quadratic approximations to the exact
thin plate energy functionals. We apply the method to
interactive surface manipulations based on energy constraints.

changes of surface normal, the curvature variation of the
surface, which represents the change of the surface normal,
should be smooth and distributed as designers want. The proposed
method controls curvature distribution directly by determining a
surface shape from an evolute, which is a locus of the curvature
center of the generatrix and moves along directrices to form the
surface. It first generates evolutes of boundary curves to be
generatrices as rational B{\'{e}}zier curves, then interpolates
their shapes with the B{\'{e}}zier polygons, and locates the

registered with head-tracked stereo viewing can be applied to

configuration, a six degree-of-freedom head-tracker and
CrystalEyes shutter glasses are used to produce stereo images
that dynamically follow the user head motion. {3D} virtual objects
can be made to appear at a fixed location in physical space
which the user may view from different angles by moving his
head. To construct {3D} animated characters, the user interacts
with the simulated environment using both hands simultaneously:
the left hand, controlling a Spaceball, is used for {3D}
navigation and object movement, while the right hand, holding a
3D mouse, is used to manipulate through a virtual tool metaphor
the objects appearing in front of the screen. In this way, both
incremental and absolute interactive input techniques are
provided by the system. Hand-eye coordination is made possible
by registering virtual space exactly to physical space, allowing
a variety of complex {3D} tasks necessary for constructing {3D}
animated characters to be performed more easily and more rapidly
than is possible using traditional interactive techniques. The
system has been tested using both Polhemus Fastrak and Logitech
ultrasonic input devices for tracking the head and {3D} mouse.

limitations in the case of moving objects. One of the main

with a method in {2D} for polygonal scenes rising the visibility
complex. It is a powerful data structure representing the
visibility relationships between objects in the plane. We have
developed and implemented an algorithm which uses this structure
to efficiently compute the discontinuity mesh and the form
factors for static scenes. We also propose an extension to our

static scenes, because they include a heavy preprocessing stage
that constructs a spatial data structure which relies on the
model objects' positions. Any changes to the scene geometry
might cause significant modifications to this data structure. We
show how these algorithms may be adapted to dynamic scenes. Two
main ideas are used: first, update the spatial data structure to
reflect the dynamic objects' current positions: make this update
efficient by restricting it to a small part of the data
structure. Second, use temporal bounding volumes (TBVS) to avoid
having to consider every dynamic object in each frame. The
combination of these techniques yields efficient,
output-sensitive visibility algorithms for scenes with multiple
dynamic objects. The performance of our methods is shown to be
significantly better than previous output-sensitive algorithms,
intendedfor static scenes. TBVs can be adapted to applications
where no prior knowledge of the objects' trajectories is
available, such as virtual reality (VR), simulations etc.
Furthermore, they save updates of the scene model itself notjust
of the auxiliary data structure used by the visibility
algorithm. They can therefore be used to greatly reduce the
communications overhead in client-server {VR} systems, as well as
in general distributed virtual environments. Proceedings of

in converting typefaces from outline representations to PTRs.
The extracted typographic elements include serifs, bars, stems,
slants, bows, arcs, curve stems and curve bars. Most notable is
the treatment of serifs, which are represented by
finite-automata. The algorithm only needs to learn a serif type
once, and is then capable of automatically recognizing it in
different typefaces. We show an application of a {PTR} for
automatic high-quality hinting of fonts, which is one of the

fogous, dolmens, chamber tombs, stone alignments or circles. The
description of such a site is done in two stages : during the
first stage, a draft of the site is drawn, each stone being
represented by its bounding box. The second stage allows the
user to describe the content of the boxes (the stones). To
describe fogous and chamber tombs, basic models of these
monuments are used. These basic types are simplified
representations of the monunients (walls only). The models can
be modified by changing the dimensions and locations of the
walls and by cutting the initial walls into individual stones.
The definition of stone alignments or circles calls for the use
of a one-dimensional position vocabulary (along simple geometric
primitives or curves). The different elements (alignments,
circles, fogous, and chamber tombs) are then combined to obtain
the draft of the site. A two-dimensional vocabulary allowing to
position the elements in the site is used. The paper is
illustrated with examples obtained with the developed software.

well-known traditional procedural methods use generally a
simplified mathematical model of a natural texture. No reliable
way for the choice of the mathematical model parameters, which
characterise directly the produced {3D} texture, is given.
Therefore, {3D} texture generation becomes a more or less
experimental process with these methods. Our recently published
method for an automatic {3D} texture generation avoids this
problem by the use of the spectral analysis of one {2D} model
texture. The resulting {3D} texture is of good quality but one
open problem remains: the aspect of the produced texture cannot
be fully controlled over the entire {3D} space by only one {2D}
spectral analysis. This may be considered as a serious
limitation for some kinds of textures representing important
variations in any direction. In this paper we present a new and
more powerful analytical approach for an automatic {3D} texture
generation. Contrarily to our previous method, this new approach
is not exclusively based on the spectral analysis of only one {2D}
model It uses two or three {2D} models corresponding to different
slices of a {3D} texture block, so, the aspect of the produced {3D}

To solve this problem, we encapsulate necessary information for

is definied as a cluster or clusters of triangles. Whenever a
scene updates, the radiosity algorithm looks tip the prestored
information in each object, thus speeding itself up by two
orders of magnitude. Besides, solution time based on cluster
representatives is linear to the number of objects since each
object is reusable, encapsulated with preprocessed data in every
level of hierarchy. We also analyze the unregarded error on
visibility estimation and propose a statistically optimal
adaptive algorithm to maintain the same error for each link.

irregular objects known through a few planar polygonal
cross-sections. This problem is considered difficult when severe
topology and morphology variations appear between neighbouring
cross-sections (multi-branching, holes, disconnected areas).
Only few methods deal with this problem in a systematic way. The
paper describes an original method allowing to build, in a fully
automatic and systematic way, an external surface with a valid
topology in any case. It moreover allows to adjust details of
the reconstructed surface in view of the morphologies and
topologies of the various initial cross-sectional contours. At
first, a global correspondence is operated between each couple
of adjacent cross-sections by extracting polygonal areas of
difference. Next steps are based on the computation in each area
of difference of the bisector network, a well-defined simplified
generalised Voronoi diagram. This structure is used both for
connecting initial contour points and for interpolating new
intermediate portions of contours. It depends on the complexity
of initial {2D} shapes. Interpolation stage is then recursively
operated until a satisfactory surface has been obtained or until
a maximum number of new intermediate cross-sectional contours
have been built. The valid final surface is directly obtained by
concatenating all the tiling areas of difference without need of
any post processing step. The processing of several real data
related to geological bodies or human organs has proved that the
described method allows detailed modelling of irregular objects
with verv performing {CPU} times. The reconstruction appears
insensitive to severe variations of the object shape, including
apparitions of holes or disconnections. Proceedings of

i.e. the distance from the origin). Exact answers to all

tight limit on the number of bits necessary for performing
intermediate calculations is achieved by expressing all of the
topological decisions based on geometric computations in terms
qf the signs of 4 by 4 determinants of the input coefficients.
The coordinates of intersection vertices are not required for
making the correct topological decisions and hence vertices and

presentation architecture that allows the application to
describe the structure of the {CAD}/CAM presentation. This
architecture provides a unified interface to drawings, views,

an external geometric modeler, while isolating applications from

irradiance, and reflectance over textured surfaces. This

surfaces, but unlike previous algorithms, the orientations of
surfaces inside each cluster are accounted for in both the error
