  abstract =	 {The new generation astronomy digital archives cover large area of the
sky at fine resolution in many wavelengths from ultraviolet through
optical and infrared. For instance, one of these projects the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey is creating a detailed catalog covering more than a
quarter of the sky with images measured with five different
filters. The size of the data set can be measured in terabytes. These
archives enable astronomers to explore the data for their
research. However, virtually walking through these huge data sets also
enables to visualize the beauty of the Universe and raises problems
which can be interesting for people related to computer graphics. In
this paper we present a technique for parallel visualization of large-scale scattered
astrophysical data that has wide-spectrum photometric property. Our
method performs sort-last parallel particle rendering using
hierarchical, static data distribution; and its performance scales up
linearly by increasing the number of the rendering nodes. It also
enables setting the color matching function in the rendering phase and
as well as altering the distance calculation formulae that calculates
spatial coordinates from the redshift -- all interactively.},
