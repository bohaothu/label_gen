                          abstract = {Although it is well documented that the perinatal period is the most dangerous time of life, the last 50 years have seen dramatic falls in both perinatal and maternal mortality.  The most significant factor behind this has been the steady increase in the amount and effectiveness of technological interventions in the management of labour.  However recent years have also seen dramatic changes in the responsibilities within maternity care teams and the role of the woman in decision-making.  This has resulted in a shift in the attitudes towards intervention due to a desire to return to more natural birth situations.  This paper outlines the results of a psychometric risk perception tool distributed to consultants and midwives in a high technology maternity unit and 'home-away-from-home' non-intervention unit in Scotland.  The aim of this work is to examine how underlying risk perceptions and attitudes towards technology are linked to organisational culture and what benefit this knowledge has in order to better understand issues surrounding the acceptance and use of technology in obstetric healthcare.
