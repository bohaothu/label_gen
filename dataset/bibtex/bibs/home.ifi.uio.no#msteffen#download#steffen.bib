		  We introduce underspecified transition systems (UTSs) as
		  general model general model for underspecification, where,
		  e.g., transitions point to sets of states. We argue for the
		  generality of the UTSs by showing that the class of all
		  UTSs is strictly more expressive than the standard
		  equivalences and simulation approaches, in the sense that
		  more sets of transition systems can be expressed.
		  Additionally, a characteristic formula in terms of the

		  Furthermore, we show that UTSs can finitely describe sets
		  of transition systems, whenever they can be described

  abstract	= "The calculus of higher-order subtyping, known as
		  $F_\leq^\omega$, a higher-order polymorphic
		  $\lambda$-calculus with subtyping, is expressive enough to
		  serve as core calculus for typed object-oriented languages.
		  The versions considered in the literature usually support
		  only pointwise subtyping of type operators, where two types
		  $S\ U$ and $T\ U$ are in subtype relation, if $S$ and $T$
		  are. In the widely cited, unpublished
		  note~\cite{cardelli:notes}, Cardelli presents
		  $F_\leq^\omega$ in a more general form going beyond
		  pointwise subtyping of type applications in distinguishing
		  between monotone and antimonotone operators. Thus, for
		  instance, $T\ U_1$ is a subtype of $T\ U_2$, if $U_1\leq
		  U_2$ and $T$ is a monotone operator.
		  
		  My thesis extends $F_\leq^\omega$ by polarized application,
		  it explores its proof theory, establishing decidability of
		  polarized $F_\leq^\omega$. The inclusion of polarized
		  application rules leads to an interdependence of the
		  subtyping and the kinding system. This contrasts with pure
		  $F_\leq^\omega$, where subtyping depends on kinding but not
		  vice versa. To retain decidability of the system, the
		  equal-bounds subtyping rule for all-types is rephrased in
		  the polarized setting as a mutual-subtype requirement of
		  the upper bounds.",

		  the Java program level. Though using directly the
		  programming language may facilitate acceptance by software
		  developers at first sight, the entailed syntax noise
		  sometimes distracts from the actual test specification,
		  speaking about interaction traces.
		  
		  We propose a Java-like test specification language, which
		  allows to describe the behavior of the test harness in
		  terms of the expected interaction \emph{traces} between the
		  program and its environment. The language is tailor-made
		  for Java, e.g., in that it reflects the nested calls and
		  return structure of thread-based interaction at the
		  interface. From a given trace specification, a testing
		  environment, i.e., a set of classes for mock objects, is
		  \emph{synthesized}.
		  
		  The design of the specification language is a careful
		  balance between two goals: using programming constructs in
		  Java-like notation helps the programmer to specify the
		  interaction without having to learn a completely new
		  specification notation. On the other hand,
		  \emph{additional} expressions in the specification language
		  allow to specify the desired trace behavior in a concise,
		  abstract way, hiding the intricacies of the required
		  synchronization code at the lower-level programming
		  language. "

		  number of states may grow exponentially with the number of
		  processes in a parallel composition. Especially for systems
		  that communicate asynchronously, the queues contribute to a
		  combinatorial explosion of the state space.
		  
		  In this paper we use constraints to represent states in
		  enumerative model checking. This reduces the state space by
		  merging states that differ only in the data in the queue.
		  In contrast to abstraction, this method is exact, i.e.,
		  only the truly reachable states are considered. The
		  representation with constraints has advantages for systems
		  whose behavior is influenced by random data, such as open
		  systems. To substantiate its benefits, is is compared to
		  the standard representation of states with concrete values

  abstract	= "Combining discrete state-machines with continuous
		  behavior, hybrid systems are a well-established
		  mathematical model for discrete systems acting in a
		  continuous environment. As a priori \emph{infinite} state
		  systems, their computational properties are undecidable in
		  the general model and the main line of research
		  concentrates on model checking of finite abstractions of
		  restricted subclasses of the general model. In our work, we
		  use \emph{deductive methods}, falling back upon the
		  general-purpose theorem prover PVS.
		  
		  To do so we extend the classical approach for the
		  verification of state-based programs by developing an
		  inductive proof method to deal with the parallel
		  composition of hybrid systems. The methods cover shared
		  variable communication, label-synchronization, and
		  especially the common continuous activities in the parallel
		  composition of hybrid automata. Besides hybrid systems and
		  their parallel composition, we formalized their operational
		  step semantics and a number of proof-rules within PVS, for
		  one of which we give also a rigorous completeness proof.
		  Moreover, the theory is applied to the verification of a
		  number of examples."

		  based on tree-like structures. Efficiency, indispensable in
		  large distributed databases, is achieved by admitting
		  internal concurrency. Concurrent operations behave
		  correctly when they conform with the observable
		  I/O-behaviour of their sequential counterparts.
		  
		  The correct design of concurrent search structures has also
		  been proposed and studied in an object-based language
		  setting. There, concurrent versions are derived from
		  correctly specified sequential ones by means of
		  \emph{program transformation.} In order to formally prove
		  the correctness of such transformations, both an
		  operational semantics at the object level and an underlying
		  process calculus semantics have been explored.
		  
		  In both the database and the object-based language
		  approaches to the correct design of concurrent search
		  structures, the crucial point is the formalisation of an
		  acceptable correctness criterion. In this paper, we use the
		  underlying process calculus semantics of the object-based
		  approach in order to formalise a notion of correctness, as
		  motivated from the database view on concurrent search
		  structures, and show its application to a known example
		  program transformation."

		  systems of message-passing processes, because such
		  properties have proved to be useful for a variety of
		  applications, ranging from reasoning about concurrent
		  objects to mobile and high-speed telecommunication
		  protocols. Roughly, confluence means that for every two
		  computations starting from a common system state, it is
		  possible to continue the computations, so to reach a common
		  state again. In order to prove confluence for a given
		  system, we are required to demonstrate that for all states
		  reachable by computation from the starting state, the
		  'owing together' of possible computations is possible. In
		  this paper, we aim at proving confluence properties for
		  concurrent systems without having to generate all reachable
		  states. Instead, we use a type system that supports a
		  static analysis of possible sources of non-confluence. In
		  message-passing systems, confluence is invalidated whenever
		  two processes compete for communication with another
		  process. We may statically check the occurrence of such
		  situations by reducing them to the concurrent access on a
		  shared communication port. For the technical development,
		  we focus on the setting of a polarized pi-calculus, where
		  we formalize the notion of port-uniqueness by means of
		  overlapping-free context-redex decompositions. We then
		  present a type system for port-uniqueness that, taking
		  advantage of a subject reduction property, yields a
		  succicnt criterion for guaranteeing confluence.}
