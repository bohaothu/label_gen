                  satisfies Laplace's equation, so one can compute a

                  surface of a body to impose the boundary
                  condition. Brazier-Smith shows that when the
                  boundary is not a sphere, boundary collocation with
                  spherical harmonics may fail because of
                  singularities of the soluhon inside the

                  the smallest sphere which is free of singularities
                  -- including singularities inside a non-spherical
                  body. Boundary collocation is guaranteed to work if
                  one uses Laplace solutions tailored to the body

                  models with the same number of points after
                  filtering (the dealiased code uses $(3/2) N$ points

                  considerably worse than dealiased modes when

                  value of the (singular) integral. Weideman shows
                  that a set of complex-valued orthogonal functions,
