  abstract = {{O}bjectives {R}esearch on men who have sex with men ({MSM}) in sub-{S}aharan {A}frica was neglected for a long time. {T}he objective of this study was to understand factors associated with unprotected anal intercourse ({UAI}) with male partners among a group of {MSM} living in the city of {D}ouala, {C}ameroon. {M}ethods {I}n 2008, a survey on the sexual activity and practices of {MSM} was set up in {D}ouala in collaboration with a local community-based organisation. {D}ata were collected among a convenience sample of 168 {MSM} during face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers. {R}esults {A} total of 142 individuals reported sexual activity during the previous 6 months, among whom 80 (57%) reported {UAI} with male partners. {I}n a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for the frequency of sexual intercourse, not having had access to prevention interventions and not knowing any {HIV}-infected person were both independently associated with a higher risk of {UAI}. {O}ther factors associated with this higher risk included having had a stable male partnership at some point in one's life and not having been out of {D}ouala for more than 4 weeks during the previous year. {C}onclusions {T}his community-based research is the first study of {MSM} in {C}ameroon and the {HIV} transmission risks they face. {R}esults show the importance of {HIV} prevention interventions from peers, and underline the need to maintain efforts to develop specific interventions targeting {MSM} more efficiently in the {A}frican context.},
