Abstract = {{The conservation of wildlife populations living adjacent to roads is
   gaining international recognition as a worldwide concern. Populations
   living in road-impacted environments are influenced by spatial
   parameters including the amount and arrangement of suitable habitat.
   Similarly, heterogeneity in threatening processes can act at a variety
   of spatial scales and be crucial in affecting population persistence.
   Common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) are considered both widespread and
   abundant throughout their eastern Australian continental distribution.
   They nevertheless face many threats, primarily human induced. As well
   as impacts from disease and predation by introduced species, high
   roadside fatality rates on many rural roads are frequently reported. We
   parameterized a model for common wombat population viability analysis
   within a 750-km(2) area of the northwestern corner of Kosciuszko
   National Park in New South Wales, Australia, and tested its sensitivity
   to changes in the values of basic parameters. We then assessed the
   relative efficiency of various mitigation measures by examining the
   combined impact from roads, disease and predation on wombat
   subpopulation persistence in the area. We constructed a
   stage-structured and spatially explicit model incorporating estimates
   of survival and fecundity parameters for each of the identified
   subpopulations using RAMAS GIS. Estimates of current threatening
   processes suggest mitigating road-kill is the most effective management
   solution. Results highlight the importance of recognizing the interplay
   between various threats and how their combination has the capacity to
   drive local depletion events.}},

   emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are
   not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most

Abstract = {{The organization of neutral genetic variation has long been used as a
   diagnostic tool to infer demographic properties of populations, and
   recently it has been shown that this information can also be used to
   estimate the magnitude of genetic deterioration in small or fragmented
   populations. A further step of this research is to assess whether
   neutral genetic indicators can serve to predict and compare the
   viabilities of endangered species. I use modeling to explore how
   ecological metapopulation settings are related to neutral genetic
   indicators (such as the fixation index {[}F-ST]), changes in genetic
   load, and metapopulation viability. The analysis indicates that genetic
   indicators are generally strongly and consistently correlated with the
   genetic load, population size and structure, and time of extinction but
   identifies two potential limitations for their use in viability
   assessments. First, the regime of environmental perturbations is not
   accurately reflected by neutral indicators, so that their predictive
   power may be reduced in variable environments. Second, many species are
   threatened by recent human-induced changes of their habitat
   configuration. In most cases, genetic indicators may not have reached
   their equilibrium value in the altered habitat, which limits their
   ability to compare species with heterogeneous histories and
   life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{Fish commonly respond to stress, including stress from chemical
   exposures, with reduced growth. However, the relevance to wild
   populations of subtle and sometimes transitory growth reductions may
   not be obvious. At low-level, sustained exposures, Cu is one substance
   that commonly causes reduced growth but little mortality in laboratory
   toxicity tests with fish. To explore the relevance of growth reductions
   under laboratory conditions to wild populations, we (1) estimated
   growth effects of low-level Cu exposures to juvenile Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), (2) related growth effects to reduced
   survival in downriver Chinook salmon migrations, (3) estimated
   population demographics, (4) constructed a demographically structured

   growth on population size, extinction risks, and recovery chances.
   Reduced juvenile growth from Cu in the range of chronic criteria

Abstract = {{The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is one of Africa's most endangered
   species and therefore classified as endangered by IUCN. Earlier
   distributions included most of Africa but currently the African wild
   dog only has populations larger than 300 individuals in three countries
   (Botswana, Tanzania and South Africa). In 1998, a plan was launched in
   South Africa to manage sub-populations of the African wild dog in
   several small, geographically isolated, conservation areas. This
   management program involved the reintroduction of wild dogs into
   suitable conservation areas and periodic translocations among them. We
   used the stochastic population simulation model VORTEX to evaluate the
   Limpopo Valley Conservancy in the north of South Africa, as a possible
   reintroduction site for African wild dogs. The simulations showed that
   the size of the initial population released only had a small effect on
   the population dynamics. However, when individuals were supplemented
   and harvested over a longer period the probability of persistence
   increased. Number of females breeding, male mortality, and carrying
   capacity were key factors in the population dynamics, but according to
   VORTEX the severity of natural catastrophes had the greatest influence
   on the extinction risk and inbreeding. We suggest that the
   reintroduction program may be successful, if areas are properly
   secured, the dogs are held in a boma before release, wild animals or at
   least a mix of wild and captive animals are used for the release and
   the animals are vaccinated against rabies. It is, however, essential to
   continue monitoring followed by modelling efforts to re-evaluate the
   success of the reintroduction program. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{``Wicked{''} problems are those that are complex and that change when
   solutions are applied. Many conflicts in conservation fall into this
   category. The study approached the problem of how to constrain the
   apparent wickedness of a problem in the conservation management of a
   species by using simple empirical indicators to carry out iterative
   assessment of the risk to a population and to document how this risk
   evolves in relation to the addition of new data and the implementation
   of management actions. Effects of high levels of uncertainty within
   data and also concerning population structure were examined through
   stochastic simulation and by exploration of scenarios. Historical
   trends in the example used, the Steller sea lion, showed rapid declines
   in abundance in some regions during the 19805. The current total
   population is 130,000-150,000 Steller sea lions through Alaska and
   British Columbia and this number has been stable since about 1990 in
   spite of regional differences in population dynamics. Regional
   differences in the sequence of changes in the number of pups and
   non-pups, suggested that an internal re-distribution of juveniles could
   have happened between 1980 and 1990. Current productivity also appears
   close to the long-term mean. Stochastic population projection using
   various scenarios showed that, based upon this history, the risk of
   extinction for the population has declined and is below reasonable
   thresholds for considering the population to be endangered. The trends
   in risk suggest that management actions taken since 1990 have probably
   been effective. Consequently, the conservation management objectives
   for the Steller sea lion are probably being met. The approach provides
   a mechanism, based upon experience and scenario analysis, for exploring
   future policy options and may help to constrain the debate amongst
   stakeholders about the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with
   different options. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction and predation by invasive alien species has led to
   the disappearance of several island populations of Darwin's finches but

   During 2006-2009, we assessed its population status and monitored
   nesting success, both before and after rat poisoning. Population size
   was estimated at around only 100 birds for the two main breeding sites,
   with possibly 5-10 birds surviving at a third mangrove. Before rat
   control, 54 per cent of nests during incubation phase were predated

   nest predation during the incubation phase fell to 30 per cent with 37
   per cent of nests producing fledglings. During the nestling phase,
   infestation by larvae of the introduced parasitic fly (Philornis

Abstract = {{In a global literature review, 46 empirical regressions on home ranges
   and geographic ranges were collected, covering thousands of species

   key population patches of 167 species occurring in the Netherlands were
   retrieved from reports. To check consistency, a theoretical model was
   derived from rate and density variables based on energy equivalency.
   The minimum number of individuals needed to sustain a viable population
   was considered invariant to size. According to the equations, areas
   were expected to scale to mass with an exponent of 1 for the individual
   home range and of about 3/4 for the minimum population ranges.
   The meta-analysis of the empirical regressions showed that average
   slopes for individual home ranges were between 0.74 for cold-blooded
   species and 1.05 for birds and mammals. Minimum and average species
   geographic range scaled to mass with exponents of 1.16-1.29 and
   0.28-0.46 respectively. Allometric correlations for the minimum key
   patch area were weak. The intercepts indicated that carnivores require
   more space than equally sized herbivores, while homeotherms occupy
   larger areas than heterotherms. Observed slopes and intercepts were
   often near model estimations, but important deviations from the average
   level were noted as well, especially for birds.
   Although variability was substantial in some cases, allometric
   approaches can contribute considerably to understanding and protecting

Abstract = {{European bison (Bison bonasus) became extinct in the wild at the

   was founded by seven individuals that survived in captivity. The
   largest population of Lowland bison live in the Bialowieza Forest, but
   the forest and the population are divided by a border fence between
   Poland and Belarus. This fence is a barrier to the movement of
   ungulates. In this study, we used population genetic models to predict
   the future viability of the Polish and Belarusian bison populations. We
   determined the founder contribution, founder equivalent, mean
   inbreeding coefficient, mean kinship, and the proportion of genetic
   diversity retained in the Belarusian bison population. Although the
   founding group of the Belarusian population was larger than that of the
   Polish population, the latter had more favourable genetic parameters.
   We assessed inbreeding depression for fecundity in free-ranging
   European bison compared to captive individuals. Using population
   viability analysis (PVA) we modelled both bison populations with or
   without gene exchange, and with or without incorporating the kinship of
   the founders. When founder kinship was included, in both populations
   the mean number of alleles and the gene diversity retained within
   extant populations decreased substantially compared to PVA models in
   which founders were not related. The worst genetic parameters were
   obtained for the Belarusian population under a scenario in which the
   founders are related and gene exchange is lacking, which is the closest
   to the real situation. Creation of passages for animals by partial
   removal of the border fence would have a favourable effect on the

Abstract = {{In this study, we performed a population viability analysis on 3
   domestic horse breeds (Equus caballus) of Danish origin, namely, the
   Frederiksborg, the Knabstrupper, and the Jutland breeds. Because of
   their small population sizes, these breeds are considered endangered.
   The Vortex software simulation package was used for the population
   viability analysis. First, we investigated the future viability of
   these breeds based on present demographic and environmental parameters.
   Second, a sensitivity analysis revealed the most important variables
   for the viability of these breeds. Third, we examined management
   scenarios in which one of the studbooks was closed. According to the
   Vortex analysis, 2 of the breeds (Knabstrupper and Jutland) will
   persist for the next 200 yr, whereas the smaller breed (Frederiksborg)
   could become extinct within 40 yr. The sensitivity analyses indicated
   that the variables concerning reproduction of the mares had the
   greatest impact, with the number of mares actively breeding being the
   most influential on the population forecasts. The results suggest that
   closing the Knabstrupper studbooks can be done only if increasing the
   number of mares actively breeding counteracts the loss of genetic
   variation attributable to such a management strategy. It is
   recommended, based on these results, that the number of Frederiksborg
   and Knabstrupper mares actively breeding must be increased to
   approximately 30\% in the 2 breeds that are presently using only 13\%,
   while leaving the third (Frederiksborg) at its present 30\% level.
   Monitoring of the breeds in the future, however, may be exploited to
   adjust the breeding strategies. We suggest that the large amount of
   data required by Vortex makes it very useful for analyzing domestic
   animals because of the comprehensive data material often available. The
   results of this analysis accord with other studies on the Prezwalski
   horse, indicating robustness in the parameter sensitivity for horses.}},

   the probability of identity and genotype mismatch frequencies suggested
   that between five and seven highly informative loci were sufficient to

Abstract = {{Broad-scale declines in populations of bull trout Salvelinus
   confluentus over the past century or more led the Idaho Department of
   Fish and Game to implement statewide no-harvest regulations on bull
   trout in 1994 and ultimately led to a threatened listing under the U.S.
   Endangered Species Act in 1998. Despite this listing, quantitative
   evaluations of trends in abundance and estimates of population size
   over most of the species' historical range have not been made. We
   evaluated bull trout distribution, abundance, and trends in abundance
   using stratified sampling extrapolations of fish surveys (snorkeling
   and electrofishing) conducted at 2,521 survey sites (most distributed
   nonrandomly) across 77,447 km of stream. Bull trout were captured at
   887 (35\%) of the sites. Within the 262 local populations designated by
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within seven Idaho recovery units,
   the number of 70-mm total length and larger bull trout was estimated at
   1.13 million; this estimate was most likely biased low due to sampling
   limitations. Long-term (>20 years) intrinsic rates of change (r) were
   negative for 10 of 16 bull trout populations up to 1994 (3 were
   significantly negative; I was significantly positive) and were positive
   for 14 of 17 populations after 1994 (1 was significantly negative; 5
   were significantly positive). Over the entire period of record and all
   trend data sets, r averaged 0.01 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- 90\% confidence
   interval), suggesting stability at a broad scale. During these same
   time periods, trends for other salmonids in much of the study area
   experienced similar declines through 1994 and increases after 1994,
   suggesting that environmental factors with influence over large
   geographical areas produced the recent positive trends. Once bull trout
   populations were detrended by use of linear regression residuals, there
   was little evidence of synchrony between populations. Our results
   suggest that despite declines from historical levels, bull trout in
   Idaho are presently widely distributed, relatively abundant, and

Abstract = {{Tradable biodiversity credit systems provide flexible means to resolve
   conflicts between development and conservation land-use options for
   habitats occupied by threatened or endangered species. We describe an
   approach to incorporate the influence of habitat fragmentation into the
   conservation value of tradable credits. Habitat fragmentation decreases
   gene flow, increases rates of genetic drift and inbreeding, and
   increases probabilities of patch extinction. Importantly, tradable
   credit systems will change the level of fragmentation over time for
   small and/or declining populations. We apply landscape equivalency
   analysis (LEA), a generalizable, landscape-scale accounting system that
   assigns conservation value to habitat patches based on patch
   contributions to abundance and genetic variance at landscape scales. By
   evaluating habitat trades using two models that vary the relationship
   between dispersal behaviors and landscape patterns, we show that LEA
   provides a novel method for limiting access to habitat at the
   landscape-scale, recognizing that the appropriate amount of migration
   needed to supplement patch recruitment and to offset drift and
   inbreeding will vary as landscape pattern changes over time. We also
   found that decisions based on probabilities of persistence alone would
   ignore changes in migration, genetic drift, and patch extinction that
   result from habitat trades. The general principle of LEA is that
   habitat patches traded should make at least equivalent contributions to
   rates of recruitment and migration estimated at a landscape scale.
   Traditional approaches for assessing the ``take{''} and ``jeopardy{''}
   standards under the Endangered Species Act based on changes in
   abundance and probability of persistence may be inadequate to prevent
   trades that increase fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We formalize the establishment process for a sexual, semelparous

   formulation of an analytical probability distribution for the next

Abstract = {{Captive breeding has become globally important in endangered species
   recovery, yet it is fraught with problems such as maintenance of

   population dynamics of a captive population of endangered Columbia
   Basin pygmy rabbits Brachylagus idahoensis, from 2003 to 2007, to
   evaluate its potential for supporting reintroduction and recovery of
   wild extirpated populations in shrub-steppe ecosystems of eastern
   Washington, USA. We developed stochastic population viability analysis
   models in Vortex and RAMAS to assess performance and surplus production
   of the captive population. This pygmy rabbit population has low adult
   survival beyond 1 year and dependency on high juvenile recruitment for
   population growth. Low juvenile survival and high variability in
   stochastic growth rates result in high variability in annual
   productivity. Our analysis showed that the captive population at n=75
   cannot sustain a steady annual harvest of >= 30 rabbits for
   reintroduction and supplementation without increasing the risk of
   quasi-extinction (n=30) to 59\%. We conducted sensitivity analysis on
   maternity, carrying capacity and survival rates to identify critical
   values for model parameters that would lower extinction risk to the
   captive population when used as a source of rabbits for reintroduction.
   Increasing juvenile survival and recruitment into the first breeding
   class is the most effective method for enhancing the breeding program.

Abstract = {{The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
   Threatened Species was increasingly used during the 1980s to assess the
   conservation status of species for policy and planning purposes. This
   use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria
   for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered,
   endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be
   applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader
   system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by
   IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by
   conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one
   indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity
   2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical
   background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to
   fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and
   extinction. But given major differences between species, the
   threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge
   relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and
   flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The
   system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and
   uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and
   decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it
   meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The
   criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are
   intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its
   categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect
   the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In
   particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty,
   poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted
   ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be
   viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the
   development of national red lists need to take account of some
   assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Prioritizing sites for localized mitigation measures, and forecasting
   the effect of interventions on an endangered population, requires an
   understanding of the spatial scales at which threat processes operate.
   Road mortality is among the greatest threats to semi-terrestrial
   freshwater turtles due to the group's life-history traits. Declining
   throughout much of their range, spotted (Clemmys guttata) and
   Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) are exposed to high road
   densities and traffic volumes in the northeastern United States. We
   examine the distribution of roadkill risk for spotted and Blanding's
   turtles at three spatial scales. Tortuosity during upland movements was
   used to predict road-crossing locations at the single-movement scale. A
   gravity model of wetland-to-wetland interactions was then developed to
   identify road mortality hot spots at a broader road segment scale.
   Finally, road-crossing risk was assessed at the scale of focal areas
   that support distinct populations, using a population viability
   analysis to evaluate the consequences of road mortality on resident
   populations. The observed spatial variability of road mortality risk
   was high for single road crossing movements, limiting the effectiveness
   of static mitigation measures conducted at this scale. At the broader
   road segment scale, road mortality hotspots were evident. The
   demographic risk associated with roads varied widely among discrete
   populations, with probabilities of extinction over 100-year projections
   reaching 5.1\% for spotted turtles, and 58.8\% for Blanding's turtles.
   We conclude that conservation interventions are most likely to be
   effective in mitigating the effects of road mortality when implemented
   at the road segment and population scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

   over-wintering English population of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo L.
   Because of the damage caused to inland fishery interests by cormorants,
   there was a change in UK government policy in autumn 2004, increasing
   the numbers of birds that can be shot under licence.
   3. A stochastic Monte Carlo annual population model was produced to
   examine the effect of changes to the numbers of birds shot each year.
   Indices of annual population size were converted to population
   estimates and used to determine annual growth rates and strength of
   density dependence.
   4. There is strong evidence for density dependence in the data, which
   suggests the population is currently slightly above carrying capacity,
   with a mean growth rate of 4-6\% per annum. The 1300 birds shot under
   licence in 2004/05 represent about 4.5\% of the English population, and
   if this level of culling continues, the population would be expected to
   decline by 9\% by 2007, compared to the long-term average. The a priori
   preferred model, which included all uncertainty, gave predictions for
   2004/05 and 2005/06 in close agreement with field data.
   5. The model was used to produce short-term population projections,
   with the understanding that Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) will be
   adopted to iteratively update the parameters and model each year,
   feeding back into the numbers of available licences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We recommend the approach used in this
   study of including parameter and structural uncertainty within a single
   model, where possible, with the proportion of iterations that utilize a
   particular structure dependent on the weight of evidence for that
   structure. This will produce results with wider confidence intervals,
   but ensures that the evidence for any particular model is not
   over-interpreted.}},

Abstract = {{The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) is endangered in several parts of
   its distribution, including Belgium, where it occurs mainly in
   artificial habitats. We parameterized a general model for natterjack
   population viability analysis (PVA) and tested its sensitivity to
   changes in the values of basic parameters. Then we assessed the
   relative efficiency of various conservation measures in 2 situations: a
   small isolated population and a system of 4 populations connected by
   rare dispersal movements. We based the population viability analysis on
   a stage-structured model of natterjack population dynamics. We
   parameterized the model in the RAMAS GIS platform with vital rates
   obtained from our own field experience and from published studies.
   Simulated natterjack populations were highly sensitive to habitat
   quality (particularly pond drying), to dispersal from surrounding local
   populations, and to a lesser extent to values of fecundity and survival
   of terrestrial stages. Population trajectories were nearly insensitive
   to initial abundances, carrying capacities, and the frequency of
   extreme climatic conditions. The simulations showed that in habitats
   with highly ephemeral ponds, where premetamorphosis mortality was high,
   natterjack populations nearly always had a very high extinction risk.
   We also illustrated how low dispersal rates (<1 dispersing
   individual/generation) efficiently rescued declining local populations.
   Such source-sink dynamics demonstrate that the identification and
   management of source populations should be a high priority.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical to search for, and to apply, robust generalizations in
   conservation biology as species-specific data on endangered species are
   often limited. While generalizations are common in conservation
   genetics, where processes are treated on the scale of generations, the
   unique population dynamics of species are often stressed in ecology and
   conservation management. Is the apparent uniqueness of population
   attributes partly an artefact of measurement scale? One facet of this
   debate is the question of whether extinction risk scales better to
   years or to generations. To resolve this issue, the extinction risk of
   100 well-studied vertebrate taxa was estimated using stochastic
   computer projections and analyses conducted to determine whether risk
   related better to years or generations. Relative strengths of evidence
   for alternative hypotheses were assessed using information theory.
   Extinction risk, assessed as the population size required for a 90\%
   probability of persistence for 100 years, was strongly related to
   generation length. Conversely, when extinction risk was assessed for a
   fixed number of generations, there was no support for a relationship
   between risk and years. This finding has ramifications for assessing
   and reporting extinction risk because it shows that (1) crucial signals
   for the effective management of threatened species may not be detected
   when risk is measured on a scale of years alone; (2) correcting for
   generation length will allow data from a wider range of species to be
   used as defaults for species with limited data; (3) generational-scale
   tests of factors affecting extinction risk are more powerful than
   year-based ones. We recommend that extinction risk be routinely
   reported on a generational scale, with results on a year scale added
   where warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Stachyurus macrocarpus is a narrowly endemic endangered shrub of which
   only one population remains on Chichi-jima Island (Ogasawara). We
   surveyed its population dynamics and reproductive states for 4 years
   and analyzed the population viability. In a survey of its entire
   distribution range, a total of 87 S. macrocarpus individuals have been
   found and 68 individuals have been confirmed in 2007. Thus, the actual
   population size is estimated to be less than 100 individuals.
   Environmental conditions and the results of a hand-pollination
   experiment suggest that low fruit setting in both sexes (female:
   4.9-11.2\%; hermaphrodite: 0.0\%) may be caused by resource limitation.
   In addition, fruit predation by alien Rattus rattus was observed
   despite the rare fruit setting. The small effective population size
   (23.1-24.6 individuals) and hermaphrodite-biased sex ratio (46
   hermaphrodites:12 females) would increase the risk of extinction. The
   habitat of S. macrocarpus was limited to dense scrubland and forest
   understory, and seedling regeneration was very scarce. During the
   survey period, 19 individuals (21.8\%) were found dead, there were only
   two seedling recruitments, and the annual population growth rate was
   0.979. The lack of occurrence on the south and west slopes and the
   shortness of shrubs in open spaces suggests that S. macrocarpus suffers
   stress from both dryness and frequent typhoons. However, S. macrocarpus
   also exhibited high mortality of shoot in forest understories. These
   findings suggest that the suitable habitat of S. macrocarpus is likely
   to be narrow in Ogasawara. While the recent increase of goat grazing
   has not affected individual mortality, 58.6\% of shoots that had been
   grazed by goats were dead within 2 years. As elasticity analysis had
   shown that larger individuals make a greater contribution to the
   population growth rate, repeated goat grazing would impact the S.
   macrocarpus population in the near future by decreasing the vitality of
   larger individuals. Emergency measures for protecting the shrub from
   goat grazing and reinforcing the population through nursery cultivation
   were proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss is the leading cause of decline in wildlife diversity and
   abundance throughout the world, but its effects on wildlife are not
   always predictable. Matrix population modeling is an increasingly
   common tool used to predict the effects of habitat loss. In spite of
   the growing number of studies using this approach, and its wide use in
   conservation practice, the predictions generated by matrix population
   models are rarely explicitly tested in the field. We compared the
   ability of a suite of spatially explicit demographic matrix models to
   predict the response of white-footed mice to loss of high quality
   habitat at mosaic sites in northeast Connecticut, USA. We tested
   short-term model predictions with landscape scale habitat perturbation
   experiments, including clear-cut logging or prescribed burning of high
   quality habitat at two study sites. Comparison of each model's
   predictions with the observed responses at both sites qualitatively
   supported predictions that perturbation of high quality habitat would
   have negative effects extending into the surrounding landscape. The
   best-supported model assumed that evicted residents of the perturbed
   habitat would successfully resettle in nearby intact habitats, and
   allowed for gradual population recovery in the perturbed habitat.
   Similarly, long-term simulations (20 years) revealed how loss of a
   single habitat could trigger population declines throughout a mosaic
   site. This study shows that careful consideration of model assumptions
   such as those pertaining to resettlement behavior is crucial if
   predictions are to be reliable, and highlights the role of experiments
   for comparing alternative model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Many applied problems in ecology and conservation require prediction,
   and population models are important tools for that purpose. Formerly,
   the majority of predictive population models were based on matrix
   models. As the limitations of classical matrix models have become
   clearer, the use of individual-based models has increased. These models
   use behavioral rules imposed at the level of the individual to
   establish the emergent consequences of those rules at the population
   level. Individual behaviors in such models use an array of different
   rule types, from empirically derived probabilities to long-term fitness
   considerations. There has been surprisingly little discussion of the
   strengths and weaknesses of these different rule types. Here, we
   consider different strategies for modeling individual behaviors,
   together with some problems associated with individual-based models. We
   propose a novel approach based on modeling optimal annual routines.
   Annual routines allow individual behaviors to be predicted over a whole
   annual cycle within the context of long-term fitness considerations.
   Temporal trade-offs between different behaviors are automatically
   included in annual routine models, overcoming some of the primary
   limitations of other individual-based models. Furthermore, as well as
   population predictions, individual behaviors and indices of condition
   are emergent features of annual routine models. We show that these can
   be more sensitive to environmental change than population size,
   offering alternative, repeatable metrics for monitoring population
   status. Annual routine models provide no panacea for the problems of
   data limitations in predictive population modeling. However, as a
   result of their ability to deal with life-history trade-offs, as well
   as their potential for relatively rapid and accurate validation and
   parameterization, we suggest that annual routine models have strong
   potential for predictive population modeling in applied conservation
   settings.}},

   many as six may be at risk. Elasticity and sensitivity analyses suggest
   that population management in most sites should focus on the protection

   predicted a 22\% chance that the population will fall below the

   years. Reintroduction to large prairie sites and prairie restoration
   reduced the chance of falling below the extinction threshold and
   increased the number of subpopulations occupied. Loss of dry prairie

   Sparrow subpopulations increased the probability of falling below the

   options. We found that increasing the amount of prairie habitat,
   especially core habitat, had a strong positive effect on viability. If

   survival estimates of the congeneric Puerto Rican Parrot (A. vittata).
   In minimally disturbed forest, population growth was estimated as
   increasing (lambda = 1.12) while, in disturbed edge habitat, population
   growth was estimated to be in slight decline (lambda = 0.99). Recently,
   two bauxite prospecting licenses were issued for over 60\% of the
   110,000 ha Cockpit Country Conservation Area, which encompasses more
   than 42,000 ha of near-contiguous primary forest and which supports

   suitable habitat for Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and
   facilitate poaching (both of nestlings and adults) via an extensive
   road network. A 2\% decline in annual adult survival caused by the
   above factors would lead to a 50\% decline in a hypothetical population
   of 5000 within 15 years, and a population of less than 100 in 100
   years. Such a prediction is not far-fetched: systematic surveys have

   We modeled patch occupancy and conducted a spatially-explicit

   patches varied over time, occupancy rate has been constant for the last
   30 years, and Indiana swamp rabbits exist as a metapopulation that
   appears to be stable. Metapopulation dynamics were best characterized
   as being stationary, but area was an important factor in extinction
   rates; occupied patches (142 37 ha) were significantly larger (P =
   0.01) than unoccupied patches (79 20 ha). We did not find strong
   support for models with colonization rates as a function of distance to
   neighboring patches, nor was distance to contiguous patches of habitat
   significantly different (P = 0.12) for occupied and unoccupied sites.
   Population viability analysis corroborated our findings based on

   disturbance events such as floods on marble trout population dynamics,
   we performed a PVA under three scenarios: (1) occurrence of both severe

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a widely used set of
   tools for evaluating relative extinction risk and prioritizing
   management options among imperiled populations. While PVA is a widely
   sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population
   viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In
   this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk
   when species interactions contribute significantly to population
   viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories
   of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism,
   parasitism and host-parasitoid interactions) in population viability
   analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first
   evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is
   applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378
   articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted
   a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with
   other species. Most of these PVA's treat a putative species interaction
   as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic
   population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the
   availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting
   species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered.
   Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an
   interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a
   stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create
   time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to
   quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA
   approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation
   with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case
   predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased
   forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct
   more complex PVA's with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are
   rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to

Title = {{Recovery of a US Endangered Fish}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background. More fish have been afforded US Endangered Species Act
   protection than any other vertebrate taxonomic group, and none has been
   designated as recovered. Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)
   occupy large rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North
   America, and the species has been protected by the US Endangered
   Species Act since its enactment. Methodology/Principal Findings. Data
   on the shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River (New York to Albany, NY,
   USA) were obtained from a 1970s population study, a population and fish
   distribution study we conducted in the late 1990s, and a fish
   monitoring program during the 1980s and 1990s. Population estimates
   indicate a late 1990s abundance of about 60,000 fish, dominated by
   adults. The Hudson River population has increased by more than 400\%
   since the 1970s, appears healthy, and has attributes typical for a
   long-lived species. Our population estimates exceed the government and
   scientific population recovery criteria by more than 500\%, we found a
   positive trend in population abundance, and key habitats have remained
   intact despite heavy human river use. Conclusions/Significance.
   Scientists and legislators have called for changes in the US Endangered
   Species Act, the Act is being debated in the US Congress, and the Act
   has been characterized as failing to recover species. Recovery of the
   Hudson River population of shortnose sturgeon suggests the combination
   of species and habitat protection with patience can yield successful
   species recovery, even near one of the world's largest human population
   centers.}},

Title = {{Food web structure and interaction strength pave the way for
   vulnerability to extinction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{249}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-92}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on how food web structure and interactions among
   species affects the vulnerability, due to environmental variability, to
   extinction of species at different positions in model food webs.
   Vulnerability is here not measured by a traditional extinction
   threshold but is instead inspired by the IUCN criteria for endangered
   species: an observed rapid decline in population abundance. Using model
   webs influenced by stochasticity with zero autocorrelation, we
   investigate the ecological determinants of species vulnerability, i.e.
   the trophic interactions between species and food web structure and how
   these interact with the risk of sudden drops in abundance of species.
   We find that (i) producers fulfil the criterion of vulnerable species
   more frequently than other species, (ii) food web structure is related
   to vulnerability, and (iii) the vulnerability of species is greater
   when involved in a strong trophic interaction than when not. We note
   that our result on the relationship between extinction risk and trophic
   position of species contradict previous suggestions and argue that the
   main reason for the discrepancy probably is due to the fact that we
   study the vulnerability to environmental stochasticity and not
   extinction risk due to overexploitation, habitat destruction or
   interactions with introduced species. Thus, we suggest that the
   vulnerability of species to environmental stochasticity may be
   differently related to trophic position than the vulnerability of
   species to other factors.
   Earlier research on species extinctions has looked for intrinsic traits
   of species that correlate with increased vulnerability to extinction.
   However, to fully understand the extinction process we must also
   consider that species interactions may affect vulnerability and that
   not all extinctions are the result of long, gradual reductions in
   species abundances. Under environmental stochasticity (which importance
   frequently is assumed to increase as a result of climate change) and
   direct and indirect interactions with other species some extinctions
   may occur rapidly and apparently unexpectedly. To identify the first
   declines of population abundances that may escalate and lead to
   extinctions as early as possible, we need to recognize which species
   are at greatest risk of entering such dangerous routes and under what
   circumstances. This new perspective may contribute to our understanding
   of the processes leading to extinction of populations and eventually
   species. This is especially urgent in the light of the current
   biodiversity crisis where a large fraction of the world's biodiversity
   is threatened. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A statistical approach to quasi-extinction forecasting}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1182-1198}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Forecasting population decline to a certain critical threshold (the
   quasi-extinction risk) is one of the central objectives of population
   viability analysis (PVA), and such predictions figure prominently in
   the decisions of major conservation organizations. In this paper, we
   argue that accurate forecasting of a population's quasi-extinction risk
   does not necessarily require knowledge of the underlying biological
   mechanisms. Because of the stochastic and multiplicative nature of
   population growth, the ensemble behaviour of population trajectories
   converges to common statistical forms across a wide variety of
   stochastic population processes. This paper provides a theoretical
   basis for this argument. We show that the quasi-extinction surfaces of
   a variety of complex stochastic population processes (including
   age-structured, density-dependent and spatially structured populations)
   can be modelled by a simple stochastic approximation: the stochastic
   exponential growth process overlaid with Gaussian errors. Using
   simulated and real data, we show that this model can be estimated with
   20-30 years of data and can provide relatively unbiased
   quasi-extinction risk with confidence intervals considerably smaller
   than (0,1). This was found to be true even for simulated data derived
   from some of the noisiest population processes (density-dependent
   feedback, species interactions and strong age-structure cycling). A key
   advantage of statistical models is that their parameters and the
   uncertainty of those parameters can be estimated from time series data
   using standard statistical methods. In contrast for most species of
   conservation concern, biologically realistic models must often be
   specified rather than estimated because of the limited data available
   for all the various parameters. Biologically realistic models will
   always have a prominent place in PVA for evaluating specific management
   options which affect a single segment of a population, a single
   demographic rate, or different geographic areas. However, for
   forecasting quasi-extinction risk, statistical models that are based on
   the convergent statistical properties of population processes offer
   many advantages over biologically realistic models.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first meta-analysis of a key measure in conservation
   biology: minimum viable population (MVP) size. Our analysis is based on
   studies published since the early, 1970s, and covers 141 sources and
   212 species (after filtering 529 sources and 2202 species). By
   implementing a unique standardization procedure to make reported MVPs
   comparable, we were able to derive a cross-species frequency
   distribution of MVP with a median of 4169 individuals (95\% CI =
   3577-5129). This standardized database provides a reference set of MVPs
   from which conservation practitioners can generalize the range expected
   for particular species (or surrogate taxa) of concern when demographic
   information is lacking. We provide a synthesis of MVP-related research
   over the past 30 years, and test for'rules of thumb' relating MVP to
   extinction vulnerability using well-known threat correlates such as
   body mass and range decline. We find little support for any plausible
   ecological and life history predictors of MVP, even though correlates
   explain > 50\% of the variation in IUCN threat status. We conclude that
   a species' or population's MVP is context-specific, and there are no
   simple short-cuts to its derivation. However, our findings are
   consistent with biological theory and MVPs derived from abundance time
   series in that the MVP for most species will exceed a few thousand

Abstract = {{The grey partridge became extinct in the province of Siena (central
   Italy) in the late seventies, whereas the red-legged partridge had
   already disappeared by the beginning of the twentieth century. Some
   reintroduction attempts of both species carried out in the 1980s gave
   encouraging but not definitive results, and failed after an initial
   success. This was probably due to the low number of birds released, the
   small size of the re-introduction areas, their isolation, the farm-bred
   origin of the partridges, and hunting. In the province of Siena, for
   the first time in Italy, a large-scale reintroduction program of grey
   and red-legged partridges was experimented. The project started up in
   1995 with seven reintroduction areas for grey and four for red-legged
   partridge, and was extended to 19 areas (22,562 ha) for grey and 7
   (6858 ha) for red-legged partridge in 2002. Population viability
   analyses for both species showed that if reintroduced populations were
   isolated they would be extinct in a few years. Therefore, a
   metapopulation approach was adopted (contemporary releases in
   reintroduction areas close to each other). In each area, 100-1000
   partridges per year were released for a minimum of 3 years, from
   different farms in order to achieve the maximum initial genetic
   diversity. Releases were effected in late summer (August-September) in
   acclimatization pens containing 10-20 aviaries. The reintroduced
   population showed marked variability of some demographic parameters,
   such as pair density and brood production rate; instead, average brood
   size was relatively constant across the study areas, but with annual
   variations. Reintroduction success was limited to a few areas only,
   mainly depending on the habitat characteristics of the areas, their
   surface area and isolation, and on the degree of care for the birds
   during the acclimatization period.}},

Abstract = {{Giant Panda Aliuropoda melonoleitca is a rare ancient animal native to

   other. The Six sub-populations are named respectively BH sub-pop, ZZWG
   sub-pop, MS sub-pop, BCFI sub-pop, QFS sub-pop and GGS sub-pop. It is
   crucial and urgent to find ways to conserve these isolated
   subpopulations. In this Study VORTEX software is used to model the
   dynainics of the Giant Panda population over the next 100 years ill the
   Minshan Mountain as a metapopulation (named Minshan meta-pop). Results
   are as follows: (1) If there were no dispersers, BH sub-pop, ZZWG
   sub-pop, QFS sub-pop and GGS sub-pop Would become extinct within 100
   years, and the population size of MS sub-pop and BCH sub-pop would
   increase within 100 years. (2) If there were immigrants the four little
   sub-populations (BH sub-pop, ZZWG sub-pop, QFS sub-pop and GGS sub-pop)
   Would retain more than 90\% of their Current genetic diversity over the
   next 100 years, even if the dispersal rate was just 1\%. (3) High
   dispersal rate was not of benefit to population growth and maintenance
   of genetic diversity in the metapopulation. (4) Ill the polygynous
   systern of the Giant Panda, the male plays an important role in
   dispersal. Limiting,g the dispersal of fernaics and increasing the
   successful dispersal of males Could promote the development of the
   metapopulation. (5) Alterina the age of dispersers had almost no impact
   upon the dynamics of metapopulations. (6) In order to ensure that thiS
   metapopulation will survive for 100 years, the minimum effective viable
   population size (Ne) should be 40 breeding individuals or 100 total
   individuals with a stable age distribution. Finally, we put forward
   some specific recommendations in light of the current situation faced
   by Giant Pandas in the Minshan Mountains, such as constructing

   individuals from four countries to develop a conceptual framework

Abstract = {{Understanding the status of fragmented populations and predicting their

   viability analysis (PVA) can help in this process and is widely used
   for assessing the extinction risk faced by threatened species and for
   finding the key factors affecting population status and survival
   prospects. From 1982 to 2004, 14 scientists studied the population of
   the globally threatened Cabot's Tragopan Tragopan caboti in Wuyanling
   National Natural Reserve (WNNR), south-cast China and collected
   life-history data on the population. Using VORTEX, we analysed the
   viability of the population in the reserve and this predicted that the
   population size will increase for the next 50 years and will then show
   a very slight decline for the next 50 years. The loss of heterozygosity
   is predicted to be 14\%, suggesting that the population may not be
   viable in the long term. Sensitivity analyses showed that nest loss is
   the most important factor affecting population size and the survival
   probability of the population, which is supported by field studies.
   Though the new evidence shows that Cabot's Tragopan can build nests in
   spruce forest successfully, broad-leaf forest is still necessary for
   them for foraging, especially at some times of the year. The simulation
   also shows that the probability of survival and the size of the
   population will decrease markedly if the extent of suitable habitat is
   reduced even relatively slowly (such as o.1\% per year). Overall, we
   conclude that the PVA has provided very informative guidance to future
   management and research on Cabot's Tragopan at Wuyanling National

Abstract = {{Small populations are vulnerable to long-term declines, even where
   short-term censuses indicate increasing trends in numbers. Census data
   for the Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) collected between
   1970 and 2004 provide evidence that despite year-to-year population
   increases detected in most of the annual censuses, the strong El Nino
   events of 1982-83 and 1997-98 were followed by population declines of
   more than 60\% from which the species has yet to recover. Such large
   declines raise concerns about the future viability of the species
   because the frequency and severity of El Nino events are predicted to
   increase. We used the simulation software VORTEX to evaluate the
   potential effects of El Nino on the risk of extinction of the Galapagos
   penguin population and its four constituent subpopulations. Weak and
   strong El Nino events were treated as catastrophes, with varying
   frequencies, which simulated past, current and future effects on the
   penguin population. The ``Current El Nino{''} scenario, based on the
   frequency of El Nino events recorded in the Galapagos between 1965 and
   2004, indicated an approximately 30\% probability of extinction within
   the next 100 years for the penguin population. More ominously, the
   species may be at a greater risk if the frequency of strong El Nino
   episodes increases only marginally. A probability of extinction greater
   than 80\% was predicted when the current frequency (5\%) of strong El
   Nino events was doubled (to 10\%). The probabilities of extinctions
   were higher for each subpopulation treated individually, ranging from
   34\% for Isabela and Fernandina, 64\% for Bartolome-Santiago to 78\%
   for the smallest subpopulation on Floreana. Sensitivity analyses
   identified survival of penguins during El Nino events and sex ratio as
   influential parameters. The estimates of extinction risk may be
   conservative as other threats associated. with increased human
   activities on the islands may further compromise species persistence.

Abstract = {{in population viability analysis we are often faced with a lack of

   valuable information to estimate missing parameters indirectly. As an
   example for this pattern-oriented modelling and parameterization,
   pre-breeding survival rate of the endangered Lesser Spotted Woodpecker
   (Picoides minor) was determined here using data on population structure
   (e.g. sex ratio) and reproductive success at the population level (e.g.
   nesting success). Therefore, an individual-based model was developed
   simulating the population dynamics for two different populations that
   had been empirically studied at Lake Mockeln, Sweden, and Taunus,
   Germany. For both populations, a small range for pre-breeding survival
   rates could be identified wherein all simulated patterns corresponded
   best to the empirical values. Prebreeding survival rate was found to be
   higher in the German scenario than in the Swedish and geographical
   variation in life-history traits is discussed as a possible reason. It
   is concluded that the pattern-oriented approach is a valuable method
   for estimating missing demographic parameters, even when using weak

   Micoureus paraquayanus, an endemic arboreal marsupial of the Atlantic
   Forest. Scenarios simulated hypothetical populations of 100 and 2000
   animals being partitioned into 1-10 populations, linked by varying
   rates of inter-patch dispersal, and also evaluated male-biased
   dispersal. Results demonstrated that a single population was more
   stable than an ensemble of populations of equal size, irrespective of
   dispersal rate. Small populations (10-20 individuals) exhibited high
   instability due to demographic stochasticity, and were characterized by
   high rates of extinction, smaller values for metapopulation growth and
   larger fluctuations in population size and growth rate. Dispersal
   effects on metapopulation persistence were related to the size of the
   populations and to the sexes that were capable of dispersing.
   Male-biased dispersal had no noticeable effects on metapopulation

Abstract = {{Although conservation and restoration practitioners have focused on
   maximizing above-ground population size and seed set of rare plants, a
   clear understanding of seed bank dynamics is crucial to managing these
   species. Santa Cruz tarplant (Holocarpha macradenia) is a threatened
   annual forb restricted to coastal prairie habitats in central
   California. Holocarpha produces disk achenes germinating within a year
   of production and ray achenes forming a persistent seed bank. We
   constructed both deterministic and stochastic demographic models for a
   restored Holocarpha population, using demographic rates measured
   separately for unmanipulated plants and plants growing in plots where
   vegetation was clipped. The deterministic models indicated that
   regardless of germination from the seed bank, the population would
   decline without clipping or similar treatments that enhance survival
   and reproductive output. Deterministic models showed only a slight
   positive effect of increased ray seed germination rates on population
   growth, which would need to be balanced against a potential loss of
   buffering against environmental variation as the dormant seed bank was
   reduced. Our stochastic simulations suggested that extinction risk for
   Holocarpha populations would be minimized by intermediate levels of ray
   seed germination. Thus, managers should focus on improving the
   performance of aboveground plants before considering actions to
   stimulate germination, since the former will yield a greater increase
   in deterministic population growth and not sacrifice any buffering
   effect of the seed bank. This case study emphasizes the importance of
   considering dormant seeds and seed banks in designing successful
   restoration and management strategies for plant species at risk of
   extinction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extinction risk is a key area of investigation for contemporary
   ecologists and conservation biologists. Practical conservation efforts
   for vulnerable species can be considerably enhanced by thoroughly
   understanding the ecological processes that interact to determine
   species persistence or extinction. Theory has highlighted the
   importance of both extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic
   demographic processes. In laboratory microcosms, single-species
   single-habitat patch experimental designs have been widely used to
   validate the theoretical prediction that environmental heterogeneity
   can increase extinction risk. Here, we develop on this theme by testing
   the effects of fluctuating resource levels in experimental multispecies
   metapopulations. We compare a three-species host-parasitoid assemblage
   that exhibits apparent competition to the individual pairwise,
   host-parasitoid interactions. Existing theory is broadly supported for
   two-species assemblages: environmental stochasticity reduces trophic
   interaction persistence time, while metapopulation structure increases
   persistence time. However, with increasing assemblage complexity, the
   effects of trophic interactions mask environmental impacts and
   persistence time is further reduced, regardless of resource renewal
   regime. We relate our findings to recent theory, highlighting the
   importance of taking into account both intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
   over a range of spatial scales, in order to understand
   resource-consumer dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the effectiveness of reserve networks is essential to ensure
   that conservation objectives such as species persistence are being met.
   We devised a new approach for measuring the effectiveness of land
   conservation in protecting rare and threatened species and applied it
   to an ecosystem of global significance. We compiled detailed global
   distributional data for 36 rare and threatened plants and animals found
   in the Lake Wales Ridge ecosystem in central Florida (US.A.). For each
   species, we developed a set of protection indices based in part on
   criteria used to categorize species for the World Conservation Union's
   Red List We calculated protection indexes tinder three different
   conservation scenarios: a past scenario, which assumed recent. major
   land-acquisition efforts never occurred; a current scenario, which
   assumed no additional areas are saved beyond what is currently
   protected; and a targeted scenario, which assumed all of the remaining
   areas targeted for protection are eventually acquired. This approach
   enabled us to quantify the progress, in terms of reduced risk of
   extinction, that conservationists have made in protecting target
   species. It also revealed the limited success these land-acquisition
   efforts have bad in reducing those extinction risks associated with
   loss of habitat or small geographic ranges. Many species of the Lake
   Wales Ridge will remain at high risk of extinction even if planned
   land-acquisition efforts are completely successful. By calculating
   protection indexes with and without each site for all imperiled
   species, we also quantified the contribution of each protected area to
   the conservation of each species, enabling local conservation decisions
   to be made in the context of a larger (global) perspective. The
   protection index approach can be adapted readily to other ecosystems
   with multiple rare and threatened species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the outcomes of a novel inter-twining of long-term
   monitoring data and population modelling to assess the accuracy of
   predictions of a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) model. In
   particular, the relative effectiveness of different management options
   for reserving areas from timber harvesting was assessed for two
   forest-dependent arboreal marsupials, the greater glider (Petauroides
   volans) and Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). We used
   data from 7 years of monitoring conducted at 161 sites to assess and
   modify, where appropriate, previous population models of the two
   species of arboreal marsupials. The results indicated that the
   importance of food resources for both had been underestimated in past
   work. Despite this, the modified models that included increased
   importance of food availability did not change the predicted risks of
   decline substantially, particularly for Leadbeater's Possum.
   Importantly, past conclusions about the optimal sizes of patches to
   reserve within the forests used wood production were robust to changes
   in the model. This is a valuable finding because the work we report is
   one of the first to empirically test the robustness of the relative
   predictions of a PVA model. Nevertheless, the new insights we derived
   from this study have implications both for: (1) the implementation of
   our ongoing long-term monitoring study, in particular the value of what
   can be termed `adaptive monitoring', and, (2) the establishment of a
   new silvicultural experiment designed to better create habitat for
   arboreal marsupials within logged and regenerated sites.}},

Abstract = {{Species extinctions and the deterioration of other biodiversity

   typically also used to satisfy these criteria. This chapter reviews
   both the concepts and technical choices that underlie the development
   of these tools. Conservation planning problems can be formulated as
   optimization problems, and we evaluate the suitability of different
   algorithms for their solution. Finally, we also review some key issues

Abstract = {{The role of inbreeding depression in the extinction of wild populations
   is controversial, largely because there are no quantitative estimates
   of its impact using realistic levels of inbreeding depression. To
   address this deficiency, this study (1) provides a comprehensive
   estimate of the impact of inbreeding depression on wild, mammalian and
   avian species via a meta-analysis, and (2) determines the impact of
   this level of inbreeding depression on extinction risk over a broad
   taxonomic range via stochastic computer projections with and without
   inbreeding depression for populations with carrying capacities of 100,
   500 and 2000 individuals. An average overall effect of 12 diploid
   lethal equivalents was found across the life-history of the species in
   the meta-analysis. In the stochastic computer projections, 12 diploid
   lethal equivalents of inbreeding depression (with purging) decreased
   median times to extinction by an average of 37\%. These decreases were
   significant and of very similar magnitude, regardless of the carrying
   capacity modelled. Disregarding the influence of inbreeding depression
   on extinction risk will lead to serious overestimates of the survival
   prospects of threatened mammalian and avian taxa. Further,

Abstract = {{Strategies are needed to recover the ocelot Leopardus pardalis from the

   (PVA) was developed which concluded that combinations of different
   recovery strategies were needed to effectively reduce ocelot extinction
   probability in the United States (US), with habitat protection and
   restoration identified as the most effective recovery scenario. We
   expanded this PVA model by incorporating landscape data to develop a
   more realistic habitat-based PVA for ocelots in southern Texas. We used
   RAMAS/(GIS) software to conduct a habitat-based PVA by linking
   landscape data with a demographic metapopulation model. The primary
   goal of this study was to provide a model for evaluating ocelot
   recovery strategies in the US. Each model scenario was simulated 1000
   times over 50 years and we defined extinction as one individual
   remaining. Using the RAMAS/(GIS) program we identified 11 possible
   ocelot habitat patches (i.e., subpopulations) occurring in southern
   Texas. In addition, based on the habitat-based PVA model we found that
   combinations of different recovery strategies were needed to
   effectively reduce ocelot extinction probability in the US, with
   reducing road mortality the single most effective strategy. Short-term
   recovery strategies should include reducing ocelot road mortality, and
   translocation of ocelots into the US from northern Mexico. Long-term
   recovery strategies should include the restoration of habitat between
   and around existing ocelot habitat patches and the establishment of a
   dispersal corridor between ocelot breeding populations. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Scalar population models, commonly referred to as count-based models,

   purposes, however, requires understanding inherent biases that may
   exist in these models. Through a series of simulations, which compared
   predictions of risk of decline of scalar and matrix-based models, we
   examined whether discrepancies may arise from different dynamics
   displayed due to age structure and generation time. We also examined
   scalar and matrix-based population models of 18 real populations for
   potential patterns of bias in population viability estimates. In the
   simulation study, precautionary bias (i.e., overestimating risks of
   decline) of scalar models increased as a function of generation time.
   Models of real populations showed poor fit between scalar and
   matrix-based models, with scalar models predicting significantly higher
   risks of decline on average. The strength of this bias was not
   correlated with generation time, suggesting that additional sources of

Abstract = {{1. There is a clear need to increase our ability to predict the
   consequences of environmental change. The seven main approaches that
   are currently used are: extrapolation, experiments, phenomenological
   models, game-theory population models, expert opinion, outcome-driven
   modelling and scenarios. Each approach has different strengths and
   weaknesses. In practice, several approaches are often combined.
   2. Adaptive management aimed at testing hypotheses is excellent in
   principle and widely advocated. In reality, however, it is almost never
   carried out because the changes in management usually have to be severe
   in order to bring about detectable changes in a reasonable time, and
   the political risks of such management are usually considered too high.
   3. Game-theory population models are used to determine population-level
   phenomena based upon the decisions individuals make in response to
   resource depletion, interference, territoriality or rank. This allows
   predictions to be made regarding responses to novel conditions. The
   main drawback is that for some models considerable information is
   required.
   4. Much of conservation practice is not based upon evidence.
   Evidence-based conservation is the practice of accumulating, reviewing
   and disseminating evidence with the aim of formulating appropriate
   management strategies. Evidence-based medicine revolutionized medical
   practice and similar opportunities exist to improve conservation
   practice.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The conventional approach of making
   assumptions and deriving models to make predictions about the
   consequences of environmental change is often unsatisfactory for
   complex problems, with considerable uncertainty. Tackling such problems
   is likely to require greater exploration of techniques such as expert
   opinion, output-driven modelling and scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, population viability analysis has become a popular
   tool to assess the relative risk of extinction among populations.
   Viability estimates for spatially structured populations require
   movement data that are often unavailable. In this paper, a diffusion
   approximation model was used to explore the effects of different
   spatial scenarios resulting from assumptions about movement rates.
   Census data for 13 breeding islands occupied by California sea lions
   Zalophus californianus californianus in the Gulf of California were
   used to explore three potential scenarios: unlimited movement between
   sites (panmictic population), limited movement (several clusters of
   populations) and no movement between islands (isolated islands).
   Predicted viability estimates were different for each scenario, but
   contrary to expectations, the mean extinction risk estimates were
   generally lowest when movement was unlimited (panmictic scenario).
   However, despite an extensive dataset, the confidence of the viability
   predictions for each scenario was low. In some cases, uncertainty in
   predictions within a scenario was greater than differences between
   scenarios. Therefore, it is recommended that in situations where
   movement rates and spatial structure are unknown, extinction risk
   estimates should reflect both the confidence intervals for each risk
   estimate and the uncertainty resulting from different spatial
   scenarios. This study also provides the first estimate of population
   viability (considering spatial structure) for California sea lions in

   probabilities (vital rates), are difficult to parameterize and their
   values may vary depending on external conditions such as weather.
   Details of how weather might influence population performance are rare,
   yet necessary to assess the effects of global climate change on a
   species' distribution.
   2. Based on a 26-year data set of a population of Himantoglossum
   hircinum in a nature reserve in Germany, variations of life-history
   traits and vital rates were studied. Matrix analysis was used to
   identify the most important life-state transitions for population
   growth. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the response of
   population traits and vital rates to changing weather conditions.
   3. Population size increased exponentially and density effects could
   not be observed. Flowering plants and large plants had the highest and
   second highest reproductive value, respectively. The population's
   finite rate of increase fluctuated strongly among years; life-history
   traits varied strongly and were interlinked, thereby violating the
   assumptions of matrix modelling in a population viability analysis.
   4. Some vital rates and the population growth rate showed a trend over
   the total period. A certain and sometimes large amount of that
   variability could be attributed to variability of weather conditions,
   with warmer winter conditions favouring population performance.
   Prediction of population size was fairly accurate within a time frame
   of 10 years, but size class structure was not.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Matrix modelling proved to be unreliable
   for predicting long-term population dynamics, despite the long-term
   data set used for matrix construction. This can be explained by
   weather-dependent variability of vital rates driving population
   dynamics. A minimum study period of 4 years is necessary to produce
   relevant information for model development. Our study emphasizes the
   need for critical evaluation of management decisions based only on
   single short-term studies and for studies covering longer time
   intervals than 2-3 years.}},

Abstract = {{Because data on rare species usually are sparse, it is important to
   have efficient ways to sample additional data. Traditional sampling
   approaches are of limited value for rare species because a very large
   proportion of randomly chosen sampling sites are unlikely to shelter
   the species. For these species, spatial predictions from niche-based
   distribution models can be used to stratify the sampling and increase
   sampling efficiency. New data sampled are then used to improve the
   initial model. Applying this approach repeatedly is an adaptive process
   that may allow increasing the number of new occurrences found. We
   illustrate the approach with a case study of a rare and endangered
   plant species in Switzerland and a simulation experiment. Our field
   survey confirmed that the method helps in the discovery of new
   populations of the target species in remote areas where the predicted
   habitat suitability is high. In our simulations the model-based
   approach provided a significant improvement (by a factor of 1.8 to 4
   times, depending on the measure) over simple random sampling. In terms
   of cost this approach may save up to 70\% of the time spent in the
   field.

Abstract = {{This review grew out of our realization that models play an
   increasingly important role in conservation but are rarely used in the
   research of most avian biologists. Modelers are creating models that
   are more complex and mechanistic and that can incorporate more of the
   knowledge acquired by field biologists. Such models require field
   biologists to provide more specific information, larger sample sizes,
   and sometimes new kinds of data, such as habitat-specific demography
   and dispersal information. Field biologists need to support model
   development by testing key model assumptions and validating models. The
   best conservation decisions will occur where cooperative interaction
   enables field biologists, modelers, statisticians, and managers to
   contribute effectively.
   We begin by discussing the general form of ecological models-heuristic
   or mechanistic, ``scientific{''} or statistical-and then highlight the
   structure, strengths, weaknesses, and applications of six types of
   models commonly used in avian conservation: (1) deterministic
   single-population matrix models, (2) stochastic population viability
   analysis (PVA) models for single populations, (3) metapopulation
   models, (4) spatially explicit models, (5) genetic models, and (6)
   species distribution models. We end by considering the intelligent use
   of models in decision-making, which requires understanding their unique
   attributes, determining whether the assumptions that underlie the
   structure are valid, and testing the ability of the model to predict
   the future correctly.}},

   logarithmic scaling of time-to-extinction as a function of population
   size for each of the 10 populations. Second, two lines of evidence
   suggested that these extinction-bound populations collectively
   exhibited dynamics akin to those theoretically proposed to occur in
   extinction vortices. Specifically, retrospective analyses suggested
   that a population size of n individuals within a decade of extinction
   was somehow less valuable to persistence than the same population size
   was earlier. Likewise, both year-to-year rates of decline and
   year-to-year variability increased as the time-to-extinction decreased.
   Together, these results provide key empirical insights into extinction

   for control region sequences and a historic specimen from the same area
   carrying a different haplotype demonstrated a loss of mtDNA diversity

   phylogeographic structure in the region, in contrast to previous UK

Abstract = {{The Mexican prairie dog Cynomys mexicanus is an endemic burrowing
   rodent with a restricted distribution. Up to 1996 the species
   experienced a loss of c. 60\% of its historical range, and in the last
   few years a further loss of habitat has occurred, with the current
   range now covering only 36\% of the historical range. In this study we
   examined the population dynamics of the Mexican prairie dog to
   determine the relative effects of habitat loss, isolation of remaining
   colonies, and decreasing habitat quality. We used data on prairie dog
   numbers in all colonies and demographic data for two colonies to carry
   out a stochastic population viability analysis. We found differing
   vital rates, which are presumed to result from differing habitat
   quality, at two colonies. As small variations of vital rates in the
   model strongly influenced the extinction risk for small populations, we
   conclude that habitat quality is important for the small populations.
   In the model the Los Angeles complex of colonies experienced a low risk
   of local extinction whereas at the Manantial complex local extinctions
   were frequent. Scenarios with changes in population sizes had the

Abstract = {{It is generally acknowledged that population-level assessments

   require the use of models to integrate potentially complex data about

   relevant measure of ecological impact. Building on excellent earlier
   reviews we here briefly outline the modelling options in

   population endpoints from available data, which is often about
   Individual life histories, the ways that individuals interact with each
   other, the environment and other species, and the ways individuals are
   affected by pesticides. As population endpoints, we recommend the use

   population persistence. We recommend two types of model: simple
   life-history models distinguishing two life-history stages, juveniles
   and adults; and spatially-explicit individual-based landscape models.
   Life-history models are very quick to set up and run, and they provide
   a great deal or insight. At the other extreme, individual-based

Abstract = {{The importance of unprotected habitats for the persistence of species
   in reserve networks is likely to be high for species living in highly
   fragmented habitat in which regional persistence depends on
   metapopulation processes. The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages)
   is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn
   Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus
   corniculatus L., growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered
   microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by
   metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61\%) out of 2620 ha of
   dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining
   unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to
   urban development Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function
   model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy
   skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve
   network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the
   reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat
   remained, with a maximum of 4\% simulation replicates going extinct in
   a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed,
   however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable,
   with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36\%. We
   calculated a relatively simple measure of ``patch importance, `` the
   colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model
   predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (a
   value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four
   to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization
   potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to
   decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper
   metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11
   patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (sigma = 0.3). My
   results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare
   butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of
   unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency

Abstract = {{Understanding population extinctions is a chief goal of ecological
   theory. While stochastic theories of population growth are commonly

   extinction were accurately predicted or only slightly biased. However,
   when density-dependent demographic stochasticity was not accounted for,

Abstract = {{We assess the use of simple, size-based matrix population models for

   in 15 permanent plots to create 17 separate time-invariant,
   density-independent population projection models, and determined
   differences between trends projected from initial surveys with a 5-year
   interval and observed data during two subsequent 5-year time steps.
   We detected departures from the assumptions of the matrix modelling
   approach in terms of strong growth autocorrelations. We also found
   evidence of observation errors for measurements of tree growth and, to
   a more limited degree, recruitment. Loglinear analysis provided
   evidence of significant temporal variation in demographic rates for
   only two of the 17 populations.
   Total population sizes were strongly predicted by model projections,
   although population dynamics were dominated by carryover from the
   previous 5-year time step (i.e. there were few cases of recruitment or
   death). Fractional changes to overall population sizes were less well
   predicted. Compared with a null model and a simple demographic model
   lacking size structure, matrix model projections were better able to
   predict total population sizes, although the differences were not
   statistically significant. Matrix model projections were also able to
   predict short-term rates of survival, growth and recruitment. Mortality
   frequencies were not well predicted.
   Our results suggest that simple size-structured models can accurately
   project future short-term changes for some tree populations. However,
   not all populations were well predicted and these simple models would
   probably become more inaccurate over longer projection intervals. The
   predictive ability of these models would also be limited by disturbance

Abstract = {{Whether land management planning provides for sufficient habitat to
   sustain viable populations of indigenous wildlife is one of the
   greatest challenges confronting resource managers. Analyses of the
   effects of land management on natural resources often rely on
   qualitative assessments that focus on single species to reflect the
   risk of wildlife extinction across a planning area. We propose a
   conceptual framework for sustainable management of wildlife habitat
   that explicitly acknowledges the greater risk of an extinction event
   when considering the viability of multiple species, e.g., an indigenous
   vertebrate fauna. This concept is based on the principle that the
   likelihood of at least one event (i.e., species extinction) is the
   joint probability of the extinction probabilities of individual
   species, assuming independence among species' responses to disturbance.
   We present an ecological rationale to support the view that, at a
   spatial scale of 10(4)-10(6) ha (i.e., planning area) and a temporal
   scale of 102 years (i.e., planning horizon), wildlife species operating
   at varying ecological scales respond relatively independently to
   disturbances typically associated with land management. We use a
   hypothetical scenario of a wildlife viability assessment and Monte
   Carlo simulation to demonstrate that the probability of `any
   extinction' is consistently higher than the probability of the `single
   most likely' extinction, and that the difference between these values
   increases as more disturbance-sensitive species (i.e., species at risk)
   are analyzed. We conclude that risk assessments that rely upon the most
   sensitive single species may substantially underestimate the risk of
   wildlife extinction across a planning area. Furthermore, the selection
   of a planning alternative based on relative threat of local extinction
   of wildlife populations can vary depending on which paradigm is used to
   estimate risk to viability across the planning area. Published by

Abstract = {{Demographic models are an increasingly important tool in population
   biology. However, these models, especially stochastic matrix models,
   are based upon a multitude of parameters that must usually be estimated
   with only a few years of data and limited sample sizes within each
   year, calling into question the accuracy of the results of these
   models. We first discuss how these data limitations create sampling
   uncertainty and bias in the estimated parameters for a stochastic
   demography model. Next, we ask whether limited data can favor the
   construction of deterministic models that ignore variation and
   correlation of rates. With less than five years of data, the mean
   squared error of deterministic models will sometimes be smaller than
   that of stochastic models, favoring the use of simple models, even when
   their predictions are known to be biased. Finally, we introduce a
   procedure to estimate the sampling variation around population growth
   rate estimates made from demographic models that are based on specified
   sampling durations and intensities.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of animal populations are determined by several key
   demographic parameters, which vary over time with resultant changes in
   the status of the population. When managing declining populations, the
   identification of the parameters that drive such change are a high
   priority, but are rarely achieved for large and long-lived species.
   Southern elephant seal populations in the South Indian and South
   Pacific oceans have decreased by as much as 50\% during the past 50 yr.
   The reasons for these decreases remained unknown. This study used a
   projected stochastic Leslie-matrix model based on long-term demographic
   data to examine the potential role of several life-history parameters
   in contributing to the declines. The models simulated the observed
   population trends that were independently derived from annual abundance
   surveys. Small changes in survival and fecundity had dramatic effects
   on population growth rates. At Macquarie Island for example, a small
   change (ca. 5\%) in survival and fecundity rates resulted in the
   population reverting from a decreasing one to a population that
   increased. The vital rates that had the greatest impact on fitness
   were, in order of importance: (1) juvenile survival, (2) adult
   survival, (3) adult fecundity and (4) juvenile fecundity, Population
   viability analysis (PVA) for each of the 2 decreasing populations
   revealed that there was a high probability of the Marion Island
   population becoming extinct within the next 150 yr, while the
   probability of extinction at Macquarie Island was low. The estimated
   mean times to extinction for each population was 134 yr (95\%
   confidence intervals: 105 to 332 yr) at Marion Island and 564 yr at
   Macquarie Island (the earliest time to extinction was 307 yr).}},

Abstract = {{The island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on Santa Catalina Island is among
   the most imperiled species on the Channel Islands due to a recent
   outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV). The western subpopulation,
   which was not exposed to CDV, is a crucial element in the recovery of
   foxes by providing a source of animals for translocation and captive
   breeding. Using the program VORTEX, we developed a population viability
   analysis for the Santa Catalina Island fox to (1) address the
   likelihood of population persistence, (2) estimate the current
   susceptibility of the population to catastrophic events, and (3)
   evaluate the efficacy of current restoration strategies of releasing
   captive bred foxes and transplanting wild animals. Overall, we found
   the population to be susceptible to catastrophic events; a 50\%
   increase in mortality every 20 years was sufficient to elevate the
   extinction risk above 5\%. Current management activities entail the
   transplanting of 12 juvenile foxes annually, which may reduce the
   viability of the western subpopulation. A minimum population size of at
   least 150 foxes should be maintained in each subpopulation to reduce
   the risk of extinction due to demographic stochasticity. Releases of
   translocated and captive bred animals affect the speed of recovery on
   the eastern half of Catalina Island, but not the probability of
   extinction, which is near zero under current conditions. We conducted a
   sensitivity analysis for demographic parameters by incrementally
   varying survival, fecundity and density-dependence parameters, while
   holding all other parameters constant. Sensitivity analyses identified
   mortality and mean litter size as the most sensitive parameters, while
   the implementation of density-dependence and environmental variation of
   model parameters did not seem to affect population performance. We
   conclude that the population of island foxes on Santa Catalina is
   currently at a critically low population level, but recovery of the

Abstract = {{European mouflon sheep are an endangered species of ovidae residing

   synchronized mouflon and domestic ewes and after IVF in in vitro
   matured moutlon and domestic ewe oocytes collected by OPU technique.
   Domestic ram (Ovis aries) spermatozoa served as control. Semen was
   collected by artificial vagina from three moullons and three domestic
   rams during the breeding season and was cryopreserved. At thawing, no
   significant differences in sperm viability were found between the wild
   and the domestic species (53.1 +/- 4.6\% versus 56.0 +/- 4.7\%) whereas
   the percentage of acrosomeintact sperm was lower in mouflon (55.5 +/-
   4.6\%) than in ram semen (62.7 +/- 3.1\%; P < 0.05). Lambing rate did
   not differ between synchronized mouflon and domestic ewes (5/11 versus
   8/12) after 150 and 156 days of pregnancy, respectively. After two OPU
   sessions, 87 and 132 oocytes were collected from three hyperstimulated
   mouflon and three domestic ewes. Cryopreserved/thawed semen was
   inseminated with an endoscope into the uterus of corresponding species
   during the non-breeding season. The oocytes were matured and fertilized
   in vitro; 61/73 mouflon and 81/101 domestic ewe oocytes were found to
   be fertilized. From these, we obtained 6/61 and 17/81 blastocysts.
   After vitrification and thawing, the hatching rate showed no
   significant difference between mouflon and sheep blastocysts (4/6
   versus 14/17). In conclusion, our data showed that cryopreserved

Abstract = {{The Przewalski's horse (Equus caballus przewalskii) became extinct in
   the wild in the 1960s. Since 1997, captive-bred horses have been
   released into the Gobi-B Strictly Protected Area (SPA) in southwestern
   Mongolia, and successful reproduction in the wild started in 1999. In
   2002, the population formed 3 harem groups and 1 bachelor group (total
   38) in the wild, and 3 harem groups (24) awaited release in summer 2003
   within acclimatization enclosures, totaling 62 individuals. We used the
   stochastic population simulation model VORTEX to (1) identify key
   variables and their threshold values in population dynamics, (2)
   predict extinction risk, and (3) optimize project management and
   release regime by comparing model parameters with our population data.
   Maximum age of reproduction, foal mortality, and fecundity rates were
   key factors in population dynamics, while number of released animals,
   release interval, and duration of supplementation played lesser roles.
   The severity level of natural catastrophes had the greatest influence
   on extinction risk and population size according to VORTEX. Assuming a
   maximum reproductive age of 16 years, an initial population of >140
   horses is necessary to achieve a 95\% probability of survival over 100
   years under the low-severity level of catastrophes scenario. The
   corresponding extinction risk for high-severity level of catastrophes
   is 37\%, even for initial population sizes >500. The low natural growth
   rate of the Przewalski's horse may have been the essential prerequisite
   for extinction in this remote area of Mongolia. However, uncertainty of
   results was high and limits the predictive value of the model.
   Comparisons between model parameters with observed population
   characteristics over the past 10 years reveal some discrepancies that.
   may require readjustment of the model if present trends continue. While
   our model currently underestimates reproductive rate and foal survival,
   adult mortality tends to be higher than estimated in the model. We
   believe that adult survival can be improved in the wild and that the
   reintroduction program has a realistic chance of success. We stress the
   importance of an intensive monitoring program of the Przewalski's horse
   population and consecutive modeling exercises to reevaluate success of
   this reintroduction program.}},

Abstract = {{The Bayesian state-space modelling framework allows us to derive
   inferences on stochastic stage-structured population dynamics models
   from multiple series of sequential observations with measurement or
   sampling errors. A state-space model works from the coupling of two
   models. The first one mimics the dynamics by conditional Markovian
   transitions between successive hidden states. The second model
   describes the observation process with random errors. Statistical
   inferences on states variables and parameters are easily performed via
   Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) methods. The flexibility of
   MCMC methods allows us to analyse a wide range of state-space models
   with non-linear relationships in the dynamic and observation equations,
   and non-Gaussian error structure just as well. The Bayesian paradigm is
   efficient for deriving quantitative diagnostics on a probability based
   rationale. We illustrate the value of this framework by fitting a
   stage-structured life cycle model for Atlantic salmon (Sahno salar) to
   a data set resulting from the survey of the population of the river Oir
   (Lower Normandy, France) between 1984 and 2001. The system dynamics
   includes non-linear regulation and has a probabilistic structure
   accommodating for both the environmental and the demographic
   stochasticity. The observation model consists in capture-mark-recapture
   experiments for the evaluation of the runs of downstream migrating
   juveniles (smolts) and upstream migrating spawners, and random sampling
   for demographic features. A full Bayesian treatment of the model is
   carried out by means of Gibbs sampling. Outputs of main interest
   consist in the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters
   and state variables such as the smolt and spawner runs. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Conventional population viability analysis (PVA) is often impractical
   because data are scarce for many threatened species. For this reason,
   simple count-based models are being advocated. The simplest of these
   models requires nothing more than a time series of abundance estimates,
   from which variance and autocorrelation in growth rate are estimated
   and predictions of population persistence are generated. What remains
   unclear, however, is how many years of data are needed to generate
   reliable estimates of these parameters and hence reliable predictions
   of persistence. By analyzing published and simulated time series, we
   show that several decades of data are needed. Predictions based on
   short time series were very unreliable mainly because limited data
   yielded biased, unreliable estimates of variance in growth rate,
   especially when growth rate was strongly autocorrelated. More
   optimistically, our results suggest that count-based PVA is sometimes
   useful for relative risk assessment (i.e., for ranking populations by
   extinction risk), even when time series are only a decade long.

Abstract = {{The features of 1/f-noise processes offer important new insights into
   the field of population biology, greatly helping our quest for
   understanding and for prediction of ecological processes. 1/f-noises
   account quite satisfactorily for the observed nature of ecological

   processes to ecology. After a discussion of the basic problems of
   population ecology that makes such an innovation necessary, we review
   the features of 1/f-noises concentrating especially on those aspects
   that make these processes attractive as a solution. We also present a
   discussion of the analysis of real ecological data, which confirms that
   there are good empirical as well as good theoretical reasons to
   establish a leading role for pink 1/f noise. We then discuss the
   consequences of such a model for our understanding of ecology. The

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{643-670}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A modelling approach to simulating vegetation dynamics is described,
   incorporating critical processes of carbon sequestration,, growth,
   mortality and distribution. The model has been developed to investigate
   the responses of Vegetation to environmental change, at time scales
   from days to centuries and from the local to the global scale. The
   model is outlined and subsequent tests, against independent data
   sources, arc relatively successful, from the small scale to the global
   scale. Tests against eddy covariance observations of carbon exchange by
   vegetation indicated significant difference between measured and
   simulated net ecosystem production (NEP). NEP is the net of large
   fluxes due to gross primary production and respiration, which are not
   directly measured and so there is some uncertainty in explaining a
   differences between observations and simulations. In addition it was
   noted that closer agreement of fluxes was, achieved for natural, or
   long-lived managed vegetation than for recently managed vegetation. The
   discrepancies appear to be Most closely related to respiratory carbon
   losses from the soil, but this area needs further exploration. The
   differences do not scale up to the global scale, where simulated and
   measured bal net biorne production were similar, indicating that fluxes
   measured at the managed observed sites are not typical globally.
   The model (the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, SDGVM) has
   been applied to contemporary vegetation dynamics and indicates a
   significant CO2 fertilisation effect on the sequestration of
   atmospheric CO2. The terrestrial carbon sink for the 20th century is
   simulated to be widespread between latitudes 40degreesS and 65degreesN,
   but is greatest between 10degrees S and 6degrees N, excluding the
   effects of human dellorestation. The mean maximum sink capacity over
   the 20th century is small, at 25 gC m(-2) year(-1) or approximately 1\%
   of gross primary production.
   Simulations of vegetation dynamics under a scenario of future global
   warming indicate a gradual decline in the terrestrial carbon sink, with
   the capacity to absorb human emissions of CO2 being reduced from 20\%
   in 2000 to approximately 2 \% between 2075 and 2100. The responses of
   carbon sequestration and vegetation structure and distribution to
   stabilisation of climate and CO2 may extend for up to 50 years after
   stabilisation has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Population models in ecology are rarely validated by comparing their
   predictions to long-term observations of changes in population size. We
   have used a variety of analytical tools to examine a 45-year time
   series of annual censuses of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in the Gran
   Paradiso National Park in northwestern Italy. This ibex population grew
   from about 3300 to almost 5000 individuals in the 1980s during a decade
   of anomalously mild winters, and then began to decline in the 1990s. By
   1997, the population size had returned to previous levels. Adult
   survival apparently increased and adult sex ratio may have changed to
   slightly favor males during the increase in population density. Yearly
   changes in total population were correlated with seasonal average snow
   depth and population density over the 39 years for which climate data
   were available. Our results show that the ibex population size was
   limited by both density dependence and deep snow. A model based on
   these factors fit to the first 19 years of data was used to forecast
   subsequent changes in total population based on initial population size
   and yearly snow depth. The model was able to predict the increase and
   subsequent decline in total population size over the final 20 years of
   the study but failed to reproduce population levels after the eruption.
   Our results suggest that the 1980s episode of population growth was
   primarily driven by increased adult survival, rather than increased
   recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) is one of the major areas of
   research in ecological studies. Rapidity of changes occurring to
   biodiversity has increased the importance of PVA. Demographic and
   environmental stochastic events are continuously influencing population
   viability. Anthropogenic activities are altering these dimensions of
   operation, and are pressurizing the viability of population. Under
   these changing scenarios, it is imperative to find out how a population
   is driven towards extinction, and at what stage(s) human intervention
   is necessary to alter the course of direction. Keeping this in mind,
   the present study has been made to propose a suitable model and to
   study its behaviour through simulation experiments for PVA. The model
   is developed keeping herbaceous plants with three distinct phases in
   life cycle as a background. Different shocks occurring at the three
   phases separately and the fourth one occurring at any of the phases are
   considered in this study to take care of environmental stochasticity.
   Probabilities of occurrence of shocks and their levels of likely impact
   on population are considered. In all the simulations, population showed
   a `perfect' oscillation. The long-term simulations revealed that the
   population oscillated between sizeable numbers. The model can be used
   to check the population viability exposed to environmental shocks with
   different probabilities. It can be used to rind out critical levels of
   population for its continuity of existence. The model is good for
   populations with minimal dispersal abilities. The model can be used to
   predict the continuity of heterogeneous herbaceous populations where
   the species are functioning largely as facilitators.}},

Abstract = {{Population models incorporating demographic, environmental and genetic
   stochasticity were created from long-term data on natural populations
   of 30 species of vertebrates. The probability of extinction for a
   single population in a continuous habitat was compared to that of
   multiple isolated, or semi-isolated, populations occupying a fragmented
   landscape with an equivalent total carrying capacity. Populations
   occupying a fragmented landscape were modelled for a range of dispersal
   rates and levels of asynchrony in the effects of environmental
   disturbances. Dispersal among subpopulations in the fragmented
   landscape partially alleviates the effect of fragmentation on
   extinction rates, despite the models explicitly incorporating disease
   epidemics which spread between subpopulations through dispersal. Even
   moderate environmental correlations among subpopulations greatly
   reduces the viability of the metapopulation relative to the case where
   the populations are totally independent. Whether a population performed
   better as a single population or as a metapopulation was strongly
   affected by the carrying capacity assumed, the time frame examined and
   the initial fitness of the population. A single population always fared
   better when the total habitat available was capable of supporting less

Title = {{Managing threatened species: the ecological toolbox, evolutionary

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{413-426}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. The management of threatened species is an important practical way
   in which conservationists can intervene in the extinction process and
   reduce the loss of biodiversity. Understanding the causes of population
   declines (past, present and future) is pivotal to designing effective
   practical management. This is the declining-population paradigm
   identified by Caughley.
   2. There are three broad classes of ecological tool used by
   conservationists to guide management decisions for threatened species:
   statistical models of habitat use, demographic models and
   behaviour-based models. Each of these is described here, illustrated
   with a case study and evaluated critically in terms of its practical
   application.
   3. These tools are fundamentally different. Statistical models of
   habitat use and demographic models both use descriptions of patterns in
   abundance and demography, in relation to a range of factors, to inform
   management decisions. In contrast, behaviour-based models describe the
   evolutionary processes underlying these patterns, and derive such
   patterns from the strategies employed by individuals when competing for
   resources under a specific set of environmental conditions.
   4. Statistical models of habitat use and demographic models have been
   used successfully to make management recommendations for declining
   populations. To do this, assumptions are made about population growth
   or vital rates that will apply when environmental conditions are
   restored, based on either past data collected under favourable
   environmental conditions or estimates of these parameters when the
   agent of decline is removed. As a result, they can only be used to make
   reliable quantitative predictions about future environments when a
   comparable environment has been experienced by the population of
   interest in the past.
   5. Many future changes in the environment driven by management will not
   have been experienced by a population in the past. Under these
   circumstances, vital rates and their relationship with population
   density will change in the future in a way that is not predictable from
   past patterns. Reliable quantitative predictions about population-level
   responses then need to be based on an explicit consideration of the
   evolutionary processes operating at the individual level.
   6. Synthesis and applications. It is argued that evolutionary theory
   underpins Caughley's declining-population paradigm, and that it needs
   to become much more widely used within mainstream conservation biology.
   This will help conservationists examine critically the reliability of
   the tools they have traditionally used to aid management
   decision-making. It will also give them access to alternative tools,
   particularly when predictions are required for changes in the
   environment that have not been experienced by a population in the past.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-99}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed and modeled the demography of Eryngium cuneifolium, an
   herbaceous species endemic to the fire-prone Florida scrub, using 10
   annual censuses (1990-1999) of 11 populations at Archbold Biological
   Station. Nearly every aspect of the demography of this plant is
   affected by time since fire. Year, time since fire, life history stage,
   and plant age affected survival, growth, and fecundity of E.
   cuneifolium, but time since fire and life history stage had the most
   consistent effects. Survival, flowering stem production, and early
   seedling survival were highest in recently burned sites. Long-term
   survival, growth, and fecundity were highest for yearling cohorts
   recruiting recently after fire, with the largest contrast between
   plants recruiting two years postfire and those recruiting more than a
   decade postfire. Prior (historical) stage also affected individual
   plant fates. For example, plants with prior stasis or regression in
   stage subsequently died in greater numbers than plants with prior
   advancement in stage. Historical analyses did not suggest any cost
   associated with the initiation of flowering.
   We used a matrix selection approach to explicitly model Eryngium
   cuneifolium population viability in relation to fire. This simulation
   strategy included preserving observed data and variances within
   projection matrices formed for individual combinations of population
   and year. We built 54 of these matrices, each with six stages (seed
   bank, yearlings, vegetative plants, and three reproductive stages).
   Each of these matrices also represented a specific time since fire. In
   building matrices, we minimized the use of pooled data while retaining
   specific matrices whenever possible. In this way, we preserved both the
   correlation structure within individual matrices (populations, years)
   and protected patterns among matrices across the time-since-fire
   gradient.
   To deal with less-detailed data on recruitment processes, we evaluated
   13 fertility and seed bank scenarios that bracketed a range of
   outcomes. All scenarios were similar in showing the positive effects of
   fire on the demography of E. cuneifolium. The scenario with high seed
   bank survival (0.5) and low germination rates (0-0.005) was the best
   predictor of observed postfire years of peak aboveground population
   size (similar to8 yr) and aboveground population disappearance (30-34
   yr), and also did a good job of reproducing observed population
   trajectories.
   Finite rates of increase (lambda) were > 1 only during the first decade
   postfire but then declined beyond a decade postfire. Although prior
   (historical) stage affected most individual demographic parameters, it
   did not significantly influence finite rates of increase. Elasticities
   were highest for stasis and germination from the seed bank.
   Elasticities for survival increased with time since fire, while growth
   and fertility elasticities decreased. In historical models (those with
   information on stage from the second-to-last year), the elasticities
   for stasis were higher and the elasticities for growth lower, compared
   to models without this history. Bootstrapping suggested small standard
   errors for several types of model output. Most matrix elements were
   positively correlated, suggesting that favorable conditions affect many
   life history stages similarly, and that simulations using element
   selection would provide a less conservative risk assessment than the
   matrix selection technique used.
   We used a stochastic simulation program to simulate changing demography
   with time since fire, with various fire-return intervals, and for
   various initial population sizes. We obtained estimates of extinction
   risk and probability of population decline. Even populations as large
   as thousands of individuals will become extinct in the absence of fire.
   Fire-return intervals of 15 yr or less are necessary for E. cuneifolium
   persistence at individual sites. Fires at intervals longer than 20 yr
   create substantial extinction risks, and intervals longer than 12 yr
   produce declining populations. Cycles of widely divergent, alternating
   short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher chances of
   extinction compared to regular fire-return intervals.
   Although shrub regrowth is implicated in the decreased viability of E.
   cuneifolium populations under regimes of infrequent fire, aboveground
   fuel increases are often too slow to allow frequent burning in Florida
   rosemary scrub. If E. cuneifolium's rosemary scrub habitat burns less
   often than every 20 yr, local extinctions and metapopulation dynamics
   may be the norm. Other rosemary scrub specialists (e.g., Hypericum
   cumulicola) thrive with less frequent fires and persist in smaller gaps
   among the regrowing shrubs. Therefore, we suggest that temporal
   variation in fire-return intervals and spatial variation in fire
   intensity and patchiness (pyrodiversity) will allow coexistence of all
   Florida scrub species and hedge against local extinctions of
   specialists like E. cuneifolium.}},

Abstract = {{Metapopulation theory has generally focused only on the stochastic
   turn-over rate among populations and assumed that the number and
   location of suitable habitat patches will remain constant through time.
   This study combines in a PVA both the deterministic landscape dynamics
   and the stochastic colonisations and extinctions of populations for the
   butterfly Lopinga achine in Sweden. With data on occupancy pattern and
   the rate of habitat change, we built a simulation model and examined
   five different scenarios with different assumptions of landscape
   changes for L. achine. If no landscape changes would be expected,
   around 80 populations are predicted to persist during the next 100 yr.
   Adding the knowledge that many of the sites are unmanaged and that the
   host plant will slowly deteriorate as canopies close over, and adding
   environmental variation and synchrony, showed that the number of
   populations will decrease to around of 4.3 and 2.8 respectively, with
   an extinction risk of 34\% - quite different from the first scenario
   based only on the metapopulation model. This study has shown the
   importance of incorporating both deterministic and stochastic events
   when making a reliable population viability analysis. Even though one
   can not expect that the long-term predictions of either occupied
   patches or extinction risks will be accurate quantitatively, the
   qualitative implications are correct. The extinction risk will be high
   if grazing is not applied to more patches than is the case today. The
   simulations indicate that an absolute minimum of 10-30 top-ranked
   patches needs to be managed for the persistence of the metapopulation
   of L. achine in the long term. The same problem of abandoned and
   overgrowing habitats affects many other threatened species in the
   European landscape and a similar approach could also be applied to them.}},

   dependence was probably related to larval parasitism by a specific
   parasitoid. Population size was negatively affected by an increase in
   the mean temperature. Dispersal was modelled as the observed proportion
   of movements between patches, taking into account the probability of
   emigration out of a given patch. Our model provided results close to
   the picture of the system drawn from the field data and was considered
   as useful in making predictions about the metapopulation. Demographic
   parameters proved to have a far higher impact on metapopulation
   persistence than dispersal or correlation of local dynamics. Scenarios
   simulating both global warming and management of habitat patches by
   rustic herbivore grazing indicated a decrease in the viability of the
   metapopulation. Our results prompted the regional nature conservation
   agency to modify the planned management regime. We urge conservation
   biologists to use structured population models including local
   population dynamics for viability analysis targeted to such threatened
   metapopulations in highly fragmented landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Individual-based assignment tests are now standard tools in molecular
   ecology and have several applications, including the study of
   dispersal. The measurement of natal dispersal is vital to understanding
   the ecology of many species, yet the accuracy of assignment tests in
   situations where natal dispersal is common remains untested in the
   field. We studied a metapopulation of the grand skink, Oligosoma
   grande, a large territorial lizard from southern New Zealand. Skink
   populations occur on isolated, regularly spaced rock outcrops and are
   characterized by frequent interpopulation dispersal. We examined the
   accuracy of assignment tests at four replicate sites by comparing
   long-term mark-and-recapture records of natal dispersal with the
   results of assignment tests based on microsatellite DNA data.
   Assignment tests correctly identified the natal population of most
   individuals (65-100\%, depending on the method of assignment), even
   when interpopulation dispersal was common (5-20\% dispersers). They
   also provided similar estimates of the proportions of skinks dispersing
   to those estimated by the long-term mark-and-recapture data. Fully and
   partially Bayesian assignment methods were equally accurate but their
   accuracy depended on the stringency applied, the degree of genetic
   differentiation between populations, and the number of loci used. In
   addition, when assignments required high confidence, the method of
   assignment (fully or partially Bayesian) had a large bearing on the
   number of individuals that could be assigned. Because assignment tests
   require significantly less fieldwork than traditional
   mark-and-recapture approaches (in this study < 3 months vs. > 7 years),
   they will provide useful dispersal data in many applied and theoretical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{The major tools used to make population viability analyses (PVA)
   quantitative are stochastic models of population dynamics. Since a
   specially tailored model cannot be developed for every threatened
   population, generic models have been designed which can be
   parameterised and analysed by non-modellers. These generic models
   compromise on detail so that they can be used for a wide range of
   species. However, generic models have been criticised because they can
   be employed without the user being fully aware of the concepts,
   methods, potentials, and limitations of PVA. Here, we present the
   conception of a new generic software package for metapopulation
   viability analysis, META-X. This conception is based on three elements,
   which take into account the criticism of earlier generic PVA models: (
   1) comparative simulation experiments; (2) an occupancy-type model
   structure which ignores details of local population dynamics ( these
   details are integrated in external submodels); and ( 3) a unifying
   currency to quantify persistence and viability, the `intrinsic mean
   time to extinction'. The rationale behind these three elements is
   explained and demonstrated by exemplary applications of META-X in the
   three fields for which META-X has been designed: teaching, risk
   assessment in the field, and planning. The conception of META-X is
   based on the notion that PVA is a tool to deal with rather than to
   overcome uncertainty. The purpose of PVA is to produce relative, not
   absolute, assessments of extinction risk which support, but do not
   supplant, management decisions.}},

   2. We analysed data collected on survival (1987-2002) using program
   MARK to explore the influence of density-dependent and independent
   processes on survival over the course of the population's development.
   3.We found evidence for non-linear, threshold density dependence in
   juvenile survival rates. Juvenile survival was also strongly influenced
   by climate, with the temporal distribution of rainfall during the
   cyclone season being the most influential climatic variable. Adult
   survival remained constant throughout.
   4. Our most parsimonious capture-mark-recapture statistical model,

Abstract = {{The California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni) is federally
   listed as an endangered species. Its nesting habitat has been degraded,
   and many colony sites are vulnerable to predation and human
   disturbance. We examined a metapopulation model for the California
   least tern that can be used to predict persistence of populations along
   the Pacific coast and the effects of various management actions. We
   used the model to estimate the effect of reducing predation impact, an
   important source of reduced fecundity, in various populations. Apart
   from restricting human access to nesting sites, most management efforts
   have concentrated on predation. In the model, each cluster of nearby
   colonies is defined as a population. Within each population, the model
   includes age-structure, year-to-year changes in survival and fecundity,
   regional catastrophes (strong El Nino/Southern Oscillation {[}ENSO]
   events), and local catastrophes (reproductive failure due to
   predation). The model predicted a continuing population increase and a
   low risk of substantial decline over the next 50 years. However, this
   prediction was sensitive to assumptions about survival and fecundity.
   Under a pessimistic scenario, the model predicted a high risk of
   decline, although a low risk of extinction. We simulated the effect of
   predator management by reducing the probability of reproductive failure
   due to predation. The improvement in viability ranged from 1\% to 4\%
   for single populations and up to 8\% when all populations were
   included. Results indicated that the number and location of populations

Abstract = {{This study examines the predictive accuracy of the population viability

   Predictions were made over eight scenarios for each species, allowing
   for variation in the amount of dispersal between patches, level of
   environmental stochasticity, and size of habitat patches. Predicted
   occupancies were compared to the 1997 field data of patch occupancy
   using logistic regression, testing H-random, that there was no

   that there was a perfect, 1:1 perfect relationship between observed and

   was underestimated, with field surveys finding that 9 of the 13 patches

Abstract = {{The selection of the most appropriate model for an ecological risk
   assessment depends on the application, the data and resources
   available, the knowledge base of the assessor, the relevant endpoints,

   ecological systems are highly variable and our knowledge of model input
   parameters is uncertain, it is important that models include treatments
   of uncertainty and variability, and that results are reported in this
   light. In this paper we discuss treatments of variation and uncertainty
   in a variety of population models. In ecological risk assessments, the
   risk relates to the probability of all adverse event in the context of
   environmental variation. Uncertainty relates to ignorance about
   parameter values, e.g., measurement error and systematic error. An
   assessment of the full distribution of risks, under variability and
   parameter uncertainty, will give the most comprehensive and flexible
   endpoint. In this paper we present the rationale behind probabilistic
   risk assessment, identify the sources of uncertainty relevant for risk
   assessment and provide an overview of a range of population models.
   While all of the models reviewed have some utility in ecology, some

Abstract = {{Ecological models have been developed and used in management of
   renewable natural resources, conservation biology, and assessments of
   ecological risks posed by toxic chemicals and other stressors. Because
   few models have been developed specifically for use in assessing
   chemical risks, this study examines the realism and relevance of a wide
   range of ecological models from the perspective of assessing
   toxicological risks posed by chemicals. Model realism is evaluated
   relative to the degree of structural and functional description of the
   actual (i.e., real-world) ecological entities or systems that is
   believed necessary for reliable estimation and management of risk.
   Relevance refers to the usefulness of model outputs in addressing the
   ecological impacts of interest in either generic or site-specific
   assessment of risks posed by toxic chemicals. A model becomes
   increasingly relevant the more closely its outputs correspond to the
   endpoints of the risk analysis.
   In addition to the relatively few models (e.g., CASK IFEM, AQUATOX)
   that have been designed specifically for ecological risk assessment, we
   identify several models developed in support of basic research that
   might be adapted for realistic and relevant risk estimation.
   Population, ecosystem, and landscape models describe ecological
   phenomena from different perspectives. Associated with each perspective
   and resulting modeling approach are hypotheses concerning simplifying
   assumptions that facilitate the specification of model structure in
   relation to the ecological topic of interest. The structurally complex
   system models (e.g., AQUATOX, CASM) attempt to explicitly represent the
   many biotic and abiotic processes and interactions that are believed to
   influence the production dynamics of aquatic populations included in
   the models.
   Future efforts in ecological risk assessment modeling should focus on
   identifying the necessary model complexity required to achieve
   sufficiently accurate and precise estimates of risk, as defined by the
   needs of risk management and risk-based decision making. Evaluations of
   model realism, endpoint relevance, flexibility, ease of use, and other
   characteristics may help to guide model users in their choice of
   specific models for further development and application to continuing
   challenges in assessing ecological risks. Clear definition of specific
   model capabilities and corresponding risk assessment endpoints can help
   to ensure that applications of existing ecological models to chemical
   risk assessments are appropriately customized to the needs of
   environmental risk assessors, managers, and decision-makers.}},

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis is an important tool for conservation
   biologists, and matrix models that incorporate stochasticity are
   commonly used for this purpose. However, stochastic simulations may
   require assumptions about the distribution of matrix parameters, and
   modelers often select a statistical distribution that seems reasonable
   without sufficient data to test its fit. We used data from long-term
   (5-10 year) studies with 27 populations of five perennial plant species
   to compare seven methods of incorporating environmental stochasticity.
   We estimated stochastic population growth rate (a measure of viability)
   using a matrix-selection method, in which whole observed matrices were
   selected at random at each time step of the model. In addition, we drew
   matrix elements (transition probabilities) at random using various
   statistical distributions: beta, truncated-gamma, truncated-normal,
   triangular, uniform, or discontinuous/observed. Recruitment rates were
   held constant at their observed mean values. Two methods of
   constraining stage-specific survival to less than or equal to100\% were
   also compared. Different methods of incorporating stochasticity and
   constraining matrix column sums interacted in their effects and
   resulted in different estimates of stochastic growth rate (differing by
   up to 16\%). Modelers should be aware that when constraining
   stage-specific survival to 100\%, different methods may introduce
   different levels of bias in transition element means, and when this
   happens, different distributions for generating random transition
   elements may result in different viability estimates. There was no
   species effect on the results and the growth rates derived from all
   methods were highly correlated with one another. We conclude that the
   absolute value of population viability estimates is sensitive to model
   assumptions, but the relative ranking of populations (and management
   treatments) is robust. Furthermore, these results are applicable to a

Abstract = {{Population size is a major determinant of extinction risk. However,
   controversy remains as to how large populations need to be to ensure
   persistence. It is generally believed that minimum viable population
   sizes (MVPs) would be highly specific, depending on the environmental
   and life history characteristics of the species. We used population
   viability analysis to estimate MVPs for 102 species. We define a
   minimum viable population size as one with a 99\% probability of
   persistence for 40 generations. The models are comprehensive and
   include age-structure, catastrophes, demographic stochasticity,
   environmental stochasticity, and inbreeding depression. The mean and
   median estimates of MVP were 7316 and 5816 adults, respectively. This
   is slightly larger than, but in general agreement with, previous
   estimates of MVP. MVPs did not differ significantly among major taxa,
   or with latitude or trophic level, but were negatively correlated with
   population growth rate and positively correlated with the length of the
   study used to parameterize the model. A doubling of study duration
   increased the estimated MVP by approximately 67\%. The increase in
   extinction risk is associated with greater temporal variation in
   population size for models built from longer data sets. Short-term
   studies consistently underestimate the true variances for demographic
   parameters in populations. Thus, the lack of long-term studies for
   endangered species leads to widespread underestimation of extinction
   risk. The results of our simulations suggest that conservation
   programs, for wild populations, need to be designed to conserve habitat
   capable of supporting approximately 7000 adult vertebrates in order to
   ensure long-term persistence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Estimates of the reliability of population viability analysis (PVA),

   of such forecasts. This letter reports how, contrary to intuition,
   introducing such a component of variability may improve the precision
   of extinction forecasts. The paradoxical result arises because the
   dependence of extinction probability on growth rate is weakened, and
   shifted onto other parameters (e.g. diffusion strength) where

Abstract = {{Changes in abundance and the risk of extinction of the rock partridge
   Alectoris graeca saxatilis in the Dolomitic Alps were investigated
   using a density-dependent model that incorporated dispersal and
   environmental stochasticity. The study was based on spring and summer
   counts collected from sample areas in geographically distinct mountain
   groups. Extinction probability was investigated by simulating a
   discrete population and a metapopulation consisting of local
   populations connected by dispersal. Persistence was not guaranteed when
   the species was examined as a discrete population. When we used a
   metapopulation approach, the persistence was assured but local
   extinctions with subsequent recolonizations of a number of empty areas
   were observed. The analysis was repeated using hunting statistics, when
   there were no restrictions on hunting policies, and a similar high
   extinction pattern was found. Our simulations suggested that long-term
   persistence of rock partridge could be guaranteed only when immigration
   was included into the demographic model. However, if the increased
   population's fragmentation recorded since the 1950s persists the
   extinction of some of the subpopulations appears inevitable.}},

Abstract = {{Poaching giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) for their skins is a
   serious threat to the persistence of wild giant panda populations in
   China. An individual-based, age-structured stochastic simulation model
   was constructed to give a quantitative analysis of the effects of
   poaching. The model takes a total wild population of 1216 individuals
   divided among 16 `patches'. The model treats individual populations as
   being completely independent, with no dispersal, and density-dependence
   only enters into the model through local carrying capacity of patches.
   The model simulates three types of poaching: deterministic (constant)
   poaching, stochastic poaching with normal distribution and stochastic
   poaching with observed distribution. Results showed that, with a given
   initial population, poaching adult females produces lower average
   population size and higher average percentage extinction than poaching
   adult males or young. At the same poaching intensity, all three
   poaching simulations predicted a similar probability of extinction.
   However, they predicted different average population size and
   percentage extinction because of differences in the parameters in the
   three models. These results should therefore be treated with caution
   when constant poaching simulation or stochastic poaching with assumed
   normal distribution is used as a simplification of realistic poaching.
   Nevertheless, the results imply that giant pandas are threatened by any
   reduction in natural populations. Effective measures are essential to
   reduce poaching. It is also important to limit the capturing of wild
   animals for zoos or breeding facilities as this also has a serious
   effect on the total population. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Red List threat categories of
   critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable are defined by a set
   of five criteria ( A-E ). Criterion E is quantitatively defined by
   three specified threshold extinction risks ( 50\%, 20\%, and 10\% ),
   each associated with a particular time frame. For a population
   viability analysis ( PVA) to be useful for assessing a species' threat
   category, the results must have been expressed as the full extinction
   probability function over time or at least for the three specified time
   frames. Often this is not the case, and extrapolations from different
   kinds of PVA results ( e.g., mean time to extinction ) are often
   necessary. By means of analytic models, we investigated the
   possibilities of extrapolation. Based on our results, we suggest that
   extrapolation is not advisable due to the huge errors that can occur.
   The extinction probability function is the best kind of summary
   statistic to use when applying criterion E, but even then the threat
   categorization may be ambiguous. If the extinction risk is low in the
   near future but increases rapidly later on, a species may be classified
   as vulnerable even though it is expected to become extinct within 100
   years. To avoid this, we suggest that the guidelines to the IUCN Red
   List criteria include three reference lines that allow for
   interpretation of the PVA results in the context of the three threat
   categories within the entire period of 100 years. If the estimated
   extinction probability function overshoots one of these functions, the
   species should be classified accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{The extinction of large carnivores in Europe during the Quaternary is

   extinct Panthera gombaszoegensis utilising life history data from the
   modern jaguar Panthera onca. This approach highlighted the potential
   importance of glacial refugia in the extinction process. Even model
   refugia the size of the Italian peninsula did not guarantee persistence
   of a population over a 1000 yr time span, illustrating the role of
   chance in survival in such a refugium. An area the size of the largest
   Mediterranean island was unable to support a big cat population for a
   period of 1000 yr. The models also demonstrated the importance of
   inbreeding as a mechanism for extinction in refugia. It is suggested
   that repeated genetic bottlenecks during successive glaciations would
   tend to remove lethal recessive alleles from the population, increasing
   the probability of survival in refugia in subsequent glaciations. The

Abstract = {{There is a growing debate about the ability of Population Viability
   Analysis (PVA) to predict the risk of extinction. Previously, the
   debate has focused largely on models where spatial variation and

   for an array of different species for which detailed tests of the
   accuracy of PVA models were completed. These models included spatial
   variation in habitat quality and the movement of individuals across a
   landscape. The models were good approximations for some species, but
   poor for others. Predictive ability was limited by complex processes
   typically overlooked in spatial population models, these being
   interactions between landscape structure and life history attributes.
   Accuracy of models could not be determined a priori, although model
   tests indicated how they might be improved. Importantly, model
   predictions were poor for some species that are among the best-studied
   vertebrates in Australia. This indicated that although the availability
   of good life history data is a key part of PVA other factors also
   influence model accuracy. We were also able to draw broad conclusions
   about the sorts of populations and life history characteristics where
   model predictions are likely to be less accurate. Predictions of
   extinction risk are often essential for real-world population

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) is usually conducted assuming that
   values of factors that characterize both average conditions and natural
   variability (stochasticity) are error-free. However, those values are
   often estimates of true parameters and, therefore, have an associated
   estimation error. This error, also called uncertainty, arises from
   limitations of the methods used to estimate parameter values, such as
   sampling, measurement, and expert opinion error. Natural resource
   management decisions must be made in spite of incomplete information,
   and the impact of uncertainty when establishing specific management
   objectives must be assessed. We propose a strategy to reflect our
   current degree of knowledge about stochastic and average system
   conditions by accounting for error in parameter estimates of PVA models
   and assessing its effect on establishing endangered species
   conservation objectives. Using the computer simulation model VORTEX, we
   applied this strategy to the black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapillus),
   an endangered neotropical migrant land bird species. We pursued two
   conservation goals in this study: probability of persistence and
   retention of genetic diversity of at least 95 and 90\%, respectively,
   over the next 100 years. We evaluated two situations, one accounting
   for uncertainty, the other not. Achieving the conservation goals while
   explicitly accounting for estimate uncertainty required more demanding
   management objectives than that assuming no uncertainty. Under static
   carrying capacity, we had to increase fecundity 40\% from 2.5 to 3.5
   young fledged per female per year to meet the conservation goals.
   Explicitly incorporating estimation error into PVA allows us not only
   to assess the range of possible fates an endangered species may face,
   but also to establish measures necessary for meeting the conservation
   goals despite current levels of uncertainty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Infectious disease constitutes a substantial threat to the viability of
   endangered species. Population viability analysis (PVA) can be a useful
   tool for directing conservation management when decisions must be made
   and information is absent or incomplete. Incorporating epidemiological
   dynamics explicitly into a PVA framework is technically challenging,
   but here we make a first attempt to integrate formal stochastic models
   of the combined dynamics of rabies and canine distemper into a PVA of
   the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), a critically endangered canid. In
   the absence of disease, populations in habitat patches of every size
   were remarkably stable and persistent. When rabies virus was
   introduced, epidemics, assumed to arise from sporadic dog-to-wolf
   transmission, caused extinction probabilities over 50 years to rise
   linearly with the force of infection from the dog reservoir and
   particularly steeply in smaller populations. Sensitivity analysis
   revealed that although the overall pattern of results was not altered
   fundamentally by small to moderate changes in disease-transmission
   rates or the way in which interpack disease transmission was modeled,
   results were sensitive to the process of female recruitment to
   male-only packs. Completely protecting wolf populations from rabies
   through vaccination is likely to be impractical, but the model
   suggested that direct vaccination of as few as 20-40\% of wolves
   against rabies might be sufficient to eliminate the largest epidemics
   and therefore protect populations from the very low densities that make
   recovery unlikely. Additional simulations suggested that the affect of
   periodic epidemics of canine distemper virus on wolf population
   persistence was likely to be slight, even when modeled together with
   rabies. From a management perspective, our results suggest that
   conservation action to protect even the smallest populations of
   Ethiopian wolves from rabies is both worthwhile and urgent.}},

Abstract = {{The Carpentarian rock-rat (Zyzomys palatalis) is a critically
   endangered endemic rodent known from only four sandstone gorges in the

   surrounded by a Eucalypt savanna matrix. The long-term persistence of
   Z. palatalis is threatened by altered fire regimes, grazing by feral
   animals and stock, weed intrusion, and the stochastic hazards
   associated with small, fragmented populations. To assess the relative
   importance of these threats and develop practical management options, a
   population and habitat simulation model was developed, based on the
   best existing data. Population viability was predicted to be highly
   sensitive to the frequency of hot, late dry-season fires. Progressive
   habitat degradation (due predominantly to intense late dry-season
   fires) is likely to substantially reduce population size and lead to
   the probable extinction of the species within the next 100 years. The
   most effective management strategy to counteract this threat would be
   regular, controlled, fuel reduction bums in the vegetation around the
   gorge entrances during the early dry season. Establishing a new

Abstract = {{Wild populations face threats both from deterministic factors, e.g.,

   Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5,

Abstract = {{1. Population viability analyses (PVAs) are commonly used to identify
   species of concern. Many PVA techniques assume that all populations are
   regulated by a single mechanism.
   2. We compared population viability predictions for three subspecies of
   sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.) based on the assumptions that: (i)
   population regulation was density-independent vs. dependent on more
   complex feedback mechanisms; (ii) the mechanism of population
   regulation was homogeneous within a region vs. heterogeneous among
   leks; (iii) environmental variation was spatially correlated within
   regions vs. uncorrelated among leks.
   3. We used sage grouse as a model species for this analysis because
   counts of lekking male grouse are available in some areas since the
   1950s, these counts are known to fluctuate widely, and sage grouse
   appear to be declining throughout their range.
   4. We fit population regulation models to data including
   density-independence, density-dependence, delayed density-dependence
   and a simplified version of Turchin \& Taylor's (1992) response surface
   model.
   5. We show that the best-fit models typically include spatial
   heterogeneity in mechanisms of population regulation. Inclusion of
   spatial heterogeneity increased expected time for population
   persistence, and changed the rank order of risk of extinction for
   different regions.
   6. We suggest that it is important to consider multiple models of

   implemented a plan to establish one benchmark population in each of six
   different biogeoclimatic zones in the province. How many bears and how
   large an area for each benchmark remains in question. In this paper I
   estimate the minimum number of bears and the areal size required to
   accommodate environmental and demographic stochastic effects that can
   result in quasi-extinction thresholds of N < 100 animals. Demographic
   data were compiled from six different grizzly bear studies in North
   America and mean values and standard deviations were entered into a
   Leslie matrix to conduct a Population Viability Analysis (PVA). I
   varied initial population sizes from 100, 150, 200, and 250 animals and
   carrying capacities from 1/2K, 3/4K, and K. Results indicated that
   200-250 bears were required for a sufficiently small probability (P <
   0.05) of decline to a quasi-extinction threshold of 27 adult female
   bears (N < 100 animals total) within 20 years and a mean time to
   extinction > 20 years. Reserve sizes varied from 8556 km(2) to 17,843
   km(2) depending on population density in each benchmark. These minimum
   viable populations and reserve sizes would protect approximately 12\%
   of the estimated provincial grizzly bear population and would cover
   approximately 5\% of the landmass of BC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study investigated the recent demise of a koala population at
   Iluka in eastern Australia and demonstrates the potential role of
   population viability analysis (PVA) in the recovery and management of
   similar small populations. Information about the Iluka population was
   reconstructed from various sources, including community knowledge,
   wildlife carer data, and from a radiotracking program. Modelling
   scenarios were constructed to identify which factors may be critical to
   the survival of the Iluka population and which management options could
   provide the most effective means of its recovery. The model suggested
   that even substantial improvements in mortality and fertility alone do
   not prevent the modelled population declining towards extinction.
   Rebuilding of the koala population is likely to require guaranteed
   regular immigration of animals of both sexes in conjunction with
   considerable improvements in population mortality and fertility. This
   highlights the importance of the metapopulation for recruitment, an
   outcome that was not expected prior to modelling. These modelling
   outcomes suggest that the management of small, local populations of
   koalas will need a concerted management effort focusing on multiple
   causes of population change. Local management actions, such as reducing
   road deaths and managing habitat and fire, must be accompanied by
   knowledge of the larger geographical population. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. During the past 15 years, models have been used increasingly in
   predictive population ecology. Matrix models used for predicting the
   fates of populations are often extremely basic, ignoring density
   dependence, spatial scale and behaviour, and often based on one sex
   only. We tested the importance of some of these omissions for model
   realism, by comparing the performance of a variety of population models
   of varying levels of complexity.
   2. Detailed data from more than 13 years of behavioural and demographic
   research on a population of alpine marmots Marmota marmota in
   Berchtesgaden National Park, southern Germany, were used to
   parameterize four different population models. The models ranged from a
   simple population-based matrix model, to a spatially explicit
   behaviour-based model.
   3. The performance of the models was judged by their ability to predict
   basic population dynamics under equilibrium conditions. Only a
   spatially explicit individual-based model ignoring optimal behaviour
   predicted dynamics significantly different to those observed in the
   field, highlighting the importance of considering realistic patterns of
   behaviour in spatially explicit models.
   4. Using realistic levels of environmental and demographic
   stochasticity, variance in population growth rates predicted by all
   models was high, even within the range of population densities
   experienced in the field. This emphasizes the difficulty of using
   population-level field data to determine overall patterns of density
   dependence for use in population models.
   5. All models were also used to predict potential density-dependent
   effects on alpine marmot population growth. In this regard, the models
   differed greatly. It was concluded that the simplest matrix model was
   adequate for making predictions regarding population sizes or densities
   under equilibrium conditions, but that for predictions requiring an
   understanding of transient dynamics only the behavioural model would be
   adequate.
   6. An emergent feature of this study of alpine marmot population
   dynamics was the prediction of a demographic Allee effect with a
   profound influence on population dynamics across a very broad range of
   population sizes. Three mechanisms were identified as underlying this
   Allee effect: stochastic skews in sex ratio and demographic composition
   at low population sizes; less efficient social thermoregulation during
   hibernation in small groups', and difficulties with mate finding during
   dispersal, even at relatively high population sizes.}},

Abstract = {{How is a species' propensity to vary in size over time related to its
   chances to be listed on the Red List (Red Book), that is to face the
   risk of extinction? Here I suggest that the linkage between the range
   of population fluctuations and chance of listing may be established on
   the basis of the ratio of species' annual fecundity to annual mortality
   of adults, B/M. For 23 mammalian species inhabiting the vast tracts of
   Western Siberia, the range of population fluctuations is found to be
   equal or at least proportional to B/M, Further, this ratio is estimated
   for a larger set of 90 mammalian species from the territory and coastal
   waters of the former Soviet Union, of which 25 species are listed in
   the Red Book of the USSR. The distribution of the Red Book species over
   the gradient of B/M is clearly non-uniform: most of them have low B/M,
   which leads to a negative relationship between chance of listing and
   B/M. The positive relation between population size variability and B/M
   and the negative relation between chance of listing and B/M suggest the
   resulting negative relation between chance of listing and population
   size variability. Both the positive and the negative relations of,
   respectively, population size variability and chance of listing on B/M
   are logically justified since B/M is a measure of the population growth
   rate: it is the total lifetime offspring and an upper estimate of the
   growth rate per generation time. Fast-growing, more resilient species
   tend to be more resistant to extinction and hence to have low chance of
   listing, but simultaneously are able to fluctuate widely. Thus, so long
   as population growth rate affects both chance of listing and population
   size variability, high variability implies low chance of listing.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of rare and endangered species are based on work carried
   out within one generation, or over one to a few generations of the
   study organism. We report the results of a study that spans 30
   generations (years) of the entire natural range of a butterfly race
   that is endemic to 35 km(2) of north Wales, UK. Short-term studies
   (surveys in single years and dynamics over 4 years) of this system led
   to the prediction that the regional distribution would be quite stable,
   and that colonization and extinction dynamics would be relatively
   unimportant. However, a longer-term study revealed unexpectedly high
   levels of population turnover (local extinction and colonization),
   affecting 18 out of the 20 patches that were occupied at any time
   during the period. Modelling the system (using the `incidence function
   model' (IFM) for metapopulations) also showed higher levels of
   colonization and extinction with increasing duration of the study. The
   longer-term dynamics observed in this system can be compared, at a
   metapopulation level, with the increased levels of variation observed
   with increasing time that have been observed in single populations.
   Long-term changes may arise from local changes in the environment that
   make individual patches more or less suitable for the butterfly, or
   from unusual colonization or extinction events that take
   metapopulations into alternative states. One implication is that
   metapopulation and population viability analyses based on studies that
   cover only a few animal or plant generations may underestimate
   extinction threats.}},

Abstract = {{As metapopulation dynamics is thought to play an important role in the

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a commonly used tool in
   endangered species management. There is no single process that
   constitutes PVA, but all approaches have in common all assessment of a
   population's risk of extinction (or quasi extinction) or its projected
   population growth either under current conditions or expected from
   proposed management. As model sophistication increases, and software
   programs that facilitate PVA without the need for modeling expertise
   become more available, there is greater potential for the misuse of
   models and increased confusion over interpreting their results.
   Consequently, we discuss the practical use and limitations of PVA in
   conservation planning, and we discuss some emerging issues of PVA. We
   review extant issues that have become prominent in PTA, including
   spatially explicit modeling, sensitivity analysis, incorporating
   genetics into PVA, PVA in plants, and PVA software packages, but our
   coverage of emerging issues is not comprehensive. We conclude that PVA
   is a powerful tool in conservation biology for comparing alternative
   research plans and relative extinction risks among species, but the
   suggest caution in its use: (1) because PVA is a model, its validity
   depends on the appropriateness of the model's structure and data
   quality; (2) results should be presented with appropriate assessment of
   confidence; (3) model construction and results should be subject to
   external review, and (4) model structure, input, and results should be
   treated as hypotheses to be tested. We also suggest (5) restricting the
   definition of PVA to development of a formal quantitative model, (6)
   focusing more research on determining how pervasive density-dependence
   feedback is across species, and (7) not using PVA to determine minimum
   population size or (8) the specific probability of reaching extinction.
   The most appropriate use of PVA may be for comparing the relative
   effects of potential management actions on population growth or

Abstract = {{The results are described of comparisons between actual values for
   patch occupancy for two species of Australian small mammals (Bush Rat
   Rattus fuscipes and Agile Antechinus Antechinus agilis) determined from
   field sampling and predictions of patch occupancy made using VORTEX, a
   generic simulation model for Population Viability Analysis (PVA). The
   work focussed on a fragmented forest in south-eastern Australia
   comprised of a network of 39 patches of native eucalypt forest
   surrounded by extensive stands of exotic softwood Radiata Pine (Pinus
   radiata) plantation. A range of modelling scenarios were completed in
   which four broad factors were varied: (1) inter-patch variation in
   habitat quality; (2) the Pattern of inter-patch dispersal; (3) the rate
   of interpatch dispersal; and (4) the population sink effects of the
   Radiata Pine matrix that surrounded the eucalypt patches. Model
   predictions were made for the total number of animals, the distribution
   of animal density among patches, the total number of occupied patches,
   and the probability of patch occupancy. Predictions were then compared
   with observed values for these same measures based on extensive field
   surveys of small mammals in the patch system. For most models for the
   Bush Rat, the predicted relative density of animals per patch
   correlated well with the values estimated from field surveys.
   Predictions of patch occupancy were not significantly different from
   the actual value for the number of occupied patches in half the models
   tested. The better models explained 10-16\% of the log-likelihood of
   the probability of patch occupancy. While some of the models gave
   reasonable forecasts of the number of occupied patches, even in these
   cases, they had only moderate ability to predict which patches were
   occupied. Field surveys revealed there was no relationship between
   patch area and population density for the Agile Antechinus-an outcome
   correctly predicted by only a few models. Five of the 18 scenarios
   completed for the Agile Antechinus gave predicted numbers of occupied
   patches not significantly different from the observed number. In each
   of these five cases, large standard deviations around the mean
   predicted value meant uncertainty generated by the simulation model
   limited the predictive power of the PVA. Some of the models gave
   reasonable predictions for the number of occupied patches, but those
   models were unable to predict which ones were actually occupied. The
   results of our study suggest that key processes influencing which
   specific patches would be occupied were not modelled appropriately.
   High levels of variability and fecundity drive the population dynamics
   of the Bush Rat and Agile Antechinus, making the patch system
   unpredictable and difficult to model accurately. Despite the fact that
   both the Bush Rat and the Agile Antechinus are two of the most studied
   mammals in Australia, there are attributes of their biology that are
   presently poorly understood (which were not included in the VORTEX
   model), but which could strongly influence patch occupancy. For
   example, local landscape features may be important determinants of
   inter-patch movement and habitat utilisation in the patch system.
   Further empirical studies are needed to explore this aspect of small
   mammal biology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the research conducted on the effects of endocrine disrupting

   levels of biological organization. While there have been some notable
   cases where field studies were used to demonstrate effects of EDCs on
   exposed populations in the wild, there has been relatively little
   research addressing the quantitative linkage between effects at the
   individual level and effects at the population level. The present study
   provides an example of linking markers of endocrine effects to
   indicators of population level effect using basic population models and
   published data for a fish species often used in laboratory studies, the
   fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Additionally, the relation
   between life history strategy and stressor response is explored using
   population models for two bird species, European kingfisher (Alcedo
   atthis) and least tern (Sterna antillarum browni), with markedly
   different life history strategies. As these examples demonstrate,
   populations of species that have different life history strategies can
   respond differently to a stressor producing responses of similar type

   predictions from various classes of population-level model has had
   success in increasing populations of at-risk species. However, such
   models might not meet policy demand for more accurate predictions of
   the extent of population recovery. This is because, by necessity, they
   often extrapolate from known data to predict the effect of new
   environmental conditions. Behaviourally structured population models
   could deliver greater prediction accuracy because they can truly
   predict population-level responses to novel situations. If such an
   approach can be applied to new situations, it could play an increasing
   role in the prediction of population recovery following management.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological risk assessment at the population level often involves
   predicting the effects of a particular change in the land-use patterns
   on the viability of native species. A common method of addressing such
   questions is modeling the metapopulation dynamics of the species in the
   landscape. However, the landscape and, as a result, the spatial
   structure of the metapopulation usually do not remain unchanged, thus
   the assessment of viability must incorporate the dynamic nature of the
   landscape. A new link being developed between a metapopulation modeling
   program (RAMAS) and a landscape dynamics program (LANDIS) will allow
   the transitional dynamics of the landscape to be incorporated into
   assessment of viability and threat. This approach combines methods of
   landscape prediction with those of metapopulation simulation. The link
   between the landscape model and metapopulation model is provided by
   statistical models of habitat suitability for the species in focus. (C)

Abstract = {{Stochastic matrix models are frequently used by conservation biologists
   to measure the viability of species and to explore various management
   actions. Models are typically parameterized using two or more sets of
   estimated transition rates between age/size/stage classes. While
   standard methods exist for analyzing a single set of transition rates,
   a variety of methods have been employed to analyze multiple sets of
   transition rates. We review applications of stochastic matrix models to
   problems in conservation and use simulation studies to compare the
   performance of different analytic methods currently in use. We find
   that model conclusions are likely to be robust to the choice of
   parametric distribution used to model vital rate fluctuations over
   time. However, conclusions can be highly sensitive to the within-year
   correlation structure among vital rates, and therefore we suggest using
   analytical methods that provide a means of conducting a sensitivity
   analysis with respect to correlation parameters. Our simulation results
   also suggest that the precision of population viability estimates can
   be improved by using matrix models that incorporate environmental
   covariates in conjunction with experiments to estimate transition rates
   under a range of environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate long-term series of demographic data are available for most
   populations of southern elephant seals. However, research on the
   elephant seals of the Falkland Islands began only recently, and
   information for an accurate forecasting of the future of this
   population is lacking. In this paper we present data on the current
   status of the population and its trend in size during the last Il
   years. We built an age-structured model of the population and analyzed
   the effect of variation in demographic parameters on population growth.
   Elasticity analysis demonstrated that variation in mortality has a more
   pronounced effect on instantaneous growth rate than an equivalent
   variation in fecundity. We examined the effects of environmental
   variability, inbreeding and catastrophes on population viability by a
   computer simulation using the VORTEX PVA programme. In the stochastic
   model, the most important factor affecting extinction risk was
   variability in mortality rates, in particular of the adult classes. We
   concluded that, although the population does not appear to be at
   immediate risk of extinction, its small size and isolation make it
   necessary to accurately monitor the population trends and to acquire
   additional information on life history and feeding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that conservation biology is proceeding along two
   separate trajectories (Caughley 1994) has provoked extensive
   discussion. Caughley's dichotomy, a ``small-population{''} paradigm
   versus a ``declining-population{''} paradigm, has recently been
   exemplified in discussion of management strategies for conservation of
   the Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch). Recommendations from extensive
   fieldwork focused on reducing the major known threat to the
   species-habitat destruction-and proposed a strategy of forest
   management and protection. A population and habitat viability analysis
   focused on an entirely different issue-low genetic diversity-and
   proposed a program of single-species genetic management. It is not
   surprising that geneticists see inbreeding as a major conservation
   problem, and it is not unusual that ecologists focus on how ecology
   relates to conservation. A problem results when managers assume that
   addressing only one or the other of these factors is the appropriate
   conservation action. Conservation biologists must learn to thoroughly
   analyze every conservation problem before trying to solve it. We must
   actively involve experts from all fields in forming and reviewing
   conservation strategies. If only captive breeding specialists or
   ecologists are invited to address a problem, then the techniques
   employed to solve it will be irrevocably biased. We do not all see the
   world in the same way, even within the relatively small field of
   conservation. To achieve effective conservation action, we must learn
   to balance and capitalize on our different perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) packages do not always allow

   for a cycling Soay sheep population, Ovis aries L., that grows,
   overeats its habitat and then suffers high winter mortality. We
   compared projections of PVA models for the sheep that incorporated
   either an unrealistic ceiling carrying capacity using INMAT (the only
   choice) and VORTEX (the default)? or realistic density dependence for
   survival (VORTEX). At year 50, the ceiling models predicted extinction
   probabilities of 60.4\% (INMAT) and 87.4\% (VORTEX), compared to only
   4.6\% for the density-dependent model. Small populations were equally
   likely to increase or decrease with the ceiling models, while they had
   high probabilities of increase with the density-dependent model, as
   found in reality. PVA cannot be relied upon to produce realistic
   projections if inappropriate mechanisms of population regulation are
