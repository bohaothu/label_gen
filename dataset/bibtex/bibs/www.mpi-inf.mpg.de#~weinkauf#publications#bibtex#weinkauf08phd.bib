  abstract = {Analyzing large and high-dimensional flow data sets is a non-trivial
              task and favorably carried out using sophisticated tools which allow
              to concentrate on the most relevant information and to automate the
              analysis. These goals can be achieved using topological methods,
              which foster target-oriented studies of the most important flow features.
              They have a variety of applications which ranges from a skeletal
              representation of the overall flow behavior to a detailed analysis
              of vortex structures.
              
              This thesis presents novel algorithms and approaches for the extraction,
              tracking and visualization of topological structures of vector fields.
              The new concept of connectors is introduced which allows visually
              simplified representations of topological skeletons of complex 3D
              vector fields. The first visualization technique for 3D higher order
              critical points and the corresponding classification are presented.
              Based on this theory, two novel applications for the topological
              simplification and construction of 3D vector fields have been developed.
              Furthermore, the first generic approach to feature extraction is
              presented, which allows to extract and track a rich variety of geometrically
              defined, local and global features evolving in scalar and vector
              fields. The use of generic concepts and grid independent algorithms
              aims at a broad applicability of the extraction methods while alleviating
              the implementational expenses. Further contributions include the
              first topology-based visualization approach for two-parameter-dependent
              2D vector fields and a thorough study of vortex structures. The usefulness
              of the newly developed methods is shown by applying them to analyze
              a number of data sets.
