                 family of RISC workstations and servers is described.
                 The RISC System\slash 6000 family is based on the new
                 IBM POWER (performance optimization with enhanced RISC)
                 architecture; the hardware implementation takes
                 advantage of this powerful RISC architecture and
                 employs sophisticated design techniques to achieve a
                 short cycle time and a low cycles-per-instruction (CPI)
                 ratio. The RS\slash 6000 CPU features
                 multiple-instruction dispatch, multiple functional
                 units that operate concurrently, separate instruction
                 and data caches, and zero-cycle branches. In this
                 superscalar implementation, at a given cycle the
                 equivalent of five operations can be executed
                 simultaneously (a branch, a condition-register
                 operation, and a floating-point multiply-add). The
                 RS\slash 6000 family supports the IBM Micro Channel

  abstract =     "The PowerPC AS* A10 64-bit RISC microprocessor is a
                 4.7-million-transistor integrated circuit design, using
                 IBM CMOS 5L 0.5-$\mu$m, 3-V, four-level-metal ASIC
                 technology. Support for the PowerPC AS architecture is
                 implemented in a 213-mm$^2$ die using a semicustom
                 design methodology. Chip density and speed are enhanced
                 through the use of custom macros and multiport arrays.
                 An on-chip phase-locked-loop circuit is used to reduce
                 chip-to-chip clock skew. Full utilization of the
                 four-level-metal interconnect technology was achieved
                 through architectural floorplanning, performance
                 clustering, and timing-driven placement and wiring,
                 with a total wire length of over 102 meters placed on
                 the 14.6 $\times$ 14.6-mm die. The microprocessor is a
                 pipelined, superscalar design with five separate
                 functional units, a 4KB instruction cache, and an 8KB
                 data cache. The design includes parity,
                 error-correction, and error-logging functions, as well
                 as self-test for logic and arrays during power-on. The
                 design is robust and implements a wide range of
                 performance configurations at the system level,
                 allowing direct attachment of DRAM to the processor, or
                 high-performance L2 cache options using high-speed
                 SRAM. An on-chip system I/O bus and bus controller are
                 provided for attachment of peripherals.",

                 compared using the SPEC benchmarks. MIPS typically
                 executes more user-level instructions than SPARC. This
                 difference can be accounted for by architectural
                 differences, compiler differences, and library
                 differences. The most significant differences are that
                 SPARC's double-precision floating point load/store is
                 an architectural advantage in the SPEC floating point
                 benchmarks while MIPS's compare-and-branch instruction
                 is an architectural advantage in the SPEC integer
                 benchmarks. After the differences in the two
                 architectures are isolated, it appears that although
                 MIPS and SPARC each have strengths and weaknesses in
                 their compilers and library routines, the combined
                 effect of compilers and library routines does not give

  abstract =     "The increasing demands for greater processor
                 performance to remain competitive in today's computer
                 market necessitate careful attention to the methods
                 used in designing processors to achieve these
                 performance goals. Processor designs are increasing in
                 complexity to meet performance goals, with such
                 features as out-of-order execution and super-scalar
                 operation. Design cycles are decreasing in length, so
                 design quality must increase as well. All of these
                 factors call for new design techniques to ensure
                 continued success. This paper presents some of the
                 design methodologies and choices used in the design of
                 the HP PA 8000 CPU, the first HP processor to implement
                 the PA-RISC 2.0 architecture and the first capable of
                 64-bit operation. The various design methods used in
                 the PA 8000, specific design techniques for the new
                 packaging technology used, the clock distribution
                 scheme, and cross-chip signal integrity issues are
                 discussed. We also present some of the new tools and
                 techniques employed by HP to ensure a high level of
                 quality on first silicon, based in large part on our

                 a low-cost, low-power, high-performance engine in a
                 single-chip superscalar microprocessor. Using less than

                 (the size of the PowerPC 603e microprocessor is 98
                 mm$^{2}$) and operating at the peak clock frequency of
                 100 MHz, an average single-pumping multiply-add-fuse
                 instruction has one-cycle throughput and four-cycle

                 latency. The estimated performance at 100 MHz is 105

                 processors is evaluated based on empirical data from 12
                 benchmarks. This evaluation is done in the context of
                 two software instruction scheduling optimizations: loop
                 unrolling and software pipelining, and for three
                 machine models: 1-scalar, 2-scalar and 4-scalar. The
                 authors also consider the effect of the memory system
                 on the performance improvements. Superscalar hardware
                 alone exhibit little performance improvement without
                 software optimization. Of the two scheduling methods,
                 software pipelining more effectively takes advantage of
                 increased hardware parallelism, and achieves near
                 optimal speedup on the 4-scalar machine model. The
                 performance of loop unrolling is restricted by the
                 limited number of floating point registers in the SPARC
                 architecture. The best performance level is obtained by
                 applying both optimization techniques. A superscalar
                 SPARC processor can provide improved floating point
                 performance but with significant software and hardware

                 minutes of operation, and performance drops by 30\% to
                 75\%. The Athlon4 shows no such behavior. The Pentium4
                 also shows different benchmark behavior under different
                 operating systems, while the Athlon4 does not. The

  abstract =     "The HP PA 8000 and PA 8200 PA-RISC CPUs are the first
                 implementations of a new generation of microprocessors
                 from Hewlett--Packard. The PA 8000 is among the world's
                 most powerful and advanced microprocessors, and at the
                 time of introduction in January 1996, the undisputed
                 performance leader. The PA 8200, introduced in June
                 1997, continues this performance leadership with higher
                 frequency larger caches, and several other
                 enhancements. Both processors feature an aggressive
                 four-way superscalar implementation, combining
                 speculative execution with on-the-fly instruction
                 reordering. This paper discusses the objectives for the
                 design of these processors, some of the key
                 architectural features, implementation details, and
                 system performance. The operation of the instruction
                 reorder buffer (IRB), which provides out-of-order
                 execution capability, is also described.",

                 member of a family of processors that support IBM's

                 processor based on a superscalar design point. As with
                 any development effort, the 601 development program had
                 several different, often conflicting, design goals. The
                 most important requirements were support for the
                 PowerPC Architecture, a short development cycle,
                 competitive performance and cost, compatibility with
                 existing POWER applications, and support for
                 multiprocessing. This paper describes several aspects
                 of the 601 design and discusses some of the design
