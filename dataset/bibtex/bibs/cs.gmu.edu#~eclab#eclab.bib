                  several novel approaches to security of complex

                  development of a class of computer tools for
                  infrastructure protection.  First, the paper
                  introduces the concept of proactive infrastructure
                  security and compares it with reactive security. The
                  comparison is done in the context of the generation

                  scenarios, which are also introduced and
                  described. Next, the paper discusses both the
                  evolutionary and co-evolutionary generation of
                  terrorist and security scenarios and discusses

  Abstract =	 {This paper explores the state of the art in
                  structural design inspired by nature and proposes an
                  improved understanding of this emerging paradigm and
                  its major components. First, it introduces and
                  discusses the nature of three categories of
                  inspiration, including visual, conceptual, and
                  computational inspiration. Next, several important
                  inspiration sources are identified and briefly
                  described, including Evolutionary Computation,
                  Coevolutionary Computation, Cellular Automata, and
                  TRIZ. In particular, design generation mechanisms
                  based on cellular automata are introduced with some
                  details. They are inspired by the processes of
                  morphogenesis occurring in nature and have great
                  potential to generate novel designs.  In this case,
                  the design generation mechanisms are encoded in
                  so-called generative representations, which are also
                  described. Three major design objectives are
                  introduced and discussed, namely optimality,
                  creativity, and robustness.  They are related to the
                  sources of inspiration and the corresponding
                  computational mechanisms inspired by nature.  Also,
                  three levels of integration of computational
                  mechanisms inspired by nature are proposed and their
                  relationship to design objectives is
                  discussed. Finally, a general design situation, when
                  inspiration by nature is considered, is introduced
                  and its unified description is proposed as the first
                  step in the direction of building a unified approach
                  to structural design inspired by nature.  The paper
                  provides initial conclusions and discusses the most
                  promising directions for future research.},

  Abstract =	 {Genetic programming may be seen as a recent
                  incarnation of a long-held goal in evolutionary
                  computation: to develop actual computational devices
                  through evolutionary search.  Genetic programming is
                  particularly attractive because of the generality of
                  its application, but it has rarely been used in
                  environments requiring iteration, recursion, or
                  internal state. In this paper we investigate a
                  version of genetic programming developed originally
                  by Astro Teller called neural programming. Neural
                  programming has a cyclic graph representation which
                  lends itself naturally to implicit internal state
                  and recurrence, but previously has been used
                  primarily for problems which do not need these
                  features. In this paper we show a successful
                  application of neural programming to various
                  partially observable Markov decision processes,
                  originally developed for the learning classifier
                  system community, and which require the use of
                  internal state and iteration.},

  Abstract =	 {What if traffic lights gave you a break after you've
                  spent a long time waiting in traffic elsewhere? In
                  this paper we examine a variety of multi-agent
                  traffic light controllers which consider vehicles'
                  past stopped-at-red histories. For example, a
                  controller might distribute credits to cars as they
                  wait and award the green light to lanes with the
                  most credits, allowing cars to keep the credits they
                  accumulate during travel. Such history-based
                  controllers are intended to provide a kind of global
                  fairness, reducing the variance in mean time spent
                  waiting at lights during trips. We compare these
                  controllers against other multi-agent controllers
                  which only consider present information, and
                  discover, among other things, that while the
                  history-based controllers are among the most robust,
                  they often unexpectedly provide more efficiency than

  Abstract =	 {Solutions to non-cooperative multiagent systems
                  often require achieving a joint policy which is as
                  fair to all parties as possible. There are a variety
                  of methods for determining the fairest such joint
                  policy. One approach, min fairness, finds the policy
                  which maximizes the minimum average reward given to
                  any agent. We focus on an extension, leximin
                  fairness, which breaks ties among candidate policies
                  by choosing the one which maximizes the
                  second-to-minimum average reward, then the
                  third-to-minimum average reward, and so on. This
                  method has a number of advantages over others in the
                  literature, but has so far been little-used because
                  of the computational cost in employing it to find
                  the fairest policy. In this paper we propose a
                  linear programming based algorithm for computing
                  leximin fairness in repeated games which has a

                  few years in the design and implementation of

                  extension of this work is to consider solving
                  difficult tasks with teams of cooperating agents.
                  Our interest in this area is motivated in part by
                  our involvement in a Navy-sponsored micro air
                  vehicle (MAV) project in which the goal is to solve
                  difficult surveillance tasks using a large team of
                  small inexpensive autonomous air vehicles rather
                  than a few expensive piloted vehicles.  Our approach
                  to developing control programs for this MAVs is to
                  use evolutionary computation techniques to evolve
                  behavioral rule sets.  In this paper we describe our

  Abstract =	 {Several researchers have used Price's equation (from
                  biology theory literature) to analyze the various
                  components of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) while
                  it is running, giving insights into the components
                  contributions and interactions.  While their results
                  are interesting, they are also limited by the fact
                  that Price's equation was designed to work with the
                  averages of population fitness.  The EA
                  practitioner, on the other hand, is typically
                  interested in the best individuals in the
                  population, not the average. In this paper we
                  introduce an approach to using Price's equation
                  which instead calculates the upper tails of
                  population distributions. By applying Price's
                  equation to EAs that use survival selection instead
                  of parent selection, this information is calculated
                  automatically.},

  Abstract =	 {Generalization is an important aspect of all machine
                  learning algorithms. Without it, learning can only
                  occur in the simplest of problem domains. The most
                  interesting domains tend to be more complex
                  though. As we scale-up our algorithms to work in
                  these complex domains, an understanding of the
                  different generalization techniques available and
                  the trade-offs between them becomes increasingly
                  important. This thesis is primarily concerned with
                  rule learning using evolutionary algorithms. We
                  examine two commonly used generalization techniques
                  called wildcards and partial matching, as well as a
                  third which is a hybrid of these two.  We
                  demonstrate that the wildcards are more effective at
                  generalizing in some domains, and partial matching
                  is more effective in others. It is our hypothesis
                  that the hybrid will be the more robust of the three
                  techniques. In other words, the hybrid will
                  generalize as well, or almost as well, as the better
                  of the other two in a variety of domains. Two very
                  different domains were chosen as testbeds for our
                  experiments. The first is a concept learning domain,
                  which tends to favor wildcards. The second is a
                  multi-agent robotics task, where partial matching is
                  more effective. When the hybrid was tested in these
                  environments, the results show that it was either
                  equivalent or superior to the other two techniques,
                  thus verifying our hypothesis. Finally we attempt to
                  find an explanation for these results that will help
                  predict behavior in other domains. We examine how
                  these generalization techniques alter the inductive
                  bias of the learning algorithm. The analysis
                  demonstrates weaknesses in both wildcards and
                  partial matching. It also suggests that the
                  weaknesses of each technique is offset by the
                  strength of the other, thus allowing the hybrid to
                  be more effective. An attempt was made to verify the
                  inductive bias explanation. We use this knowledge to
                  devise a concept learning problem which will favor
                  partial matching instead of wildcards. But the
                  results of this experiment show that the most
                  accurate classifiers were produced using the
                  wildcard generalization mechanism. The inductive
                  bias hypothesis is clearly helpful for understanding
                  some of the behaviors observed in the learning
                  algorithm. None the less, further study will be
                  required to understand a problem as complex as this
                  one fully.},

                  simulation outcomes as described in Growing

                  significant replication of the rules and simulation
                  outcomes; code supplied with Repast, Swarm, and
                  NetLogo implement a minority of the rules in
                  Sugarscape. In particular, the standard Repast
                  distribution only implements Growback, Movement, and
                  Replacement. Sugarscape implementations in these

  Abstract =	 {Multi sensor remote sensing provides real time high
                  resolution data that can be used to study anomalous
                  changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere
                  associated with an impending earthquake. Anomalous
                  behavior in Surface Latent Heat Flux (SLHF) prior to
                  large coastal earthquakes has been recently
                  found. However, an SLHF time series usually contains
                  several sharp peaks that may be associated either
                  with earthquakes or with atmospheric
                  perturbations. In this paper we have used
                  evolutionary algorithms to perform a search in a
                  large space bounded by longitude, latitude and time,
                  to distinguish between signals associated with
                  earthquakes and those associated with atmospheric
                  phenomena. The algorithm finds paths which delimit
                  the extent of the detected anomalies by optimizing
                  an objective function that takes into consideration
                  several aspects, such as spatial and time
                  continuity, the magnitude of the anomalies, and the
                  distance to the continental boundary. This search
                  strategy is crucial for the development of a fully
                  automated early warning system for providing
                  information about impending earthquakes in a
                  seismically active coastal region. Experiments have
                  been performed over a 2000 km2 area comprising a
                  part of the continental boundary between the African
                  and Eurasian plate, roughly corresponding to Italy
                  and Greece, one of the most seismically active
                  regions. Using a 365-days-long time series, we
                  identified three signals associated with seismic
                  events. Additionally, it was possible to establish
                  that the extent of the signal does not propagate
                  further than 600 km from the epicenter of the

                  computational multi-agent social simulation models

                  information-processing structure in terms of basic
                  cognitive elements. In particular, memory is usually
                  not explicitly modeled. We present initial results
                  from a new prototype called ``Wetlands'', designed
                  to investigate the effect of group memory structures
                  and interaction situations on emergent patterns of
                  sociality or collective intentionality.
                  Specifically, we report on initial computational
                  experiments conducted on culturally-differentiated
                  agents endowed with finite and degradable memory

                  with the environment. The use of GAs is motivated by
                  recent studies showing the effects of various forms
                  of bias built into different concept learning
                  systems, resulting in systems that perform well on
                  certain concept classes (generally, those well
                  matched to the biases) and poorly on others. By
                  incorporating a GA as the underlying adaptive search
                  mechanism, we are able to construct a concept
                  learning system that has a simple, unified
                  architecture with several important features. First,
                  the system is surprisingly robust even with minimal
                  bias. Second, the system can be easily extended to
                  incorporate traditional forms of bias found in other
                  concept learning systems.  Finally, the architecture
                  of the system encourages explicit representation of
                  such biases and, as a result, provides for an
                  important additional feature: the ability to
                  dynamically adjust system bias. The viability of
                  this approach is illustrated by comparing the
                  performance of GABIL with that of four other more
                  traditional concept learners (AQ14, C4.5, ID5R, and
                  IACL) on a variety of target concepts. We conclude
                  with some observations about the merits of this
                  approach and about possible extensions.},

  Abstract =	 {On the basis of early theoretical and empirical
                  studies, genetic algorithms have typically used 1
                  and 2-point crossover operators as the standard
                  mechanisms for implementing recombination. However,
                  there have been a number of recent studies,
                  primarily empirical in nature, which have shown the
                  benefits of crossover operators involving a higher
                  number of crossover points. From a traditional
                  theoretical point of view, the most surprising of
                  these new results relate to uniform crossover, which
                  involves on the average L / 2 crossover points for
                  strings of length L. In this paper we extend the
                  existing theoretical results in an attempt to
                  provide a broader explanatory and predictive theory
                  of the role of multi-point crossover in genetic
                  algorithms. In particular, we extend the traditional
                  disruption analysis to include two general forms of
                  multi-point crossover: n-point crossover and uniform
                  crossover. We also analyze two other aspects of
                  multi-point crossover operators, namely, their
                  recombination potential and exploratory power. The
                  results of this analysis provide a much clearer view
                  of the role of multi-point crossover in genetic
                  algorithms. The implications of these results on

  Abstract =	 {A strategy for using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to
                  solve NP-complete problems is presented. The key
                  aspect of the approach taken is to exploit the
                  observation that, although all NP-complete problems
                  are equally difficult in a general computational
                  sense, some have much better GA representations than
                  others, leading to much more successful use of GAs
                  on some NP-complete problems than on others. Since
                  any NP-complete problem can be mapped into any other
                  one in polynomial time, the strategy described here
                  consists of identifying a canonical NP-complete
                  problem on which GAs work well, and solving other
                  NP-complete problems indirectly by mapping them onto
                  the canonical problem. Initial empirical results are
                  presented which support the claim that the Boolean
                  Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is a GA effective
                  canonical problem, and that other NP complete
                  problems with poor GA representations can be solved
                  efficiently by mapping them first onto SAT

  Abstract =	 {Choosing representations and operators that preserve
                  locality between genotype and phenotype space is an
                  important goal in EA design. In the GA literature
                  there has been considerable discussion of this issue
                  with respect to the choice between standard binary
                  encoding and Gray codes. In this paper we argue that
                  an important and unappreciated aspect of such
                  discussions is the degree to which locality
                  preservation is isotropic in phenotype space (i.e.,
                  independent of location in phenospace). We show that
                  using a traditional bit-flip mutation operator with
                  either of these two representations results in
                  rather weak isotropic locality. These insights lead
                  to the design of a new binary mutation operator that
                  increases isotropic locality. The results from an
                  initial set of experiments supports the hypothesis
                  that this improvement in isotropic locality leads to

                  diffusion equation. It has physical plausibility and
                  handles well different shaped and sized diffusion
                  neighborhoods in the sense that it achieves
                  isotropic diffusion in spite of the bias introduced
                  by the discretizing grid. It provides one
                  formulation that encapsulates the diffusion
                  neighborhood details and renders it applicable to
                  linear, planar, spatial and even n-dimensional
                  constructs.},

  Abstract =	 {While the gap between theory and practice is slowly
                  closing, the evolutionary computation community
                  needs to concentrate more heavily on the middle
                  ground. This paper defends the position that
                  contemporary analytical tools facilitate such a
                  concentration. Empirical research can be improved by
                  considering modern analytical techniques in
                  experimental design. In addition, formal analytical
                  extensions of empirical works are possible. We
                  justify our position by way of a constructive
                  example: we consider a recent empirically-based
                  research paper and extend it using modern techniques
                  of asymptotic analysis of run time performance of
                  the algorithms and problems investigated in that
                  paper. The result is a more general understanding of
                  the performance of these algorithms for any size of
                  input, as well as a better understanding of the
                  underlying reasons for some of the previous
                  results. Moreover, our example points out how
                  important it is that empirical researchers motivate
                  their parameter choices more clearly. We believe
                  that providing theorists with empirical studies that
                  are well-suited for formal analysis will help bridge
                  the gap between theory and practice, benefitting the
                  empiricist, the theorist, and the community at

                  function optimization framework, a very simple
                  cooperative coevolutionary (1+1) EA is defined. This
                  algorithm is investigated under the perspective of
                  the expected optimization time. The focus is on the
                  impact the cooperative coevolutionary approach has
                  and on the possible advantage it may have over more
                  traditional evolutionary approaches. Therefore, a
                  systematic comparison between the expected
                  optimization times of this coevolutionary algorithm
                  and the ordinary (1+1) EA is presented. The main
                  result is that separability of the objective
                  function alone is is not sufficient to make the
                  cooperative coevolutionary approach beneficial. By
                  presenting a clear structured example function and
                  analyzing the algorithms' performance, it is shown
                  that the cooperative coevolutionary approach comes
                  with new explorative possibilities. This can lead to

@article{jansen.wiegand:the-cooperative2004,
  Abstract =	 {Coevolutionary algorithms are variants of
                  traditional evolutionary algorithms and are often
                  considered more suitable for certain kinds of
                  complex tasks than non-coevolutionary methods. One
                  example is a general cooperative coevolutionary
                  framework for function optimization. This paper
                  presents a thorough and rigorous introductory
                  analysis of the optimization potential of
                  cooperative coevolution. Using the cooperative
                  coevolutionary framework as a starting point, the CC
                  (1+1) EA is defined and investigated from the
                  perspective of the expected optimization time. The
                  research concentrates on separability, a key
                  property of objective functions. We show that
                  separability alone is not sufficient to yield any
                  advantage of the CC (1+1) EA over its traditional,
                  non-coevolutionary counterpart. Such an advantage is
                  demonstrated to have its basis in the increased
                  explorative possibilities of the cooperative
                  coevolutionary algorithm.  For inseparable
                  functions, the cooperative coevolutionary set-up can
                  be harmful. We prove that for some objective
                  functions the CC (1+1) EA fails to locate a global
                  optimum with overwhelming probability, even in
                  infinite time; however, inseparability alone is not
                  sufficient for an objective function to cause
                  difficulties. It is demonstrated that the CC (1+1)
                  EA may perform equal to its traditional counterpart,
                  and may even outperform it on certain inseparable
                  functions.},

                  evolutionary architectures applied to a complex
                  structural design problem. The experiments were

                  evolutionary design support tool developed at George
                  Mason University.  First, a general introduction to
                  evolutionary computation is provided with an
                  emphasis on recent developments in parallel
                  evolutionary architectures. Next, a discussion of

                  structural design and for the analysis of their
                  results. It implements state-of-the-art
                  representations supporting generation of novel

  Abstract =	 {The paper introduces an integrated research and
                  design support tool, called Emergent Designer,
                  developed at George Mason University. It is a tool
                  that implements models of various complex systems,
                  including cellular automata and evolutionary
                  algorithms, to represent engineering systems and
                  design processes. The system is intended for
                  conducting design experiments in the area of
                  structural design and for the analysis of their
                  results. It implements state-of-the-art
                  representations supporting generation of novel
                  design concepts and efficient mechanisms for their
                  subsequent optimization at the topology and sizing
                  level. It also implements advanced methods, models,
                  and tools from statistics and from the linear as
                  well as nonlinear time series analysis to conduct
                  the analysis of the design processes. Thus, it is a
                  versatile tool that can be used both as a
                  state-of-the-art design support tool and as an
                  advanced research tool equipped with the methods and
                  tools for the analysis of the design processes and
                  of the obtained experimental results.},

  Abstract =	 {Evolutionary computation is emerging as a new
                  engineering computational paradigm, which may
                  significantly change the present structural design
                  practice. For this reason, an extensive study of
                  evolutionary computation in the context of
                  structural design has been conducted in the
                  Information Technology and Engineering School at
                  George Mason University and its results are reported
                  here. First, a general introduction to evolutionary
                  computation is presented and recent developments in
                  this field are briefly described. Next, the field of
                  evolutionary design is introduced and its relevance
                  to structural design is explained. Further, the
                  issue of creativity/novelty is discussed and
                  possible ways of achieving it during a structural
                  design process are suggested. Current research
                  progress in building engineering systems'
                  representations, one of the key issues in
                  evolutionary design, is subsequently
                  discussed. Next, recent developments in
                  constraint-handling methods in evolutionary
                  optimization are reported. Further, the rapidly
                  growing field of evolutionary multiobjective
                  optimization is presented and briefly described. An
                  emerging subfield of coevolutionary design is
                  subsequently introduced and its current advancements
                  reported. Next, a comprehensive review of the
                  applications of evolutionary computation in
                  structural design is provided and chronologically
                  classified. Finally, a summary of the current
                  research status and a discussion on the most
                  promising paths of future research are also

                  structural systems of tall buildings. It describes
                  results of extensive research on both short-term (up
                  to a few hundred generations) and long-term
                  evolutionary design processes (at least a few
                  thousand generations). The experiments were
                  conducted with Inventor 2001, an evolutionary design
                  support tool developed at George Mason University,
                  for generating conceptual and detailed designs of
                  steel structural systems in tall buildings. First,
                  the paper discusses conceptual design of steel
                  structural systems in tall buildings and briefly
                  introduces Inventor 2001 as well as its design
                  representation and evolutionary computation
                  characteristics. Next, it provides the results
                  obtained from systematic parametric design
                  experiments conducted with Inventor 2001. The
                  objective of these experiments was to qualitatively
                  and quantitatively investigate evolution of steel
                  structural systems of tall buildings during a
                  multistage evolutionary design process as well as
                  the influence of various evolutionary computation
                  parameters.  Mutation and crossover rates,
                  population size, the length of the evolutionary
                  processes, and the importance of symmetry
                  requirement have been analyzed and results
                  produced. Emergence of structural shaping patterns
                  has been also studied and several interesting
                  patterns found in the evolutionary design
                  process. Finally, research conclusions are presented

                  representations of steel structural systems are
                  provided and empirically investigated. These
                  representations utilize various kinds of cellular
                  automata to generate design concepts of steel
                  structures in tall buildings. In the paper, a brief
                  overview of the state-of-the-art in cellular

  Abstract =	 {Any computational approach to design, including the
                  use of evolutionary algorithms, requires the
                  transformation of the domain-specific knowledge into
                  a formal design representation. This is a difficult
                  and still not completely understood process. Its
                  critical part is the choice of a type of design
                  representation. The paper addresses this important
                  issue by presenting and discussing results of a
                  large number of design experiments in which
                  parameterized and generative representations were
                  used.  Particularly, their computational and design
                  related advantages and disadvantages were
                  investigated and compared. Evolutionary design
                  experiments reported in this paper considered two
                  classes of structural design problems, including the
                  design of a wind bracing system and the design of an
                  entire structural system in a tall building.
                  Parameterized and generative representations of the
                  structural systems were introduced and their basic
                  features discussed. The generative representations
                  investigated in the paper were inspired by the
                  processes of morphogenesis occurring in
                  nature. Specifically, one-dimensional cellular
                  automata were used to develop, or "grow," structural
                  designs from the corresponding "design embryos." The
                  conducted research led to three major
                  conclusions. First, generative representations based
                  on cellular automata proved to scale well with the
                  size of the considered design problems. Second,
                  generative representations outperformed
                  parameterized representations in minimizing weight
                  of the structural systems in our problem domain by
                  generating better designs and finding them
                  faster. Finally, extensive experimental studies
                  showed significant differences in optimal settings
                  for evolutionary design experiments for the two
                  representation types. The rate of mutation operator,
                  the size of the parent population, and the type of
                  the evolutionary algorithm were identified as the
                  evolutionary parameters having the largest impact on
                  the performance of evolutionary design processes in
                  our problem domain.},

  Abstract =	 {For a long time, engineering design research has
                  been focused on the development of various design
                  theories, methodologies, methods, tools, and
                  procedures. The design methods have been
                  subsequently used by engineers to more efficiently
                  design artifacts. However, as the artifacts have
                  grown in complexity, the need for new methods has
                  become obvious. Also, in a nowadays world, increased
                  competition and globalization require organizations
                  to reexamine traditional product development
                  strategies.  Traditional methods focused exclusively
                  on the numerical optimality of produced artifacts,
                  or their manufacturing processes, are no longer
                  adequate. Creativity and innovation of designed
                  artifacts provide organizations not only with a
                  competitive advantage but are, in fact, a matter of
                  their survival. This dissertation addresses this
                  problem by posing and answering the question: "How
                  can one construct an effective method for designing
                  engineering systems that would support development
                  of novel/creative designs and their efficient
                  optimization?" It proposes a new and conceptually
                  coherent design method, called Emergent Engineering
                  Design. The proposed design method is inspired by
                  the fundamental processes occurring in nature, which
                  has arguably created the most fascinating designs
                  known to humankind. All major phases of Emergent
                  Engineering Design are represented by complex
                  systems, including cellular automata and
                  evolutionary algorithms, which have been
                  successfully used to model the processes governing
                  the complex behavior occurring in nature. In order
                  to facilitate the development of the proposed design
                  method, Emergent Engineering Design was implemented
                  in a computer system called Emergent Designer. It is
                  an integrated research and design support tool which
                  applies models of complex systems to represent
                  engineering systems and analyze design
                  processes. Emergent Designer was used to conduct the
                  empirical validation of the proposed design method
                  for two classes of conceptual design problems in
                  structural engineering. The extensive design
                  experiments reported in this dissertation have shown
                  that Emergent Engineering Design not only generates
                  novel design concepts exhibiting remarkable
                  structural shaping patterns but it also efficiently
                  optimizes them.},

  Abstract =	 {The need to build modular, scalable, and complex
                  technology capable of adaptation, self-assembly, and
                  self-repair has fuelled renewed interest in using
                  approaches inspired by developmental biology. To
                  meet this need, a new field, called Computational
                  Development (CD), has emerged. Its focus is on
                  adapting processes and mechanisms from developmental
                  biology so as to help us build scalable, complex
                  technology. Due to the embryonic nature of the eld,
                  however, research investigating the potential of
                  such approaches for different problem domains is
                  crucial to its success. In this paper, the
                  plausibility of applying a developmental
                  biology-inspired approach to the demanding problem
                  domain of reactive robot control is explored. Using
                  developmental genetics as a source of inspiration, a
                  model of genetic regulatory networks is used in
                  conjunction with a spatially distributed
                  evolutionary algorithm to evolve real-time robot

  Abstract =	 {Agent-based modeling (ABM) has transformed social
                  science research by allowing researchers to
                  replicate or generate the emergence of empirically
                  complex social phenomena from a set of relatively
                  simple agent-based rules at the micro-level. Swarm,
                  RePast, Ascape, and others currently provide
                  simulation environments for ABM social science
                  research. After Swarm — arguably the first widely
                  used ABM simulator employed in the social sciences —
                  subsequent simulators have sought to enhance
                  available simulation tools and computational
                  capabilities by providing additional functionalities
                  and formal modeling facilities. Here we present
                  MASON (Multi-Agent Simulator Of Neighborhoods),
                  following in a similar tradition that seeks to
                  enhance the power and diversity of the available
                  scientific toolkit in computational social
                  science. MASON is intended to provide a core of
                  facilities useful not only to social science but to
                  other agent-based modeling fields such as artificial
                  intelligence and robotics. We believe this can
                  foster useful “cross-pollination” between such
                  diverse disciplines, and further that MASON's
                  additional facilities will become increasing
                  important as social complexity simulation matures
                  and grows into new approaches. We illustrate the new
                  MASON simulation library with a replication of
                  HeatBugs and a demonstration of MASON applied to two
                  challenging case studies: ant-like foragers and
                  micro-aerial agents. Other applications are also
                  being developed. The HeatBugs replication and the
                  two new applications provide an idea of MASON’s
                  potential for computational social science and
                  artificial societies.},

  Abstract =	 {With the exception of a small body of
                  adaptive-parameter literature, evolutionary
                  computation has traditionally favored keeping the
                  population size constant through the course of the
                  run. Unfortunately, genetic programming has an aging
                  problem: for various reasons, late in the run the
                  technique become less effective at
                  optimization. Given a fixed number of evaluations,
                  allocating many of them late in the run may thus not
                  be a good strategy. In this paper we experiment with
                  gradually decreasing the population size throughout
                  a genetic programming run, in order to reallocate
                  more evaluations to early generations. Our results
                  show that over four problem domains and three
                  different numbers of evaluations, decreasing the
                  population size is always as good as, and frequently
                  better than, various fixed-sized population
                  strategies.},

                  advanced considerably, revealing that genes are not

  Abstract =	 {Genetic programming has highlighted the problem of
                  bloat, the uncontrolled growth of the average size
                  of an individual in the population. The most common
                  approach to dealing with bloat in tree-based genetic
                  programming individuals is to limit their maximal
                  allowed depth. An alternative to depth limiting is
                  to punish individuals in some way based on excess
                  size, and our experiments have shown that the
                  combination of depth limiting with such a punitive
                  method is generally more effective than either
                  alone. Which such combinations are most effective at
                  reducing bloat? In this article we augment depth

                  them with one another. These methods are chosen from
                  past literature and from techniques of our own
                  devising. Testing with four genetic programming
                  problems, we identify where each bloat control
                  method performs well on a per-problem basis, and
                  under what settings various methods are effective
                  independent of problem. We report on the results of
                  these tests, and discover an unexpected winner in
                  the cross-platform category.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper discusses and compares five major
                  tree-generation algorithms for genetic programming,

                  PTC1, PTC2, RANDOM-BRANCH, and UNIFORM. The paper
                  compares the performance of these algorithms on
                  three genetic programming problems (11-Boolean
                  Multiplexer, Artificial Ant, and Symbolic
                  Regression), and discovers that the algorithms do
                  not have a significant impact on fitness.
                  Additional experimentation shows that tree size does
                  have an important impact on fitness, and further
                  that the ideal initial tree size is very different
                  from that used in traditional GP.},

  Abstract =	 {Bloat control is an important aspect of evolutionary
                  computation methods, such as genetic programming,
                  which must deal with genomes of arbitrary size. We
                  introduce three new methods for bloat control:
                  Biased Multi-Objective Parsimony Pressure (BMOPP),
                  the Waiting Room, and Death by Size. These methods
                  are unusual approaches to bloat control, and are not
                  only useful in various circumstances, but two of
                  them suggest novel approaches to attack the
                  problem. BMOPP is a more traditional
                  parsimony-pressure style bloat control method, while
                  the other two methods do not consider parsimony as
                  part of the selection process at all, but instead
                  penalize for parsimony at other stages in the
                  evolutionary process. We find parameter settings for
                  BMOPP and the Waiting Room which are effective
                  across all tested problem domains. Death by Size
                  does not appear to have this consistency, but we
                  find it a useful tool as it has particular
                  applicability to steady-state evolution.},

  Abstract =	 {Many forms of parsimony pressure are parametric,
                  that is final fitness is a parametric model of the
                  actual size and raw fitness values. The problem with
                  parametric techniques is that they are hard to tune
                  to prevent size from dominating fitness late in the
                  evolutionary run, or to compensate for
                  problem-dependent nonlinearities in the raw fitness
                  function. In this paper we briefly discuss existing
                  bloat-control techniques, then introduce two new
                  kinds of non-parametric parsimony pressure, Direct
                  and Proportional Tournament. As their names suggest,
                  these techniques are based on simple modifications
                  of tournament selection to consider both size and
                  fitness, but not together as a combined parametric
                  equation. We compare the techniques against, and in
                  combination with, the most popular genetic
                  programming bloat-control technique, Koza-style
                  depth limiting, and show that they are effective in
                  limiting size while still maintaining good

  Abstract =	 {Much of the genetic programming literature compares
                  techniques using counts of ideal solutions
                  found. These counts in turn form common comparison
                  measures such as Koza's Computational Effort or
                  cumulative Probability of Success. The use of these
                  measures continues despite past warnings that they
                  are not statistically valid. In this paper we too
                  criticize the measures for serious statistical
                  problems, and also argue that their motivational
                  justification is faulty. We then present evidence
                  suggesting that ideal solution counts are not
                  necessarily positively related to
                  best-fitness-of-run statistics: in fact they are
                  often inversely correlated. Thus claims based on
                  ideal solution counts can mislead readers into
                  thinking techniques will provide superior final
                  results, when in fact the opposite is true.},

  Abstract =	 {Model- and simulation-designers are often interested
                  not in the optimum output of their system, but in
                  understanding how the output is sensitive to
                  different parameters. This can require an
                  inefficient sweep of a multidimensional parameter
                  space, with many samples tested in regions of the
                  space where the output is essentially all the same,
                  or a sparse sweep which misses crucial "interesting"
                  regions where the output is strongly sensitive. In
                  this paper we introduce a novel population-oriented
                  approach to adaptive parameter sweeping which
                  focuses its samples on these sensitive areas. The
                  method is easy to implement and model-free, and does
                  not require any previous knowledge about the
                  space. In a weakened form the method can operate in
                  non-metric spaces such as the space of genetic
                  program trees. We demonstrate the method on three
                  test problems, showing that it identifies regions of
                  the space where the slope of the output is highest,

                  encoding. While both cellular encoding and edge
                  encoding can produce all possible graphs, the two

                  teams. In using genetic programming to produce such
                  teams, one faces several design decisions. First,
                  there are questions of team diversity and of
                  breeding strategy. In one commonly used scheme,
                  teams consist of clones of single individuals; these
                  individuals breed in the normal way and are cloned
                  to form teams during fitness evaluation. In
                  contrast, teams could also consist of distinct
                  individuals. In this case one can either allow free
                  interbreeding between members of different teams, or
                  one can restrict interbreeding in various ways. A
                  second design decision concerns the types of
                  coordination-facilitating mechanisms provided to
                  individual team members; these range from sensors of
                  various sorts to complex communication systems. This
                  paper examines three breeding strategies (clones,
                  free, and restricted) and three coordination
                  mechanisms (none, deictic sensing, and name-based
                  sensing) for evolving teams of agents in the
                  Serengeti world, a simple predator/prey
                  environment. Among the conclusions are the fact that
                  a simple form of restricted interbreeding
                  outperforms free interbreeding in all teams with
                  distinct individuals, and the fact that name-based
                  sensing consistently outperforms deictic sensing.},

  Abstract =	 {Genetic programming trees have a strong tendency to
                  grow rapidly and relatively independent of fitness,
                  a serious flaw which has received considerable
                  attention in the genetic programming
                  literature. Much of this literature has implicated
                  introns, subtree structures with no effect on the an
                  individual's fitness assessment. The propagation of
                  inviable code, a certain kind of intron, has been
                  especially linked to tree growth. However this paper
                  presents evidence which shows that denying inviable
                  code the opportunity to propagate actually increases
                  tree growth. The paper argues that rather than
                  causing tree growth, a rise in inviable code is in
                  fact an expected result of tree growth. Lastly, this
                  paper proposes a more general theory of growth for
                  which introns are merely a symptom.},

  Abstract =	 {The C-value Paradox is the name given in biology to
                  the wide variance in and often very large amount of
                  DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the poor correlation
                  between DNA length and perceived organism
                  complexity. Several hypotheses exist which purport
                  to explain the Paradox.  Surprisingly there is a
                  related phenomenon in evolutionary computation,
                  known as code bloat, for which a different set of
                  hypotheses has arisen. This paper describes a new
                  hypothesis for the Cvalue Paradox derived from
                  models of code bloat. The new explanation is that
                  there is a selective bias in preference of genetic
                  events which increase DNA material over those which
                  decrease it. The paper suggests one possible
                  concrete mechanism by which this may occur: deleting
                  strands of DNA is more likely to damage genomic
                  material than migrating or copying strands.  The
                  paper also discusses other hypotheses in biology and
                  in evolutionary computation, and provides a
                  simulation example as a proof of concept.},

  Abstract =	 {Genetic Programming is an evolutionary computation
                  technique which searches for those computer programs
                  that best solve a given problem. As genetic
                  programming is applied to increasingly difficult
                  problems, its effectiveness is hampered by the
                  tendency of candidate program solutions to grow in
                  size independent of any corresponding increases in
                  quality. This bloat in solutions slows the search
                  process, interferes with genetic programming's
                  searching, and ultimately consumes all available
                  memory. The challenge for scaling up genetic
                  programming is to find the best solutions possible
                  before bloat puts a stop to evolution. This can be
                  tackled either by finding better solutions more
                  rapidly, or by taking measures to delay bloat as
                  long as possible.<p> This thesis discusses issues
                  both in speeding the search process and in delaying
                  bloat in order to scale genetic programming to
                  tackle harder problems. It describes evolutionary
                  computation and genetic programming, and details the
                  application of genetic programming to cooperative
                  robot soccer and to language induction. The thesis
                  then compares genetic programming breeding
                  strategies, showing the conditions under which each
                  strategy produces better individuals with less
                  bloating. It then analyzes the tree growth
                  properties of the standard tree generation
                  algorithms used, and proposes new, fast algorithms
                  which give the user better control over tree
                  size. Lastly, it presents evidence which directly
                  contradicts existing bloat theories, and gives a
                  more general theory of code growth, showing that the
                  issue is more complicated than it first appears.},

  Abstract =	 {Genetic programming is an evolutionary optimization
                  method that produces functional programs to solve a
                  given task.  These programs commonly take the form
                  of trees representing LISP s-expressions, and a
                  typical evolutionary run produces a great many of
                  these trees. For this reason, a good tree generation
                  algorithm is very important to genetic
                  programming. This paper presents two new
                  tree-generation algorithms for genetic programming
                  and for strongly-typed genetic programming, a common
                  variant. These algorithms are fast, allow the user
                  to request specific tree sizes, and guarantee
                  probabilities of certain nodes appearing in
                  trees. The paper analyzes these two algorithms and
                  compares them with traditional and recently proposed
                  approaches.},

                  independent analysis which answers this question,

                  technique to three problem domains in genetic
                  programming.  It discovers that in two of these
                  domains there is a maximal number of generations
                  beyond which it is irrational to plan a run; instead
                  it makes more sense to do multiple short runs.},

  Abstract =	 {There has recently been a growing interest in the
                  study of EA performance in changing
                  environments. Studies of EAs in dynamic
                  environments, however, have used only a few limited
                  fitness functions. As has been shown in the study of
                  EAs in static environments, comparative studies of
                  the effectiveness of various EAs in dynamic
                  environments will require more rigorous and
                  standardized test functions. These functions should
                  have a simple representation mechanism, so that a
                  wide range of complexity and sophisticated dynamics
                  can be unambiguously described in an elementary
                  manner. The paper proposes an initial test function
                  generator with these characteristics to facilitate
                  further understanding of the effectiveness of

                  its relationship to the most common phenotypic and
                  genotypic diversity measures.  We further

  Abstract =	 {Reliable execution and analysis of an evolutionary
                  algorithm (EA) normally requires many runs to
                  provide reasonable assurance that stochastic effects
                  have been properly considered. One of the first
                  stochastic influences on the behavior of an EA is
                  the population initialization.  This has been
                  recognized as a potentially serious problem to the
                  performance of EAs but little progress has been made
                  in improving the situation. Using a better
                  population initialization algorithm would not be
                  expected to improve the many-run average performance
                  of an EA, but instead, it would be expected to
                  reduce the variance of the results, without loss of
                  average performance. This would provide researchers
                  the opportunity to reliably examine their
                  experimental results while requiring fewer EA runs
                  for an appropriate statistical sample. This paper
                  uses recent advances in the measurement and control
                  of a population’s dispersion in a search space to
                  present a novel algorithm for better population
                  initialization. Experimental verification of the
                  usefulness of the new technique is provided.},

                  potential for concurrent multiagent learning domains
                  and are of special utility to domains involving
                  teams of multiple agents. Unfortunately, they also
                  exhibit pathologies resulting from their
                  game-theoretic nature, and these pathologies
                  interfere with finding solutions that correspond to
                  optimal collaborations of interacting agents. We
                  address this problem by biasing a cooperative
                  coevolutionary algorithm in such a way that the
                  fitness of an individual is based partly on the
                  result of interactions with other individuals (as is
                  usual), and partly on an estimate of the best
                  possible reward for that individual if partnered
                  with its optimal collaborator. We justify this idea
                  using existing theoretical models of a relevant
                  subclass of coevolutionary algorithms, demonstrate
                  how to apply biasing in a way that is robust with
                  respect to parameterization, and provide some
                  experimental evidence to validate the biasing
                  approach. We show that it is possible to bias
                  coevolutionary methods to better search for optimal
                  multiagent behaviors.},

  Abstract =	 {Competitive fitness is the assessment of an
                  individual's fitness in the context of competition
                  with other individuals in the evolutionary
                  system. This commonly takes one of two forms:
                  one-population competitive fitness, where
                  competition is solely between individuals in the
                  same population; and N-population competitive
                  fitness, often termed competitive coevolution. In
                  this paper we discuss common topologies for
                  one-population competitive fitness functions, then
                  test the performance of two such topologies,
                  Single-Elimination Tournament and K-Random
                  Opponents, on four problem domains. We show that
                  neither of the extremes of K-Random Opponents (Round
                  Robin and Random-Pairing) gives the best results
                  when using limited computational resources. We also
                  show that while Single-Elimination Tournament
                  usually outperforms variations of K-Random Opponents
                  in noise-free problems, it can suffer from premature
                  convergence in noisy domains.},

  Abstract =	 {Multi-agent research often borrows from biology,
                  where remarkable examples of collective intelligence
                  may be found. One interesting example is ant
                  colonies' use of pheromones as a joint communication
                  mechanism. In this paper we propose two
                  pheromone-based algorithms for artificial agent
                  foraging, trail-creation, and other tasks.  Whereas
                  practically all previous work in this area has
                  focused on biologically-plausible but ad-hoc single
                  pheromone models, we have developed a formalism
                  which uses multiple pheromones to guide cooperative
                  tasks. This model bears some similarity to
                  reinforcement learning. However, our model takes
                  advantage of symmetries common to foraging
                  environments which enables it to achieve much faster
                  reward propagation than reinforcement learning
                  does. Using this approach we demonstrate cooperative
                  behaviors well beyond the previous ant-foraging
                  work, including the ability to create optimal
                  foraging paths in the presence of obstacles, to cope
                  with dynamic environments, and to follow tours with
                  multiple waypoints. We believe that this model may
                  be used for more complex problems still.},

  Abstract =	 {Multi-agent problem domains may require distributed
                  algorithms for a variety of reasons: local sensors,
                  limitations of communication, and availability of
                  distributed computational resources. In the absence
                  of these constraints, centralized algorithms are
                  often more efficient, simply because they are able
                  to take advantage of more information. We introduce
                  a variant of the cooperative target observation
                  domain which is free of such constraints. We propose
                  two algorithms, inspired by K-means clustering and
                  hill-climbing respectively, which are scalable in
                  degree of decentralization. Neither algorithm
                  consistently outperforms the other across over all
                  problem domain settings. Surprisingly, we find that
                  hill-climbing is sensitive to degree of
                  decentralization, while K-means is not. We also
                  experiment with a combination of the two algorithms

                  solved through relatively simple behaviors in
                  combination with communication through

                  generalization over a large set of possible cases as
                  input.  Such spaces seem particularly apropos to
                  Genetic Programming, which notionally searches for
                  computer algorithms and functions. Most existing
                  research in this area uses ad-hoc approaches to the
                  sampling task, guided more by intuition than
                  understanding. In this initial investigation, we
                  compare six approaches to sampling large training
                  case sets in the context of genetic programming
                  representations. These approaches include fixed and
                  random samples, and adaptive methods such as
                  coevolution or fitness sharing. Our results suggest
                  that certain domain features may lead to the
                  preference of one approach to generalization over
                  others. In particular, coevolution methods are
                  strongly domain-dependent. We conclude the paper

  Abstract =	 {In concurrent cooperative multiagent learning, each
                  agent simultaneously learns to improve the overall
                  performance of the team, with no direct control over
                  the actions chosen by its teammates. An agent's
                  action selection directly influences the rewards
                  received by all the agents, resulting in a
                  co-adaptation among the concurrent learning
                  processes. Co-adaptation can drive the team towards
                  suboptimal solutions because agents tend to select
                  those actions that are rewarded better, without any
                  consideration for how such actions may affect the
                  search of their teammates. We argue that to counter
                  this tendency, agents should also prefer actions
                  that inform their teammates about the structure of
                  the joint search space in order to help them choose
                  from among various action options. We analyze this
                  approach in a cooperative coevolutionary framework,

                  highlights the advantages of selecting informative

                  at early stages of learning, when the agent's

                  these differential equations to account for lenient
                  learners: agents that forgive possible mismatched
                  teammate actions that resulted in low rewards. We
                  use these extended formal models to study the
                  convergence guarantees for these algorithms, and
                  also to visualize the basins of attraction to
                  optimal and suboptimal solutions in two benchmark
                  coordination problems. The paper demonstrates that
                  lenience provides learners with more accurate
                  information about the benefits of performing their
                  actions, resulting in higher likelihood of
                  convergence to the globally optimal solution. In
                  addition, the analysis indicates that the choice of
                  learning algorithm has an insignificant impact on
                  the overall performance of multiagent learning
                  algorithms; rather, the performance of these
                  algorithms depends primarily on the level of
                  lenience that the agents exhibit to one
                  another. Finally, the research herein supports the
                  strength and generality of evolutionary game theory

  Abstract =	 {Recent theoretical work helped explain certain
                  optimization-related pathologies in cooperative
                  coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs). Such explanations
                  have led to adopting specific and constructive
                  strategies for improving CCEA optimization
                  performance by biasing the algorithm toward ideal
                  collaboration. This paper investigates how
                  sensitivity to the degree of bias (set in advance)
                  is affected by certain algorithmic and problem
                  properties. We discover that the previous static
                  biasing approach is quite sensitive to a number of
                  problem properties, and we propose a stochastic
                  alternative which alleviates this problem. We
                  believe that finding appropriate biasing rates is
                  more feasible with this new biasing technique.},

                  several types of evolutionary computation, one
                  natural and popular method is to coevolve multiagent
                  behaviors in multiple, cooperating
                  populations. Recent research has suggested that
                  coevolutionary systems may favor stability rather
                  than performance in some domains. In order to
                  improve upon existing methods, this paper examines
                  the idea of modifying traditional coevolution,
                  biasing it to search for maximal rewards. We
                  introduce a theoretical justification of the
                  improved method and present experiments in three

                  more traditional machine learning perspective, we
                  explain why seeding is sometimes not helpful by
                  looking at the learning experience bias produced by

  Abstract =	 {The paper reports the results of a joint project on
                  evolutionary design of reinforced concrete
                  structures in tall buildings. It has been conducted
                  at the Center for Concrete Structures at the
                  Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and in
                  the School of Information Technology and Engineering
                  at George Mason University. Its ultimate objective
                  is to revolutionize design of both steel and
                  concrete structural systems through the introduction
                  of evolutionary design processes and tools. In this
                  paper, we first provide a general overview of
                  structural design of reinforced concrete structures
                  in tall buildings. Next, various issues of design
                  representation space are addressed, including a
                  general design space for a building for which both
                  crisp and fuzzy approaches are used.  Also, a more
                  specific issue of developing a design representation
                  space for a reinforced concrete structure of a tall
                  building is addressed and the concept of a floor
                  template is introduced. The central part of the
                  paper is a description of the proposed evolutionary
                  design process and of the related computer design
                  support tools. Finally, the results of various
                  conducted design experiments are reported. They
                  include the comparison of various selection
                  strategies and the comparison of evolutionary design
                  processes when crisp and fuzzy evaluation of designs
                  is used.},

                  cognitive architectures aimed at the human level of

                  tremendous store of knowledge of experimental

                  methods and test paradigms used for evaluation of
                  humans and/or brain models need to be adjusted
                  before they can be used for evaluation of
                  artifacts. The present work is focused on this
                  problem and its possible solutions in one general
                  paradigm of ontogenesis in virtual environment. We

                  can be achieved through the blending of innovative
                  concepts used in both components. i) On the

  Abstract =	 {A key element of our approach is the interpretation
                  of ``self''in a meta-cognitive sense: that is,
                  ``self'' is understood as a virtual character
                  representing an agent as the subject of experience,
                  as the target of attribution of experiences and
                  deliberate actions performed by this agent.  Thus
                  understood, ``self'' can be represented as an
                  element in an agent's cognitive system and can be
                  used for meta-cognitive processing: i.e., reasoning
                  about one's own self and other selves. This general
                  idea reflects a simulationist theory-of mind
                  viewpoint (Nichols & Stich, 2000), which is taken as
                  the basis for our approach. Our model of an agent's
                  mind includes multiple instances of ``self''
                  representing notions of INow, I-Yesterday,
                  I-Imagine, I-Goal, etc. Each instance of ``self'' is
                  represented by a ``chart'' with a set of properties
                  and mental states attributed to it. Thus, mental
                  states in this framework are representations of
                  experiences attributed to a particular instance of
                  ``self''. This attribution further implies certain
                  rules and constraints imposed on the contents and
                  the dynamics of representations. The result is a
                  general architecture that will enable in intelligent
                  agents a metacognitive ``common sense'', which
                  proves to be vital in a variety of paradigms and
                  scenarios requiring cooperation within a team.},

  Abstract =	 {A number of recent studies introduced
                  meta-evolutionary strategies and successfully used
                  them for solving problems in genetic
                  programming. While individual results indicate
                  possibilities of successes and failures (e.g.,
                  Kantschik, Dittrich et al., 1998, 1999), the
                  emerging global picture suggests that the approach
                  may have universal, domain-independent advantages
                  over traditional methods.  Trying to develop a
                  general theoretical understanding of this concept,
                  we use Price's theorem to define fitness at a
                  meta-level and show with two simple case studies
                  (two-dimensional optimization and the Eight puzzle)
                  that the ideology based on Price's theorem can work
                  at a meta-level in a similar manner for very
                  different problems.  Specifically, Pricean
                  definition of fitness for reproductive operators
                  appears to be practically useful and essential for
                  performance and stability of a certain class of

  Abstract =	 {We present an island model that uses different
                  representations in each island. The model transforms
                  individuals from one representation to another
                  during migrations. We show that such a model helps
                  the evolutionary algorithm to escape from local
                  optima and to solve problems that are difficult for
                  single representation EAs. We illustrate this
                  approach with a two population island model in which
                  one island uses a standard binary encoding and the
                  other island uses a standard reflective Gray
                  code. We compare the performance of this
                  multi-representation island model with single
                  population EAs using only binary or Gray codes. We
                  show that, on a variety of difficult multi-modal
                  test functions, the multi-representation island
                  model does no worse than a standard EA on all of the

  Abstract =	 {A need for solving more and more complex problems
                  drives the Evolutionary Computation community
                  towards advanced models of Evolutionary
                  Algorithms. One such model is the island model
                  which, although the subject of a variety of studies,
                  still needs additional fundamental research. In this
                  paper we have experimentally studied the influence
                  of various migrations sizes and intervals on island
                  models using a set of special functions. One of the
                  surprising observations from these experiments is
                  that the migration interval seems to be a dominating
                  factor, with migration size generally playing a
                  minor role with regard to the best solution
                  found. Additional experiments measuring genetic
                  diversity show that too frequent migrations cause
                  islands to dominate others and lose global diversity
                  before they are able to exchange solutions to
                  produce better results.  Also, we observe that even
                  small migrations already make a significant impact
                  on the behavior of an island model and therefore the
                  effects are comparable to those of bigger
                  migrations. On the other hand rare migrations cause
                  a degraded performance due to the slow convergence.
                  Collectively, these observations provide useful
                  guidance for island model applications.},

                  water supply agencies have done a truly remarkable
                  job of ensuring a safe, dependable supply. However,
                  threats posed by an organized group of actors may
                  represent a new and different challenge to the
                  security of water supplies. A tool to assist in
                  identifying possible attacks and simultaneously
                  providing remedies to counter these attacks has been
                  developed. The tool uses evolutionary computation as
                  the optimization method, and EPANET as the system
                  simulator. Preliminary examples of its use to
                  identify optimal attacks against a realistic but
                  hypothetical pipe network and corresponding counter
                  measures are presented.},

  Abstract =	 {Robotic hardware designs are becoming more complex
                  as the variety and number of on-board sensors
                  increase and as greater computational power is
                  provided in ever smaller packages on-board
                  robots. These advances in hardware, however, do not
                  automatically translate into better software for
                  controlling complex robots. Evolutionary techniques
                  hold the potential to solve many difficult problems
                  in robotics which defy simple conventional
                  approaches, but present many challenges as well.
                  Numerous disciplines including artificial life,
                  cognitive science and neural networks, rule-based
                  systems, behavior based control, genetic algorithms
                  and other forms of evolutionary computation have
                  contributed to shaping the current state of
                  evolutionary robotics. This paper provides an
                  overview of developments in the emerging field of
                  evolutionary robotics, and discusses some of the
                  opportunities and challenges which currently face
                  practitioners in the field.  The need for ER arises
                  from the fact that as robotic systems and the
                  environments into which they are placed increase in
                  complexity, the difficulty of programming their
                  control systems to respond appropriately increases
                  to the point where it becomes impracticable to
                  foresee every possible state of the robot in its
                  environment. Evolutionary algorithms are used to
                  generate control algorithms using the Darwinian
                  principle of survival-of-the-fittest. A population
                  of controllers is maintained and evolved by
                  evaluating individual control systems based on a
                  measure of how well they achieve desired
                  characteristics such as executing appropriate
                  behaviors at appropriate times. Only the fitter
                  members of the population survive and pass the
                  characteristics that made them successful on to
                  future generations. The ultimate goal is to produce
                  the best possible controller given some design
                  criteria. As discussed in the following sections,
                  this approach has proven very successful in a wide
                  variety of challenging robotics domains. The
                  remainder of this paper will provide a sampling of
                  recent development efforts in evolutionary robotics
                  research with the goal of showing both the
                  opportunities presented by the use of evolutionary
                  techniques for solving difficult problems in
                  robotics, but also in showing some of the challenges
                  of applying these techniques.},

  Abstract =	 {Real-world systems are often modeled by sampling
                  sensor data taken during system operation. System
                  states may not be all known or measurable, sensor
                  data may be biased or noisy, and it is not often
                  known which sensor data may be useful for predictive
                  modeling. Neural network models generated from this
                  data must therefore rely on how effectively the
                  chosen sensor data represents the system. Genetic
                  algorithms may help to address this problem by
                  determining a near optimal subset of sensor
                  variables most appropriate to produce good
                  models. This paper describes the use of genetic
                  algorithms to optimize variable selection to
                  determine inputs into a neural network system
                  model. The use of this technique for modeling a
                  typical industrial application, a liquid fed ceramic
                  melter, and the results of the genetic search to
                  optimize the neural network model for this
                  application, are described.},

                  crossover and uniform crossover. This analysis
                  extends the work from De Jong's thesis, which dealt
                  with disruption of n-point crossover on 2nd order
                  hyperplanes. We present various extensions to this
                  theory, including 1) an analysis of the disruption
                  of n-point crossover on kth order hyperplanes; 2)
                  the computation of tighter bounds on the disruption
                  caused by n-point crossover, by handling cases where
                  parents share critical allele values; and 3) an
                  analysis of the disruption caused by uniform
                  crossover on kth order hyperplanes. The implications
                  of these results on implementation issues and
                  performance are discussed, and several directions

  Abstract =	 {Traditionally, genetic algorithms have relied upon 1
                  and 2-point crossover operators. Many recent
                  empirical studies, however, have shown the benefits
                  of higher numbers of crossover points. Some of the
                  most intriguing recent work has focused on uniform
                  crossover, which involves on the average L/2
                  crossover points for strings of length L.
                  Theoretical results suggest that, from the view of
                  hyperplane sampling disruption, uniform crossover
                  has few redeeming features. However, a growing body
                  of experimental evidence suggests otherwise. In this

  Abstract =	 {This paper shows how the performance of a genetic
                  programming system can be improved through the
                  addition of mechanisms for non-genetic transmission
                  of information between individuals (culture). Teller
                  has previously shown how genetic programming systems
                  can be enhanced through the addition of memory
                  mechanisms for individual programs [Teller 1994]; in
                  this paper we show how Teller's memory mechanism can
                  be changed to allow for communication between
                  individuals within and across generations. We show
                  the effects of indexed memory and culture on the
                  performance of a genetic programming system on a
                  symbolic regression problem, on Koza's Lawnmower
                  problem, and on Wumpus world agent problems. We show
                  that culture can reduce the computational effort
                  required to solve all of these problems. We conclude
                  with a discussion of possible improvements.},

                  through their own mini evolutionary loop until some
                  fixed wall clock time has been exceeded. Our

                  presented an example where a special learning
                  algorithm (FMQ) is capable of doing just that when
                  paired with a specific less capable algorithm even

                  recently that a general architecture for cooperative
                  coevolution has been proposed. Since that time, the
                  flexibility and success of this cooperative
                  coevolutionary architecture (CCA) has been shown in
                  an array of different kinds of problems. However,
                  many questions about the dynamics of this model, as
                  well as the efficacy of various CCA-specific choices

                  cooperative coevolutionary algorithms is perhaps
                  more attainable.  Recently, evolutionary game
                  theoretic (EGT) models have begun to be used to help
                  analyze the dynamical behaviors of coevolutionary
                  algorithms. One type of EGT model which is already
                  reasonably well understood are multi--population
                  symmetric games. We believe these games can be used
                  to analytically model cooperative coevolutionary
                  algorithms.  This paper introduces our analysis
                  framework, explaining how and why such models may be
                  generated. It includes some examples illustrating
                  specific theoretical and empirical analysis. We
                  demonstrate that using our framework, a better
                  understanding for the degree to which cooperative
                  coevolutionary algorithms can be used for
                  optimization can be achieved.},

  Abstract =	 {Though coevolutionary algorithms are currently used
                  for optimization purposes, practitioners are often
                  plagued with difficulties due to the fact that such
                  systems frequently behave in counter intuitive ways
                  that are not well understood. This paper seeks to
                  extend work which uses evolutionary game theory
                  (EGT) as a form of dynamical systems modeling of
                  coevolutionary algorithms in order to begin to
                  answer questions regarding how these systems work.
                  It does this by concentrating on a particular
                  subclass of cooperative coevolutionary algorithms,
                  for which multi-population symmetric evolutionary
                  game theoretic models are known to apply. We examine
                  dynamical behaviors of this model in the context of
                  static function optimization, by both formal
                  analysis, as well as model validation
                  study. Finally, we begin looking at the effects of
                  variation by extending traditional EGT, offering
                  some introductory analysis, as well as model
                  validation. In the course of this study, we
                  investigate the effects of parameterized uniform
                  crossover and bit-flip mutation.},

  Abstract =	 {Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) have
                  been applied to many optimization problems with
                  varied success.  Recent empirical studies have shown
                  that choices surrounding methods of collaboration
                  may have a strong impact on the success of the
                  algorithm. Moreover, certain properties of the
                  problem landscape, such as variable interaction,
                  greatly influence how these choices should be
                  made. A more general view of variable interaction is
                  one that considers epistatic linkages which span
                  population boundaries. Such linkages can be caused
                  by the decomposition of the actual problem, as well
                  as by CCEA representation decisions regarding
                  population structure. We posit that it is the way in
                  which represented problem components interact, and
                  not necessarily the existence of cross population
                  epistatic linkages that impacts these decisions. In
                  order to explore this issue, we identify two
                  different kinds of representational bias with
                  respect to the population structure of the
                  algorithm, decompositional bias and linkage bias. We
                  provide analysis and constructive examples which
                  help illustrate that even when the algorithm's
                  representation is poorly suited for the problem, the
                  choice of how best to select collaborators can be
                  unaffected.},

  Abstract =	 {We present two key components of a principled method
                  for constructing modular, heterogeneous

                  for representing swarm behaviors to extend the power
                  of multiagent systems by specializing agents and
                  their interactions. Second, a novel graph-based
                  method is introduced for designing swarm-based
                  behaviors for multiagent teams. This method includes
                  engineer-provided knowledge through explicit design
                  decisions pertaining to specialization,
                  heterogeneity, and modularity. We show the
                  representational power of our generalized
                  representation can be used to evolve a solution to a
                  challenging multiagent resource protection
                  problem. We also construct a modular design by hand,

  Abstract =	 {Coevolutionary algorithms offer great promise as
                  adaptive problem solvers but suffer from several
                  known pathologies.  Historically, spatially embedded
                  coevolutionary algorithms seem to have succeeded
                  where other coevolutionary approaches fail; however,
                  explanations for this have been largely
                  unexplored. We examine this idea more closely by
                  looking at spatial models in the context of a
                  particular coevolutionary pathology: loss of
                  gradient. We believe that loss of gradient in
                  cooperative coevolution is caused by asymmetries in
                  the problem or initial conditions between
                  populations, driving one population to convergence
                  before another. Spatial models seem to lock
                  populations together in terms of evolutionary
                  change, helping establish a type of dynamic balance
                  to thwart loss of gradient. We construct a tunably
                  asymmetric function optimization problem domain and
                  conduct an empirical study to justify this
                  assertion.  We find that spatial restrictions for
                  collaboration and selection can help keep population
                  changes balanced when presented with severe
                  asymmetries in the problem.},

@phdthesis{wiegand:an-analysis2004,
  Abstract =	 {Coevolutionary algorithms behave in very
                  complicated, often quite counterintuitive
                  ways. Researchers and practitioners have yet to
                  understand why this might be the case, how to change
                  their intuition by understanding the algorithms
                  better, and what to do about the differences.
                  Unfortunately, there is little existing theory
                  available to researchers to help address these
                  issues. Further, little empirical analysis has been
                  done at a component level to help understand
                  intrinsic differences and similarities between
                  coevolutionary algorithms and more traditional
                  evolutionary algorithms. Finally, attempts to
                  categorize coevolution and coevolutionary behaviors
                  remain vague and poorly defined at best. The
                  community needs directed investigations to help
                  practitioners understand what particular
                  coevolutionary algorithms are good at, what they are
                  not, and why.  This dissertation improves our
                  understanding of coevolution by posing and answering
                  the question: "Are cooperative coevolutionary
                  algorithms (CCEAs) appropriate for static
                  optimization tasks?" Two forms of this question are
                  "How long do they take to reach the global optimum"
                  and "How likely are they to get there?" The first
                  form of the question is addressed by analyzing their
                  performance as optimizers, both theoretically and
                  empirically. This analysis includes investigations
                  into the effects of coevolution-specific parameters
                  on optimization performance in the context of
                  particular properties of potential problem
                  domains. The second leg of this dissertation
                  considers the second form of the question by looking
                  at the dynamical properties of these algorithms,
                  analyzing their limiting behaviors again from
                  theoretical and empirical points of view. Two common
                  cooperative coevolutionary pathologies are explored
                  and illustrated, in both formal and practical
                  settings. The result is a better understanding of,
                  and appreciation for, the fact that CCEAs are not
                  generally appropriate for the task of static,
                  single-objective optimization. In the end a new view
                  of the CCEA is offered that includes analysis-guided
                  suggestions for how a traditional CCEA might be
                  modified to be better suited for optimization tasks,
                  or might be applied to more appropriate tasks, given
                  the nature of its dynamics.  },

                  which has been more recently explored is the area of
                  mutualism.  In mutualistic methods, the problem is
                  subdivided into modular components where each
