  abstract =     "The Unified Modelling Language (UML) ostensibly assumes a
                  four level (meta) modelling framework, both for its
                  definition and for the conceptual context in which its
                  users operate. In practice, however, it is still
                  dominated by the traditional two level (model + data)
                  view of object modelling and neither supports nor applies
                  the four level framework properly. This not only
                  diminishes the clarity of the UML semantics, but
                  complicates the task of those users who do wish to fully
                  embrace a multi-level approach. After outlining the
                  characteristics of the intended conceptual framework, and
                  the problems resulting from the UML?s current two-level
                  bias, this paper presents three simple enhancements to
                  the UML which provide the required expressive power for
                  multi-level modelling. The paper then goes on to discuss
                  issues in the application of the conceptual framework
                  within the UML's own definition.",

                  These charts show definition dependencies between
                  concepts of the model of the UML. They allow to have a
                  good view of the concepts of the model of the UML and of
                  their dependencies. They also allow to define overviews

                  recognised that constraints are a good means to produce
                  more precise and formal specifications. One proof of this
                  is that UML incorporates a standard constraint language
                  called OCL (Object Constraint Language). The availability
                  of OCL to every user of UML will undoubtedly encourage
                  many people to add constraints to their UML models. This
                  paper explains this language and shows the wide
                  applicability of OCL, e.g. to express invariants, pre-
                  and post- conditions, and guards. Probably the largest
                  application of OCL to date was its use to define the
                  metamodel of UML, and the experiences gained in this
                  application of OCL will be discussed.",

                  Design - Specification of Integrity Constraints",
  pages =        "147--156",
  abstract =     "In the course of object-oriented software engineering,
                  the UML class diagrams are used to specify the static
                  structure of the system under study, such as classes,
                  types and various kinds of static relationships among
                  them. Objects of the persistent classes can be stored in
                  object-oriented databases or in relational databases. In
                  the former case, the UML class diagrams are actually used
                  for conceptual object-oriented database designs. However,
                  the standard UML class diagram lacks the ability to
                  specify some inherent integrity constraints, such as keys
                  and uniqueness, for object-oriented databases. This paper
                  proposes an extension to the UML metamodel, i.e., the
                  introduction of two new model elements (key and
                  IConstraint) and some new attributes to the existing
                  metamodel, to accommodate more constraint specification.
                  In the model level, a compartment CONSTRAINT to the class
                  notation and some property strings for displaying the
                  integrity constraints are added. The database design is
                  then mapped to the extended ODMG-ODL schema definition.",

                  graphical description techniques for the specification
                  and documentation of object-oriented systems. We describe
                  the experiences gained while using UML 1.0 for the
                  development of a small, distributed Java program for
                  planning break supervision schedules in schools. Our
                  motivation in this case study is not only to evaluate the
                  techniques provided by UML and Java, but also to study
                  their interrelationships and their methodical use from
                  requirements analysis to implementation. Based on our
                  observations some proposals for extensions and changes to
                  the UML are made. Because the example is complete and
                  self-contained and provides methodical guidelines and
                  hints, it can also be used as a tutorial for UML 1.0 and

                  program-specific details of the source code. In a second,
                  more involved step, we try to create a design view from
                  the source code and also represent certain patterns as
                  ODMG language features. The focus of our approach is on
                  minimizing the resulting UML diagrams (minimal with
                  respect to the number of elements in the diagrams) by
                  recognizing certain patterns in the source code and
                  transforming certain low-level syntactic constructs into
                  high-level semantic UML features.",

                  that it seems not feasible to give a single semantics for
                  the complete language in one step. In order to define the
                  semantics, we propose to translate as many UML language
                  features as possible into UML itself. The part of UML
                  which cannot be treated in this way is called the UML
                  core. The semantics of the non-core language features is
                  given by a translation into the core, whereas a different
                  semantics\~(for example a set-theoretic one or a
                  semantics on the basis of graphs) must be given to the
                  UML core. It turns out that for the first step, namely
                  the translation of UML language features into the UML
                  core, graph transformations are an ideal language for
                  expressing the required manipulations and the UML
                  metamodel gives the necessary fundamental vocabulary and

                  models, we formally describe and thereby analyze the
                  Entity-Relationship and the Relational data model. In
                  addition, we represent the transformation between these

                  application in forward engineering, it is also possible
                  to use them for the redocumentation of existing programs.
                  However, the inherent structure of UML diagrams, which
                  consists of graphical as well as textual information,
                  makes it difficult to read and oversee large diagrams
                  generated from complex systems. The view on such diagrams
                  can be compared with taking a look at a detailed map: the
                  reader has to decide whether to read the fine details or
                  to view the whole structure.  We present approaches to
                  overcome this problem by using object-oriented metrics

                  recognize the need for practical tools to support
                  reverse-engineering activities. Most of the well-known
                  CASE-tools nowadays support reverse engineering in some
                  way. But although the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has
                  emerged as the \verb|\|\{\verb|\|it de facto\} standard
                  for the abstract graphical representation of
                  object-oriented software systems, there does not yet
                  exist a standard scheme for representing the reverse
                  engineered models of software systems. Due to the
                  differences in understanding and application of the UML
                  notation and the proprietary extensions that different
                  tools adopt, it is often difficult to ensure that model
                  semantics remains unambiguous when working with different
                  tools at the same time. In this paper, we examine the
                  capabilities of the two most successful
                  industrial-strength CASE-tools in reverse engineering the
                  static structure of software systems and compare them to
                  the results produced by two academic prototypes. The
                  comparisons are carried out both manually and
                  automatically using a research prototype for manipulating

                  Graph transformation is a formal technique having some
                  common ideas with the UML. Graph transformation rules are
                  associated with the operations in class diagrams and with
                  the transitions in state diagrams. The resulting graph

                  components.   We develop a visual  technique for
                  object-oriented modeling  of real-time reactive  systems,
                  based on a minimal  set of extensions to UML, along with
                  a set of well-formedness rules for the real-time models. 
                  We then present a formalization of  the Real-Time UML
                  (RTUML) notation, making use of the abstract syntax and
                  well-formedness rules of UML metamodel, and provide
                  formal denotational  and operational semantics for 
                  RTUML. Finally, we introduce a   methodology for
                  mechanized   verification of time-dependent  properties
                  in  the RTUML design  of real-time reactive systems, 
                  within   the   PVS verification  environment.    The 
                  formal semantics   of   RTUML provides a    foundation  
                  for the verification methodology, and for rigorous
                  analysis and validation techniques.  The novelty of the
                  development  methodology for real-time systems  lies in
                  the    mechanized    verification   approach

                  by representing certain aspects of a system graphically.
                  Recently, the UML has become common to provide software
                  designers with tools, in which they can create visual
                  representations of software interactively. But the UML is
                  intended to be drawn on two-dimensional surfaces. Our
                  approach extends UML into a third and fourth dimension in
                  a way that we can place both static and dynamic aspects
                  in one single view. By this, we can show behavior in the
                  context of structural aspects, instead of drawing
                  different diagrams for each aspect with only loose
                  relation to each other.  We also use the third dimension
                  to emphasize important things and to place less
                  interesting things in the background. Thereby, we direct
                  the viewer's attention to the important things in the
                  foreground.  Currently, UML shows dynamic behavior by
                  diagrams which do not change and are therefore static in
                  nature. In sequence diagrams, for example, time elapses
                  from the top of the diagram to the bottom.  We point out
                  that behavior is better visualized by animated diagrams
                  where message symbols move from the sender object to the
                  receiver object. Our approach supports the creation of a
                  system as well as the communication of its dynamic
                  processes especially to customers.",

                  notation for object-oriented analysis and design.  In
                  context of information systems modeling, UML class
                  diagrams can be utilized for describing the overall
                  structure, whereas additional integrity constraints and
                  queries are specified with OCL expressions. By using OCL,
                  constraints and queries can be specified in a formal yet
                  comprehensible way. However, the OCL itself is currently
                  defined only in an informal way. Thus the semantics of
                  constraints is in general not precisely defined. Our

                  them to specify queries retrieving non-trivial
                  information about certain objects in a given system
                  state.  These queries can then be translated into
                  statements of a query language of the chosen
                  implementation environment. A precise OCL semantics would
                  obviously facilitate a more systematic description of a
                  translation scheme from OCL to e.g. SQL or the ODMG's
                  Object Query Language (OQL).",

  abstract =     "We present a precise approach that allows an analysis and
                  validation of UML models and OCL constraints. We focus on
                  models and constraints specified in the analysis and
                  early design stage of a software development process. For
                  this purpose, a suitable subset of UML corresponding to
                  information that is usually represented in class diagrams
                  is identified and formally defined. This basic modeling
                  language provides a context for all OCL constraints. We
                  define a formal syntax and semantics of OCL types,
                  operations, expressions, invariants, and
                  pre-/postconditions. We also give solutions for problems
                  with the current OCL definition and discuss possible
                  extensions.  A metamodel for OCL is introduced that
                  defines the abstract syntax of OCL expressions and the
                  structure of types and values. The metamodel approach
                  allows a seamless integration with the UML metamodeling
                  architecture and makes the benefits of a precise OCL
                  definition easier accessible. The OCL metamodel also
                  allows to define context-sensitive conditions for
                  well-formed OCL expressions more precisely. These
                  conditions can now be specified with OCL whereas they
                  previously were specified only informally. In order to
                  demonstrate the practical applicability of our work, we
                  have realized substantial parts of it in a tool
                  supporting the validation of models and constraints.
                  Design specifications can be ``executed'' and animated
                  thus providing early feedback in an iterative development
                  process. Our approach offers novel ways for checking user
                  data against specifications, for automating test
                  procedures, and for checking CASE tools for standards
                  conformance. Therefore, this work contributes to the goal
                  of improving the overall quality of software systems by
                  combining theoretical and practical techniques.",

                  software industry's dominant modeling language.  It is
                  the de facto modeling language standard for specifying,
                  visualizing, constructing, and documenting the components
                  of software systems. Despite its prominence and status as
                  the standard modeling language, UML has its critics. 
                  Opponents argue that it is complex and difficult to
                  learn.  Some question the rationale of having nine
                  diagramming techniques in UML and the raison d'{\^e}tre
                  of those nine techniques in UML.  Others point out that
                  UML lacks a comprehensive methodology to guide its users,
                  which makes the language even more convoluted.  A few
                  studies on UML can be found in the literature.  However,
                  no study exists to provide a quantitative measure of UML
                  complexity or to compare UML with other object oriented
                  techniques.  In this research, we evaluate the complexity
                  of UML using complexity metrics.  The objective is to
                  provide a reliable and accurate quantitative measure of
                  UML complexity.  A comparison of the complexity metrical
                  values of UML with other object-oriented techniques was
                  also carried out.  Our findings suggest that each diagram
                  in UML is not distinctly more complex than techniques in
                  other OO methods.  But as a whole, UML is very complex --
                  2-11 times more complex than other OO methods.",

                  interactions of a set of objects and actors during a

                  dynamic modeling aspects of object-oriented software
                  development. The discussed techniques include synthesis
                  of a state diagram using information given in scenarios,
                  optimization of a synthesized state diagram by generating
                  OMT state diagram notation for it, and generation of
                  scenarios by animation communication between state
                  diagrams. Concurrency and aggregation in OMT state
                  diagram notation is considered, as well as possibilities
                  to include it also to SCED. Consistency between scenarios
                  and state diagrams in SCED is discussed.",
