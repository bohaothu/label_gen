  abstract = {Wearable computing systems can be broadly defined as mobile electronic
	devices that can be unobtrusively embedded in a user's outfit as
	part of the garment or an accessory. Unlike conventional mobile devices,
	such systems shall be virtually invisible, not hindering physical
	activity, always active and running without user's attention. We
	present our wearability driven design approach and the philosophy
	for a novel wearable computing system integrated into a fully functional
	belt. This system integrates the main electronics in the buckle of
	a belt and utilizes the belt itself as extension bus and mechanical
	support for add ons. The system runs GNU/Linux operating system and
	has sufficient resources to address a variety of applications in
	the field of wearable computing. Considerations regarding ergonomic
	design, system architecture, first implementation results and applications
	are presented.},
