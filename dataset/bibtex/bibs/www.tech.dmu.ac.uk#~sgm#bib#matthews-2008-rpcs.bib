  abstract = {The field of computational intelligence is the successor of artificial intelligence. It combines elements of learning, evolution and fuzzy logic to create programs that can exhibit, to some degree, intelligent behaviour. The last few years have seen a growth in theoretical and practical developments in this field. This paper presents an extensive survey of the latest patents in the domain of computational intelligence. It discusses and summarises some of these latest developments in terms of patents. The patents are categorised by their domain of application: Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic and Evolutionary Algorithms and further classified by the application area.},
