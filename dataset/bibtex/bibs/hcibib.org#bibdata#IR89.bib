%X Knowledge-based search tactics are discussed in terms of their role in the
functioning of a semantically-based search system for bibliographic information
retrieval.  This prototype system, EP-X, actively assists users in defining or
refining their topics of interest.  It does so by applying search tactics to a
knowledge-base describing topics in a particular domain and a database
describing the contents of individual documents.
   This paper reviews the empirical studies that lead to the two central
concepts implemented in EP-X:
 1. Semantically-based search;
 2. Knowledge-based search tactics.
It then describes the capabilities of a system based on such concepts.

%X AIR represents a connectionist approach to the task of information
retrieval.  The system uses relevance feedback from its users to change its
representation of authors, index terms and documents so that, over time, AIR
improves at its task.  The result is a representation of the consensual meaning
of keywords and documents shared by some group of users.  The central focus
goal of this paper is to use our experience with AIR to highlight those
characteristics of connectionist representations that make them particularly
appropriate for IR applications.  We argue that this associative representation
is a natural generalization of traditional IR techniques, and that
connectionist learning techniques are effective in this setting.

%X In conventional Boolean retrieval systems, users have difficulty controlling
the amount of output obtained from a given query.  This paper describes the
design of a user interface which permits gradual enlargement or refinement of
the user's query by browsing through a graph of term and document subsets. 
This graph is obtained from a lattice automatically generated from the usual
document-term relation.  The major design features of the proposed interface
are the integration of menu, fill-in the blank and direct manipulation modes of
interaction within the "fisheye view" [Furnas, 1986] paradigm.  A prototype
user interface incorporating some of these ideas has been implemented on a
microcomputer.
   The resulting interface is well adapted to various kinds of users and needs.
More experienced users with a particular subject in mind can directly specify a
query which results into a jump to a particular vertex in the graph.  From
there, the user can refine his initial query by browsing through the graph from
that point on.  On the other hand, casual users without any prior knowledge of
the contents of the system or users without any particular subject in mind can
freely navigate through the graph without ever specifying any query.

%X This paper describes the design of the information retrieval facilities of
an integrated information system called EUROMATH.  EUROMATH is an example of a
Knowledge Worker Support System: it has been designed specifically to support
mathematicians in their research work.  EUROMATH is required to provide uniform
retrieval facilities for searching in a user's personal data, in a shared
database of structured documents and in public, bibliographic databases.  The
design of information retrieval facilities that satisfy these and other
requirements posed several interesting design issues regarding the integration
of various retrieval techniques.  As well as a uniform query language, designed
to be highly usable by the target user group, the retrieval facilities provide
expert intermediary functions, i.e. sophisticated support for the retrieval of
bibliographic data.  This support is achieved using a model of the user, a
model of the user's information need and a set of search strategies based on
those used by human intermediaries.  The expert intermediary facilities include
extensive help facilities, automatic query reformulation and browsing of a
variety of sources of query terms.

%X We show that any approach to develop optimum retrieval functions is based on
two kinds of assumptions: first, a certain form of representation for documents
and requests, and second, additional simplifying assumptions that predefine the
type of the retrieval function.  Then we describe an approach for the
development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions: request-document pairs
(f{sub:l},d{sub:m}) are mapped onto description vectors x(f{sub:l},d{sub:m}),
and a polynomial function of the form a{sup:T}&times;v(x) is developed such
that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance
P(R|x(f{sub:l},d{sub:m}) with minimum square errors.  We give experimental
results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted
indexing as well as to documents with complex representations.  In contrast to
other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual
probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and
requests, and it can be easily applied to multi-valued relevance scales.  On
the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models,
and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application.

%X In this paper we present a parallel document ranking algorithm suitable for
use on databases of 1-1000 GB, resident on primary or secondary storage.  The
algorithm is based on inverted indexes, and has two advantages over a
previously published parallel algorithm for retrieval based on signature files.
First, it permits the employment of ranking strategies which cannot be easily
implemented using signature files, specifically methods which depend on
document-term weighting.  Second, it permits the interactive searching of
databases resident on secondary storage.  The algorithm is evaluated via a
mixture of analytic and simulation techniques, with a particular focus on how
cost-effectiveness and efficiency change as the size of the database, number of
processors, and cost of memory are altered.  In particular, we find that if the
ratio of the number of processors and/or disks to the size of the database is
held constant, then the cost-effectiveness of the resulting system remains
constant.  Furthermore, for a given size of database, there is a number of
processors which optimizes cost-effectiveness.  Estimated response times are
also presented.  Using these methods, it appears that cost-effective
interactive access to databases in the 100-1000 GB range can be achieved using
current technology.

configuration we show how one might implement a set of text processing
operations using lasers, spatial light modulators and photodetectors.

%X Most approaches to full-text information retrieval currently index documents
based on the words they contain, and retrieve them based on the word's
frequency of occurrence.  This can cause many irrelevant documents to be
retrieved because words are often ambiguous.  We propose an approach in which
documents are indexed by word senses, and in which these senses are taken from
a machine-readable dictionary.  We review some of the work on machine-readable
dictionaries and the approaches that have been taken to word sense
disambiguation.  We then discuss our own approach to the problem based on the
use of multiple sources of evidence.  We conclude with the results of some
experiments that indicate the degree to which lexical ambiguity is a factor in
current systems.

%X A large and important class of optical disc technology are CLV format discs
such as CD ROM and WORM.  In this paper, we examine the issues related to the
implementation and performance of several different file organizations on CLV
format optical discs such as CD ROM and WORM.  The organizations examined are
based on hashing and trees.
   The CLV recording scheme is shown to be a good environment for efficiently
implementing hashing.  Single seek access and storage utilization levels
approaching 100% can be achieved for CD ROM's.  It is shown that a B-tree
organization is not a good choice for WORM discs (both CAV and CLV), but a
modified ISAM approach can be appropriate for WORM discs.  We describe
clustered BIM's, a class of tree organizations appropriate for CD ROMS. 
Expressions for the expected retrieval performance of both hashing and trees
are also given.
   The paper concludes by outlining recent results and future directions on
buffered implementations of access methods for WORM discs, as well as
advantages of signature based access methods for text retrieval in WORM disc
architectures.

are that they are real time algorithms, they don't need to buffer the input,

%X In order to improve the two-level signature file method designed by
Sacks-Davis et al. [20], we propose new multikey access methods based on term
discrimination and signature clustering.  By term discrimination, we create
separate, efficient access methods for the terms frequently used in user
queries.  We in addition cluster similar signatures by means of these terms so
that we may achieve good performance on retrieval.  Meanwhile we provide the
space time analysis of the proposed methods and compare them with the two-level
signature file method.  We show that the proposed methods achieve 15-30%
savings in retrieval time and require 3-9% more storage overhead.

information appears as an interesting media to access related pictures in the
data base.  After the presentation of the application and a study of the
particular corpus involved we define a semantic model for the documents which
is based on a Conceptual Language.  Then we detail the indexing process and its
various linguistic components which perform the translation of every medical
report according to this semantic model.

%* (c) Copyright 1989 Association for Computing Machinery
%X In contrast to other kinds of libraries, software libraries need to be
conceptually organized.  When looking for a component, the main concern of
users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are
secondary.  Software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large
libraries of software components.  In this paper, we present GURU, a tool that
allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented
software components.  We focus here on GURU's indexing component which extracts
conceptual attributes from natural language documentation.  This indexing
method is based on words' co-occurrences.  It first uses EXTRACT, a
co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from
textual documents.  Conceptually relevant collocations are then selected
according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context
words.  This fully automated indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based
tools in the understanding of a document without the brittleness of
knowledge-based tools.  The indexing component of GURU is fully implemented,
and some results are given in the paper.

%X This paper reports on one of the findings of a larger case study that
attempts to describe how people organize documents in their own offices.  In
that study, several dimensions along which people make classificatory decisions
were identified.  Of these, the use to which a document is put emerged as a
strong determiner of that document's classification.  The method of analysis is
reviewed, and examples of different kinds of uses are presented, demonstrating
that it is possible to describe a wide variety of specific instances using a
closed set of descriptors.  The suggestion is made that, in designing systems
for organizing materials, it might be advantageous to incorporate information
about contextual variables, such as use, since these seem to be particularly
important in classification decisions made within personal environments.

%X Hypertext offers users a simple, flexible way to navigate through electronic
information systems but at the potential risk of becoming lost in the network
of interconnected pieces of information.  A study was conducted on information
retrieval using a commercial hypertext-based help system.  It was found that
the predominant search strategy was "browsing" (characterized by scanning
tables of contents and paging through topics), rather than employing the
indexes ("analytical search").  Although subjects did not become lost,
individuals with better spatial visualization ability, as measured by a
standardized test, were faster at retrieving information and returned to the
top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial
visualization ability.  These results support previous studies that have found
a strong preference by users to browse in hypertext systems and extend those
findings to a new domain (help), a different type of user interface, and a
different information architecture.  In addition, the results demonstrate the
importance of spatial visualization ability for efficient navigation and
information retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system.

%X In organized health care, primary care is the first level.  It is
characterized by the wide span of health problems managed as well as remote
location from traditional medical information and knowledge sources.  The
LIMEDS project has formulated the special requirements for integrated knowledge
and data base management in primary care.  This paper presents Gosta's book, a
hypertext knowledge base implemented in LINCKS, an object oriented, networked
database system.  Firstly, aspects which make integrated hypermedia systems
particularly suitable for application in primary health care are explored.  We
then describe the hypertext knowledge base, consisting of 500 basic text
objects and 3000 links, and current implementations using the NODE data model.
NODE is implemented on a SUN III fileserver, and the user interface for the
hypertext context on Apple Macintosh.  Combination of design methods towards a
parallel means-ends strategy was found to be necessary to achieve Gosta's book.
Design groups need to be composed of computer science, medical, psychological
and organizational competences.

called the settings structure.  The paper begins by placing the settings
structure into the context of its being one part of the CLORIS system.
