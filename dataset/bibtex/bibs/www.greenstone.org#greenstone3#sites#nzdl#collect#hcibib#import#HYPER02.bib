%X We describe an SQL relational database schema for representing the objects
in HyperCard, along with a technique for automatically populating this schema
from a HyperCard stack using the facilities in HyperTalk with calls to the
database manager.  The standard relational database query language SQL can then
be used to perform more general hypertext searches than are possible with the
string search feature found in most hypertext browsing environments. 
Semiautomatic updates of the content of a hypertext are also possible using SQL
updates on the object representations in the database to trigger corresponding
HyperCard updates on the objects themselves.  We describe a prototype
implementation and present several example queries and updates to motivate this
approach.  These techniques, although demonstrated here specifically using
HyperCard and Oracle for Macintosh, are generally applicable to a wide range of
hypertext systems and relational databases.

%X Research and development has been undertaken on the production of
hypertext-based authoring and end-user training systems, linked to a videodisc
player.  A hypermedia system enabled the use of animation, purpose-designed
graphics, sound and fast response to enhance the learning environment.  The
package structure could be presented, to allow the user to move around the
package, and to see at a glance the consequence of his actions.  In addition,
material visited by the user and decisions taken, could be stored to enable
computer managed manipulation of the data structure for individual
requirements.
   This paper discusses one particular system for design trainers to explore
various structures of training material.  This videodisc-based package gives
guidance on the use of multi-media authoring packages to produce material that
is sensitive to the interests of each trainee at an appropriate level of
understanding.  The control structure required some innovative programming
techniques of benefit to other researchers investigating the potential of
hypermedia.

%X Hypertext and object-oriented database technology offer significant
possibilities for designing new software engineering environments which better
represent the complex relationships between the many artifacts created during
the life of a software system.  These artifacts are composed of structured
(machine understandable) and unstructured information.  Hypertext systems can
record both the structured and unstructured information of the software project
and the linking relationships between both types of information.  Issue-based
information systems (also called argumentation systems) are special-purpose
hypertext systems for capturing the issues and reasoning for decision making. 
The Issue-Based Experiment (IBE) system is an issue-based information system
implemented on an object-oriented database platform.  IBE was developed to
research methods of capturing the life cycle of a software project in an
issue-based information network.  IBE is demonstrated to be useful in both the
requirements development and system maintenance phases of the software life
cycle.  Several issues are discussed concerning the usability of issue-based
information systems: maintaining a constant level of detail, scoping an Issue
for placement in the issue network, and enforcing usage.  IBE looks promising
when integrated as part of a software development environment based on
hypertext and object-oriented database technology.

%X With the advent of multimedia technology, hypertext has evolved into
hypermedia, in which the elements that are linked together can include
animations, video clips, music recordings, and database queries.  The critical
hypertext function of link traversal must undergo a parallel evolution to
support the dynamic aspects of these new types of information.
   This paper introduces the concept of active anchors within dynamic
information and explores the design issues involved in linking to active
anchors.  Scenarios from our hypermedia system, Intermedia, illustrate the use
of active anchors in a university setting.  General conclusions recommend
characteristics that may facilitate the implementation of this concept in other
hypermedia systems.

%X This paper describes how qualitative data collected using several
application software programs were consolidated into a single linked database
using HyperCard.  A Macintosh computing environment with word processing,
database, spreadsheet and graphics applications was first used to transcribe,
code, organize and report on the data.  The creation of the HyperCard database
facilitated pulling together and re-analysing the data to produce new findings.
The example used is a multiple-site case study of the implementation of
microcomputers in a school district that was conducted during 1986-7 and
included structured interviews, informal interviews, naturalistic observations,
content analysis of historical documents, computer usage statistics, and
stages-of-concern graphs.

%X This study adopts as a fundamental orientation the view that hypertext may
eventually bring about a paradigm shift in text delivery and in human
information processing.  However, paradigm shifts do not occur overnight; they
are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  Because of the considerable
commitment of Western knowledge and culture to the written word and to linear
text, it seems likely that successful hypertext systems will -- at least in the
beginning -- electronically emulate many of the strategies a sophisticated
reader uses in dealing with hard copy.  This article describes a project which
modeled the functionality an intelligent reader would bring to paper text
(specifically, a maintenance manual), and designed and implemented a hypertext
version of the document using Apple Computer's HyperCard.
   Since few fully specified hypertext systems have been deployed, the research
described here was undertaken to build a platform on which notions about the
efficacy of non-linear text processing for a specific application could be
tried out.  This article describes a stackware version of a portion of an
aircraft maintenance manual and considers issues of (1) data storage models,
(2) user interface, and (3) information retrieval methods for online text. 
These elements -- among others -- are the essence of the new rhetoric for
non-sequential text.

%X Parallels are frequently drawn between navigating through everyday spatial
environments and information systems, hypertexts being a particular case in
point.  This paper examines the cognitive mapping theory often borrowed
implicitly from spatial cognition research, which has a bearing on the
appropriateness of using spatial imagery in hypertext.  Conceptual differences
between euclidean and virtual spaces are identified, and ways considered in
which to make information spaces more coherent.  A demonstration hypertext
browser is described, incorporating some of the cognitive principles discussed.

%X Hypertext systems operate by establishing links within information.  Links
are normally established by an author, although some systems -- GUIDE, for
example -- make little distinction between author and user, permitting
deliberate modification of existing connections.  However, linking between
nodes, whether by original author or later user, is typically an active
process.  Producing effective hypertext links involves knowledge both of the
system and of the particular data set within it.
   I suggest that efficient link building might be greatly facilitated, and
existing systems given greater functionality, if two related modifications
could be made.  Firstly, more general or' broad-button' nodal links could be
created; I use the phrase 'broad button' linking to describe ranked connections
established between areas of a hyperbase.  The term is defined in detail below.
Intended to be easily selectable, broad-button links would offer users the
choice of a ranked list of destinations from any point within any node. 
Secondly, were nodes to be ranked in order of probable user choice, allowing
users a degree of feedback following selection of a node would permit such
ranking to be dynamically organised.  Feedback of this kind also has potential
in assisting automatic establishment of appropriate new links between nodes.
   In this paper I describe how such modifications might be organised, and
describe some experiments which are currently being planned and undertaken to
evaluate the 'broad-button linking' process.

%X Hypertext systems provide an appealing mechanism for informally browsing
databases by traversing selectable links.  However, in many fact finding
situations string search is an effective complement to browsing.  This paper
describes the application of the signature file method to achieve rapid and
convenient string search in small personal computer hypertext environments. 
The method has been implemented in a prototype, as well as in a commercial
product.  Performance data for search times and storage space are presented
from a commercial hypertext database.  User interface issues are then
discussed.  Experience with the string search interface indicates that it was
used successfully by novice users.

%X Hypermedia systems have been implemented for such a wide range of
applications that one must wonder whether their principles should not be
included among the building blocks of computer environments themselves.  In
this paper, we argue that this would indeed be desirable and present a model on
which such extension could be based.
   After a brief review of hypermedia principles and the terminology used in
this paper, we give examples of several computer applications in which
hypermedia already are or could advantageously be used.  We then suggest that
most computer applications would greatly benefit if hypermedia were extended
from isolated applications to a system-wide facility and that this could
substantially simplify implementation of new hypermedia applications.  This
claim is then generalized and it is shown that extending hypermedia concepts to
the organization of the computer environment itself -- the file system -- and
to the user interface would make computer environments more flexible and easier
to use.
   We then list the main characteristics of such a 'hyperenvironment', and
conclude the paper with an outline of its implementation model and an example.

%X As a growing learning technology, hypermedia needs to be examined in terms
of the cognitive processes it encourages in users.  The characteristics that
circumscribe hypermedia are first discussed.  Two perspectives on learning from
hypermedia are then presented.  These are purpose of usage (culture, education,
information) and usage context.  Four cognitive processes involved in
hypermedia usage are described.  These are browsing, searching, integrating,
and angling (establishing multiple perspectives).  Two cognitive pitfalls are
also discussed: hyperspace wandering and cohesion deficit.  It is concluded
that both practical and theoretical concerns emerge out of this focus on
cognitive processes in hypermedia.

%X The success of hypertext as an information system will depend on its
usability.  Hypertext systems have mostly been built as research prototypes and
paid little attention to user interface usability.  Experiments are conducted
to measure the usability of six well known hypertext systems.  The first
experiment measures authoring speed and the second browsing speed for novice
users.
   Results show that the easiest systems to use, for novices, are those with
the simplest models.  Factors such as a high information band width (multiple
card displays), an uncluttered screen and simple interaction also contribute to
usability.  For authoring, NoteCards emerged as statistically faster than other
systems.

%X HyperCard, by Apple Computer Inc., provides a powerful programming
environment to anyone with a Macintosh computer.  This hypertext development
environment allows novice and intermediate level programmers to create
applications that would otherwise, be beyond their normal capability. 
Unfortunately, very few educators have the time, the programming knowledge, or
can obtain enough professional credit to entice them into becoming HyperTalk
programmers.  If hypertext systems are to have a significant effect on
education, the need to become a programmer must be removed from the lesson
development process.  The Slice of Life STAKAuthor is a second generation
NoteCard-based authoring application.  STAKAuthor is a tool that allows anyone
with the Slice of Life videodisc to create an interactive, computer-assisted
lesson without the need to write a single line of HyperTalk code.
