  abstract = {Content annotations in semantic cultural heritage portals commonly
make spatiotemporal references to historical regions and places using names
whose meanings are different in different times. For example, historical 
administrational regions such as countries, municipalities, and cities have been renamed,
merged together, split into parts, and annexed or moved to and from other regions.
Even if the names of the regions remain the same (e.g., “Germany”), 
the underlying regions and their relationships to other regions may change (e.g., the regional
coverage of “Germany” at different times). As a result, representing and finding
the right ontological meanings for historical geographical names on the semantic
web creates severe problems both when annotating contents and during 
information retrieval. This paper presents a model for representing the meaning of 
changing geospatial resources. Our aim is to enable precise annotation with temporal
geospatial resources and to enable semantic search and browsing using related
names from other historical time periods. A simple model and metadata schema
is presented for representing and maintaining geospatial changes from which an
explicit time series of temporal part-of ontologies can be created automatically.
The model has been applied successfully to representing the complete change 
history of municipalities in Finland during 1865–2007, and the resulting ontology
time series is used in the semantic cultural heritage portal CULTURESAMPO to
support faceted semantic search of contents and to visualizing historical regions
on overlaying maps originating from different historical eras.}
