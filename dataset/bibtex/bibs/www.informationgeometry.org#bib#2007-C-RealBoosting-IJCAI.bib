, abstract={In the past ten years, boosting has become a major field of machine learning and
 classification. This paper brings contributions to its theory and algorithms. We
 first unify a well-known top-down decision tree induction algorithm due to Kearns
 and Mansour, 1999 , and discrete AdaBoost Freund and Schapire, 1997 , as two versions
 of a same higher-level boosting algorithm. It may be used as the basic building
 block to devise simple provable boosting algorithms for complex classifiers. We
 provide one example: the first boosting algorithm for Oblique Decision Trees, an
 algorithm which turns out to be simpler, faster and significantly more accurate
 than previous approaches.}
