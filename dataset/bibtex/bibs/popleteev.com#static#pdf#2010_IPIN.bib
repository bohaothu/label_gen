  abstract = {A cost-effective alternative to Wi-Fi is localization using FM radio
	signals. Previous works on FM positioning considered only outdoor environments and used specialised
	hardware. This paper, in contrast, focuses on indoor scenarios and FM receivers
	already present in many mobile devices, such as cellphones, MP3 players, pedometers,
	etc. The short-range FM transmitters used as beacons are available from conventional electronics
	shops, and are significantly cheaper than Wi-Fi access points. In this paper we present
	the results of experimental comparison of FM and Wi-Fi positioning accuracy. Also,
	we describe and evaluate a method for maintaining the system accuracy over time without
	any additional hardware.}
