    ABSTRACT:: In May, 1995 an NSF workshop on the future of database
               management systems research was convened. This paper reports
               the conclusions of that meeting. Among the most important
               directions for future DBMS research recommended by the panel
               are: support for multimedia objects; managing distributed and
               loosely coupled information, as on the world-wide web;
               supporting new database applications such as data mining and
               warehousing; workflow and other complex
               transaction-management problems, and enhancing the
               ease-of-use of DBMS's for both users and system managers.
