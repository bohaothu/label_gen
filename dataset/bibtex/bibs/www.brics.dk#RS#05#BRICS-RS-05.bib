                  principals specify their trusting relationships with
                  other principals in terms of trust policies. In
                  their paper on trust structures, Carbone et
                  al. present a language for trust policies, and
                  provide a suitable denotational semantics. The
                  semantics ensures that for any collection of trust
                  policies, there is always a unique global
                  trust-state, compatible with all the policies,
                  specifying everyone's degree of trust in everyone
                  else. However, as the authors themselves point out,
                  the language lacks an operational model: the global
                  trust-state is a well-defined mathematical object,
                  but it is not clear how principals can actually
                  compute it. This becomes even more apparent when one
                  considers the intended application environment: vast
                  numbers of autonomous principals, distributed and
                  possibly mobile. We provide a compositional
                  operational semantics for a language of trust
                  policies. The operational semantics is given in
                  terms of a composition of I/O automata. We prove
                  that this semantics is faithful to its corresponding
                  denotational semantics, in the sense that any run of
                  the I/O automaton ``converges to'' the denotational
                  semantics of the policies. Furthermore, as I/O
                  automata are a natural model of asynchronous
                  distributed computation, the semantics leads to an
                  algorithm for distributedly computing the
                  trust-state, which is suitable in the application

                  on the observation that the sequence of character
                  comparisons accurately reflects maintained
                  information. Notably, we can easily prove matchers
                  to be different and we show that they display more
                  variety and finesse than previously believed. As a
                  consequence, we are able to pinpoint differences and
                  inaccuracies in many results previously considered
                  equivalent.\bibpar Our analysis includes a framework
                  that lets us obtain string matchers -- notably the
                  family of Boyer-Moore algorithms -- in a systematic
                  formalism-independent way from a few
                  information-propagation primitives. By leveraging
                  the existing research in string matching, we show
                  that the landscape of information propagation is
                  non-trivial in the sense that small changes in
                  information propagation may dramatically change the

                  classical messages under a shared key, where
                  attempts to eavesdrop the ciphertext can be

                  securely re-use the entire key for encrypting new

                  length of the message, but can re-use almost all of

                  type-indexed logical relation replaced by a
                  ``recursively defined'' \emph{invariant relation},
                  in the style of Pitts. In fact, the construction can
                  be seen as generalizing a computational-adequacy
                  argument for an untyped, call-by-name language to
                  normalization instead of evaluation.\bibpar In the
                  untyped setting, not all terms have normal forms, so
                  the normalization function is necessarily
                  partial. We establish its correctness in the senses
                  of \emph{soundness} (the output term, if any, is in
                  normal form and $\beta$-equivalent to the input
                  term); \emph{identification} ($\beta$-equivalent
                  terms are mapped to the same result); and
                  \emph{completeness} (the function is defined for all
                  terms that do have normal forms). We also show how
                  the semantic construction enables a simple yet
                  formal correctness proof for the normalization
                  algorithm, expressed as a functional program in an
                  ML-like call-by-value language.\bibpar Finally, we
                  generalize the construction to produce an infinitary
                  variant of normal forms, namely \emph{B\"ohm
                  trees}. We show that the three-part characterization
                  of correctness, as well as the proofs, extend
                  naturally to this generalization.",

  abstract =	 "We present a programming pattern where a recursive
                  function defined over a data structure traverses
                  another data structure at return time. The idea is
                  that the recursive calls get us `there' by
                  traversing the first data structure and the returns
                  get us `back again' while traversing the second data
                  structure. We name this programming pattern of
                  traversing a data structure at call time and another
                  data structure at return time ``There And Back
                  Again'' (TABA).\bibpar The TABA pattern directly
                  applies to computing symbolic convolutions and to
                  multiplying polynomials. It also blends well with
                  other programming patterns such as dynamic
                  programming and traversing a list at double
                  speed. We illustrate TABA and dynamic programming
                  with Catalan numbers. We illustrate TABA and
                  traversing a list at double speed with palindromes
                  and we obtain a novel solution to this traditional
                  exercise. Finally, through a variety of tree
                  traversals, we show how to apply TABA to other data
                  structures than lists.\bibpar A TABA-based function
                  written in direct style makes full use of an
                  ALGOL-like control stack and needs no heap
                  allocation. Conversely, in a TABA-based function
                  written in continuation-passing style and
                  recursively defined over a data structure (traversed
                  at call time), the continuation acts as an iterator
                  over a second data structure (traversed at return
                  time). In general, the TABA pattern saves one from
                  accumulating intermediate data structures at call
                  time",
