  abstract = {Pastry is an algorithm for implementing a scalable distributed hash
	table over an underlying P2P network, an active area of research
	in distributed systems.
	
	Several implementations of Pastry are available and have been applied
	in practice, but no attempt has so far been made to formally describe
	the algorithm or to verify its properties. Since Pastry combines
	rather complex data structures, asynchronous communication, concurrency,
	resilience to \emph{churn} and fault tolerance, it makes an interesting
	target for verification. We have modeled Pastry's core routing algorithms
	in the specification language \texorpdfstring{\textrm{\upshape TLA\textsuperscript{+}}}{TLA+}
	and used its model checker \textsc{tlc} to analyze qualitative properties
	of Pastry such as \emph{correctness} and \emph{consistency}.}
