In this paper, we present openacademia, a semantics-based system for the management of distributed bibliographic information collected from the Web, in which the Instance Unification problem is ubiquitous. Our tentative solution is Rough DL, a simple extension of classical Description Logics, which allows for approximations of vague concept. This shows that already a simple formalism for dealing with uncertain information in a qualitative way can provide an elegant solution to practical problems on the Semantic Web.",

abstract = "In medicine, many diseases cannot be defined unequivocally by etiology or anatomical localization, but are instead described by a combination of signs and symptoms that are common in patients believed to be having that disease. In communication between health care professionals, this is generally not problematic. In biomedical research, however, crisp definitions are required to distinguish patients with and without the disease. This results in different operational definitions being in use for a single disease. Comparing those definitions, e.g, for trial design, is complicated by their complex structure. This paper presents an approach to compare different operational definitions of a single disease in a systematic manner using formal ontological modeling and reasoning. The concept of an operationalization hierarchy is introduced, which is subsequently used to model and analyze operational disease definitions. The approach is illustrated with a case-study in the area of severe sepsis.",

Often, for example in medical applications, concepts are not definable in a crisp way but can fairly exhaustively be constrained through a particular sub- and a particular super-concept. We introduce such lower and upper approximations based on rough-set semantics, and show that reasoning in these languages can be reduced to standard DL satisfiability. This allows us to apply Rough Description Logics in a study of medical trials about sepsis patients, which is a typical application for precise modeling of vague knowledge. The study shows that Rough DL-based reasoning can be done in a realistic use case and that modeling vague knowledge helps to answer important questions in the design of clinical trials.",
