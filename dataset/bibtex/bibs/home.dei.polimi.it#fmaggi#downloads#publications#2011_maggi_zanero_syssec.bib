                  lines of research in the systems security area
                  pursued by the Performance Evaluation Lab of
                  Politecnico di Milano. We describe our past research
                  in the area of learning algorithms applied to
                  intrusion detection, our current work in the area of
                  malware analysis, and our future research outlook,
                  oriented to the cloud, to mobile device security,
                  and to cyber-physical systems.},
