  abstract = {Clinical studies are often conducted as multi-centered studies involving
  participants at different locations. Thus it becomes obvious that
  using mobile platforms and remote data entry is beneficial for such
  studies. When working in a distributed fashion, data exchange standards
  are required. Bringing these standards to the end user also requires
  incorporating user interface issues. Considering various device types,
  from desktop computer to small handheld devices raises the question
  how user interfaces could be derived from the data exchange standards.
  In this paper we consider CDISC´s Operational Data Model as a data
  standard and discuss its relevance in the user interface generation
  process. Several candidate description languages are explored and
  embedded into a general transformation process emphasizing especially
  small and mobile device characteristics.},
