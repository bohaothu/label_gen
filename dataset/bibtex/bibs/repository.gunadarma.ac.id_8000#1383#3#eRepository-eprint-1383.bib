        abstract = {Despite the very high penetration of the private sector with mobile devices, only few applications
and services based on mobile technologies are used, and those are rather trivial. This article
suggests an approach for the identification of alternatives for the support of processes of everyday
life by launching and establishing services based on mobile applications, mobile devices, and
infrastructures for mobile dispositions. Therefore a framework for the identification as well as
criteria for the analysis of potential fields of application will be discussed in detail. An exemplary
benchmark for a selected basic process in private everyday life visualises the suggested framework,
which can be adapted for individual methodical analyses.}
