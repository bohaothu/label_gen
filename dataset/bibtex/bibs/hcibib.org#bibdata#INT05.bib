%X Among others, Hummels, Djajadiningrat and Overbeeke (Knowing, Doing and
Feeling: Communication with your Digital Products. Interdisziplinares Kolleg
Kognitions und Neurowissenschaften, Gunne am Mohnesee, March 2-9 2001,
289-308.), have expressed the notion that the real product of design is the
resultant "context for experience" rather than the object or software that
provokes that experience. This closely corresponds to what I refer to as a
transition in focus from a materialistic to an experiential view of design.
Paraphrasing what I have already said, is not the physical entity or what is in
the box (the "material" product) that is the true outcome of the design
process. Rather, it is the behavioural, experiential and emotional responses
that come about as a result of its existence and use in the "wild".
   Designing for experience comes with a whole new level of complexity. This is
especially true in this emerging world of information appliances, reactive
environments and ubiquitous computing, where, along with those of their users,
we have to factor in the convoluted behaviours of the products themselves.
Doing this effectively requires both a different mind-set, as well as different
techniques.
   This talk is motivated by a concern that, in general, our current training
and work practices are not adequate to meet the demands of this level of
design. This is true for those coming from a computer science background, since
they do not have sufficient grounding in design, at least in the sense that
would be recognized by an architect or industrial designer. Conversely, those
from the design arts, while they have the design skills, do not generally have
the technical skills to adequately address the design issues relating to the
complex embedded behaviours of such devices and systems.
   Hence, in this talk, we discuss the design process itself, from the
perspective of methods, organization, and composition. Fundamental to our
approach is the notion that sketching is a fundamental component of design, and
is especially critical at the early ideation phase. Yet, due to the temporal
nature of what we are designing, conventional sketching is not - on its own -
adequate. Hence, if we are to design experience or interaction, we need to
adopt something that is to our process that is analogous to what traditional
sketching is to the process of conventional industrial design.
   It is the motivation and exploration of such a sketching process that is the
foundation of this presentation.

%X Our society's modalities of communication are rapidly changing: we divide
our activities between real and digital worlds and our daily lives are
characterized by our constant access-to and processing-of a vast quantity and
variety of information. These transformations of our lifestyle demand both a
new architecture and interaction modalities that support the new as well as old
ways of communicating and living.
   As a consequence of the prevalent role of information in today's society,
architecture is presently at a turning point. Screens are everywhere, from the
billboards which dot the contemporary urban cityscape, to the video walls which
welcome us in the entry-halls of corporate headquarter buildings, to our
desktop computer monitor at home, the PDA in our pocket, or the tiny
private-eye screens of wearable computers. Wearable computers are starting to
transform our technological landscape by reshaping the heavy, bulky desktop
computer into a lightweight, portable device that's accessible to people at any
time. Computation and sensing are moving from computers and devices into the
environment itself. The space around us is instrumented with sensors and
displays, and this tends to reflect a widespead need to blend together the
information space with our physical space. "Augmented reality" and "mixed
reality" are the terms most often used to refer to this type of media-enhanced
interactive space. The combination of large public and miniature personal
digital displays together with distributed computing and sensing intelligence
offers unprecedented opportunities to merge the virtual and the real, the
information landscape of the Internet with the urban landscape of the city, to
transform digital animated media in public installations, in storytellers, also
by means of personal wearable technology.
   To meet the challenges of the new information- and technology-inspired
architecture we need to think of the architectural space not simply as a
container but as a living body endowed with sensors, actuators, and a brain (a
mind), a space capable of assisting people in the course of their activities
within such spaces.
   On the basis of my work and research I will argue that intelligent
architecture needs to be supported by three forms of intelligence: perceptual
intelligence, which captures people's presence and movement in the space in a
natural and non-encumbering way; interpretive intelligence, which "understands"
people's actions and is capable of making informed guesses about their
behavior; and narrative intelligence, which presents us with information,
articulated stories, images, and animations, in the right place, at the right
time, all tailored to our needs and preferences.
   This talk will describe and illustrate a series of models, technological
platforms and installations the author developed originally at the MIT Media
Lab (1994 to 2002) and later commercially for Sensing Places (2003 to 2005).
They contribute to defining new trends in architecture that merge virtual and
real spaces, and are currently in the process of reshaping the way we live and
experience the museum, the home, the theater, and the modern city.

%X The Web took the world by storm, and as a result developed rapidly in many
directions. However it still exhibits many aspects of its early development,
such as its visual and computer-screen orientation. But the Web is still
developing rapidly: there are now more browsers on mobile telephones than on
desktops, and there is a vast diversity in types of devices, types and
orientations of screens, and sizes (in number of pixels), and resolutions (in
dpi) of screens.
   Dealing with this diversity is impossible to address just by keeping a list
of all the possible devices, or even a list of the most-used ones, and
producing different sites for them, since the complexity would be unmanageable,
and because once sites started turning away browsers and devices they didn't
know, the browser makers responded by disguising themselves to such sites as
other browsers.
   On top of this diversity there is also the diversity required for
accessibility. Although providing access for the visually impaired is an
important reason for accessibility, we are all more or less visually impaired
at one time or another. When displaying an application on a projector screen at
a conference or meeting, the whole audience will typically be visually impaired
in comparison to someone sitting behind a computer screen. The existence of
separate socalled "Ten-foot Interfaces" (for people controlling their computers
by remote control from an armchair ten feet away) demonstrates that the
original applications are not designed for accessibility. Furthermore, Google
(and all other search engines) is blind, and sees only what a blind user sees
of a page; as the webmaster of a large bank has remarked, "we have noticed that
improving accessibility increases our Google rating".
   The success of the Web has turned the browser into a central application
area for the user, and you can spend most of your day working with applications
in the browser, reading mail, shopping, searching your own diskdrive. The
advent of applications such as Google Maps and GMail has focussed minds on
delivering applications via the web, not least because it eliminates the
problems involved with versioning: everyone always has the most recent version
of your application. Since Web-based applications have benefits for both user
and provider, we can only expect to see more of them in the future.
   But this approach comes at a cost. Google Maps is of the order of 200K of
Javascript code. Such applications are only writable by programming experts,
and producing an application is not possible by the sort of people who often
produce web pages for their own use.
   The Web Interfaces landscape is in turmoil at the moment. Microsoft has
announced a new markup language and vector graphics language for the next
version of Windows; probably as a response Adobe has acquired Macromedia and
therefore Flash; W3C have standards for applications in the form of XForms,
XHTML and SVG and are working on "compound documents"; and other browser
manufacturers are calling for their own version of HTML.
   What are we to make of these different approaches? Are they conflicting?
Have any addressed authorability, device-independence, usability or
accessibility? Is it even possible to make accessible applications? HTML made
creating hypertext documents just about as easy as it could be; do any of the
new approaches address this need for simplicity, or has power been
irretrievably returned to the programmers?
   This talk discusses the requirements for Web Applications, and the
underpinnings necessary to make Web Applications follow in the same spirit that
engendered the Web in the first place.

%X This paper presents an initial investigation into the use of Tactons, or
tactile icons, to present progress information in desktop human-computer
interfaces. Progress bars are very common in a wide range of interfaces but
have problems. For example, they must compete for screen space and visual
attention with other visual tasks such as document editing or web browsing. To
address these problems we created a tactile progress indicator, encoding
progress information into a series of vibrotactile cues. An experiment
comparing the tactile progress indicator to a standard visual one showed a
significant improvement in performance and an overall preference for the
tactile display. These results suggest that a tactile display is a good way to
present such information and this has many potential applications from computer
desktops to mobile telephones.

%X This paper describes a model for haptizing wind on a weather map. To design
the model, we examined the human sensory scale to represent wind speed and
direction with appropriate haptic stimuli, and examined parameters of the
stimulus that allow a user to easily recognize changes in wind speed and
direction. The results of these experiments show that vibration frequency can
represent wind speed while a constant reactive force represents direction. The
model solves a problem users of reactive force-only systems have difficulty
identifying direction when the force is small due to light wind. Based on the
model, we have developed a prototype weather information system with visual and
haptic information.

%X Quick prototyping of tangible user interfaces is currently hampered by
availability of toolkits and the double challenge of tinkering with software
and hardware. While software may be downloaded, hardware cannot. As a
work-around for a class on experimental prototyping of tangible appliances we
utilized the ARToolKit that tracks optical markers. By creatively adapting it,
our students quickly developed working prototypes, simulating a range of
devices and tracking technologies. Our approach enabled a focus on quick
prototyping, idea testing and simulation of the interaction process. We explain
our reasons for using the ARToolKit, summarize its advantages and
disadvantages, present four students projects, and discuss our experiences and
conclusions. In particular we found that visual tracking has the advantage not
to limit or determine possible interaction styles and thus fosters designing
richer interaction. We discuss this as a requirement for future tangible
prototyping toolkits.

%X Tangible computing applications are rarely evaluated with field studies in
real settings, which can contribute as formative studies to understand the
challenges and benefits of tangible interfaces in real world practices. We
present an AR environment for painting, with a physical brush, digital textures
on physical models and creating dynamic stages for the model with spatial
collages providing different backgrounds. We report on an evaluation of this AR
environment in an architecture school, where 8 groups of students used it as a
practical assignment. The evaluation demonstrated the benefits of specific
features of the environment and of its tangible interfaces: immersiveness,
public availability, supporting collaboration, flexibility, dynamicism and
resulting rapidity in creating mixed media representations. Several challenges
surfaced from the evaluation especially in connection to the distribution of
the interface. The physical, spatial, and computational separation of interface
components raised issues on accountability and ergonomics. We link our
observations to design guidelines.

%X Mobile devices (cellular phone, PDA, etc.) have so far been personal tools.
Due to their evolution to multi-functionality, however, the devices have begun
to be used by multiple people in co-located situations. This paper discusses
near future technologies: a mobile device with a projector and intuitive
manipulation techniques by using a video camera mounted on the device. In
today's technologies, it is difficult to realize a mobile device with a small
and lightweight projector that still retains the feature of mobility.
Therefore, we have developed a system to project displays of mobile devices on
a table, a floor, or a wall, by tracking their three-dimensional positions and
orientations and using an existing LCD projector. The proposed system called
Hotaru (a firefly, in English) allows users to annotate/rotate a picture or a
document in a mobile device by touching its projected display with their
fingers. Users can intuitively transfer a file between multiple devices by
making their projected displays overlapped. Informal evaluations of Hotaru
indicated that the proposed manipulation techniques could effectively support
multiple people in co-located situations in conducting their tasks.

%X Pen computing devices provide a natural interface for annotating documents
with freeform digital ink. However, digital ink annotations are usually larger
and sloppier than real ink annotations on paper. We present DIZI, a
focus+context interface that zooms up a region of the underlying document for
inking. Users write in the zoomed region at a comfortable size for the device.
When the zoom region is shrunk back to normal page size, the digital ink
shrinks to an appropriate size for the underlying document. The zoom region
covers only a small portion of the screen so that users can always see the
overall context of the underlying document. We describe several techniques for
fluidly moving the zoom region to navigate the document. We show that DIZI
allows users to create digital ink annotations that more closely mimic the look
of real ink annotations on physical paper.

%X This paper presents a comparison of several selection aids to improve
pointing input on tabletop displays. Our previous research explored the
TractorBeam -- a hybrid point-touch interaction technique for tabletop
displays. We found that while pointing input was preferred (over touch) by
users of tabletop displays, it was slower for small distant targets. Drawing
from previous work on improving target acquisition for desktop displays, we
developed and tested three selection aids to improve pointing selection of
small distant targets on tabletop displays: expanding the cursor, expanding the
target, and snapping to the target. Our experiments revealed that all three
aids resulted in faster selection times than no selection aid at all, with
snapping to the target being the fastest. Additionally, participants liked
snapping to the target better than the other selection aids and found it to be
the most effective for selecting targets.

%X In the CAS/CAD field, the increasing adoption of Spline-based free-form
methods to generate surfaces, has introduced a higher degree of freedom into
the design process. However, on the other hand, this evolution has made the
process of creating and manipulating surfaces more complex. For this reason a
much more intuitive and intelligent task-centered and user-centered interaction
paradigm is required. This paper presents a responsive interaction technique
which adopts a sketch-based interface capable of exploiting the stepwise
refinement process typical of conceptual designing. Further it makes use of
adaptive user modeling techniques by introducing an innovative adaptive
decision-tree structure for top-down designing. We illustrate the
implementation of the algorithm and we highlight its efficiency and feasibility
for its adoption within Sketch-Based Modeling Systems (SBMS).

%X A 2x2 mixed design experiment (N=52) was conducted to examine the effects of
search interface and task complexity on participants' information-seeking
performance and affective experience. Keyword vs. natural language search was
the within-participants factor; simple vs. complex tasks was the
between-participants factor. There were cross-over interactions such that
complex-task participants were more successful and thought the tasks were less
difficult and reported more enjoyment and confidence when they used keyword
search vs. natural language queries, while the opposite was found for
simple-task participants. The findings suggest that natural language search is
not the panacea for all information retrieval tasks: task complexity is a
critical mediator. Implications for interface design and directions for future
research are discussed.

%X We present a lightweight tool to compare the relevance ranking provided by a
search engine to the relevance as actually judged by the user performing the
query. Using the tool, we conducted a user study with two different versions of
the search engine for a large corporate web site with more than 1.8 million
pages, and with the popular search engine GoogleTM. Our tool provides an
inexpensive and efficient way to do this comparison, and can be easily extended
to any search engine that provides an API. Relevance feedback from actual users
can be used to assess precision and recall of a search engine's retrieval
algorithms and, perhaps more importantly, to tune its relevance ranking
algorithms to better match user needs. We found the tool to be quite effective
at comparing different versions of the same search engine, and for benchmarking
by comparing against a standard.

%X Document triage is the practice of quickly determining the merit and
disposition of relevant documents. This practice involves selection of
documents from a document overview and quick forms of reading: skimming,
reading short portions of a longer document, and navigating through headings,
indices, and tables of contents. Earlier studies of document triage practice
showed considerable overhead related to window management during transitions
between the document overview and reading interfaces. This study examines the
impact of multiple display configurations on document triage practice. In
particular, it compares (1) configurations with same and different size
displays, and (2) configurations with and without user control over which
activity is performed on which display. Results show a significant increase in
the number of transitions between activities when a multi-display configuration
is introduced although there is no significant difference between the different
multiple display configurations. Additionally, user activity with a document
was positively correlated with an overall assessment of document value.

The way music is searched and the subjective factors varied significantly
across input device and type of audio feedback. However, no difference in task
completion time was found for the evaluated interfaces. Based on the

searching and browsing in recorded music.

%X This paper describes a new unifying workstyle model for the user-centered
design process, comprised of eight dimensions that we claim as fundamental to
supporting the UCD process. Our proposal is new because it is the first
workstyle model tailored to UCD. We also show the usefulness of workstyle
modeling when evaluating the stage/effort of a project at a given time. Our
workstyle model was based on the identification of the main obstacles to UCD
and SE integration, current research results and extensive observation of HCI
students involved in UCD projects. Though simple, it models the designer's
behavior and can be effectively and easily used to (a) choose adequate tool
support for a given phase of a project and (b) drive the development of new UCD
tools.

%X Nowadays, designers of Virtual Reality (VR) applications are faced with the
choice of a large number of different input and output devices leading to a
growing number of interaction techniques. Usually VR interaction techniques are
described informally, based on the actions users can perform within the VR
environment. At implementation time, such informal descriptions (made at design
time) yield to ambiguous interpretations by the developers. In addition,
informal descriptions make it difficult to foresee the impact throughout the
application of a modification of the interaction techniques. This paper
discusses the advantages of using a formal description technique (called ICO)
to model interaction techniques and dialogues for VR applications. This
notation is presented via a case study featuring an immersive VR application.
The case study is then used to show, through analysis of models, how the formal
notation can help to ensure the usability, reliability and efficiency of
virtual reality systems.

%X Mobility of ubiquitous systems offers the possibility of using the current
context to infer information that might otherwise require user input. This can
either make user interfaces more intuitive or cause subtle and confusing mode
changes. We discuss the analysis of such systems that will allow the designer
to predict potential pitfalls before the design is fielded. Whereas the current
predominant approach to understanding mobile systems is to build and explore
experimental prototypes, our exploration highlights the possibility that early
models of an interactive system might be used to predict problems with
embedding in context before costly mistakes have been made. Analysis based on
model checking is used to contrast configuration and context issues in two
interfaces to a process control system.

%X Detachable user interfaces consist of graphical user interfaces whose parts
or whole can be detached at run-time from their host, migrated onto another
computing platform while carrying out the task, possibly adapted to the new
platform and attached to the target platform in a peer-to-peer fashion.
Detaching is the property of splitting a part of a UI for transferring it onto
another platform. AttAaching is the reciprocal property: a part of an existing
interface can be attached to the currently being used interface so as to
recompose another one on-demand, according to user's needs, task requirements.
Assembling interface parts by detaching and attaching allows dynamically
composing, decomposing and re-composing new interfaces on demand. To support
this interaction paradigm, a development infrastructure has been developed
based on a series of primitives such as display, undisplay, copy, expose,
return, transfer, delegate, and switch. We exemplify it with QTkDraw, a
painting application with attaching and detaching based on the development
infrastructure.

%X This paper discusses the design and development of a preference-based search
tool (PBST) for tourists, operating on PDA devices. PBSTs are decision support
systems that help users in finding the outcomes (e.g., multi-attribute products
or services) that best satisfy their needs and preferences. Our tool is
specifically aimed at filtering the amount of information about points of
interest (POIs) in a geographic area, thus supporting users in the search of
the most suitable solution to their needs (e.g., a hotel, a restaurant, a
combination of POIs satisfying a set of constraints specified by the user). We
focus on the design of an effective interface for the tool, by exploring the
combination of dynamic queries to filter POIs on a map with a visualization of
the degree of satisfaction of constraints set by the user. We also report the
results of a usability test we carried out on the first prototype of the
system.

%X Local memory in mobile devices increases rapidly. Simultaneously, new
content creation devices, such as digital cameras, are embedded. As a
consequence, the amount of locally stored content is bound to increase in huge
numbers. In order to provide support for end-users in managing this
ever-growing pile of content, new means of accessing, organizing, and enjoying
the content are needed. We investigate techniques that may be used to display
more information, especially visual content, on the mobile device screen at
once, as well as accessing the content with ease. We focus on visual
interaction, with a media manager as a target application. We present the
design factors and a prototype application running on a mobile phone. We show
that it is feasible to include spatial cues in the design of mobile user
interfaces, and report an initial usability study with very encouraging
results.

%X We examined the strengths and weaknesses of three diverse scroll control
modalities for photo browsing on personal digital assistants (PDAs). This
exploration covered nine alternatives in a design space that consisted of three
visual interfaces and three control modalities. The three interfaces were a
traditional thumbnail layout, a layout that placed a single picture on the
screen at a time, and a hybrid that placed one large photo in the center of the
display, while also displaying a row of neighboring thumbnails at the top and
bottom of the screen. In a user experiment we paired each of these interfaces
with each of the following three scroll control modalities: a jog dial, a
squeeze sensor, and an on-screen control that was activated by tapping with a
stylus. We offer a simple model that classifies our experiment's interfaces by
how much they provide visual context within the photo collection. The model
also classifies the scroll modalities by how tightly they correlate scroll
input actions to effects on the screen. Performance and attitudinal results
from the user experiment are presented and discussed.

few have considered the small screens of handheld computers. This paper
presents an investigation into the effect of varying font size between 2 and 16
point on reading text on a handheld computer. By using both older and younger
participants the possible effects of age were examined. Reading speed and
accuracy were measured and subjective views of participants recorded. Objective
results showed that there was little difference in reading performance above 6
point, but subjective comments from participants showed a preference for sizes
in the middle range. We therefore suggest, for reading tasks, that designers of
interfaces for mobile computers provide fonts in the range of 8-12 point to
maximize readability for the widest range of users.

challenging researchers in the HCI community to design technologies to help
them remain independent and preserve their quality of life. One approach has
been to create assistive technology solutions using Personal Digital Assistants
(PDAs). However, some have questioned whether older people can use PDAs because
of age related problems with dexterity, coordination, and vision. This paper
presents an initial usability study that shows there are no major differences
in performance between older and younger users when physically interacting with
PDAs and completing conventional (e.g. pressing buttons, viewing icons,
recording messages) and non-conventional tasks (e.g. scanning bar codes).

%X A system for automatically evaluating the usability and accessibility of web
sites by checking their HTML code against guidelines has been developed. All
usability and accessibility guidelines are formally expressed in a
XML-compliant specification language called Guideline Definition Language (GDL)
so as to separate the evaluation engine from the evaluation logics (the
guidelines). This separation enables managing guidelines (i.e., create,
retrieve, update, and delete) without affecting the code of the evaluation
engine. The evaluation engine is coupled to a reporting system that
automatically generates one or many evaluation reports in a flexible way:
adaptation for screen reading or for a printed report, sorting by page, by
object, by guideline, by priority, or by severity of the detected problems.
This paper focuses on the reporting system.

the underlying theory is presented and differentiated from related research.
The proposed solution has been implemented as a prototype and tested for
usability issues using an online evaluation and in-laboratory eye-tracking to
find some evidence that time spent off-communication is reduced. The results
are reported briefly, implications considered and the areas for further work

cooperative work. Laboratory tests showed the approach was efficient and
effective; focus groups were run to assess its ease of use. Logs, user
satisfaction questionnaires, and interviews were exploited to investigate the
interaction experience. We found that user' attitude is mainly hierarchical
with the user wishing to control and check the system's initiatives. However
when confidence in the system capabilities rises, a more cooperative
interaction is adopted.

%X Multiple large displays are being increasingly used in interactive
workspaces to enhance individual and group work. However, little research has
been conducted to determine whether various configurations of large displays
impact users or their tasks differently. We show that such an impact exists,
and take steps towards developing guidelines for how to effectively arrange
large displays in interactive workspaces. For two large displays, we
manipulated their physical separation, angle between them, and symmetry when
facing each other and measured time on task, subjective workload, and
satisfaction for application relocation tasks. From the results, we produced
three useful guidelines: (i) displays can be separated on a horizontal plane up
to a subtended visual angle of 45&deg;, (ii) a display should not be placed
behind a user, but if necessary, it should be offset relative to the user, and
(iii) displays should be positioned at a 45&deg; angle relative to each other
rather than being orthogonal. As the use of large displays is increasing, these
guidelines should have a broad, practical impact.

%X The use of multiple monitors for personal desktop computing is becoming more
prevalent as the price of display technology decreases. The use of two monitors
for a single desktop has been shown to have performance improvement in several
studies. However, few studies have been performed with more than three
monitors. As a result, we report an observational analysis of the use of a
large tiled display containing nine monitors (in a 3x3 matrix). The total
resolution of the large display is 3840x3072, for a total of 11,796,480 pixels.
Over the course of six months we observed the behavior and actions of five
users who used the display extensively as a desktop. We relate our
observations, provide feedback concerning common usage of how people do and do
not use the display, provide common scenarios and results of interviews, and
give a series of design recommendations and guidelines for future designers of
applications for high-resolution, tiled displays.

%X Conventional interaction in large screen projection-based display sys tems
only allows a "master user" to have full control over the application. We have
developed the VRGEO Demonstrator application based on an interaction paradigm
that allows multiple users to share large projection-based environment displays
for co-located collaboration. Following SDG systems we introduce a
collaborative interface based on tracked PDAs and integrate common device
metaphors into the interface to improve user's learning experience of the
virtual environment system. The introduction of multiple workspaces in a
virtual envi ronment allows users to spread out data for analysis making use of
the large screen space more effectively. Two extended informal evaluation
sessions with application domain experts and demonstrations of the system show
that our collaborative interaction paradigm improves the learning experience
and interac tivity of the virtual environment.

%X Technical troubleshooting is a domain that has changed enormously in recent
years. Instead of relying on visits from service personnel end users facing
technical problems with machinery, for example computers and printers, can now
seek assistance from systems that guide them toward an autonomous solution of
the problem. Systems that can be offered to them are wide in their range, but
typically fall either in the category of Expert Systems or searchable databases
that can be queried with keyword searches. Both approaches present advantages
and disadvantages in terms of flexibility to address different levels of user
expertise and ease of maintenance. However, few studies explicitly address the
issue of how best to design for a balance between guidance and user freedom in
such systems. In the work reported here an office equipment manufacturer's call
centre was studied in order to understand the mechanisms used when human agents
guide users toward a resolution. The overall aim here is not to reproduce the
agent behaviour in a system, but rather to identify which interactional
building blocks such a system should have. These are assessed in relation to
the existing online knowledge base resources offered by the same company in
order to exemplify the kinds of issues designers need to attend to in this
domain.

research approach is utilized in the analysis user involvement in software
development organizations operating in the product development context. User
involvement is indirect in the organizations, and labelled as usability work.
Usability specialists are conceptualized as a specific community of practice,
usability work being their practice. Analysis reveals divergent ways usability
work has been organized in the organizations, and divergent meanings attached

interaction is still poorly understood. We present an experiment that compares
think-aloud and constructive interaction. The experiment involves 60 children
with three setups where children apply think-aloud or constructive interaction
in acquainted and non-acquainted pairs. Our results show that the pairing of
children had impact on how the children collaborated in pairs and how they
would afterward assess the testing sessions. In some cases, we found that
acquainted dyads would perform well as they would more naturally interact and
collaborate while in other cases they would have problems in controlling the
evaluations.

explores three different interfaces to support this task on the limited screen
of mobile devices (e.g., PDAs, in-car systems, mobile phones). Two of the
considered interfaces are based on the idea of tree-augmentation of a list
proposed in Furnas' Effective View Navigation theory [6] and differ in their
depth versus breadth ratio. The third interface adopts the traditional
technique of list scrolling based on keyboard entry. We compare them in terms
of search time, number of errors, and user's satisfaction. Results show that
list scrolling based on keyboard entry outperforms both tree-augmented lists
and that the broader tree-augmented list is better than the deeper one.

proposed to use error-tolerant spoken queries [26] combined with direct
modalities such as buttons mounted on the steering wheel [7]. In this paper, we
present in detail the results of an experiment designed to compare the industry
standard approach of hierarchical graphical menus to our approach. We found our
proposed interface to be more efficient and less distracting in a simulated
driving task.

%X Sketching activities are widely adopted during early design phases of user
interface development to convey informal specifications of the interface
presentation and dialog. Designers or even end users can sketch some or all of
the future interface they want. With the ever increasing availability of
different computing platforms, a need arises to continuously support sketching
across these platforms with their various programming languages, interface
development environments and operating systems. To address needs along these
dimensions, which pose new challenges to user interface sketching tools,
Sketchi XML is a multi-platform multi-agent interactive application that enable
designers and end users to sketch user interfaces with different levels of
details and support for different contexts of use. The results of the sketching
are then analyzed to produce interface specifications independently of any
context, including user and platform. These specifications are exploited to
progressively produce one or several interfaces, for one or many users,
platforms, and environments.

input system. FlowMouse uses optical flow techniques to model the motion of the
hand and a capacitive touch sensor to enable and disable interaction. By using
optical flow rather than a more traditional tracking based method, FlowMouse is
exceptionally robust, simple in design, and offers opportunities for fluid
gesture-based interaction that go well beyond merely emulating pointing devices
such as the mouse. We present a Fitts law study examining pointing performance,
and discuss applications of the optical flow field for gesture input.

present a complementary approach that depends on active user participation and
emphasizes the experience of using peripheral displays. The Context of Use
Evaluation of Peripheral Displays (CUEPD) captures context of use through
individualized scenario building, enactment and reflection. We illustrate the
CUEPD method in a study to evaluate two peripheral displays. The evaluation
using CUEPD revealed important design recommendations, suggesting that the
method may be an important advance in evaluation methods for peripheral
displays.

%X The many benefits that cell phones provide are at times overshadowed by the
problems they create, as when one person's cell phone disrupts a group
activity, such as a class, meeting or movie. Cell phone interruption is only
highlighted by the ever increasing number of mobile devices we carry. Many
tools and techniques have been proposed in order to minimize interruption
caused by mobile devices. In the current study, we use calendar information to
infer users' activity and to automatically configure cell phones accordingly.
Our in-situ experiment uses PDAs that run a cell phone simulator to examine the
feasibility and design factors of such a solution. Our results show that both
structured activities and appropriate cell phone configuration can be predicted
with high accuracy using the calendar information. The results also show
consistent mapping of activities to configuration for each individual. However
there was a poor consistency of mapping activity to configuration across
different participants. We discuss the results in relation to inaccuracy,
spontaneous activities, and user reactions.

%X Navigation and manipulation in virtual environments may require up to six
degrees of freedom each. Input devices with twelve or more degrees of freedom
can avoid explicit changes between navigation and manipulation and may
therefore perform well in certain situations. However, usability of already
existing 12-DOF devices is still unclear. For evaluating such handheld devices,
we developed an extended docking task based on docking tasks designed for
examining the usability of 6-DOF devices. In addition to the usually
investigated object manipulation, the task requires navigation. We compared
docking performances of two 12-DOF devices, the CubicMouse and the YoYo.
Additionally, performance with a newly developed 12-DOF input device, the
SquareBone, was under study. The SquareBone, a variation of the YoYo idea
combined with some potentially beneficial features of the CubicMouse, provides
2 * 6 elastic DOF which can be controlled simultaneously. The study revealed
that the isotonic CubicMouse, although preferred by novice users, was
outperformed by the elastic SquareBone and the YoYo. The new SquareBone was
shown to bear the potential of becoming superior to the YoYo, possibly because
it enables simultaneous control of the 2*6 DOF.

%X 3D computer graphic models hold much promise as illustrations that can be
interactively explored. These 3D illustrations often need to be linked to
labels, annotations and sometimes more lengthy textual explanations. Achieving
effective integration of the 3D illustration and its textual information is a
difficult task and has resulted in a variety of proposed approaches. However,
the comparative effectiveness of these approaches has not been studied. To
address this issue, we have conducted a study in which we have compared methods
of associating text with its 3D model: attaching the text directly to the
object, placing the text in the object's shadow, using symbols to make the
correlation between the object and the text, and using a line to make the
visual connection from the text to the object with and without additional hints
in the shadow. During the first part we were interested in whether a graphical
method can clarify the correlation between a part of the 3D model and its
associated text. The second part focused on whether the text remains
comprehensible during a scene exploration. Based on our results, we suggest
design implications for developing interactive 3D illustrations.

%X Much work in the area of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has
targeted the problem of supporting meetings between collaborators who are
non-collocated, enabling meetings to transcend boundaries of space. In this
paper, we explore the beginnings of a proposed solution for allowing meetings
to transcend time as well. The need for such a solution is motivated by a user
survey in which busy professionals are questioned about meetings they have
either missed or forgotten the important details about after the fact. Our
proposed solution allows these professionals to transcend time in a sense by
revisiting a recorded meeting that has been structured for quick retrieval of
sought information. Such a solution supports complete recovery of prior
discussions, allowing needed information to be retrieved quickly, and thus
potentially facilitating the effective continuation of discussions from the
past. We evaluate the proposed solution with a formal user study in which we
measure the impact of the proposed structural annotations on retrieval of
information. The results of the study show that participants took significantly
less time to retrieve the answers when they had access to discourse structure
based annotation than in a control condition in which they had access only to
unannotated video recordings (p &lt; 0.01, effect size 0.94 standard

%X This paper explores the interaction between human and artificial problem
solvers when interacting with an Intelligent Scheduling System. An experimental
study is presented aimed at investigating the users' attitude towards two
alternative strategies for solving scheduling problems: automated and
interactive. According to an automated strategy the responsibility of solving
the problem is delegated to the artificial solver, while according to an
interactive strategy human and automated solvers cooperate to achieve a problem
solution.
   Previous observations of end-users' reactions to problem solving systems
have shown that users are often skeptical toward artificial solver performance
and prefer to keep the control of the problem solving process. The current
study aims at understanding the role played by both the users' expertise and
the difficulty of the problem in choosing one of the two strategies. Results
show that user expertise and task difficulty interact in influencing this
choice.
   A second aspect explored in the paper concerns the context in which the
end-users rely on explanations to understand the solving process. Explanations
are in fact expected to play an important role when artificial systems are used
for cooperative and interactive problem solving. Results support the hypothesis
that explanation services are more often called into play in case of problem
solving failures.

A questionnaire was given to the visitors to explore their opinions of the

found that the visitors' opinions varied according to age; younger visitors did
not necessarily like the robots more than elderly visitors; positive evaluation
of the robots did not necessarily conflict with negative evaluations such as
anxiety; there was no gender difference; and there was almost no correlation
between opinions and the length of time spent near the robots.

%X To work productively in an interactive workspace, users need effective
interfaces for seamlessly sharing, annotating, and juxtaposing digital
information across heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we present an
interface toolset for constructing and using iconic interfaces for interactive
workspaces. Using an iconic representation of the physical workspace, users can
quickly and easily relocate applications and redirect input across devices. The
toolset provides a graphical tool for rapidly constructing iconic
representations for various workspaces, supports an existing interactive
workspace infrastructure, and is engineered to be portable to others. A
usability evaluation showed that the interaction design of the interfaces
created with our toolset is effective for redirection and relocation tasks. Our
results provide the first empirical baseline for comparing alternative
interfaces for interactive workspaces. The use of our toolset facilitates more
productive use of interactive workspaces for both individual and group work and
is available for download today.

%X There are as many arguments against as supporting the accommodation of
culture into user interface design. One argument suggests that it is necessary
to match the subjective cultural profile of the interface to the cultural
profile of the users in order to enhance usability and performance. In
contrast, we argue that the interface design characteristics required to design
interfaces to accommodate one side of four of the five cultural dimensions
proposed by Hofstede will result in an increase in usability for all users,
irrespective of the users' cultural profile. Secondary data analysis of a prior
experiment somewhat supported our argument, but we conclude that further
research into the effects of Hofstede's cultural dimensions is required before
our hypotheses can be accepted.

%X User-centered product concept design aims at creating concepts of new

present-day information to come up with concepts concerning future products.
This paper takes as its task to investigate and explore what underlies this use
of future-oriented information and what challenges it poses at the creative
stages of a design process. The proposed solution is based on an analytic
division of available information into (1) trends such as company strategies,
trends in the society and working life that denote changing conditions, and (2)
stable context features that describe issues that are unlikely to change in the
timeframe concerned. A small case study is presented that exemplifies how this
analytic distinction can be put into use. More broadly, the paper encourages
designers to think reflectively about the nature of information on which design
decisions are based.

formatting in newspapers and magazines, research on the issue is not
consistent. Early work using printed media favored narrow formatting, while
more recent work using computer monitors has favored wider formatting. In this
paper, we approach this issue by using eye tracking analysis of users reading
material on instructional web pages. In our experimental system, subjects read
the material using an instrumented browser that records all HTML content and
browser actions, and their eye gaze is recorded using a nonobtrusive, "remote"
eye tracker. Comparing the wide and narrow formatting conditions, our analysis
shows that for narrow formatting, subjects (a) read slightly faster, (b) have
fewer regressions, (c) retain more information in a post-test of the material,
but (d) tend to abandon the ends of longer paragraphs.

reported here examines how quickly users adapt to an unfamiliar design layout
and, in particular, how quickly they adjust their expectations of where to look
for a given target link during repeated exposures to a new layout. Eye
movement-based metrics such as time to target fixation, location of first
fixation and scan path (sequence of fixations) were applied to capture users'
eye movements. These metrics were then applied to analyse the effects of
repeated exposures and of design layouts of websites. More exposures led to
decreased time to target fixation, indicating that user-adaptation occurred.
The visual characteristics of the target link also influenced visual search
behaviour. Qualitative complementary data such as the users' frequency and
purpose of internet usage, users' expectations about the target link added
value to the eye-movement data.

%X A video database can contain a large number of videos ranging from several
minutes to several hours in length. Typically, it is not sufficient to search
just for relevant videos, because the task still remains to find the relevant
clip, typically less than one minute of length, within the video. This makes it
impor tant to direct the users attention to the most promising material and to
indicate what material they already investigated. Based on this premise, we
created a video search system with a powerful and flexible user interface that
incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects. The
system employes an automatic story segmentation, combines text and visual
search, and displays search results in ranked sets of story keyframe collages.
By adapting the keyframe collages based on query relevance and indicating which
portions of the video have already been explored, we enable users to quickly
find relevant sec tions. We tested our system as part of the NIST TRECVID
interactive search evaluation, and found that our user interface enabled users
to find more relevant results within the allotted time than other systems
employing more sophisticated analysis techniques but less helpful user
interfaces.

which separates presentation from content and views interaction methods as

an interactive tool that combines spatial and temporal components of video,
creating a unified mechanism for analyzing video data; it can be used for

%X Several hierarchical clustering techniques have been proposed to visualize
large graphs, but fewer solutions suggest a focus based approach. We propose a
multilevel clustering technique that produces in linear time a contextual
clustered view depending on a user-focus. We get a tree of clusters where each
cluster -- called meta-silhouette -- is itself hierarchically clustered into an
inclusion tree of silhouettes. Resulting Multilevel Silhouette Tree (MuSi-Tree)
has a specific structure called multilevel compound tree. This work builds upon
previous work on a compound tree structure called MO-Tree. The work presented
in this paper is a major improvement over previous work by (1) defining
multilevel compound tree as a more generic structure, (2) proposing original
space-filling visualization techniques to display it, (3) defining relevant
interaction model based on both focus changes and graph filtering techniques
and (4) reporting from case studies in various fields: co-citation graphs,
related-document graphs and social graphs.

paper, we identify sources of missing data and describe three levels of impact
missing data can have on the visualization: perceivable, invisible or
propagating. We then report on a user study with 30 participants that compared
three design variants. A between-subject graph interpretation study provides
strong evidence for the need of indicating the presence of missing information,
and some direction for addressing the problem.

%X This paper presents the current status of VU-Flow (Visualization of Users'
Flow), a software tool that is able to automatically record usage data in
Virtual Environments and provide a set of 2D and 3D visualizations that make it
easy for an evaluator to visually detect peculiar users' behaviors and
navigability problems. The paper focuses on novel functionalities we recently
added to the tool. More specifically, the new version of VU-Flow includes: (i)
the possibility of visualizing predominant flow directions for multiple users
or multiple visiting sessions, (ii) a visualization aimed at highlighting
traffic congestion problems in multi-user VEs, (iii) the possibility of
visualizing a replay of users' visits together with audio and video recordings
of actual users (e.g. gathered during lab experiments), and (iv) the ability to
derive, for each user, a list of quantitative data characterizing her behavior
in the VE.

%X Advances in GPS and wireless networking technologies have enabled a new
class of location-aware applications, including location tracking [10,2],
location-enhanced messaging [3,9], location-based gaming(www.botfighters.com),
and navigation aids for the visually impaired [12]. However, these applications
typically represent places quite simply, as a geographical point or a point
plus radius. We conducted an experiment that showed that this simple
representation is not expressive enough to represent the full range of people's
everyday places. We also present a set of more complicated physical shapes that
our subjects found sufficient to cover their places. These results identify
representational requirements for location-aware systems, have implications for
systems that aim to acquire place representations, suggest enhanced
applications, and open up interesting avenues for future research.

%X People have difficulties interacting with external representations designed
to guide navigating physical environments. We derive theory to inform design by
probing users' experience and use of their "internal" representations in a
temporally evolving wayfinding activity in situ. Interactions with
environmental landmarks are explored by analyzing spatial concepts in SMSs used
by a group collaborating to wayfind to an unfamiliar rendezvous. Results show
differences between landmarks provoking actions and contributing to abstract
concepts; and, effects of direct or induced perspective in situ. Design
recommendations account for orientation dependence and use of ambiguity in
user-world-representation mappings. These include tactics to enable users' to
induce perspectives appropriately: with accuracy for recognising landmarks
along routes and agility to situate landmark use in naturally evolving
wayfinding goals.

%X Ubiquitous and ambient computing -- computationally enhanced built
environments and portable products that aim to make computing available
anytime-anywhere -- has somewhat paradoxically put place at the heart of
Interaction Design. In this paper, foundations are laid for a dialogical
approach to place as an expression of the experienced relationship between
people and space. Building on McCarthy and Wright's dialogical
conceptualisation of technology as experience, place is described in terms of
the plurality of histories, interactions and meanings that characterise
people's different engagements with particular spaces. Implications of a
dialogical approach to place are considered with respect to the further
development within Interaction Design of concepts such as context, engagement,
and interactivity.

%X As systems grow larger in size and complexity, it becomes increasingly
difficult for administrators to maintain some shared sense of awareness of
what's going on in the system. We implemented a large public display with
appropriately designed visualizations that allow for rapid assessment and
peripheral awareness of system health. By placing the visualizations on a large
display in a shared, commonly used team location, system administrators can
monitor behavior as they walk past. Such a display helps administrators
identify emerging problems early on and be a focal point for discussions of the
system. It allows them not only to share information with colleagues on an
"as-noticed" basis, but also highlights interconnected problems that would not
be otherwise evident. We found that this approach significantly reduces the
workload of individual system administrators, changing the nature of their work
by radically simplifying a complex task through social sharing of peripherally
noticed state.

experiences, the new visualization is a valuable tool when the temporal order
of visiting Areas of Interest (AOI) is the main focus in the analysis, the AOIs
have a natural linear order, there are many AOIs to produce interesting
patterns, and the AOIs fill most of the coordinate space being studied.

%X Previous research has identified information search and re-access strategies
used by experienced web users, but not the popularity of these strategies. To
fill this gap, we collected data from 236 experienced web users via a
questionnaire. A cluster analysis of the data revealed three distinct user
groups, each having different search and re-access strategies. The group of
"professional searchers" was the only one to use Boolean operators in searching
and most of the advanced strategies for information re-access. In contrast, the
strategies of the other two groups were much simpler. These results show that
the previous findings on advanced search and re-access strategies may describe
the strategies of information professionals, but not those of other web users,
regardless of their extensive experience.

%X Current systems for synchronous, text-based communication offer more varied
interactions than e-mail, but cannot easily convey non-verbal or emotional
information in an unobtrusive and intuitive manner. In this report we introduce
ChatAmp, a new chat system which incorporates music as a central part of social
interaction. Music is used in order to create an unobtrusive ambient soundscape
that gives information about conversational activity and emotion using changes
to instrument behavior. This soundscape acts as a peripheral channel to let a
multitasking user monitor the conversation while focused else-where without
being interrupted by jarring alert sounds. By combining this with
non-sequential visualization which groups all of a user's activity in his area
of the screen, ChatAmp provides "at-a-glance" information through both auditory
and visual channels. Informal user tests support the effectiveness of
integrating music and conversation in achieving the goals above and suggest
directions for further research.

were the user to stop scrolling and choose select. When scrolling through a

under it. An experiment is reported which varies this stationary focus position
in a five item display. It was either: the last item in window (end stop
scheme), the next to last (view forward one item) or the centre (view forward
two items). The centre position allowed significantly faster scrolling than the
other two positions.

while there is no such variation with individual users. The traditional
configuration is not well-suited for collaborative tasks, and even after
augmenting it to a shared monitor with multiple-mice it is still significantly

times on a calendar, which dynamically adjusts to provide instant feedback and
suggests optimal meeting times for all participants. Our prototype is geared
toward college students and the scheduling is done through a democratic and
open negotiation process where everyone's preference is heard. Students who
evaluated the prototype thought that the scheduling process was more efficient
than the widely-used e-mail scheduling among college students, which is largely

%X A key challenge in supporting face-to-face collaborative work is edocument
micro-mobility: supporting movement of digital content amongst shared display
surfaces and personal devices at arbitrary levels of document granularity.
Micro-mobility is a dexterity that physical paper artifacts afford - the
ability to be handled with any position and placement, to be dismantled, cut
and torn apart, marked up, reassembled and sorted. To support micromobility for
electronic content and group work, we propose DocuBits and Containers. DocuBits
offer the metaphor of a paper-cutter and a scanner for electronic documents. A
portion of screen 'bits' from any application or any parts of visible display
can be cut, grabbed, sent and launched onto a different display surface or
device with minimal interaction - merely three mouse/stylus click-select. Once
arrived on the target display surface, DocuBits can be arbitrarily positioned,
re-oriented, marked up, and pulled into other documents, or again sent to other
display surfaces. A Container is a composite draft of DocuBits and other
documents, usually composed as the outcome of a collaborative meeting.

%X In this paper we propose the concepts of virtual reflections, lights and
shadows to enhance immersion in mixed reality (MR) environments, which focus on
merging the real and the virtual world seamlessly. To improve immersion, we
augment the virtual objects with real world information regarding the virtual
reality (VR) system environment, e.g., CAVE, workbench etc. Real-world objects
such as input devices or light sources as well as the position and posture of
the user are used to simulate global illumination phenomena, e.g., users can
see their own reflections and shadows on virtual objects. Besides the concepts
and the implementation of this approach, we describe the system setup and an
example application for this kind of advanced MR system environment.

%X A computer-adaptive test (CAT) is a software application that makes use of
Item Response Theory (IRT) to create a test that is tailored to individual
learners. The CAT prototype introduced here comprised a graphical user
interface, a question database and an adaptive algorithm based on the
Three-Parameter Logistic Model from IRT. A sample of 113 Computer Science
undergraduate students participated in a session of assessment within the
Human-Computer Interaction subject domain using our CAT prototype. At the end
of the assessment session, participants were asked to rate the level of
difficulty of the overall test from 1 (very easy) to 5 (very difficult). The
perceived level of difficulty of the test and the CAT scores obtained by this
group of learners were subjected to a Spearman's rank order correlation.
Findings from this statistical analysis suggest that the CAT prototype was
effective in tailoring the assessment to each individual learner's proficiency
level.

However the use of dynamic HTML documents severely limits the amount of user
interface (UI) validation that can be done. In order to generalize the abstract
UI platform and strengthen the UI validation process, we developed a novel
platform to support both UI adaptation and dynamic UI construction. It provides
a generic architecture for runtime adaptive UI development based on various XML
technologies. As well as making use of different built-in modules, one can
extend the platform by adding new functionalities into it. The ease of use of
the platform is illustrated using a case study of an on-line accommodation

%X Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) is a methodology for analysing complex
socio-technical systems. It aims to structure system information in a manner
that is meaningful for human control and interaction. The Abstraction
Decomposition Space (ADS) in an important tool used during the first phase of
CWA to describe the work domain. In this paper we create an ADS for a
Semiconductor Fabrication Plant. This is a High Volume Manufacturing
environment and its complexity necessitates a number of adjustments to the
original ADS technique. The physical decomposition of the system is
de-emphasised and a number of alternative decomposition hierarchies are used
instead. The analysis aims to produce artifacts that aid in the design of
decision support systems. These artifacts not only help to assess the
information needs of workers, but also structure the work domain in a manner
that will inform display design.

touching the broadcasted augmented virtual objects in the captured real scene,
problems of force trembling and discontinuity occur due to static registration
errors and slow marker pose update rate, respectively. In order to solve these
problems, threshold and interpolation methods are proposed respectively. The
resultant haptic interaction provides smoother continuous tremble-free force

various entertainment events such as DJ events. Some performers use computers
to generate visuals, but using a keyboard or a mouse to control the visuals in

laser pointers that enables performers to interact with the screen directly.
The system can also detect shapes of the laser trails that enables the
performer to move the laser pointers quickly. Most of existing systems employ
color and pattern matching techniques that are not suitable for visual

%X We used eye-tracking to study 28 users when they evaluated result lists
produced by web search engines. Based on their different evaluation styles, the
users were divided into economic and exhaustive evaluators. Economic evaluators
made their decision about the next action (e.g., query re-formulation,
following a link) faster and based on less information than exhaustive
evaluators. The economic evaluation style was especially beneficial when most
of the results in the result page were relevant. In these tasks, the task times
were significantly shorter for economic than for exhaustive evaluators. The
results suggested that economic evaluators were more experienced with computers
than exhaustive evaluators. Thus, the result evaluation style seems to evolve
towards a more economic style as the users gain more experience.

%X We present a novel camera-based adaptable user interface system that uses
hotspot components for 2D gesture-based interaction. A camera points to the
desktop and the image captured by the camera appears on the user's screen. A
hotspot area is activated when a user's hand passes through the rectangle that
defines it. For example, a right_left hotspot activates when the user moves his
hand from right to left, entering and exiting the rectangle. Our system is
highly flexible because it allows the user to customize the interface as
follows: (1) hotspot areas can be created anywhere within the camera-captured
image; (2) new commands can be assigned to particular hotspots or composite
hotspot sequences (e.g., right_left for previous webpage; up+right+down for
webpage reload); (3) a physical workspace on the desktop can be defined by
pointing the camera to any location; (4) different hotspot layouts for
different applications can be created and saved. The system works with an
inexpensive webcam in real time and uses machine learning to automatically
detect skin areas for robust gesture recognition.

%X Abbrevicons are a technique for encoding audio information efficiently while
still providing the user with useful and appropriate feedback. Ideally,
abbrevicons are targeted towards audio interfaces that are infrequently used
and where the user doesn't have the opportunity to develop a strong model of
the system or make sense of rich encoding schemes. Abbrevicons allow us to
present natural language feedback that is identifiable and comprehensible,
while taking significantly less time than traditional verbal feedback.
Abbrevicons can decrease the speed of short descriptive feedback by up to 200%
while still ensuring user comprehension. These techniques seek to provide
richer user feedback in audio interfaces while still keeping in mind the need
for efficient user interactions.

subtly to affect the way that individuals perceive icons. Icon users
unconsciously use the cues available to them: the extent to which these cues
are utilised depends on the language background of the user. In order to

function label characteristics, but also about how they merge with icon and
user characteristics to affect usability.

%X This paper reports on an investigation that found that conventional
techniques for including users in technology design are likely to fail if the
user has autism. The heterogeneity of autistic symptomatology across cognitive,
social, behavioural and communication domains suggests a 'single user'
environment, while rendering typical design interaction techniques meaningless,
making the need for assistive technologies great, and the risk of abandonment
high. This complex problem of urgency and constraint was addressed through a
Delphi study with a panel of psychologists critiquing design activities for
people with autism. The major finding is that while each of the activities may
work if modified, all require that the designer is well acquainted with autism
in general and has a close working relationship based on trust with the
individual user. If these requirements are met, there is no reason that the
abandonment rate cannot be reduced.

who present dynamic needs that evolve with age. This study explores pupillary
response behavior (PRB) during computer interaction to identify underlying
differences between older adults of varying ocular profiles. PRB was measured
from two groups of individuals diagnosed with Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD) and a visually healthy control group. Unconventional analytical
techniques -- wavelet-based multifractal analyses -- were used to identify PRB
anomalies resulting from the effects of aging and/or ocular pathology. A
distribution of regularity indices was extracted from the data signals to
reveal signatures of PRB change patterns. One characteristic of the
multifractal spectrum, Left Slope (LS), fully distinguished the user groups,
revealing trends of increasing PRB irregularity with increasing levels of
ocular dysfunction.

%X We introduce the concept of identity-differentiating widgets (iDwidgets),
widgets parameterized by the identity of their user. Although multi-user
applications have become more common, most support only traditional
"single-user" widgets. By adding user-identity information we allow
interactions with today's widgets to be dynamically customized on a per-user
basis in a group usage setting. The concept has inspired the design of new
widgets as well. In this paper we describe example iDwidgets and define a
conceptual framework based on what is being customized in the widget. iDwidgets
can support novel interaction techniques in collaborative settings.

%X In this study of various evaluation-instruments, subjects fulfilled sev-eral
tasks on two different operating systems and answered several question-naires,
among them AttrakDiffTMand ISONORM 9241/10, and objective meas-ures were taken.
A correlation between the "hedonic quality - identity"-scale of the AttrakDiff
and the ISONORM 9241/10 was found. As the ISONORM 9241/10 measures usability as
described in ISO 9241-10 and not hedonic quali-ty, the hedonic quality seems to
have an influence on the tester ratings of usability. This is supported by the
finding, that the hedonic quality does not correlate with the objective
measures and therefore does not have any effective influence on the efficiency
component of usability.

%X This article describes a new initiative MAUSE of which the ultimate goal is
to bring more science to bear on usability evaluation methods. This overarching
goal will be realized through scientific activities of four Working Groups
(WGs) with each of them having specific objectives, rationales, tasks and
expected outcomes. Outlook for MAUSE's development is described.

%X The digital inclusion promotes the reduction of social inequalities. Based
on this principle, the Brazilian Government has been setting up an increasing
number of Web access locations to render virtual support to its citizens.
However, there are no guidelines for the construction and assessment of these
electronic Government (e-Gov) sites. In this article we measure the web site
quality in the e-Gov domain with the following proprieties: usability,
accessibility, interoperability, security, privacy, information reliability,
and service agility. We implemented our method, by using a checklist tool, in
the evaluation of 127 Brazilian government sites (federal, state and
municipal). Our method proved itself efficient in the diagnosis and
identification of specific problems in the e-Gov site domain.

%X Interaction design patterns have yet to prove themselves in interaction
design in the way that design guidelines have. This paper describes an
empirical study comparing the use of patterns and guidelines. The study
involved a heuristic evaluation of a web site, the redesign of the web site,
and the design of a new web site. Preliminary results suggesting that
developers find patterns useful in the interaction design process are
presented. Further analysis using heuristics to compare the quality of the
designs produced using patterns and guidelines will provide an objective
assessment of the usefulness of patterns.

%X This paper reports the first of several tests of new auditory alarms
originally proposed by Block et al. [1] and formalized in IEC 60601-1-8 for use
in medical electrical equipment. We test whether participants who are supplied
with the IEC-recommended mnemonics while learning label-alarm associations can
more accurately identify the alarms after short periods of learning. Results
for 18 participants strongly indicate that there is a mutual confusability
between certain alarm pairs in both learning conditions, but that mnemonics may
strengthen rather than diminish certain key confusions.

%X Despite its rising success, interactive TV (iTV) has found very little
attention in the field of HCI. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to
investigate the usability of iTV services. It presents the results of a
usability test and discusses the implications for further developments. The
results show, that prior knowledge of Internet and mobile phones supports the
usability of iTV services regarding navigation and text input, while the lack
of it leads to great difficulties. Difficult tasks, such as writing a text
message, had a success rate of only 20%, while guided tours proofed to be more
usable with a success rate of 70%.
