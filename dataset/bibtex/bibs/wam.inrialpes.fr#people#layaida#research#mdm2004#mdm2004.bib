   ABSTRACT = {This paper discusses the problem of content adaptation for
    mobile devices. The adaptation considers the context of the client and also
    the environment where the client request is received. A device independent
    model is defined and used in order to achieve automatic adaptation of the
    content based on its semantic and the capabilities of the target device.
    Our system includes a context description model and a client repository
    and offers device contexts management and querying functions. The
    proposed system uses the XQuery language to query the profiles and
    delivers the results in the form of SOAP services.}
