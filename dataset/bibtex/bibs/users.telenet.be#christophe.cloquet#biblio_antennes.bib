  abstract = {We have received a Phase 1 SBIR
	 contract from the U.S. Navy to develop a plasma stealth antenna. The
	 concept is to use plasma discharge tubes as antenna elements. When the
	 tubes are energized, they become conductors and can transmit and
	 receive radio signals. When they are de-energized, they revert to
	 nonconducting elements (in present tests, glass tubes), and do not reflect
	 probing radio signals. The reflection problem is most acute for probing
	 signals near the resonant frequency of the antenna, which produces
	 a large reflection cross section. A second feature of the plasma
	 antenna, is that it can be reconfigured during operation, by selectively
	 energizing only some of the elements. It can therefore be `steered'
	 electronically. This cannot be done with metal conductor antennas. A third
	 feature of the plasma antenna, is that it can be turned off rapidly,
	 reducing ringing on pulse transmission. Preliminary tests before
	 receiving the SBIR successfully demonstrated both the operation of the
	 antenna in transmission and reception, and the stealth features on a
	 Navy test range in San Diego. The tubes used in that demonstration
	 were modified neon sign discharge tubes filled with helium, neon,
	 argon, and a neon-argon mixture. More detailed experiments are under
	 way to explore such topics as optimizing the system with respect to
	 antenna-feeder coupling, radiation-pattern peaking, and signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {The plasma antenna is modeled as
	 a center fed dipole. The net radiated power of the plasma dipole
	 antenna is derived. The surrounding plasma blanket has a variable and
	 controlled density. In the regions of the plasma blanket with the
	 plasma extinguished or with the plasma frequency much less than the
	 antenna frequency, the region becomes transparent to electromagnetic
	 waves from the antenna. In regions where the plasma frequency is much
	 higher than the antenna frequency the plasma behaves like a good
	 reflector and can block radiation. Thus we can create windows or
	 aperture and shape a reconfigurable antenna radiation field. By having
	 the entire plasma blanket have a much greater plasma frequency than
	 the antenna frequency, we can store electromagnetic energy. When we
	 open one or more plasma apertures or windows, we can release the
	 electromagnetic energy as a pulse in reconfigurable radiation patterns.
	 As our first iteration to this calculation, we will assume that an
	 open plasma window surrounded by plasma in the metallic mode is an
	 aperture antenna surrounded by a conductor. In this case we can use
	 equivalence theorems to reduce the problem to equivalent magnetic
	 currents which is essentially the negative of twice the vector cross
	 product of the unit vector normal to the window and the electric
	 field in the plane of the aperture. We will also assume that for a
	 window depth into the plasma blanket at distance much less than a
	 wavelength, the field is constant across the face of the window.
	 In actuality the tangential component of the field at the aperture
	 is the dot product of the unit vector in the z direction and the
	 angular component of the electric field, we will assume that for small
	 windows, the tangential component of the electric field is constant. The
	 second iteration of calculations will take the variation of the field
	 across the aperture into account. We present experimental evidence
	 that plasma apertures or windows suppress the back and side lobes.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental results
	 [1] have demonstrated that plasma can achieve comparable electrical
	 performance to metal in conventional antenna applications. In these
	 experiments plasma was formed and contained in an evacuated cylindrical
	 tube filled with 10 mTorr - 2 Torr of noble gas mixtures such as a
	 fluorescent lighting tube. Adequate efficiencies (up to 50) for most
	 applications, predictable radiation patterns and low base-band noise for HF
	 and VHF communications have been demonstrated. Such antennas may
	 therefore offer a viable alternative to metal in existing applications
	 when overall technical requirements are considered. The electrical
	 properties of plasma can be varied in both space and time. Thus plasma
	 antennas can be rapidly reconfigured for directionality and frequency
	 agility or turned off to eliminate current ringing. When the plasma
	 is extinguished it no longer scatters radiation. As a result, it
	 has a significantly reduced radar cross-section. Unlike metals, the
	 plasma electrical properties are dependent on frequency. Below the
	 plasma frequency, the plasma behaves like a metal. Above the plasma
	 frequency, the plasma behaves like a dielectric. A plasma antenna can
	 therefore be employed for communications at HF while having a reduced
	 cross-section to microwave radar. Extinguishing the antenna eliminates mutual
	 interference with neighbouring antennas suggesting applications in antenna
	 arrays and antenna farms. The RF Hub of the Australian Defence Science
	 and Technology Organisation and The Plasma Research Laboratory of
	 the Australian National University have been collaborating on the
	 development of plasma antenna technology. The goals of the program
	 have been to investigate the efficacy of plasma antennas, establish
	 their potential to replace metal antennas in some circumstances, and
	 investigate the possibility of creating novel antenna structures that
	 overcome some of the limitations of current antenna technologies.
	 In this paper we describe the progress of this work. We review the
	 electromagnetic properties of plasma that are relevant for antenna
	 applications and we review our main experimental results. A theory of
	 cylindrical plasma antenna elements has been developed [2] and it will be
	 compared with experiment. The performance of plasma antennas in certain
	 telecommunications and radar applications will also be presented.},

	 reflector for radar electronic beam steering using helium in the 0.2-0.5
	 Torr pressure range. Compared to former experiments, the use of this
	 light gas reduces significantly spurious sputtering effect on the
	 cathode materials. In a previous paper, a semi-quantitative physical
	 model was developed to calculate the time evolution of the sheet
	 reflectivity from the experimental current Id(t) measured across the
	 discharge. A self-consistent, numerical, stationary model is now
	 developed to describe the main physical mechanisms that govern the
	 hollow-cathode source. The model describes the coupling between the
	 high-voltage collisional sheath and the magnetized plasma through the hollow
	 cathode. The cold electron creation rate includes the efficiency of
	 ionization from the fast secondary electrons emitted from the surface
	 of the cathode, lowered by the three-body recombination process in
	 volume and by the ejection of a part of these fast electrons out
	 of the cathode plasma. As the recombination rate scales as Te-9/2,
	 the energy balance of the electrons must be solved precisely, so
	 that the collisional-radiative exchanges in Helium are included in
	 the model. The results are then compared to the experimental V-I
	 characteristics for different pressures of the neutral gas; there is good
	 agreement between the theoretical plasma model and the experiment.},

	 microwave pulse simply passes through the plasma antenna without

  abstract = {The electromagnetic fields
	 and plasma parameters have been studied in an azimuthally symmetric
	 surface wave-excited plasma (SWP) source, by using a two-dimensional
	 numerical analysis based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
	 approximation to Maxwell's equations self-consistently coupled with a fluid
	 model for plasma evolution. The FDTD/fluid hybrid simulation was
	 performed for different gas pressures in Ar and different microwave
	 powers at 2.45 GHz, showing that the surface waves (SWs) occur along
	 the plasma-dielectric interfaces to sustain overdense plasmas. The
	 numerical results indicated that the electromagnetic SWs consist of two
	 different waves, Wave-1 and Wave-2, having relatively shorter and
	 longer wavelengths. The Wave-1 was seen to fade away with increasing
	 pressure and increasing power, while the Wave-2 remained relatively
	 unchanged over the range of pressure and power investigated. The
	 numerical results revealed that the Wave-1 propagates as backward
	 SWs whose phase velocity and group velocity point in the opposite
	 directions. In contrast, the Wave-2 appeared to form standing waves, being
	 ascribed to a superposition of forward SWs whose phase and group
	 velocities point in the same direction. The fadeaway of the Wave-1 or
	 backward SWs at increased pressures and increased powers was seen with
	 the damping rate increasing in the axial direction, being related
	 to the increased plasma electron densities. A comparison with the
	 conventional FDTD simulation indicated that such fine structure of the
	 electromagnetic fields of SWs is not observed in the FDTD simulation with
	 spatially uniform and time-independent plasma distributions; thus,
	 the FDTD/fluid hybrid model should be employed in simulating the
	 electromagnetic fields and plasma parameters in SWPs with high accuracy.},

	 appreciable deterioration in the noise characteristics of the radiation. An
	 analysis is made of methods of decreasing the output radiation noise of
