% This bibliography contains a lot of papers!  Please feel free to
% add more and then commit your changes.
%
% There are a few rules about adding new citations:
% * All citations should include first names and page numbers.
% * The key for a citation should be of the form:
%   lastname:confxx
%   where "lastname" is the last name of the first author,
%   "conf" is the abbreviation of the conference or journal in which
%   the paper appeared, and "xx" is the two-digit year of publication.s key would not be unique, add a letter to the end of the
%   key to make it unique.  For example, you might have:
%   long:ipccc01
%   long:ipccc01a
%   if there were two papers with "Long" as the first author in IPCCC 2001.
% * Use strings corresponding to conference names.  The string should be
%   of the form confxx, where "conf" is the standard conference abbreviation
%   and xx is the year.  DO NOT USE sequence numbers here (ie, don't use
%   osdi4 for the OSDI that occurred in 2000---we never remember which
%   OSDI is which, but we typically know the year).  For each string you
%   use, create an entry in the top of the bibliography for the string.
%   This entry can include year-specific info (such as "10th Annual
%   Conference on Foo").  You need only create a string if you expect
%   more than one or two papers from the conference.
% * Please keep the bibliography alphabetized by key.  There is a script
%   (alphabetize.pl) in this directory that will do this.  Just run it as:
%   alphabetize.pl < orig.bib > sorted.bib
%   MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLLOWING LINE PRECEDES THE FIRST BIBLIOGRAPHY ENTRY!

  I/O calls, large file sizes, and more encouragement for extents to be
  allocated. The hardware is particularly suited to RAID~3 with a 16 byte
  striping unit, although in theory the software could do anything it wants.
  Geared to data-parallel model. Proc nodes (PNs) contact the timesharing
  daemon (TD) on the control processor (CP), who gets block lists from the file
  system, which runs on one of the CPs. The TD then arranges with the disk
  storage nodes (DSNs) to do the transfer directly with the PNs. Each DSN has
  8~MB of buffer space, 8 disk drives, 4 SCSI busses, and a SPARC as
  controller. Partition managers mount non-local sfs via NFS. Performance
  results good. Up to 185~MB/s on 118 (2~MB/s) disks.}
