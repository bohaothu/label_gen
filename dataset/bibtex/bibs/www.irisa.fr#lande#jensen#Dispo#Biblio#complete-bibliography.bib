   ABSTRACT     = {Given the high proportion of HTTP traffic in the 
      Internet, Web caches are crucial to reduce user access time, network 
      latency, and bandwidth consumption. Prefetching in a Web cache can 
      further enhance these benefits. Nevertheless, to achieve the best 
      performance, the prefetching policy must match user and Web server 
      characteristics. This implies that new prefetching policies must be 
      loaded dynamically as needs change. Most Web caches are large C 
      programs, and thus adding a single prefetching policy to an existing 
      Web cache is a daunting task. Providing multiple policies is even 
      more complex. The essential problem is that prefetching concerns 
      crosscut the cache structure. Aspect-oriented programming is a 
      natural technique to address this issue. Nevertheless, existing 
      approaches do not provide dynamic weaving of aspects targeted toward 
      C applications. In this paper, we present $\mu$Dyner, which addresses 
      these needs. $\mu$Dyner also provides lower overhead for aspect 
      invocation than other dynamic approaches, thus meeting the 
      performance needs of Web caches.}

   ABSTRACT     = {In this paper, we consider a direct, source-to-source, 
      specialization of Java programs. In this setting, specialization does 
      not boil down to partially evaluating functions (here called methods) 
      any longer. Indeed, specialized methods have also to be encapsulated 
      into residual classes. We show that inheritance offers new 
      specialization opportunities but that these opportunities are not so 
      easy to benefit from because of some deep incompatibilities between 
      specialization as partial evaluation and specialization as 
      inheritance in standard object-oriented languages.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) promises separation of 
      concerns at the implementation level. However, aspects are not always 
      orthogonal and aspect interaction is an important problem. Currently 
      there is almost no support for the detection and resolution of such 
      interactions. The programmer is responsible for identifying 
      interactions between conflicting aspects and implementing conflict 
      resolution code. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem 
      based on a generic framework for AOP. The contributions are 
      threefold: we present a formal and expressive crosscut language, two 
      static conflict analyses and some linguistic support for conflict 
      resolution.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Crosscutting, i.e. relating different program points is 
      one of the key notions of Aspect-Oriented Programming. In this 
      report, we consider a general and operational model for crosscutting 
      based on execution monitors. A domain-specific language for the 
      definition of crosscuts constitutes the core of the report. The 
      semantics of this language is formally defined by means of parser 
      operators matching event patterns in execution traces. We define an 
      operational semantics of the matching process by means of rules 
      relating the operators. The use of the language is exemplified by 
      several sophisticated crosscut definitions. We sketch a prototype 
      implementation in Java default which has been systematically derived 
      from the language definition.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Component-based programming promises to facilitate the 
      construction of large-scale applications, which is supported by the 
      important concept of interfaces. In most current component models, 
      interfaces essentially declare types and sets of services that a 
      component implements. They are not expressive enough to formulate 
      many properties important for component collaboration. In this paper 
      we consider an important class of such properties, sequencing 
      constraints, which components must obey when calling one another 
      services. We consider the integration into interfaces of sequencing 
      properties by means of protocols formalized in terms of finite-state 
      machines. The paper presents three contributions. First, a set of 
      protocol composition operators and a discussion of correctness 
      properties of such operators useful for component assembly. Second, 
      we provide a first step toward the integration of additional state 
      information into protocols. Finally, we show how JavaBeans can 
      benefit from the techniques we present. }
