    % 
    % Hi Hugh,
    % 
    % Thanks for including me, but I don't think the current citation is
    % appropriate: for sure there are other people who contributed at least
    % as much as me (Calogero Zarba, who wrote the expression package, is
    % one example). In any case, the bulk of the work was done by Michael,
    % everyone else did peanuts. So IMO you either cite Michael only, or you
    % cite everyone involved (Calogero, Henny, ...?) I don't really care
    % since I did so little, so don't worry about my feelings :-)
    % 
    % Another point is that, no matter how uninvolved they've been in trying
    % to give you access to Deduct's code, I believe that Stanford and Zohar
    % are still the legal owners of the code, and Zohar should at least be
    % asked for his opinion.
    % 
    % I'm glad that you're writing your own software from scratch. I
    % strongly believe that restarting from scratch once in a while is the
    % best way to go.
    % 
    % Regards,
    %
