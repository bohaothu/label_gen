  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper discusses the design and performance of a
                  proxy-cache designed to make Internet information
                  systems scale better. A hierarchical arrangement of
                  caches mirroring the topology of a wide-area
                  internetwork can help distribute load away from
                  server hot spots raised by globally popular
                  information objects, reduce access latency, and
                  protect the network from erroneous clients. We
                  present performance figures indicating that the
                  cache significantly outperforms other popular
                  Internet cache implementations at highly concurrent
                  load and that indicate the effect of hierarchy on
                  cache access latency. We also summarize the results
                  of experiments comparing TTL-based consistency with
                  an approach that fans out invalidations through the
                  cache hierarchy. Finally, we present experiences
                  derived from fitting the cache into the increasingly
                  complex and operational world of Internet
                  information systems, including issues related to
                  security, transparency to cache-unaware clients, and
                  the role of file systems in support of ubiquitous
                  wide-area information systems.",
