  abstract = {{A}edes albopictus is a mosquito originating from {A}sia, which has extended its range worldwide the last decades. {I}t is a competent vector for several arboviruses. it was first described in {L}a {R}eunion (an island of the {S}outh {W}est part of the {I}ndian {O}cean) in 1913. {S}ince then, it has become the dominant {A}edes species and a serious threat to public health, especially during the two last arboviruses outbreaks of dengue (1977) and chikungunya (2005-2006). {D}espite its pest status, data on the biology of this vector are scarce, especially the population present in the {I}ndian {O}cean (10), which has never been studied in detail. {T}herefore, the immature development, survival, longevity, fecundity, and gonotrophic cycles of {A}e. albopictus were studied for an {F}-2 population of the {IO}. {T}hese biological parameters were studied in controlled conditions at eight constant temperatures (5, 10,15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees {C}). {T}he minimal threshold of immature stages development was found at 10.4 degrees {C} and its optimum at 29.7 degrees {C}. {T}he shortest periods for immature development were found at 30 degrees {C}, with in average of 8.8 d. {T}he optimum intrinsic rate of growth (r) was observed between 25 and 30 degrees {C}. {T}he gonotrophic cycles were also evaluated, and the shortest cycles were found at 30 degrees {C} (mean, 3.5 d). {T}hose results are according to the field repartition of this species in {L}a {R}eunion, allowing{A}e. albopictus survival at a large range of temperatures.},
