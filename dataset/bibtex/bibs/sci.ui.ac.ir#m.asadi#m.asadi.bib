abstract = "-Abstract: One of the most important types of system structures is the parallel structure. In the present article, we propose a definition for the mean residual life function of a parallel system and obtain some of its properties. The proposed definition measures the mean residual life function of a parallel system consisting of n identical and independent components under the condition that n - i, i = 0, 2,..., n - 1, components of the system are working and other components of the system have already failed. It is shown that, for the case where the components of the system have increasing hazard rate, the mean residual life function of the system is a nonincreasing function of time. Finally, we will obtain an upper bound for the proposed mean residual life function.

abstract = "-Abstract: In many reliability and survival analysis problems the current age of an item under study must be taken into account by information measures of the lifetime distribution. Kullback-Leibler information and Shannon entropy have been considered in this context, which led to information measures that depend on time, and thus are dynamic. This paper develops dynamic information divergence and entropy of order a. also known as Renyi information and entropy, which for alpha = 1 give the Kullback-Leibler information and Shannon entropy, respectively. We give characterizations of the proportional hazards model. the exponential distribution, and Generalized Pareto distributions in terms of dynamic R Renyi information and entropy. It is also shown that dynamic Renyi entropy uniquely determines distributions that have monotone densities. A result that relates dynamic Renyi entropy and hazard rate orderings is given. This result leads to a Maximum Dynamic Entropy of order alpha formulation and characterizations of some well-known lifetime models. A dynamic entropy hazard rate inequality is developed as an analog of the known entropy moment inequality. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MDDI model relative to a given distribution G is that which has least Kullback-Leibler information discrepancy relative to G, among all distributions satisfying some information constraints given in terms of residual moment inequalities, residual moment growth inequalities, or hazard rate growth inequalities. Our results lead to MDDI characterizations of many well-known lifetime models and to the development of some new models. Dynamic information constraints that characterize these models are tabulated. A result for characterizing distributions based on dynamic Renyi information divergence is also given.

It is assumed that at time t the system has failed. Under these conditions, we obtain the mean past. lifetime (MPL) of the components of the system. Some properties of MPL are studied. It is shown that the underlying distribution function F can be recovered from the proposed MPL. Also, a comparison between two parallel systems are made based on their MPLs in the case where the components of the system are ordered in terms of reversed hazard rate.

This family of distributions includes exponential distribution. Pareto distribution. and Power distribution. In the present article, we will obtain some characterizations results on GPD. We first propose a new definition for multiplicative lack of memory (MLM) property in terms of mean residual life function and show that, under some mild conditions. the distribution of a continuous non negative. random variable X satisfies in the proposed property if it is a member of GPD. Then, we give a characterization result on GPD based on proportionality of the hazard rate (HR) of a continuous random variable X and the HR of corresponding weighted distribution (for some weight function). We also prove a characterization result on GPD based on the minimum of a random sample.
