  title = {Holistic twig joins: optimal {XML} pattern matching},
  year = {2002},
  pages = {310-321},
  abstract = {XML employs a tree-structured data model, and, naturally, XML queries
	specify patterns of selection predicates on multiple elements related
	by a tree structure. Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern
	in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing.
	Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary
	structural (parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships,
	and twig matching is achieved by: (i) using structural join algorithms
	to match the binary relationships against the XML database, and (ii)
	stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach
	for matching twig patterns is that intermediate result sizes can
	get large, even when the input and output sizes are more manageable.In
	this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack,
	for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain
	of linked stacks to compactly represent partial results to root-to-leaf
	query paths, which are then composed to obtain matches for the twig
	pattern. When the twig pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships
	between elements, TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential
	algorithms that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of
	sizes of the input lists and the final result list, but independent
	of the sizes of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a
	modification of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig
	patterns in sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis
	with experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data,
	and query twig patterns.},

  year = {1987},
  pages = {112-119},
  abstract = {Recursive query evaluation is a capability of deductivele-augmented
	database systems that conventional database systems do not support
	well, if at all. Many recursive queries involve computation of the
	transitive closure of a relation. Previously rublished algorithms
	for transitive closure are iterative in nature, performing repeated
	joins, unions, and differences until convergence is obtained. In
	this paper, we present an adaption of Warren's algorithm for computing
	the transitive closure of a relation. Warren's algorithm was originally
	designed for a bit matrix representation of a binary relation; we
	have adapted it for use with a binary relation represented as a set
	of tuples, as in a relational database management system. This adapted
	algorithm computes the transitive closure in two passes over the
	relation. We analyze the performance of this algorithm, and compare
	it to the performance of two algorithms based on relational algebra:
	an iterative algorithm, and an inproved version of the iterative
	algorithm that eliminates unnedessary I/O at the expense of more
	computation. We evaluate the performatnce of the algorithms for different
	source relations sizes, available memory sizes, join selectivities,
	and maximum path length. Our results show that no algorithm has uniformly
	superior performance; the adaption of Warren's algorithm is superior
	when the source and result relations are not too much larger than
	main memory. We conclude that in future systems with large main memory,
	Warren's algorithm generally performs best, and thus should be implemented
	with the option of switching to an iterative algorithm when the source
	or result sizes are very large.},

  pages = {316-325},
  abstract = {Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an interesting
	problem with broad applications. Most of the previous studies focus
	on pruning unfruitful search subspaces effectively, but few of them
	address the mining on large, disk-based databases. As many graph
	databases in applications cannot be held into main memory, scalable
	mining of large, disk-based graph databases remains a challenging
	problem. In this paper, we develop an effective index structure,
	ADI (for <u>ad</u>jacency <u>i</u>ndex), to support mining various
	graph patterns over large databases that cannot be held into main
	memory. The index is simple and efficient to build. Moreover, the
	new index structure can be easily adopted in various existing graph
	pattern mining algorithms. As an example, we adapt the well-known
	gSpan algorithm by using the ADI structure. The experimental results
	show that the new index structure enables the scalable graph pattern
	mining over large databases. In one set of the experiments, the new
	disk-based method can mine graph databases with one million graphs,
	while the original gSpan algorithm can only handle databases of up
	to 300 thousand graphs. Moreover, our new method is faster than gSpan
	when both can run in main memory.},

	is an extension of this functionality for uniformly querying both

	of graphs. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient
	algorithm, called FSG, for finding all frequent subgraphs in large
	graph data sets. We experimentally evaluate the performance of FSG
	using a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our results show
	that despite the underlying complexity associated with frequent subgraph
	discovery, FSG is effective in finding all frequently occurring subgraphs
	in data sets containing more than 200,000 graph transactions and
	scales linearly with respect to the size of the data set.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural and functional analysis of genome-based large-scale
	metabolic networks is important for understanding the design principles
	and regulation of the metabolism at a system level. The metabolic
	network is conventionally considered to be highly integrated and
	very complex. A rational reduction of the metabolic network to its
	core structure and a deeper understanding of its functional modules
	are important. RESULTS: In this work, we show that the metabolites
	in a metabolic network are far from fully connected. A connectivity
	structure consisting of four major subsets of metabolites and reactions,
	i.e. a fully connected sub-network, a substrate subset, a product
	subset and an isolated subset is found to exist in metabolic networks
	of 65 fully sequenced organisms. The largest fully connected part
	of a metabolic network, called 'the giant strong component (GSC)',
	represents the most complicated part and the core of the network
	and has the feature of scale-free networks. The average path length
	of the whole network is primarily determined by that of the GSC.
	For most of the organisms, GSC normally contains less than one-third
	of the nodes of the network. This connectivity structure is very
	similar to the 'bow-tie' structure of World Wide Web. Our results
	indicate that the bow-tie structure may be common for large-scale
	directed networks. More importantly, the uncovered structure feature
	makes a structural and functional analysis of large-scale metabolic
	network more amenable. As shown in this work, comparing the closeness
	centrality of the nodes in the GSC can identify the most central
	metabolites of a metabolic network. To quantitatively characterize
	the overall connection structure of the GSC we introduced the term
	'overall closeness centralization index (OCCI)'. OCCI correlates
	well with the average path length of the GSC and is a useful parameter
	for a system-level comparison of metabolic networks of different
	organisms. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena
	to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order
	to predict their behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect
	predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible.
	As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling
	real-world networks have recently been introduced. RESULTS: One example
	of large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction
	(PPI) networks. We analyze PPI networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure
	of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures
	of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different
	network models, including Erdos-Renyi, scale-free and geometric random
	network models, to these PPI networks with respect to the measures
	of local and global network structure. We demonstrate that the currently
	accepted scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in
	several respects and show that a random geometric model provides
	a much more accurate model of the PPI data. We hypothesize that only
	the noise in these networks is scale-free. Conclusions: We systematically
	evaluate how well-different network models fit the PPI networks.
	We show that the structure of PPI networks is better modeled by a
	geometric random graph than by a scale-free model. SUPPLEMENTARY
