       distributions. In this paper we study percolation on graphs
       with completely general degree distribution, giving exact
       solutions for a variety of cases, including site percolation,
       bond percolation, and models in which occupation probabilities
       depend on vertex degree. We discuss the application of our

       focused attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree

       distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In
       this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs
       with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple
       undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of

       the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean
       number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly

       graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including
       the worldwide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and
       Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some

       unusual, hybrid phase transition with a jump emergence of the
       k-core as at a first order phase transition but also with a
       critical singularity as at a continuous transition. We describe
       the properties of the k-core, explain the meaning of the order
       parameter for the k-core percolation, and reveal the origin of
       the specific critical phenomena. We demonstrate that a so-
       called "corona" of the k-core plays a crucial role (corona is a
       subset of vertices in the k-core which have exactly k neighbors
       in the k-core). It turns out that the k-core percolation
       threshold is at the same time the percolation threshold of
       finite corona clusters. The mean separation of vertices in
       corona clusters plays the role of the correlation length and
       diverges at the critical point. We show that a random removal
       of even one vertex from the k-core may result in the collapse
       of a vast region of the k-core around the removed vertex. The
       mean size of this region diverges at the critical point. We
       find an exact mapping of the k-core percolation to a model of
       cooperative relaxation. This model undergoes critical
       relaxation with a divergent rate at some critical moment.},

Two closely related classes of these critical phenomena are considered, namely, structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. Systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other are also discussed. A wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks are mentioned. Strong finite-size effects in these systems and open problems and perspectives are also discussed.

       capture the global properties of such systems is to model them
       as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose
       links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand,
       scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as
       characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture,
       revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real
       networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a

       topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts

       We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like
       regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths,
       like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by
       analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known
       as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the
       worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western
       United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are
       shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems
       with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation

  abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against
       errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist
       and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental
       interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness
       of the underlying metabolic network(1). Complex communication
       networks(2) display a surprising degree of robustness: although
       key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely
       lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of
       the network. The stability of these and other complex systems
       is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional
       web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate
       that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it
       is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks,
       called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide
       Web(3-5), the Internet(6), social networks(7) and cells(8). We
       find that such networks display an unexpected degree of
       robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being
       unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However,
       error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks
       are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection
       and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in
       maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance
       and attack vulnerability are generic properties of
       communication networks.},

       This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it

       formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex
       correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity

       suggests different metrics that are able to thoroughly
       characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of
       several real networks, which makes use of this formalism and
       the metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered
       networks can be classified into two main groups: the weak and
       the strong transitivity classes. In the first class, edge
       multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the
       second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share

  abstract = {The investigation of community structures in networks is an important
       issue in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant
       for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the
       web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic and
       protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of
       large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for
       revealing the community structure in networks, but a general
       and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in
       the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the
       interpretation of the results without any additional
       nontopological information. In this article we deal with this
       problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community
       are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this
       way the algorithms for the identification of the community
       structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose
       a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the
       existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping
       the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on
       artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how
       the algorithm applies to a network of scientific
       collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with
       the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the
       way to applications to large-scale technological and biological
       systems.},

The approximation gives rise to expressions for the epidemic threshold and the probability of a large outbreak in the epidemic. It is investigated how these quantities varies with the clustering in the graph and it turns out for instance that, as the clustering increases, the epidemic threshold decreases. The network is modelled by a random intersection graph, in which individuals are independently members of a number of groups and two individuals are linked to each other if and only if they share at least one group.}

  abstract = {Cite as:  arXiv:0806.2888v1 [q-bio.QM]    Contact networks form the substrate along which infectious diseases spread. Most network-based studies of the spread have only considered the impact of variations in node degrees. However, a number of other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts are expected to play a significant role. We find analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the growth rate, probability, and size of epidemics which we validate for a realistic social network. We find that (for given degree distribution and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling the probability of an epidemic, and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering largest when the population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also strongly clustered. Our results have a number of implications for design of interventions.},

  abstract = { Cite as: arXiv:cond-mat/0206240v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn]    A challenging problem in the social sciences is the characterization of the formation of ``social capital''. It is believed that societies with more social capital are more democratic and economically developed than societies with little social capital. However, social capital is a concept hard to quantify and measure in a ``real-word'' context. Here, we take advantage of an existing ``web of trust'' between users of the ``Pretty-Good-Privacy'' (PGP) encryption algorithm, which is used in digital communication to ``sign'' documents so that the recipient knows for sure who the author is. Our analysis reveals the coexistence in the web of trust of a macro scale-free structure with micro strongly-connected cells in a complex network. We also show that when this network is intentionally attacked the scale-free structure rapidly disintegrates and that the resulting network is partitioned into a large number of small strongly-connected cells that are resilient to the intentional attack. }
