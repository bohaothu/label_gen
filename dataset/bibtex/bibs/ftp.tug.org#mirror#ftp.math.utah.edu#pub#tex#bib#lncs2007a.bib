                 analysis of PageRank-induced order changes when the
                 damping factor varies is provided. Conditions that do
                 not allow variations in the order are studied, and the
                 mechanisms that make the order change are
                 mathematically investigated. Moreover the influence on
                 the order of a truncation in the actual computation of
                 PageRank through a power series is analysed.
                 Experiments carried out on a large Web digraph to
                 integrate the mathematical analysis show that PageRank
                 -- while working on a real digraph -- tends to hinder

                 important part and carry important information of the
                 web graph. In this work, we consider dangling nodes as

                 structure and therefore fully preserve the information
                 carried by them. This differs from some other
                 algorithms which include dangling nodes but treat them
                 differently from regular pages for the purpose of
                 efficiency. We then give an efficient algorithm with
                 negligible overhead associated with dangling node
                 treatment. Moreover, the treatment poses little

  abstract =     "PageRank has been widely used to measure the
                 importance of web pages based on their interconnections
                 in the web graph. Mathematically speaking, PageRank can
                 be explained using a Markov random walk model, in which
                 only the direct outlinks of a page contribute to its
                 transition probability. In this paper, we propose
                 improving the PageRank algorithm by looking N -step
                 ahead when constructing the transition probability
                 matrix. The motivation comes from the similar 'looking
                 N -step ahead' strategy that is successfully used in
                 computer chess. Specifically, we assume that if the
                 random surfer knows the N -step outlinks of each web
                 page, he/she can make a better decision on choosing
                 which page to navigate for the next time. It is clear
                 that the classical PageRank algorithm is a special case
                 of our proposed N -step PageRank method. Experimental
                 results on the dataset of TREC Web track show that our
                 proposed algorithm can boost the search accuracy of
                 classical PageRank by more than 15\% in terms of mean
                 average precision.",
