ABSTRACT:: 
Several projects in the operating systems research community suggest a
trend of convergence among features once divided between operating
systems and languages. We describe how partial evaluation and
transformational programming systems apply to this trend by providing a
general framework for application support, from compilation to run-time
services. We contend that the community will no longer think of
implementing a static collection of services and calling it an
operating system; instead, this general framework will allow
applications to be flexibly configured, and the ``operating system''
will simply be the application support that is supplied at run-time.
