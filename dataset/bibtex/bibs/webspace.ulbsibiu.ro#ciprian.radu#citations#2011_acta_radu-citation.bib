  abstract = {Network-on-Chip  architectures  have  been  recently  proposed  to  address  the  limitations  of  bus-based 
interconnection  networks. They focus on  modularity,  scalability and intrinsic support for heterogeneous Systems-on-
Chip.  Network-on-Chip  application  mapping  is  an  NP-hard  problem  that  deals  with  the  topological  mapping  of 
Intellectual Property cores onto network tiles. This paper outlines the main contributions of an ongoing PhD research, 
which addresses this problem. At the Advanced Computer Architecture & Processing Systems (ACAPS) research lab, 
we  developed  UniMap,  a  framework  that  evaluates  and  optimizes  algorithms  for  Network-on-Chip  application 
mapping,  through  a  unified  approach.  Using  this  tool,  multiple  application  mapping  algorithms  can  be  tested  on  the 
same network architecture. The framework is also intended to be flexible so that different interconnection designs can 
be used when comparing the performance of different algorithms. We present here UniMap’s design and we show how 
it contributes to the Network-on-Chip application mapping research. },
