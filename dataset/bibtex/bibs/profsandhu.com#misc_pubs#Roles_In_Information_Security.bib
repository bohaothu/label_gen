  abstract = {In role-based access control (RBAC), users and objects are assigned
	to one or more roles. Users should be active in the role that has
	the required permissions before access is granted. Thus, users should
	be aware of the role-permission assignments for activating the required
	roles. In general, with respect to role activations, current systems
	follow the human-active, system-passive model. Users often get swamped
	with role activations due to numerous factors that include increase
	in the number of objects, multiple role assignments, and shifting
	roles often, and lean toward activating all the assigned roles violating
	the principle of least privilege (PLP). In this paper, we introduce
	smartaccess, a system based on the system-active, human-passive model
	that allows users to concentrate on what objects they need, rather
	than what role should be activated in order to carry on their work
	efficiently. Furthermore, it provides access control by preserving
	the PLP and without any information leak. We provide algorithms for
	discovering roles and analyze various associated factors.},

	is the complexity of security administration and user-profile management.
	Role based access control (RBAC) has become the predominant model
	for advanced access control due to the reduced complexity and cost
	of administration. Under RBAC, security administration is greatly
	simplified by using roles, hierarchies and privileges, and user management
	is uncomplicated by using LDAP API specification within the J2EE
	application. System administrators create roles according to the
	job functions performed in an organization, grant permissions to
	those roles, and then assign users to the roles on the basis of their
	specific job responsibilities and qualifications. We introduce in
	this paper RBAC in a typical J2EE enterprise application and present
	architectural details, along with security administration and user-profile
	management for RBAC. Netegrity SiteMinder provides the RBAC foundation,
	and J2EE framework serves as the reference model for administration
	in the application. Then we emphasize the design and implementation
	of a custom RBAC-model, and the possibilities of optimization of
	this model},

	of Manufacturing Grid, we propose a new Manufacturing Grid Access
	Control Model to support the dynamic restricted rights management
	based on the current Role-based Access Control Model. We employ a
	distributed access control mechanism to realize the authorization
	from the local service nodes according to the global and local authorization
	policy. The implementation within the project of the Shanghai High
	Institutions Grid proves the authorization architecture and model
	are workable and our work is valuable.},

  abstract = {Separation of duties (SoD) is a key security requirement for many
	business and information systems. Role based access controls (RBAC)
	is a relatively new paradigm for protecting information systems.
	In the ANSI standard RBAC model both static and dynamic SoD are defined.
	However, static SoD policies assume that the system has full control
	over the assignment of all roles to users, whilst dynamic SoD policies
	assume that conflicts of interest can only arise during the simultaneous
	activation of a user's roles. Unfortunately neither of these assumptions
	hold true in dynamic virtual organisations (VOs), or in business
	processes that span multiple user sessions, or where users only partially
	disclose their roles at each session. In this paper we propose multi-session
	SoD (MSoD) policies for business processes which include multiple
	tasks enacted by multiple users over many user access control sessions.
	We explore the means to define MSoD policies in RBAC via multi-session
	mutually exclusive roles (MMER) and multi-session mutually exclusive
	privileges (MMEP). We propose an approach to expressing MSoD policies
	in XML and enforcing MSoD policies in a policy controlled RBAC infrastructure.
	Finally, we describe how we have implemented MSoD policies in the
	PERMIS privilege management infrastructure.},

	one is to illustrate that the new model provides a simpler and more
	natural way to implement BLP model using role-based techniques; a
	second application is to make it possible to define separation of
	duty constraints on two roles that have a common senior role and
	for a user to be assigned to or activate the senior role; finally,
	we describe how a single hierarchy in the new model can support the
	distinction between role activation and permission usage. In short,
	the oriented permission model provides ways of implementing a number

	applying. RBAC (role based access control) as an access control technology
	using for distributed system has been widely researched these years.
	Role hierarchies is one component of RBAC model, it can reduce the
	workload of permission assignment. Nowadays most research of RBAC
	has no relation with timing constraint. The main purpose of this
	article is to study the effect of temporal constraint acting on role
	hierarchy. The basis of the study is RBAC96 model, first we analyse
	the change of role state, propose 3 forms of temporal constraint
	and give the expression of temporal constraint. Then we present an
	analysis of the effects of temporal constraint on role enabling and
	role activation which has various implication on a role hierarchy,
	and at last we formally describe a timing restricted role hierarchies
	model},

	typical problems and requirements in the distributed hierarchical
	resource management such as: hierarchical resources policy administration,
	user roles/attributes management, dynamic security context and authorisation
	session management, and others. It describes relations between the
	RBAC and the generic AAA access control models and defines combined
	RBAC-DM model for domain-based access control management and suggests
	mechanisms that can be used in the distributed service-oriented infrastructure
	for security context management. The paper provides implementation
	details on the use of XACML for finegrained access control policy
	definition for domain based resources organisation and roles assignments
	in RBAC-DM. The paper is based on experiences gained from the major

	A role concept shows a job function in an enterprise. Traditional
	locking protocols and timestamp ordering schedulers are based on
	principles "first-comer-winner" and "timestamp order" to make multiple
	conflicting transactions serializable, respectively. In this paper,
	we discuss a concurrency control based on the significancy of roles
	assigned to transactions. We define a significantly dominant relation
	on roles. We discuss a role ordering (RO) scheduler based on the
	role concept. We evaluate the RO scheduler compared with the two-phase
	locking (2PL) protocol.},

	system with flexible access control. We have formally analyzed and
	modeled the system requirements with the UML language. In addition,
	we have adopted an augmented role-based access control mechanism
	to design a news production system that can easily adapt to organizational
	changes. The implemented system is used a testbed for experimental
	news production. Preliminary evaluation of the system functions reveals
	that users can adapt to this system and increase their productivity
	in the news production process.},

	on multi-agent systems (MAS) technique owing to its modularity, autonomy,
	distributedness, flexibility, and scalability. All agents serve their
	specific purposes. Leveraging agents simplifies high availability.
	PKI is used for trust enablement between intra- and inter-domain
	agent communications. The security assertion markup language (SAML)
	is adopted for supporting the exchange of authentication and authorization
	information in the architecture. The approach supports strong two-factor
	authentication with X.509 digital certificate. The authorization
	scheme is based on the privilege management infrastructure (PMI).
	Finally, we reported our extended implementation status and demonstrated
	that our proposed model is efficient and flexible to implement in
	the multiple SSO and PKI domains.},

	introduced to enterprises. Especially, the demands on enforcement
	of enterprise-level security policies and total identity management
	are rapidly growing. The RBAC model needs to be extended to deal
	with various circumstances of large enterprises, such as geographical
	distribution and heterogeneous environments including physical access
	control. In this paper, we introduce a new RBAC model, suitable for
	single sign-on systems. This model optimizes evaluation of rule-based
	RBAC so that total operation costs and productivity can be improved.
	
	Furthermore, to select most cost-effective RBAC extensions for enterprise-wide
	requirements, we propose a quantitative risk evaluation method based
	on fault trees. We construct fault trees having security violation
	and productivity loss as top events, and RBAC standard functions
	and security incidents as basic events. Probabilities of the top
	events are computed for given RBAC models and operation environments.
	We apply this method to a real enterprise system using the above
	RBAC extension and the proposed model realizes more safety and productivity
	over the base model.},

  abstract = {A decomposition of a binary matrix into two matrices gives a set of
	basis vectors and their appropriate combination to form the original
	matrix. Such decomposition solutions are useful in a number of application
	domains including text mining, role engineering as well as knowledge
	discovery. While a binary matrix can be decomposed in several ways,
	however, certain decompositions better characterize the semantics
	associated with the original matrix in a succinct but comprehensive
	way. Indeed, one can find different decompositions optimizing different
	criteria matching various semantics. In this paper, we first present
	a number of variants to the optimal Boolean matrix decomposition
	problem that have pragmatic implications. We then present a unified
	framework for modeling the optimal binary matrix decomposition and
	its variants using binary integer programming. Such modeling allows
	us to directly adopt the huge body of heuristic solutions and tools
	developed for binary integer programming. Although the proposed solutions
	are applicable to any domain of interest, for providing more meaningful
	discussions and results, in this paper, we present the binary matrix
	decomposition problem in a role engineering context, whose goal is
	to discover an optimal and correct set of roles from existing permissions,
	referred to as the role mining problem (RMP). This problem has gained
	significant interest in recent years as role based access control
	has become a popular means of enforcing security in databases. We
	consider several variants of the above basic RMP, including the min-noise
	RMP, delta-approximate RMP and edge-RMP. Solutions to each of them
	aid security administrators in specific scenarios. We then model
	these variants as Boolean matrix decomposition and present efficient
	heuristics to solve them.},

	propose a distributed domain administration of RBAC model, DARBAC,
	in which the authorization and administration privileges are distributed
	to multiple administrative domains. Each administrative role is assigned
	to an administrative domain and can only execute administrative operations
	within its domain. By introducing the concept of administrative domain
	and administrative role hierarchy, the DARBAC model can flexibly
	meet the access control requirements in collaborative environments.
	We also describe how to implement the model in the PLM product and

	developed and widely used in peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks.
	Here, groups of peers are dynamically and autonomously constructed
	to achieve some objectives by sharing objects held by the member
	peers. Each peer holds objects and is assumed to manage its own objects
	in the role-based access control (RBAC) model in this paper. A role
	is a collection of access rights, i.e. permissions. A peer defines
	roles on its own objects and grants and revokes a role to and from
	another peer. Only a peer granted a role is allowed to make an access
	to the objects in access rights of the role. In this paper, we discuss
	how to securely share objects with multiple peers in a society. Each
	member peer logically views a society to be a collection of society
	objects and society roles to manipulate the society objects without
	being conscious of which local peer holds the objects and whether
	or not the peer is granted access rights. In a society, each member
	peer plays one or more than one society role. On joining a society,
	a peer first negotiates with the society an agreement on which roles
	the peer can support to the society and which society role the peer
	is granted. In this paper, we discuss how peers do the negotiation
	with each other to grant and revoke roles in a society.},

	based access control requirements. The generalized temporal RBAC
	model has been proposed to capture fine-grained time-based access
	control requirements using periodic time expression to capture recurring
	intervals of time. In this paper, we present conditional temporal
	RBAC (CT-RBAC) model that extends GTRBAC model by extending the periodic
	time expression. In particular, the extension allows fine-grained
	extension to capture other logical conditions that restricts the
	validity of the temporal constraints. CT-RBAC uses a symbolic representation
	of conditional periodic time that can be used to define a set of
	conditions to qualify the components of a periodic time expression,
	using the concurrent transaction logic. Because of the conditional
	set introduced, CT-RBAC extends the time control dimension to the
	(condition, time) control plane and the (time, constraint) plane
	of the GTRBAC framework to the (condition, time, constraint) three-dimensional
	control space, thus providing more flexibility in the access control
	model. We analyze conflicts introduced by the constraint set and
	the complexity of evaluating the conditional set.},

	to implement fine-grained access control based on RBAC while considering
	specific context constraints. The approach is object-dependent and
	policy-enforced through binding policies to particular object. In
	the policies, context constraints are incorporated to support separation
	of duties (SoD). Furthermore, the implement of the approach is described
	in detail and an application to meet specific access control requirements
	of comprehensive knowledge management system in an aviation enterprise
	is presented.},

	information security. When building large-scale systems based on
	popular commercial component middleware, such as J2EE, a usual way
	to enforce access control is to define access control configurations
	for components in a declarative manner. These configurations can
	be interpreted by the J2EE security service to grant or deny access
	requests to components. However, it is difficult for the developers
	to define correct access control configurations according to complex
	and sometimes ambiguous real-world access control requirements. The
	difficulties come from mainly the complexity of configuring voluminous
	component methods in large-scale component based systems and some
	quality constraints on the configurations, for example, the completeness,
	consistency and performance overhead of configurations. In this paper,
	we propose a requirements model driven approach for automatic generation
	of J2EE access control configurations and demonstrate the approach
	in a J2EE blueprint application.},

	Nowadays, many organizations and enterprises such as banks, insurance

	very large number of users. This shows that assigning users to roles
	is a intolerable task and maintaining user-role assignment up-to-date
	is costly and error-prone. Also, with the increasing number of users,
	RBAC may have problems in prohibiting cheat and changing roles of
	users. To overcome these problems, user-role assignment decision
	can be made based on how much we trust him/her. In this paper, we
	propose a model to assign users to roles based on trustworthiness
	which is fuzzy in nature. The proposed model uses fuzzy relation

	important for the interoperability of cross- enterprises in insecure

	for confidentiality and integrity has gained growing attention in
	both the research world and the industry. However, the traditional
	workflow authorization model (WAM) mainly focuses on the synchronization
	of authorization flow by using authorization templates (ATs) and
	is limited in encountering the consequences of workflow changes and/or
	exceptions, which are very common in today's dynamic business environment.
	In this paper, we propose an integrated approach of a flexible WAM
	with dynamic checking features to handle workflow changes and exceptions.
	Extended temporal role-based access control and flexible workflow
	authorization template are adopted to further enhance the traditional
	AT ensuring information confidentiality and integrity. The method
	of implementing the proposed model is also introduced.},

	can be integrated with the rest of the system from the outset, because:
	a single notation is used to express both access control and functional
	requirements; a systematic and incremental approach to constructing
	a formal behavior tree specification can be adopted; and the specification
	can be simulated and model checked. The effectiveness of the model
	is evaluated using a case study with distributed access control requirements.},

	has become very appealing because of the benefits that a role-based
	approach typically brings. This approach uses RBAC itself to manage
	RBAC policies so that the administration functions can be decentralized
	and made more efficient. ARBAC97, ARBAC99, and ARBAC02 are series
	of well-known solutions for decentralized RBAC administration. However,
	none of these can be used for RBAC systems that support hybrid hierarchies,
	which have been shown to be necessary to specify fine-grained RBAC
	policies. In this paper, we propose the ARBAC07 model based on the
	ARBAC97, ARBAC99 and ARBAC02 models for an RBAC system with hybrid
	hierarchy. We show that our model keeps all the advantages of the
	original model and can further deal with more fine-grained RBAC policies

	The proposed approach introduces authorization group, which is used

	privileges, and hierarchical access control mechanism which is used
	to protect the services and services patameters. We outline the configuration

  abstract = {Authorization constraints (also simply called constraints) are an
	important aspect of role-based access control (RBAC), since they
	can be argued to be one of the principal motivations behind RBAC.
	Although the importance of constraints in RBAC has been recognized
	for a long time, they have not received much attention in research
	literature, while role hierarchies have been practiced and discussed
	at considerable length. Most prior work has focused on separation
	of duty (SOD) constraints enumerating many variations. In this dissertation,
	we describe a framework for specifying authorization constraints
	in role-based systems. To specify these constraints, we need an appropriate
	language as well as some system functions. We propose a simple and
	intuitive language, RCL 2000 (Role-based Constraints Language 2000),
	to specify constraints in an intuitive and useful way in role-based
	systems. The formal semantics for this language is based on its translation
	to a restricted form of first order predicate logic.
	
	
	With this language we show how we can express the previous SOD constraints
	discovering newly identified properties, such as permission-centric
	constraints. We also define new forms of SOD, especially with role
	hierarchies. To illustrate the power of RCL 2000 we specify constraints
	which have been identified in simulations of Lattice-based access
	control, Chinese Wall, and Discretionary access control policy in
	RBAC. Moreover, we separate role-based constraints into two major
	classes: Prohibition Constraints and Obligation Constraints . We
	characterize a subset of these classes from our specification of
	role-based constraints.
	
	
	Our work also shows that it is futile to try to enumerate all constraints
	because there are too many possibilities and variations; instead,
	we should pursue an intuitively simple yet rigorous language, such
	as RCL 2000 , for specifying constraints.},

  abstract = {With respect to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA's) paradigm, the
	core Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has several limitations. In
	SOA, permissions to execute web services are not assigned statically
	to roles but are associated with a set of Permission Assignment Constraints
	(PAC) upon the fulfilment of which a role is assigned a permission
	to execute a web service. Further, the RBAC does not support partial
	inheritance which is an integral requirement in SOA. A major challenge
	in SOA is the inheritance of permissions associated with PAC in the
	presence of role hierarchies. This contribution has three objectives.
	First we propose an extension to Role Based Access Control (available
	at csrc.nist.gov/rbac/), which we call Constraint based RBAC (CRBAC),
	in order to make RBAC applicable to the dynamic environment of SOA.
	Within CRBAC, a high-level language  called SECTET-PL (available
	at http:// qe-informatik.uibk.ac.at/~muhammad/TechnicalReportSECTETPL.pdf)
	is used for the specification of PAC. Being part of the SECTET-framework
	for model-driven security for B2B-workflows, SECTET-PL is a policy
	language influenced by OCL (available at http://www.omg.org/docs/ptc/03-10-14.pdf)
	and interpreted in the context of UML models. Using the Model Driven
	Architecture (MDA) (available at http://www.omg.org/mda) paradigm,
	we then describe the transformation of high-level security models
	to low-level web services standard artefacts with the help of the
	Eclipse Modelling Framework and OpenArchitectureWare. Finally, we
	present the target architecture of the SECTET-framework used to realize
	the security artefacts generated from the transformations and thus
	completes the cycle of MDA.},

	delegates authority to another active entity in order to carry out
	some functions on behalf of the former. User delegation in RBAC is
	the ability of one user (called the delegating user) who is a member
	of the delegated role to authorize another user (called the delegate
	user) to become a member of the delegated role. This paper introduces
	a new model, which we consider it to be an extension of REDM0 [BS2000].
	The central contribution of this paper is to introduce a new model,
	referred to as RBDM1 (role-based delegation model/ hierarchical roles),
	that uses the details from RBDM0, which was described in the literature
	by Barka and Sandhu [BS2000] to address the temporary delegation
	based on hierarchical roles. We formally defined a role-based delegation
	model based on hierarchical relationship between the roles involved.
	We also identified the different semantics that impact the can-delegate
	relation, we analyzed these semantics to determine which ones we
	consider as more appropriate in business today, thus allowed in our
	model, and provided a justification to why those selections are made.},

  abstract = {Establishing and maintaining a presence on the World Wide Web (Web),
	once a sideline for U.S. industry, has become a key strategic aspect
	of marketing and sales. Many companies have demonstrated that a well
	designed Web site can have a positive effect on their profitability.
	Enabling customers to answer their own questions by clicking their
	way through Web pages, instead of dealing with operators and voice
	response systems, increases the efficiency of the customer interface.
	
	
	One of the most challenging problems in managing large networked systems
	is the complexity of security administration. This is particularly
	true for organizations that are attempting to manage security in
	distributed multimedia environments such as those using World Wide
	Web services. Today, security administration is costly and prone
	to error because administrators usually specify access control lists
	for each user on the system individually.
	
	
	Role-based access control (RBAC) is a technology that is attracting
	increasing attention, particularly for commercial applications, because
	of its potential for reducing the complexity and cost of security
	administration in large networked applications. The concept and design
	of RBAC is perfectly suited for use on both intranets and internets.
	It provides a secure and effective way to manage access to an organizations
	Web information. This paper describes a research effort to develop
	RBAC on the Web. The security and software components that provide
	RBAC for networked servers using Web protocols have been implemented
	and are described in this paper. The RBAC components can be linked
	with commercially available web servers, and require no modification
	of the server software.},

	because it reduces the complexity and cost of security administration
	by interposing the notion of rle in the assignment of permissions
	to users. In this paper, we present a formal framework relying on
	an extension of the -calculus to study the behaviour of concurrent
	systems in a RBAC scenario. We define a type system ensuring that
	the specified policy is respected during computations, and a behavioural
	equivalence to equate systems. We then consider a more sophisticated
	feature that can be easily integrated in our framework, i.e., the
	possibility of automatically adding rle activations and deactivations
	to processes to be run under a given policy (whenever possible).
	Finally, we show how the framework can be easily extended to express
	significant extensions of the core RBAC model, such as rles hierarchies
	or constraints determining the acceptability of the system components.},

	in the security field. Many access control mechanisms including Role-Based
	Access Control (RBAC) are widely used for authorization. The common
	use of the wireless network imposes not only existing problems such
	as secure system management but also new problems such as limited
	storage and transaction size. In this paper, we propose an access
	control method that solves these problems for wireless environment.
	The proposed system uses bit pattern to represent access control
	information hence reduces transaction size and enhances security
	level. This system employs neural networks instead of access control
	tables, which reduces storages for role-permission tables and extra
	mutual exclusive data tables.},

	as useful in information security and many RBAC models have been
	proposed. Current RBAC researches focus on developing new models
	or enhancing existing models. In our research, we developed an RBAC
	model that can be embedded in object-oriented systems to control
	information flows (i.e. to protect privacy) within the systems. This
	paper proposes the model. The model, which is named OORBAC, is an
	extension of RBAC96. OORBAC offers the following features: (a) precisely
	control information flows among objects, (b) control method invocation
	through argument sensitivity, (c) allow purpose-oriented method invocation
	and prevent leakage within an object, (d) precisely control write
	access, and (e) avoid Trojan horses. We implemented a prototype for
	OORBAC using JAVA as the target language. The implementation resulted
	in a language named OORBACL, which can be used to implement secure
	applications. We evaluated OORBAC using experiments. The evaluation

	mining algorithms. This framework is based on a rigorous analysis
	of identifiable patterns in access permission data. In particular,
	it is possible to derive a lattice of candidate roles from the permission
	powerset. We formally prove some interesting properties about such
	lattices. These properties, a contribution on their own, can be applied
	practically to optimize role mining algorithms. Data redundancies
	associated with co-occurrences of permissions among users can be
	easily identified and eliminated, allowing for increased output quality
	and reduced processing time. To prove the effectiveness of our proposal,
	we have applied our results to two existing role mining algorithms:
	Apriori and RBAM. Application of these modified algorithms to a realistic
	data set consistently reduced running time and, in some cases, also
	greatly improved output quality; all of which confirmed our analytical
	findings.},

  abstract = {Our society is increasingly moving towards richer forms of information
	exchange where mobility of processes and devices plays a prominent
	role. This tendency has prompted the academic community to study
	the security problems arising from such mobile environments, and
	in particular, the security policies regulating who can access the
	information in question.
	
	
	In this paper we describe a calculus for mobile processes and propose
	a mechanism for specifying access privileges based on a combination
	of the identity of the users seeking access, their credentials, and
	the location from which they seek it, within a reconfigurable nested
	structure.
	
	
	We define View the MathML source, a boxed ambient calculus extended
	with a Distributed Role-Based Access Control mechanism where each
	ambient controls its own access policy. A process in View the MathML
	source is associated with an owner and a set of activated roles that
	grant permissions for mobility and communication. The calculus includes
	primitives to activate and deactivate roles. The behavior of these
	primitives is determined by the processs owner, its current location
	and its currently activated roles. We consider two forms of security
	violations that our type system prevents: (1) attempting to move
	into an ambient without having the authorizing roles granting entry
	activated and (2) trying to use a communication port without having
	the roles required for access activated. We accomplish (1) and (2)
	by giving a static type system, an untyped transition semantics,
	and a typed transition semantics. We then show that a well-typed
	program never violates the dynamic security checks.},

  abstract = {The idea of role has been widely applied to solving the authority,
	responsibility, function and interaction, which are associated with
	member station in organizations. Access control is a key security
	issue in distributed collaboration systems. After analyzing corresponding
	security requirements and the present status of security in distributed
	collaboration system, this paper presents an extensive role-based
	access control (ERBAC) architecture based on differentiated domain
	management. In this architecture, security management is classified
	into inter-domain one and infra-domain one, whilst, it can integrate
	new security policies. Based on definition of role permission type,
	the paper introduces a function of permission type change to make
	ERBAC architecture flexible. In addition, the authors discuss the
	methods by which the security can be implemented in an agent-based
	framework. The practices signify that this system can be flexibly
	applied various existing policy languages and protocols.},

	We show that there is a subset of GTRBAC constraints that is sufficient
	to express all the access constraints that can be expressed using

	set can provide better flexibility and lower complexity of constraint

	constraint or maximum active duration constraint within a specified

	Control (C-RBAC) model for distributed systems in which accesses
	across system domain boundaries are allowed. Access entities in a
	TOS vary in time. The changes in the organizational structure of
	the access entities in one system may influence other cooperating
	systems. In addition, policy-freeness, domain and rule conflicts
	are possible. These problems restrict the flexibility and scalability
	of coordination. We propose drafting a meta-component to play the
	role of a coordinator in multi-domain role-based access control.
	It is then possible to impart flexibility and scalability in a secure
	fashion. Experimental studies of the proposed model with the Network
	File System and SELinux system support our conclusion.},

	In software development process, the target software system consists

	This results in potential operation conflicts in cooperative works
	among the project members. This problem can be much reduced by decomposing
	the target software system into the relatively independent components.
	Our system incorporates hierarchical role-based decomposition model
	to reduce operation conflicts frequently occur in synchronous/asynchronous
	collaboration. The decomposed components are also used as basic units
	of the role-based access control. Once the target software system
	is properly decomposed according to this model, its subsystems can
	migrate to the other sites, and thus, the components can be evenly
	distributed over networked computers},

	One import aspect of RBAC is the enforcing of security policy, called
	constraint, which controls the behavior of components in RBAC. Much
	research has been conducted to specify constraints. However, more
	work is needed on the aspect of sharing information resources for
	providing better interoperability in the widely dispersed ubiquitous
	information system environment. This paper provides visual modeling
	of RBAC policy and specifies constraints of RBAC by employing a semantic
	web ontology language (OWL) to enhance understanding of constraints
	for machines and people in a ubiquitous computing environment. Using
	OWL, constraints were precisely formalized according to the constraint
	patterns and the effectiveness of OWL specification was demonstrated

	since its components, especially role hierarchy, are suitable for
	modeling an organization structure. But the functional role hierarchy
	constructed through the existing role engineering approaches does
	not reflect an organization structure, because they do not take the
	structural characteristics of the organization into account. Also,
	it has been observed that the unconditional permission inheritance
	property in functional role hierarchy may breach a least privilege
	security principle and make it impossible to define separation of
	duty requirements on roles that have a common senior role. In this
	paper, we propose a role engineering methodology considering organizational
	roles as well as functional roles to provide a practical RBAC model
	for corporate environment. We also elaborate the characteristics
	of organizational roles relatively neglected in the previous work,
	and compare them with those of functional roles. And models for associating
	organizational and functional roles and those role hierarchies (unified
	vs. separate) are proposed and the advantages and shortcomings of

  abstract = {In addition to basic security services such as confidentiality, integrity
	and data source authentication, a secure group communication system
	should also provide authentication of participants and access control
	to group resources. While considerable research has been conducted
	on providing confidentiality and integrity for group communication,
	less work focused on group access control services. In the context
	of group communication, specifying and enforcing access control becomes
	more challenging because of the dynamic and distributed nature of
	groups and the fault tolerance issues (i.e. withstanding process
	faults and network partitions).
	
	In this paper we analyze the requirements access control mechanisms
	must fulfill in the context of group communication and define a framework
	for supporting fine-grained access control in client-server group
	communication systems. Our framework combines role-based access control
	mechanisms with environment parameters (time, IP address, etc.) to
	provide policy support for a wide range of applications with very
	different requirements. While policy is defined by the application,
	its efficient enforcement is provided by the group communication
	system. %We discuss how such a framework addresses the unique needs
	%of group communication systems and can be supported and %enforced
	in an efficient manner in Spread, a publicly available %group communication
	system.},

	functions and interactions associated with manager positions within
	organizations. In this paper we discuss the issues related to specifying
	roles for both human and automated managers of distributed computer
	systems. The starting point is that a role can be defined in terms
	of the authorization and obligation policies, for a particular manager
	position, which specify what actions the manager is permitted or
	is obliged to do on a set of target objects. This permits individuals
	to be assigned or removed from positions without respecifying the
	policies for the role. However these policies are insufficient for
	fully specifying relationships between managers and the targets they
	manage or between different manager roles. There is a need to specify
	the interaction protocols and how managers coordinate and synchronize
	their activities. The role based framework consists of a set of tools
	enabling the creation of roles from policies, the specification of
	the concurrency constraints for role activities and the specification
	of protocols for role interaction. In addition, the issues related
	to conflicts which can occur between policies within a role or between
	interacting roles are briefly discussed.},

	electronic patient record (EPR) is essential to a wide scale use
	of EPR in large health organizations. In this paper, we propose a
	contextual role-based access control authorization model aiming to
	increase the patient privacy and the confidentiality of patient data,
	whereas being flexible enough to consider specific cases. This model
	regulates user's access to EPR based on organizational roles. It
	supports a role-tree hierarchy with authorization inheritance; positive
	and negative authorizations; static and dynamic separation of duties
	based on weak and strong role conflicts. Contextual authorizations
	use environmental information available at access time, like user/patient
	relationship, in order to decide whether a user is allowed to access
	an EPR resource. This enables the specification of a more flexible
	and precise authorization policy, where permission is granted or
	denied according to the right and the need of the user to carry out
	a particular job function.},

	mechanism serves as the foundation for programmable security. The
	implementation incorporates a preprocessor for language translation

	infrastructure. The preprocessor translates the extended Java source
	code to native Java for eventual bytecode interpretation simultaneously
	binding security services to the native code. The design is simple

	security within Java packages},

  abstract = {Corporations and government agencies rely on inter-operating software
	artifacts (e.g., legacy, COTS, GOTS, databases, servers, etc.) and
	client applications, brought together by middleware (e.g., CORBA,
	JINI, .NET, etc.), supporting unrestricted access to application
	programmer interfaces, APIs. As part of our ongoing research, we
	have designed and prototyped a unified role-based/mandatory access
	control (RBAC/MAC) security model with delegation and enforcement
	to control access by users (via clients) to the methods of artifact
	APIs, namely: who (user/client) can invoke which methods of artifact
	APIs at what times. Underlying our RBAC/MAC framework are security
	assurance rules, SARs, which provide a confidence level on the attainment
	of an application's security policy. We focus on the formal underpinnings
	of our security assurance research, its realization during security
	policy definition with management tools, and at runtime by the enforcement
	framework.},

	A successful application of the model can help the user navigate

	the roles' permissions. The principal motivation behind RBAC is to
	simplify administration. Several framework for the development of
	role-based systems have been introduced. However, there are a few
	works specifying RBAC in a way which system developers or software
	engineers can easily understand and refer to develop role-based systems.
	The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose visual modeling
	language in which we can specify, visualize, and document the components
	of a software system. In this paper we represent the RBAC model with
	this well-known modeling language to reduce a gap between security
	models and system developments. We specify the RBAC model with three
	views: static view, functional view, and dynamic view. In addition,
	we briefly discuss about the future directions},

  abstract = {One reason workflow systems have been criticized as being inflexible
	is that they lack support for delegation. This paper shows how delegation
	can be introduced in a workflow system by extending the role-based
	access control (RBAC) model. The current RBAC model is a security
	mechanism to implement access control in organizations by allowing
	users to be assigned to roles and privileges to be associated with
	the roles. Thus, users can perform tasks based on the privileges
	possessed by their own role or roles they inherit by virtue of their
	organizational position. However, there is no easy way to handle
	delegations within this model. This paper tries to treat the issues
	surrounding delegation in workflow systems in a comprehensive way.
	We show how delegations can be incorporated into the RBAC model in
	a simple and straightforward manner. The new extended model is called
	RBAC with delegation in a workflow context (DW-RBAC). It allows for
	delegations to be specified from a user to another user, and later
	revoked when the delegation is no longer required. The implications
	of such specifications and their subsequent revocations are examined.
	Several formal definitions for assertion, acceptance, execution and
	revocation are provided, and proofs are given for the important properties
	of our delegation framework.},

	use a de facto constraints specification language in software engineering
	to analyze the constraints in user-role assignments and permission-role
	assignments. We show how to represent role-based access constraints
	with object constraint language (OCL) and discuss the future work.
	Finally, comparisons with other related work are presented.},

	presents a mediation security architecture for information integration
	based on role-based access control (RBAC). An adorned XML model (AXM)
	is used to homogenize security data modeling. Security requirements
	of mediation systems are specified by constraints over various RBAC

	and communicate with each other to perform their jobs more efficiently.
	For better performance, it is important to keep resources and information
	integrity from unexpected use by unauthorized users. Therefore, there
	is a strong demand for access control of distributed shared resources.
	Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) has been introduced and offers a
	powerful means for specifying access control decisions. The authors
	propose an object oriented RBAC model for distributed system (ORBAC),
	it efficiently represents the real world. Moreover, under the decentralized
	ORBAC management architecture, an implementation of the model has
	realized multiple-domain access control. Finally, statically and
	dynamically role authorization is considered and a method to deal
	with the problem of separation of duties is presented},

  abstract = {There is an emerging recognition of the importance of utilizing contextual
	information in authorization decisions. Controlling access to resources
	in the field of wireless and mobile networking require the definition
	of a formal model for access control with supporting spatial context.
	However, traditional RBAC model does not specify these spatial requirements.
	In this paper, we extend the existing RBAC model and propose the
	SC-RBAC model that utilizes spatial and location-based information
	in security policy definitions. The concept of spatial role is presented,
	and the role is assigned a logical location domain to specify the
	spatial boundary. Roles are activated based on the current physical
	position of the user which obtained from a specific mobile terminal.
	We then extend SC-RBAC to deal with hierarchies, modeling permission,
	user and activation inheritance, and prove that the hierarchical
	spatial roles are capable of constructing a lattice which is a means
	for articulate multi-level security policy and more suitable to control
	the information flow security for safety-critical location-aware
	information systems. Next, constrained SC-RBAC allows express various
	spatial separations of duty constraints, location-based cardinality
	and temporal constraints for specify fine-grained spatial semantics
	that are typical in location-aware systems. Finally, we introduce
	9 invariants for the constrained SC-RBAC and its basic security theorem
	is proven. The constrained SC-RBAC provides the foundation for applications
	in need of the constrained spatial context aware access control.},
