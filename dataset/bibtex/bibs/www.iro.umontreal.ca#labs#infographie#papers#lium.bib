  abstract =     "We describe an \emph{interactive} system to reconstruct
  		  3D geometry and extract textures from a set of photographs
		  taken with arbitrary camera parameters. The basic idea is
		  to let the user draw 2D geometry on the images and set
		  constraints using these drawings.  Because the input comes
		  directly from the user, he can more easily resolve most of
		  the ambiguities and difficulties traditional computer
		  vision algorithms must deal with.

		  A set of geometrical linear constraints formulated as a
		  weighted least-squares problem is efficiently solved for
		  the camera parameters, and then for the 3D geometry.
		  Iterations between these two steps lead to improvements
		  on both results.  Once a satisfying 3D model is
		  reconstructed, its color textures are extracted by
		  sampling the projected texels in the corresponding images.
		  All the textures associated with a polygon are then fitted
		  to one another, and the corresponding colors are combined
		  according to a set of criteria in order to form a unique
		  texture.

		  The system produces 3D models and environments more
		  suitable for realistic image synthesis and computer
		  augmented reality.",

		  the simulation of one aspect of liquids, i.e. droplets
		  running down surfaces. We present a model oriented
		  towards a visually-satisfying simulation and efficiency.

		  The efficiency results from the separation between the
		  shape and the motion of a droplet. The motion accounts for
		  all changes encountered along the path followed over a
		  mesh of triangles. It is affected by various properties
		  modeled as friction, adhesion, roughness, and collisions
		  between droplets. Streaks are also added along the paths.

		  We characterize the shape of a droplet by a small set of
		  properties, such as volume conservation, surface tension,
		  etc. We model them as constraints to satisfy. The shape
		  model is mainly based on mass-springs. It is simple and
		  efficient, and it guarantees that whatever the values of
		  the unconstrained parameters, all produced shapes satisfy
		  the characteristic properties, and thus, can represent
		  different types of droplets.

		  Rendered animations of various liquids illustrate the

  keywords =     "animation techniques, keyframe techniques, face,

  url =          "http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/labs/infographie/papers/",
  abstract =     "The importance of faces in human interaction explains
  		  the desire for synthetic faces as a communication vehicle
		  in computer graphics. Unfortunately, animating a face is
		  a very complex process, partly because of our very
		  familiarity with the human face. Moreover, depending upon
		  the application, there exists a wide range of faces to
		  animate, whether realistically or artistically.

		  We present here an animation system that captures live
		  facial expressions from a performance actor, and uses them
		  to animate in real-time a synthetic character. Our approach
		  is based upon a bank of 3D facial expressions of a
		  synthetic model. Critical points on the face model are
		  matched to live markers. A linear combination of the basic
		  expressions obtained by minimizing Euclidean distance
		  between corresponding points and markers is then used to
		  construct the intermediate facial expression. Mapping
		  the motion into a bank of expressions produces subtle
		  motions more dependent on the characteristics of the
		  model itself. This is more difficult to achieve with
		  previous techniques deforming a model without any
		  additional information on how the model should move.
		  Our technique draws mostly on the technical skills of
		  an artist to model facial expressions, and on the skills
		  of a performance actor to bring life to a face, with most
		  animation issues being automated.

		  We also present improvements on the control of markers,
		  on specific details for more delicate control of the
		  eyelids, and on the use of filters applied to the sequence
		  of markers displacements. More flexibility in the bank of
		  expressions is provided by subdividing some of the
		  expressions into independent components, and by
		  controlling accessories such as teeth and the tongue only
		  by means of the reconstructed expression.

		  The resulting system is very flexible, intuitive to use,
		  and the real-time animations provide immediate feedback to
		  express and refine animator and performer skills.",

  abstract =     "We present a visibility algorithm that is based on
                  sampling the scene for visible surfaces.  The subset of
                  lines for which the visibility is pre-calculated is
                  defined by a two-plane parameterization.  Each sample
                  represents the portion of geometry that is visible for
                  the lines through that sample's region.  Lumping
                  geometry together in grid cells allows achieving
                  visibility at a coarser level, and improves the
                  solution.  A rendering algorithm that uses this
                  visibility pre-calculation is presented.  Using this
                  method, most hidden geometry is culled and a speedup in
                  rendering time is obtained.  Some problems remain,
                  however, and are discussed here.  Particularly, some
                  cells are left unrendered because they are missed by
                  the discrete sampling procedure, thus potentially
                  creating holes in surfaces.  Techniques to improve the
                  solution are proposed.  In particular, modifying the
                  pre- and post-filtering algorithms used in
                  creating/resampling the field helps remove some of the
                  artifacts.  Nonetheless, the algorithm remains useful
                  for cases where only coarse visibility is needed.",
