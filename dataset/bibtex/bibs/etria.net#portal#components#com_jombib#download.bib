	abstract = {Cleaner Production is an organized approach to minimize industrial
   waste and emissions by increasing the efficiency of the use of
   materials and energy. It is propagated especially by UNIDO and UNEP as
   an approach to identify preventive measures to cut on waste and
   emissions from industrial activities. Case studies conducted by the
   authors in the last 10 years demonstrate, that in a number of cases
   water consumption per production unit of industries from the surface
   treatment sector, from food processing and from the textile industry
   could be reduced by 30-90\%. auxiliary materials consumption could be
   reduced by 30-50\%, and energy consumption of processes could be
   reduced by 15-25\%. All these measures were actually economically
   beneficial for the companies, most of these measures paid back in less
   than one year {[}1].
   The standard approach to apply Cleaner Production originates from
   chemical engineering. It follows the steps of: Drawing a process flow
   sheet - collecting input/output data - doing mass and energy balances -
   identify sources for waste and emissions - set priorities - identify
   options. In the process of option generation one generally relies on
   expert knowledge or on checklists which are available in different
   manuals or in the best available technology reference (BREF) notes.'
   This approach is strong with teams with an (chemical) engineering
   background.
   The authors wanted to develop a generic approach for option
   identification especially for teams with little formal engineering
   background or teams which have to go beyond their professional
   experience by using elements of the so-called TRIZ method (Theory of
   inventive problem solving, or originally Russian: ``(sic){''} (Teoria
   reschenija isobretatjelskich sadatsch)). TRIZ offers very strong tools
   for developing process improvement options on a generic level without
   specific technological knowledge about the process which shall be
   improved. The authors have found from their research that especially
   the concept of the Ideal Final Result, and the Laws of Evolution form a
   conceptual framework which can aid effectively in the identification of
   improvement options in a systematic way. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

	abstract = {Innovative design in the development of new product and process has
   become the core value in most business establishments. These innovative
   designs are often associated with the long-established trade-off
   compromises or conflicting performance parameters where speed and
   reliability or quality and cost are readily acknowledged. The rate of
   change in technology and the commercial environment suggests that the
   opportunity for innovative design is accelerating and systematic
   support for innovation process is needed. This study combines the
   Russian theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) and the analytical
   hierarchy process (AHP) for designing the automated manufacturing
   systems. This study applied the contradiction matrix table, 40
   innovative principles, and 39 engineering parameters to compromise the
   trade-off between design contradictions and engineering parameters. The
   design engineers can acquire more feasible solutions and inspiration
   through the proposed approach. However, due to vagueness and
   uncertainty in the decision maker's judgment, an AHP is employed as a
   decision support tool that can adequately represent qualitative and
   subjective assessments under the multiple criteria decision making
   environment. Moreover, the proposed approach can help decision makers
   facilitate the selection and evaluation of innovative designs in the
   presence of intangible attributes and uncertainty. In short, the
   objectives of this research are to use TRIZ to propose the automated
   design alternatives under the innovative design consideration and to
   use an AHP to evaluate and select the best feasible alternative under
   multiple criteria. A case study of designing automated connector
   assembly line has been used to demonstrate the applicability of the

	abstract = {Anew category of tools known as CAI(computer-aided innovation) is an
   emerging domain in the array of computer-aided technologies. CAI has
   been growing as a response to greater industry demands for reliability
   in new products. Some initial CAI ideas and concepts focused on
   assisting product designers in the early stage of the design process,
   but now a more comprehensive vision conceives CAI systems as beginning
   at the fuzzy front end of perceiving business opportunities and
   customer demands, then continuing during the creative stage in
   developing inventions and, further on, providing help up to the point
   of turning inventions into successful innovations in the marketplace.
   CAI methods and tools are partially inspired by Innovation Theories,
   such as TRIZ, QFD (Quality Function Development), Axiomatic Design,
   Synectics. General Theory of Innovation, Mind Mapping, Brain Storming,
   Lateral Thinking, and Kansei Engineering, among others. The goal of
   these new CAI tools under development is to assist innovators,
   inventors, designers, process developers and managers in their creative
   performance, with the expectation of changes in paradigms through the
   use of this new category of software tools. CAI, therefore, stands out
   as a departure from the usual trends. The latest approaches are

   together with an introduction to the methodologies from which our
   strategy evolves. It begins with a description of two already popular
   disciplines, which have their roots in computer science and natural
   evolution: evolutionary design (ED) and genetic algorithms (GAs). A
   description of some optimization processes in the field of mechanical
   design is also presented. We explain our approach to multi-objective
   optimization and show how tools like the Pareto diagram can help in
   identifying conflicts. The concepts presented here are exemplified
   through the optimization of a combustion engine crankshaft. The main
   premise of the paper is the possibility to optimize the imbalance of a
   crankshaft using tools developed in this methodology. This study brings
   together techniques that have their origins in the fields of
   optimization and new tools for innovation. We reflect on how computers
   can have an active role in the conceptual design process, and explain
   how TRIZ (Theory of inventive Problem Solving) can enrich the
   discipline of ED. The aim of our research is to extend the search for
   solutions with GAs and present creative, innovative alternatives to the

   product development cycle through the integration of Computer-Aided
   Innovation (CAI) with Optimization and PLM systems. The

   This methodology was developed within the PROSIT project
   (http://www.kaemart.it/prosit).
   The paper describes the main issues related to the integration of these
   complementary instruments and the solutions proposed by the authors.
   More specifically, the main idea of the PROSIT project to link CAI and
   Optimization systems is the adoption of the latter tools not just to
   generate optimized solutions, but also as a design analysis tool,
   capable to outline critical aspects of a mechanical component in terms
   of conflicting design requirements or parameters. CAI systems are then
   applied to overcome the contradictory requirements. The second step,
   i.e. the integration between Optimization and PLM systems, has been
   obtained through the development of Knowledge-Based (KB) tools to
   support designer's activities. More in details, they provide means to
   analyze and extrapolate useful geometrical information from the results
   provided by the optimizer, as well as semi-automatic modelling features
   for some specific geometries. A detailed example related to the design
   of a plastic wheel for light motoscooters clarifies the whole

   fully dependent on the guidance, inspection and help of his superior in

   second half of the 20(th) century systematic design methods have been
   developed, with the aim that even a novice designer will be able to
   devise a novel good product. The methods were developed in two very
   different trends, one in the USSR by G. Altshuller, by the name of TRIZ
   - a Russian acronym for the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving - and
   the other in Germany, by a few contributors and is generally known as
   the Pahl and Beitz method. These two techniques are quite different in
   approach and in details and have been further developed in the recent
   years. The Pahl \& Beitz method has been enhanced by the ICDM tools and
   TRIZ has been further developed into SIT, ASIT and USIT versions. In
   this study, a comparison of all the versions will be made and
   differences and similarities are highlighted. The methods started very
   different, but as the development advanced, now quite a few basics and
   details of both methods, are getting closer to each other. Both ways
   became quite popular, and attracted many followers. This study presents
   a comprehensive comparison of the two routes of methods in solving

	abstract = {What can education do to foster students' inventive design and
   problem-solving competencies? On the one hand, it is widely agreed that
   accomplishing this end is one of education's main objectives today. On
   the other hand, many people regard creativity as a `God-given' ability,
   something an individual either has or does;not have but can hardly be
   learned or enhanced. Therefore, it is of no surprise that only little
   has been done to introduce the teaching of creative thinking into
   traditional schooling, either in K-12 education or in engineering
   education. In the current paper, however, I present a different
   viewpoint.
   The literature on design and problem-solving in engineering shows that
   while novices tend to follow a routine design approach or use the
   trial-and-error method, experts are likely to use domain-specific
   strategies, schemes and heuristics, move flexibly from one working
   method to another, combine given strategies in new ways, and solve
   problems by using shortcuts or rules-of-thumb rather than work
   according to a specific method. Therefore, it could be useful to teach
   students several heuristic methods for inventive design and
   problem-solving that have been used increasingly in engineering, for
   example, SCAMPER, TRIZ, Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) and the
   Eight-Dimensional method. This paper briefly reviews some of these
   methods and addresses the outcomes of several studies about teaching
   the methods to engineers and designers in industry, junior high school
   students, and science and technology teachers. The findings indicate
   that the participants often improved their achievements in suggesting
   original solutions to problems in comparison to a control group, and
   successfully utilized die method they had learned in their final
   project. The implications to engineering education are also discussed.},

   However, this compromise trade-off can not eliminate the contradictions

   integrated with TRIZ (the Russian acronym of the Theory of Inventive
   Problem Solving) becomes hot research recently for TRIZ can be used to

   planning approach is not suitable for QFD integrated with TRIZ for that
   TRIZ requires emphasizing the contradictions between engineering
   characteristics at problem definition stage instead of compromising
   trade-off. So, a new planning approach based on QFD / TRIZ integration
   is proposed in this paper, which based on the consideration of the
   correlation matrix of engineering characteristics and customer
   satisfaction on the basis of cost. The proposed approach suggests that
   TRIZ should be applied to solve contradictions at the first step, and
   the correlation matrix of engineering characteristics should be amended
   at the second step, and at next step IFR (ideal final result) must be
   validated, then planning execute. An example is used to illustrate the
   proposed approach. The application indicated that higher customer
   satisfaction can be met and the contradictions between the
   characteristic parameters are eliminated.},

	abstract = {With the evolutions of the surrounding world market, researchers and
   engineers have to propose technical innovations. Nevertheless, Chemical
   Engineering community demonstrates a small interest for innovation
   compared to other engineering fields. In this paper, an approach to
   accelerate inventive preliminary design for Chemical Engineering is
   presented.
   This approach uses case-based reasoning (CBR) method to model, to
   capture to store and to make available the knowledge deployed during
   design. CBR is a Very interesting method coming from artificial
   intelligence, for routine design. Indeed, in CBR the main assumption is
   that a new problem of design can be solved with the help of past
   successful ones. Consequently the problem solving process is based on
   Past Successful Solutions, therefore, the design is accelerated but
   creativity is limited and not stimulated.
   Our approach is an extension of the CBR method from routine design to
   inventive design. One of the main drawbacks of this method is that it
   is restricted in one particular domain of application. To propose
   inventive solution, the level of abstraction for problem resolution
   must be increased. For this reason CBR is coupled with the TRIZ theory
   (Russian acronym for Theory of Solving Inventive Problem). TRIZ is a
   problem solving method that increases the ability to solve creative
   problems thanks to its capacity to give access to the best practices in
   all the technical domains.
   The proposed synergy between CBR and TRIZ combines the main advantages
   of CBR (ability to store an to reuse rapidly knowledge) and those of
   TRIZ (no trade-off during resolution inventive solutions). Based on
   this synergy, a tool is developed and a mere example is treated. (c)

   high technology development have led to vigorous business competition
   and market uncertainty. In new product design, it is increasingly
   important to put more emphasis on innovative concerns than quality and
   speed of production. Providing unique, innovative and value-added
   products becomes a crucial strategy for success. This study aims to
   develop a new product design process that concentrates on radical
   innovations. Visioning thinking, TRIZ Image Scale, and Morphological
   Analysis are integrated for developing designs with a balance of
   rational/logical analyses and intuitive/creative thinking. The proposed
   process fulfills the need for radical innovation through enriching
   heuristic thinking. It is a useful methodology that adds value to
   products in terms of technological functions, form perceptions, and
   holistic usability. A proposal of therapy bike design for cerebral
   palsy children is demonstrated using the new process. Through case
   demonstration, designers could enhance products with human-centered
   values while coping with market uncertainty effectively. The
   applicability of the vision-oriented approach for innovative product
   design is verified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   family education, a new board game (ANTRI3(R)) was created last year to
   facilitate the learning process and practical use of the ``Theory of
   Inventive Problem Solving{''} (TRIZ). Deliberately kept away from the
   computer screen, this game follows the new wave of revival of social
   gaming. Each set is made for maximum four teams of two to three
   players, and gives them access to the essence of an efficient creative
   problem solving method. Without requiring prior knowledge, it makes
   TRIZ easier to understand and more accessible to users who are eager to
   utilise the benefits of research on millions of patents over a long
   time. A major objective is to enhance company-wide (or even along an
   entire value chain) access and participation to the innovation process,
   making use of all available brainpower of the stakeholders in and
   around a company, thereby breaking out of the engineers' or marketers'
   office. With a proper mindset of a maximal manpower, the throughput
   time of innovation processes in industry can be reduced and produce a
   better output, resulting in better products, less waste and leaner
   processes. The main functionality of the game is to playfully instruct
   people with different backgrounds and experience how they can tackle
   innovation challenges and problem situations by joining thinking
   forces, stimulating combined innovative thinking, using available force
   fields and resources. Due to its modularity the game can be used in
   different ways, and adjusted to the background and experience of a
   variety of players, ranging from company employees, over students, to
   even scholar pupils. It introduces them to a systematic thinking
   process in small groups, by use of a selection from 15 model problems
   picked from daily life. People who have used the game feel better
   prepared to look at situations from a different, but context-relevant
   viewpoint, with the help of their team's own scientific and social
   knowledge.},

   experiences in technology education can contribute to Education for
   Sustainable Development. It appears, however, that in the Technology
   Education classroom little or no change has been achieved to the
   practice of designing and problem solving strategies oriented towards
   sustainable design. Brainstorming, Brainwriting, SCAMPER, Metaphoric
   Thinking, Outrageous Thinking, Mind Mapping and other problem-solving
   strategies used in the classroom could be suitable for eco-design,
   however, there appears to be little research data on their use. This
   paper examines and presents the `Advanced Systematic Inventive
   Thinking' (ASIT) system as an eco-design strategy. ASIT is derived from
   a more complex engineering-based problem solving strategy known as TRIZ
   (the Russian acronym for The Theory of the Solution of Inventive
   Problems). Drawing on Stable's (in press) call for new approaches to
   address sustainable design and achieve solutions through Technology
   Education, this article traces the history of TRIZ and the development
   of ASIT. It then argues that the ASIT strategy can be an effective
   methodology to be taught and used in the Technology Education classroom
   to solve problems in the `eco' or sustainable design context. Several
   design scenarios have been included to illustrate how ASIT can deliver
   eco-design solutions to problems. These examples demonstrate the

	abstract = {Innovative design in the development of new product and process has
   become the core value in most business establishments. These innovative
   designs are often associated with the long-established trade-off
   compromises or conflicting performance parameters where speed and
   reliability, or quality and cost are readily acknowledged. The rate of
   change in technology and the commercial environment suggests that the
   opportunity for innovative design is accelerating, and systematic
   support for innovation process is needed. This study combines the
   Russian Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) and the fuzzy
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for designing the automated
   manufacturing systems. This study applied the contradiction matrix
   table, 40 innovative principles, and 39 engineering parameters to
   compromise the trade-off between design contradictions and engineering
   parameters. The design engineers can acquire more feasible solutions
   and inspiration through the proposed approach. However, due to
   vagueness and uncertainty in the decision-maker's judgment, a fuzzy AHP
   is employed as a decision support tool that can adequately represent
   qualitative and subjective assessments under the multiple criteria
   decision making environment. Moreover, the proposed approach can help
   decision makers facilitate the selection and evaluation of innovative
   designs in the presence of intangible attributes and uncertainty. In
   short, the objectives of this research are to use TRIZ to propose the
   automated design alternatives under the innovative design
   consideration, and to use a fuzzy AHP to evaluate and select the best
   feasible alternative under multiple criteria. A case study of designing
   automated connector assembly line has been used to demonstrate the
   applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

	abstract = {The innovation is nowadays the master word of competitiveness. Inside
   of innovation the design process is the most constitutive. Starting
   from the limits of classical design and user centered design we study
   the needs for the best practices in innovative design. Essentially
   these practices would be based on situated action (the goal of the
   innovation is unknown), multiple actors (including the users of course
   but also the different practitioners in human factors and project
   managers) and evaluation along the life cycle of design. The best way
   to reach these objectives seems to mix and adapt some formalized models
   from the participatory design and creative design as TRIZ. The paper
   describes a management method for the participatory design based on a
   graph organization and UML description. This method is not a task
   planner, what would be not feasible in design domain, but a control in
   the running of work so as to return this phase of the life cycle of a
   product, controllable and effective. The method is based on
   ``moments{''} which are elementary and generic granules of activity;
   valid for all the tasks of user centered design. From these tasks the
   method proposes an evolutionary management formalized by graphs of
   states, the transitions of which are controlled by logical and temporal
   operators under certain conditions. So the actors as the project
   manager can have access to all the documents, the procedures, etc.,
   which they need to work or in collective session or in an individual
   way. The process of capitalization is also integrated into this plan,
   what allows reusing the know-how acquired for the other projects but
   especially to avoid the occasions, the questioning or the rehearsal in
   the design process. The paper concludes on the realization and the
   efficiency of the method, especially in case of breakdown innovation
   but also in dominant design due to the tools developed around the
   method which facilitates the management and the knowledge retrieval.},

   system properties and uses standard principles to remove the
   contradictions of the systems. The ultimate aim of the TRIZ is to reach
   the ideal systems.
   In order to create the matrix-based access system, technical properties
   of a chip removal process were defined. Following this step, technical
   properties are organised in the matrix form and compared with each
   other. Consequently, contradictions that prevent an ideal chip removal
   process have been observed and design recommendations, which can
   eliminate or minimise these contradictions, were placed into the

   However, a creative and systematic way of achieving higher customer

   TRIZ, a Russian acronym which means ``Theory of Inventive Problem

   the correlation between the imprecise requirements from customers and
   the determinants of service quality is analyzed with Fuzzy Quality
   Function Deployment (QFD) in order to identify the critical
   determinants relating to customer satisfaction. After which, the

   shapes that resembled a creative behavior. A description of
   optimization processes based on Genetic Algorithms is presented, and
   some of the genetic operators are explained as a background of the

   Design Optimization Systems is also explained and its use of splined

   niulti-objective optimization with Genetic Algorithms is analyzed from
   the point of view of Pareto diagrams. It is discussed how the
   transition from a multi-objective optimization conflict to a solution
   with the aim of an ideal result can be developed means the help of TRIZ
   (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), complementing the discipline of
   Evolutionary Design. Similarities between Genetic Algorithms and TRIZ
   regarding ideality and evolution are identified and presented. Finally,
   a brief presentation of a case study about the design of engine
   crankshafts is used to explain the concepts and methods deployed. The

   strategies for solving engineering problems. Our aim is to design a
   roof for hot climates that gets free cooling through radiant coupling
   with the sky. The insulalion in a standard roof stops the sun and
   convection from warming the thermal mass. But it also restricts the
   mass's longwave view of the cool sky. Different solutions to this
   conflict are offered by BioTRIZ. The chosen solution is to replace the
   standard insulation component with an open cell honeycomb. The vertical
   cells would allow longwave radiation to pass, while arresting
   convection. The solutions offered by BioTRIZ's technological
   counterpart include no such changes in structure. It is estimated that
   the thermal mass in the biomimetic roof would remain on average 4.5
   degrees C cooler than in a standard roof over a year in Riyadh, Saudi

   makes possible to better and faster adapt to real life practice which
   changes very fast.
   TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a powerful method of
   creative technical thinking which originated by studying patents and by
   generalization of successful process solving. The method TRIZ makes
   possible to find a correct formulation of a task out of unclearly

   advance the integration of PV systems in mass produced products. We
   assume that industrial design engineering (IDE) could play a crucial
   role in making PV technology fit for product applications by its focus
   on functionality and usability. IDE might have an added value to
   existing R\&D of PV technology which emphasizes on increased
   performance and decreased production cost of PV cells and modules.
   Therefore, in this paper, we will assess how industrial design methods
   might favour the development of product-integrated PV applications. In
   our project product designers have conceptually designed 17 products
   with integrated PV cells. The project took place in 2007 at the School
   of Industrial Design Engineering of University of Twente in the
   Netherlands. During the design process several innovative design
   methods were applied, among which the innovation phase model, lead user
   studies, platform driven product development, risk diagnosis,
   technology road mapping, TRIZ, innovative design and styling,
   innovation journey and constructive technology assessment. By observing
   17 PV-powered products which resulted from the project we evaluated the
   innovative effect of industrial design methods on product-integrated PV
   applications. The application of IDMs resulted in a broad range of
   varied innovative PV-powered product concepts ranging from small
   products, like electronic handhelds, to middle-sized products like toys
   and portable fridges, to big-sized objects such as building-integrated
   PV elements and a zeppelin. The results show that the use of carefully
   chosen and applied industrial design methods can help to better
   integrate PV technology in products.},

   in design of process safety management systems with positive effect,
   yet achieving safety objectives sometimes remain a distant target.
   Companies regularly apply tools and methods which have roots in quality
   and productivity improvement. The ``plan, do, check, act{''}
   improvement loop, statistical analysis of incidents (non-conformities),
   and performance trending popularized by Dr. Deming are now commonly
   used in the context of process safety. Significant advancements in HSE
   performance are reported after applying methods viewed as fundamental
   for quality management.
   In pursuit of continual process safety improvement, the paper examines
   various quality improvement methods, and explores how methods intended
   for product quality can be additionally applied to continual
   improvement of process safety. Methods such as Kaizen, Poke yoke, and
   TRIZ, while long established for quality improvement, are quite
   unfamiliar in the process safety arena. These methods are discussed for
   application in improving both process safety leadership and field work
   team performance. Practical ways to advance process safety. based on

   property rights in the form of patents provide a source of
   technological information that can be used by researchers and invertors
   to find new solutions to technical problems. Theory of Inventive
   Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a systematic approach that developed on the
   basis of patent information currently being applied internationally to
   find innovative solutions for technical problems. The patterns and
   lines of technology evolution that summarized from patent analysis of
   TRIZ are applied to identify evolutionary potential (EP) of a technical
   system and help decision-makers to make strategic decisions for product
   development. A searching method for EP is put forward and the method to
   construct the plot structure of EP is introduced. A sequential process
   of evolutionary potential mapping of product based on patent analysis
   is then formed. As an illustration, a butterfly valve case study shows
   the application of the process.},

   Central to the notion of situated design is the notion of design

   systems (CAIs) are applied in the design, the environment and the
   situation are different from the traditional design process and
   environment. The basic principles of some CAIs in the world market are
   directly related to theory of inventive, problem solving (TRIZ).
   Special TRIZ solutions, such as 40 inventive principles and the related
   cases, are medium-solutions to domain problems. The second stage
   analogy process is used to generate domain solutions and in this
   process the TRIZ solutions are used as source designs of analogy-based
   process. Unexpected discoveries (UXDs) are the key factors to trigger
   designers to generate new ideas for domain solutions. The type of UXDs

   proposes a general design methodology to effectively support

   employs three tools: LCA ( life cycle assessment), QFDE ( quality
   function deployment for environment), and TRIZ ( theory of inventive
   problem solving). QFDE is a tool developed by modifying and extending
   QFD, and is extended further in this paper. In addition, connecting two
   consecutive tools is realized by established relations among those
   tools. The presented methodology is proved through application to a
   hair dryer to effectively support the product planning and conceptual
   design stages. For instance, designers could utilize one of the LCA
   results that the product has a high impact on global warming through
   energy consumption during its use phase to define a requirement
   objectively in QFDE, `reduce the energy consumption' with a high
   weighting. TRIZ allowed designers to generate four improvement
   solutions. The most highly evaluated was using resonance frequency on
   the motor. This was obtained from a QFDE result that `dry quickly' and
   `dry quietly' have a contradiction. The methodology has a larger
   benefit than is obtained from utilizing those three tools independently.},

   process because its outputs, i.e., concepts, will directly determine

   would be greatly beneficial if there was a tool to help the creative
   thinking process such that designers could represent, manipulate,

   Mind-mapping, a method frequently used in corporations, presents the

   documenting, planning, and organizing thinking processes; proper
   guidance to create new ideas is limited. This paper presents the
   concept of incorporating semantics into a mind map. By considering
   different creative thinking methods such as the brainstorming,
   historical examination, TRIZ method, and etc., we explored the
   applications of these semantics to guide the growth of a mind map, and
   built a software system that can help users easily create new ideas and
   re-use existing knowledge in creative conceptual design. Several design
   examples are illustrated in detail in this paper to show the

   crystals. The primary fluid inclusions analysed in the amethyst
   crystals yield a 152 to 238 degrees C crystallization temperature
   range. The amethyst geodes are always located in the massive,
   fracture-free, basaltic part of the lava flows and surrounded by a
   limited wall-lining alteration halo, the thickness of which depends on
   the geode radius. The geochemical balances calculated from fresh to
   altered basalt in the geode environment indicate that the amount Of
   SiO2 released from the alteration halo is always sufficient to produce
   the siliceous rims in the geodes without requirement for extraneous
   silica supply. The results point to a volcanic origin for the amethyst
   geode infillings through basalt `autoalteration' by authigenic high
   temperature hydrothermal fluids. These fluids can originate from (1)
   unmixing of volatile coumpounds from melt through pressure release, (2)
   cooling to supercritical hydrous fluids with `autoalteration' of the
   surrounding basalt and (3) migration of the residual hot fluids from
   the basalt to the geodic cavities through the pressure gradient between
   the geodic cavity and the rock.},

   the integration between QFD and TRIZ is realized. After conducting
   quality function development two outputs can be obtained. They are the

   technology. TRIZ also suggests that biological design is autonomous and

   autonomy extends to the control system, so that the sensor is commonly

   inspiration sources are identified and briefly described, including
   evolutionary computation, coevolutionary computation, cellular
   automata, and TRIZ. In particular, design generation mechanisms based
   on cellular automata are introduced with some details. They are
   inspired by the processes of morphogenesis occurring in nature and have
   great potential to generate novel designs. In this case, the design
   generation mechanisms are encoded in the so-called generative
   representations, which are also described.
   Three major design objectives are introduced and discussed, namely
   optimality, creativity, and robustness. They are related to the sources
   of inspiration and the corresponding computational mechanisms inspired
   by nature. Also, three levels of integration of computational
   mechanisms inspired by nature are proposed and their relationship to
   design objectives is discussed. Finally, a general design situation,
   when inspiration by nature is considered, is introduced and its unified
   description is proposed as the first step in the direction of building
   a unified approach to structural design inspired by nature. The paper

   encouraging sustainable development are two of the main future goals of
   the EU (see Lisbon goals, European Council 2000). Also in Austria there
   are several initiatives from local and the federal government to foster
   these two issues (among other things - Funding Programmes ``Plant of
   the Future ``, ``Protec 2002+ ``, ``Technofit'). In the last three
   years the University of Leoben, Austria, was engaged in several
   projects both on the European and the regional level to encourage
   companies to learn and practice innovation - and creativity-fools in
   order to strengthen their creativity potential.
   The idea of this paper is to give an over view about these projects and
   of the core methodology, which plays a central part in all of this
   projects - TRIZ (The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving).

   for customised products or services be fulfilled under zero customer
   lead time and at a price near the price of mass production. By means of
   the manufacturing paradigm innovation model (MPIM), the operational
   tactics, operational tenets, and an operational framework of instant

   within all the operational tactics is finalise-to-individual demand
   forecasting, meaning end products are finalised according to the
   forecasting of individual customer's needs. The knowledge and
   information, which is the primary input of individual demand
   forecasting, is gleaned and understood by total customer participation
   and value fusion. Total customer participation and value fusion are
   developed through customer participation and customer relationship
   management, which have critical distinctions. The operational
   framework, which is termed manufacturing paradigm tree of instant
   customerisation, can characterise the operational tenets, the
   relationships between different operational tactics and the objectives,
   and the relationships among different operational tactics. With the
   proposed framework, instant customerisation can be understood more
   effectively and holistically.},

   Although many manufacturing paradigms have been developed since 1970,
   there is no innovation process model for manufacturing paradigms. In
   order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developing a new
   manufacturing paradigm, this paper proposes the Manufacturing Paradigm
   Innovation Model ( MPIM), which is composed of the Manufacturing
   Paradigm Tree ( MPT), Innovation Sources for manufacturing paradigms,
   and the Manufacturing Paradigm Innovation Process Model ( MPIPM). MPT
   can depict the relationships among the objectives and the practices of
   a manufacturing paradigm. With MPT, the manufacturing paradigm can be
   understood more effectively and holistically. MPT can help assess the
   maturity of a manufacturing paradigm and help identify a new
   manufacturing paradigm. The Innovation Sources can direct innovators to
   seek new practices when developing the new manufacturing paradigm.
   MPIPM consists of eight stages to develop the new manufacturing
   paradigm. MPIPM can be illustrated by examining the history of Toyota
   Motor Corporation between 1948 and 1963 when lean production was
   pioneered.},

   problems. Recently Mann recognized that the contradiction

   leading to new contradictions in an endless chain. Diverse authors have
   been analyzing the role of contradiction in product development and
   innovation. In this paper, a product development approach is presented
   where product performance enhancement is first achieved through
   quantitative changes in parametric design (optimization) and later
   through paradigm shift (innovation). The approach is based on the
   concept of changing the design scenario to ``eliminate{''} technical or
   physical contradictions, which avoid achieving higher performance
   goals. Based on these results, product innovation is presented as
   ``optimization{''} not restricted to parametric variation but extended
   to ``concept variation.{''} The role of ``concept variation{''} in
   product innovation and its similarity and relationships to parametric
   optimization is analyzed in this paper, based on identifying

   eliminating ``hitching{''} and ``ringing{''} in a diesel engine
   powertrain. Slow- and high-amplitude oscillation of the entire vehicle
   powertrain under steady pedal position at idle is called ``ringing,{''}
   and similar behavior under cruise-control conditions is called
   ``hitching.{''} The intermittent nature of these conditions posed a
   particular challenge in arriving at proper design alternatives.
   Zero-point-proportional dynamic S/N ratio was used to quantify
   vibration and tracking accuracy under six driving conditions, which
   represented noise factors. An L18 orthogonal array explored
   combinations of six software strategy control factors associated with
   controlling fuel delivery to the engine. The result was between 4 and
   10 dB improvement in vibration reduction, resulting in virtual
   elimination of the hitching condition. As a result of this effort, a 12
   Repair/1000 vehicle reliability (eight million dollar warranty) problem
   was eliminated.
   The Robust Design methodology developed in this application may be used
   for a variety of applications to optimize similar feedback control
   strategies.},

   lately gained popularity due to the need for a science-based design
   methodology. Interestingly, many concepts of the two design theories
   seem to be in coincidence, even though they have been developed quite
   independently for a long time. In this paper, several concepts of TRIZ
   are reviewed from the standpoint of Axiomatic Design. The concept of

   elimination of trade-offs can support the agile paradigm. Whereas
   `agility' is often seen as a trade-off free destination, both TOC and
   TRIZ may be considered to be route finders, as they comprise
   methodologies that focus on the identification and elimination of the
   trade-offs that constrain the purposeful improvement of a system, be it
   organisational or mechanical. This paper will also show how the TOC
   thinking process may be combined with the TRIZ knowledge based approach
   and used in breaking contradictions within agile logistics.},

   predict - i.e., to calculate probabilistically - the outcomes of each

   the information and evidence relevant to those outcomes. Risk analysis
   may thus be considered the ``information-gathering'' option, or the
   ``inner loop{''} of a decision analysis. The Russian theory TRIZ can be
   thought of as an ``option-generating'' or ``outer loop{''} of a
   decision process. In this sense, TRIZ completes the decision theory
   model in an important way. We note that just one good idea in the outer

	abstract = {Product development deals with the interface between the customer and
   the design concept, i.e. the translation from ``what should be done{''}
   to ``how to accomplish such wants{''} through engineering solutions.
   Finding these solutions can be a difficult task with enormous
   consequences. Poor design decisions in this interface can rarely be
   recouped by subsequent development efforts. The development of
   principle-based approaches, such as Axiomatic Design and TRIZ, to guide
   better decisions in mapping one design domain to another, have
   tremendous implications in the evolution of engineering quality
   products with unprecedented customer satisfaction.},
