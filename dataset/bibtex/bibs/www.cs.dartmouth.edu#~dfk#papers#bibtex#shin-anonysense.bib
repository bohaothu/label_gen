    abstract = {We describe AnonySense, a privacy-aware system for realizing
pervasive applications based on collaborative, opportunistic sensing by
personal mobile devices. AnonySense allows applications to submit sensing
\emph{tasks\/} to be distributed across participating mobile devices, later
receiving verified, yet anonymized, sensor data \emph{reports\/} back from
the field, thus providing the first secure implementation of this
participatory sensing model. We describe our security goals, threat model,
and the architecture and protocols of AnonySense. We also describe how
AnonySense can support extended security features that can be useful for
different applications. We evaluate the security and feasibility of
AnonySense through security analysis and prototype implementation. We show
the feasibility of our approach through two plausible applications: a Wi-Fi
rogue access point detector and a lost-object finder.}
