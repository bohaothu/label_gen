	abstract = {In order to be able to explicitly reason about beliefs, we've introduced a non-monotonic formalism, called Autoepistemic Logic of Beliefs, AEB, obtained by augmenting classical propositional logic with a belief operator B. For this language we've defined the static autoepistemic expansions semantics. The resulting non-monotonic knowledge representation framework turned out to be rather simple and yet quite powerful. Moreover, it has some very natural properties which sharply contrast with those of Moore's AEL.

While static expansions seem to provide a natural and intuitive semantics for many belief theories, and, in particular, for all affirmative belief theories (which include the class of all normal and disjunctive logic programs), they often can lead to inconsistent expansions for theories in which (subjective) beliefs clash with the known (objective) information or with some other beliefs. In particular, this applies to belief theories (and to logic programs) with strong or explicit negation. 

In this paper we generalize AEB to avoid the acceptance of inconsistency provoking beliefs. We show how such AEB theories can be revised to prevent belief originated inconsistencies, and also to introduce declarative language level control over the revision level of beliefs, and apply it to the domains of diagnosis and declarative debugging. The generality of our AEB framework can capture and justify the methods that have been deployed to solve similar revision problems within the logic programming paradigm.}

This makes iterated revision possible and makes explicit the connection between iterated belief change and teh axiom of recovery. We provide a presentation theorem that connects the semantic conditions we impose on interated revision and the additional syntactical properties mentioned. We also show interesting similarities between our framework and that of Darwiche-Pearl.

It also shows that a simple modification to the AGM framework can allow belief revision to be a function of epistemic states.

The resulting approach is interesting for several reasons. It allows prior contraction steps to be recorded in a meaningful manner and brought to bear in deciding the outcome of subsequent belief change steps. An agent is not forced to discard descredited beliefs; these are retained as defaults in anticipation of future re-use as a full fledged belief. Other benefits, such as those of lazy evaluation and deferred commitment also accrue. The paper uses the THEORIST system as the underlying default reasoning formalism. Non-prioritized belief change operators for revision and contraction are defined and axiomatic characterizations of these operators are provided}

 process, and ignore several problems that become important when a

 paper identifies these problems and argues for the need to retain
 all of the multiple possible outcomes of a belief change step,
 and for a framework in which the effects of a belief change step
 persist as long as is consistently possible. To demostrate that
 such formalisation is indeed possible, we develop a framework
 which uses the language of PJ-default logic to represent a belief
 state, and which enables the effects of a belief change step to
 presist by propagating belief constrains. Belief change in this
 framework maps one belief state to another, where each belief
 state is a collection of theories given by the set of extensions
 of the PJ-default theory representing that belief state. Belief
 constrains do not need to be separately recorded; they are
 encoded as clearly identifiable components of a PJ-default
 theory. The framework meets the requirements for iterated belief
 change that we identify and satisfies most of the AGM postulates
 as well.}

In this paper, we build on earlier work by Rao aimed at narrowing this gap, by developing a strongly-typed, formal, yet computational model of the BDI-based AgentSpeak(L) language. AgentSpeak(L) is a programming language, based on the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) and the Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System (dMARS), which determines the behaviour of the agents it implements. In developing the model, we add to Rao's work, identify some omissions, and progress beyond the description of a particular language by giving a formal specification of a general BDI architecture that can be used as the basis for profiding further formal specifications of more sophisticated systems.}

We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Shoham. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The preferential models proposed here are much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper.}

Next, the theory is applied to give a semantic reconstruction of a default logic theory of speech atcs proposed by Perrault. This reconstruction characterizes the way the speech act transforms an only knowing representation of the agent's belief states. The results are shown to differ from those obtained by Perrault.

A novel feature of this approach is the introduction of disbeliefs alongside beliefs which allows for a view of belief contraction as independently useful, instead of just being seen as an intermediate step in the process of belief revision. THe Ghose-Goebel approach is, however, restrictive in assuming a linear ordering of realibility on the received inputs. This paper extends the Ghose-Goebel framework by replacing the linear ordering with a preference ranking on inputs from which a total preorder on inputs can be induced. This extension brings along with it the problem of dealing with inputs of equal rank, a situation that cannot occur in the Ghose-Goebel setup.

	abstract = {One of the most important and difficult problems in logic programming is the problem of finding a suitable declarative or intended semantics for logic programs. The importance of this problem stems from the declarative character of logic programming, whereas its difficulty can be largely attributed to the non-monotonic character of the negation operator used in logic programs. The problem can therefore be viewed as the problem of finding a suitable formalization of the type of non-monotonic reasoning used in logic programming.
In this paper, Teodor introduces a semantics of logic programs based on the class PERF(P) of all, not necessarily Herbrand, perfect models of a program P and he shows that the proposed semantics is not only natural but it also combines many of desirable features of previous approaches, at the same time eliminating some of their drawbacks. For a positive program P, the class PERF(P) of perfect models coincides with the class MIN(P) or minimal models of P.
The perfect model semantics is shown to be equivalent to the semantics of McCarthy's Circumscription and is also equivalent to the remaining three major formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning in artificial intelligence - Reiter's closed world assumption, Moore's autoepistemic logic and Reiter's default theory - thus establishing a closer link between the areas of logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning.
He also defines a generalization of SLD-resolution, called SLS-resolution and he proves that SLS-resolution is sound and complete with respect the the perfect model semantics}

This allows different types of rational agents to be modeled by imposing certain conditions on the persistence of an agent's beliefs, goals, and intentions.

	abstract = {This paper introduce a new operator - belief fusion - which is a generalisation of the classical AGM revision operator to the multi-agent case. In the process, pedigreed belief states are defined, which enrich standard belief states with the sources of each piece of information. It shows that AGM revision can be derived from belief fusion. It then notes that the fusion operator defines a semi-lattice, and in particular in idempotent, associative, and communicative. As one consequence, we illustrate how belief fusion can be iterated without difficulty, in constrast to belief revision whose iteration has proved challenging. Finally, belief diffusion is defined; whereas fusion procudes a belief state with more information than is possessed by either of its two arguments, diffusion produces a state with less information. Fusion and diffusion are symmetric operators, and together define a distributive lattice.}

	address = {ACM Press, New York, USA},
	abstract = {The paper provides a model for iterated belief change in multi-agent systems. The formal tool we use for this is a combination of modal and dynamic logic. Two core notions in that model are the expansion of the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, and the processing of new information. An expansion has been defined as the change in the knowledge and beliefs of an agent when it decides to believe an incoming formula while holding on to its current propositional beliefs. To prevent agents from forming inconsistent beliefs they do not expand with every piece of information they receive. Instead, agents remember their origial beliefs and every piece of information they receive. After every receipt of information they decide which (consistent) subset of the received information should be incorporated into their original beliefs. This procedure is called the processing of new information . This paper shows that its model of belief update behaves in an intuitive way and that it is not sensitive to criticism on comparable models.}

	title = {Speculative Computation with Multi-Agent Belief Revision},
	address = {Italia},
	abstract = {In multi-agent system, we often face incompleteness of information due to communication failure or other agent's suspension of decisions. To solve the incompleteness, we previously proposed speculative computation using abduction in the context of matter-slave multi-agent systems and gave a procesure in abductive logic programming. In the work, a master agent prepares a default value for a question in advance and it performs speculative compuation using the default without waiting for a reply for the question. This computation is effective unless the contradictory reply with the default is returned. However, we find that this mechanism is not sufficient for speculative computation in more general multi-agent systems such that replies can be revised according to other agents' speculative computation. In this paper, we formalize speculative computation with multi-agent belief revision and propose a correct procedure for such computation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we elaborate on our earlier work on modelling the mental states of PRS-like agents by considering the logical properties of intentions and various rationality postulates for PRS-like agents that are a consequence of this modelling, in particular Bratman's asymmetry transference principles. We show that PRS-like agents do enjoy many of the accepted logical properties of intention and rationality postulates as automatic consequences of our approach, though, as we have argued before, PRS-like agents do not have intentions in the sense required by Bratman's theory.}

	abstract = {The book introduces a BDI logic called LORA (logic of rational agents). In addition to the BDI componenet, LORA contains a temporal component, which allows one to represent the dynamics of how agents and theirs environments change over time, and an action componenent, which allows one to represent the actions that agents perform and effects of the actions. The book shows how LORA can be used to capture many components of a theory of rational agency, including such notions as communication and cooperation.},
