Regularization is an essential technique to improve generalization of neural
networks. This paper addresses the neural network regularization problem from
a multi-objective optimization point of view. The dynamic weighted aggregation
(DWA) method and the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)
are used and compared to optimize the structure and parameters of the neural
network. Instead of a single network, a number of neural networks with a
spectrum of model complexity can be obtained in asingle run.

As a natural by-product of the multi-objective optimization approach to
neural network regularization,neural network ensembles can be easily constructed
using the obtained networks with different levels of model complexity.

When dealing with MO of the tyre-suspension system of a racing car, a
large number of design variables and objectives have to be taken into
account. Two models have been used, both validated on data coming from
an instrumented car, a diff. equation based model and a NN model.  Up to
23 objfs have been defined, at least 14 of which showing reciprocal
strict clash. A fuzzy definition of optima, being a generalization of
Pareto- optimality, is applied to the problem.  The result is that
subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions (a big portion of the entire search
space) can be properly selected provided simple inputs from the
designer. The obtained optimal solutions are compared with the reference
vehicle and with the optima previously obtained.

This study addresses the optimization mechanical components during the first
stage of the design process. While a previous work focused on parameterized
designs with fixed configurations (which led to the development of the PAMUC
method for solving multicriteria constrained problems within EAs), the models
analyzed here are enriched by the presence of topological variables.
Therefore, in order to create realistic designs, fulfilling not only technical
requirements but also technological constraints expressed as rules, an
original approach is proposed: PAMUC II. It consists in integrating an
inference engine within the EA, and repairing the individuals violating the
rules. PAMUC II is illustrated on a mechanical benchmark and a poppet valve.

Simulated annealing (SA) is a provably convergent optimiser for
single-objective (SO) problems. Previously proposed MO extensions have mostly
taken the form of an SO SA optimising a composite function of the objectives.
We propose an MO SA utilising the relative dominance of a solution as the
system energy for optimisation, eliminating problems associated with composite
objective functions.  We also propose a method for choosing perturbation
scalings promoting search both towards and across the Pareto front.

We illustrate the SA's performance on standard test problems. The new SA is
shown to promote rapid convergence to the true Pareto front with a good
coverage of points across it.

evolutionary gradient search framework. Performance laws are derived that shed

Boltzmann selection is an important selection mechanism in evolutionary

analysis. In this paper we propose an annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection
 scheme based on a hypothesis that selection pressure should increase as
evolutionary process goes on and distance between two selection intensities
should  decrease for the process to converge. To formalize these aspects, we
develop formalism for selection mechanisms and we derive an annealing schedule
called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate the novelty of proposed

search heuristic is hybridized with a genetic algorithm and then the Hybrid K-

Program Bloat - the phenomenon of ever-increasing program size during a GP run -

their reliance on parameters whose optimal values it is difficult to a priori
determine. In this paper we introduce POPE-GP, a system that makes use of the
NSGA-II multiobjective evolutionary algorithm as an alternative, parameter-free
technique for eliminating program bloat. We test it on a classification problem
and find that while vastly reducing program size, it does improve

limited number of available data the inferring problem is under-determined and
ambiguous. Further on, the problem often is multi-modal and therefore
appropriate optimization strategies become necessary. In this paper we propose
a new method, which evolves the topology as well as the parameters of the
mathematical model to find the correct network. This method is compared to
standard algorithms found in the literature.

This paper concerns the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for supervised
classification of transcriptome (gene expression) data.  In such applications
GP can produce accurate predictive models that generalize well and use only
very few gene expression values. It is often suggested that the selected genes
are therefore of biological significance in discriminating the classes.  The
paper presents a preliminary study of successful parsimonious GP models to
investigate the extent to which the selected variables contribute to the
classification. The work is based on a readily available and well studied
dataset that represents gene expression values for two groups of patients with
different forms of Leukaemia.

In recent years, several biclustering methods have been suggested to identify
local patterns in gene expression data. Most of these algorithms represent
greedy strategies that are heuristic in nature: an approximate solution is
found within reasonable time bounds. This paper addresses the question whether
additional run-time resources can be exploited in order to improve the outcome
of the greedy algorithms. To this end, we propose a general framework that
embeds such biclustering methods as local search procedures in an evolutionary
algorithm. We demonstrate on one prominent example that this approach achieves
significant improvements in the quality of the biclusters when compared to the
application of the greedy strategy alone.

identity of the nearest fixed point and the distance to that point. In
practice, distributions of test functions are not block uniform, and
conservation properties hold to a degree that depends upon distance to the

This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm for parameter estimation - a
population- based, stochastic, particle swarm optimizer to identify promising
regions of search space that are further locally explored by a
Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer. This hybrid method is able to find global
optimum for six benchmark problems. It is sensitive to the swarm topology
which defines information transfer between particles; however, the hypothesis
[1] that a star topology is better for finding the optimum for problems with
large number of optima is not supported by this study. It is also seen that in
the absence of the local optimizer, particle swarm alone is not as effective.

Particle Swarm Optimizer is a novel algorithm where a population of candidate

topological neighbors.The standard Particle Swarm Optimizer may prematurely
converge on suboptimal solutions that are not even guaranteed to be local
extrema. A new particle swarm optimizer, called stochastic PSO, which is
combined with Tabu technique, is presented based on the analysis of the
standard PSO. And the global convergence analysis is made using the F.Solis

that SPSO is more efficient than the standard PSO.

The popularity of search heuristics, has lead to numerous new approaches in
the last two decades. Since algorithm performance is problem dependent and
parameter sensitive, it is difficult to consider any single approach as of
greatest utility over all problems. Despite this, differential evolution (DE)
is a numerical optimization approach that requires hardly any parameter tuning
and is very efficient and robust on both benchmark and real-world problems.
However, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that standard methods
of evolutionary optimization are able to outperform DE on noisy problems when
the fitness of candidate solutions approaches the fitness variance caused by
the noise.

In Evolutionary Computation, fixed genetic operators may destroy the
sub-solution, usually called building blocks, instead of discovering and
preserving them. One way to overcome this problem is to build a model based on
the good individuals, and sample this model to obtain the next population. In
this paper, along this line, we propose a new method, Grammar Model-based
Program Evolution (GMPE) to evolved GP program. We replace common GP genetic
operator with a Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (SCFG). In each generation,
an SCFG is learnt, and a new population is generated by sampling this SCFG
model. On two benchmark problems we have studied, GMPE significantly
outperforms conventional GP, learning faster and more reliably.

positive rates are two necessary features of succssful AIS. Strong detectors
are the basis of creating a successful AIS. Some preliminary experiments
showed its promise to encode detectors in the form of data triples. Currently,
ther are two types of detectors: binary-coded and constraint-based. This paper
compares the two types of detectors using simulated network traffic data. The
result showed that the constraint-based had better performance than binary-
coded detectors.

A novel autonomous agent response learning (AARL) algorithm is presented in
this paper. We proposed to decompose the award function into a set of local
award functions. By optimizing this objective function set, the response
function with maximum award can be determined. To tackle the optimization
problem, a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) called "Multi-Species
PSO (MS-PSO)" is introduced by considering each objective function as a specie
swarm. Two sets of experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of
MS-PSO. The results show that it returns a more accurate response set within

In this paper a novel concurrent PSO algorithm is proposed to alleviate

algorithm in which modified PSO and FDR-PSO algorithms are simulated
concurrently with frequent message passing between them. This algorithm
reduces computation time of FDR-PSO algorithm by improving search efficiency.
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
experiments were conducted on six benchmark continuous optimization problems.
Results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm
in terms of solution quality, average computation time and consistency. This

contains a direction indicator. Maps are evolved using a simple genetic

might not be able to sufficiently optimize simple, continuous, unimodal
objective functions. Keeping in mind the evolutionary algorithms' high
performance especially in the field of global function optimization, getting
stuck (also known as premature convergence) at suboptimal function values is
mostly attributed to the presence of millions of distracting local optima.
This paper describes some examples in which such a behavior occurs. It also
gives some explanations of the underlying reasons. These explanations
indicate, as a conclusion, that premature convergence might happen very well
at continuous, unimodal functions (and thus real-world applications).

We proposed a new search heuristic using the scuba diving metaphor. This
approach is based on the concept of evolvability and tends to exploit
neutrality in fitness landscape. Despite the fact that natural evolution does
not directly select for evolvability, the basic idea behind the Scuba Search
heuristic is to explicitly push evolvability to increases. Globally the search
process switches between two phases: Conquest-of-the-Waters and
Invasion-of-the- Land. A comparative study of the new algorithm and standard
local search heuristics on the NKq-landscapes has shown advantage and limit of
the scuba search. The qualitative differences between neutral search processes
are also analyzed.

This paper introduces the application of particle swarm optimization
techniques to infinite impulse response (IIR) adaptive filter structures.
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is similar to the genetic algorithm (GA) in
that it performs a structured randomized search of an unknown parameter space
by manipulating a population of parameter estimates to converge on a suitable
solution.  Both techniques are independent of the adaptive filter structure
and are capable of converging on the global solution for multimodal
optimization problems, which makes them especially useful for optimizing IIR
and nonlinear adaptive filters.  This paper outlines PSO and provides a
comparison to the GA for IIR filter structures.

mechanisms rely fundamentally on the same principle--the positive assortment
of helping behaviors. We discuss barriers to this unified view, including
phenotype/genotype differences and non-additive fitness (or utility) functions
that are typical of reciprocal altruism models. We then demonstrate how

This paper presents an Immune Algorithm (IA) based on Clonal Selection
Principle using a new mutation operator, the hypermacromutation, and an aging
process to tackle the protein structure prediction problem (PSP) in the 2D HP
model. The IA presented has only three parameters. To correctly set these
parameters we compute the parameter surfaces, the 3D plots of IA success rate
in function of the cloning paramater and the maximum age allowed to each B
cell.  The parameter surfaces show that hypermacromutation and aging operators
are key features for generating diversity and searching more properly the
funnel landscape of the PSP. Experiments show that the IA we propose is very
competitive with the state-of-art algorithms for the PSP.

Given the large number of possible fault scenarios, complex control systems
are usually impossible to test exhaustively. One promising approach, however,
is evolutionary testing (ET) in which a genetic algorithm (GA) evolves
critical test situations. We evolved challenges (pipe rupture and water
demand) to the valve and pump controls of a shipboard firemain system. ET
found minor events that collectively produced significant systen failure, and
also identified a modification to the ship design that improved system
performance. ET can also be used to map the boundary of search space for a
given, user-defined criterion. The potential of this powerful, generic
technique not just for testing but also for system redesign is thus
emphasized.

valuable in an EDA context because the objective function is by definition

used to evolve the "true" metric of attribute space. The goal here is to
evolve the attribute space distance function until "interesting" features of
the data are revealed when a clustering algorithm is applied.   In a second

The fitness function is defined assuming that the image intensity is piecewise

In recent years, neutrality has been recognized as an important feature of a
fitness landscape for genetic search. The concept of neutrality originates
from Kimura's neutral theory. Thus, it can be expected that the dynamics of
artificial evolution in the landscapes including neutrality would be described
by using techniques in population genetics. In this work, computer simulations
are conducted by using a standard genetic algorithm in order to investigate
the characteristics of the Nei's standard genetic distance systematically. By
the results of the computer simulations, the consistencies with Kimura's
neutral theory and Ohta's nearly neutral theory are confirmed in artificial
evolution through the Nei's genetic distance.

analyzed by characterizing the attractor and stationary measure of the

Different means of control have been investigated for unmanned vehicles with
various algorithms like genetic algorithms, evolutionary computations, neural
networks etc. This paper presents the application of Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for collective robotic search. The performance of the PSO
algorithm depends on various parameters called quality factors and these
parameters are determined using a secondary PSO. Results are presented to show
that the performance of PSO algorithm and search is improved for a single and
multiple target searches.

This paper presents a simple mechanism to handle constraints with a particle
swarm optimization algorithm. Our proposal uses a simple criterion based on
closeness of a particle to the feasible region in order to select a leader.
Additionally, our algorithm incorporates a turbulence operator that improves
the exploratory capabilities of our particle swarm optimization algorithm.
Despite its relative simplicity, our comparison of results indicates that the

Covering the whole set of Pareto-optimal solutions is a desired task of
multi-objective optimization methods. Because in general it is not possible to
determine this set, a restricted amount of solutions are typically delivered
in the output to decision makers. In this paper, we propose a new method using
multi-objective particle swarm optimization to cover the Pareto-optimal front.
The method works in two phases. In phase 1 the goal is to obtain a good
approximation of the Pareto-front. In a second run subswarms are generated to
cover the Pareto-front. The method is evaluated using different test functions
and compared with an existing covering method using a real world example in
antenna design.

Blackjack affords the player an opportunity to have an advantage over the

break-even wager. When also taking the distribution of cards played in prior

developed by examining different situations in the game and computing the
optimum play for each setting. However, the decisions made at one setting
affect the probabilities of being in other settings during the course of play.
Simulation provides the basis for optimizing blackjack strategies as a whole,
as opposed to in a piecemeal fashion. This paper reports on experiments

late arrival at the customer is allowed by adding a penalty into the objective
value. The service vehicle returns to the depot whenever its capacity is
exceeded, and resumes its collections along the planned route. A mathematical
model is developed to describe the behavior of the delivery system. The
techniques of genetic algorithms are used to solve this intractable routing
problem in order to minimum the total cost. Computational examples are

specialized operators to adapt traditional genetic algorithms. Although some
of these operators are useful, they are ad hoc. In this paper, we propose a
priority-based encoding scheme instead. We assign priorities to all the edges
and then perform a greedy algorithm to find a suboptimal solution. The greedy
algorithm constructs a legal tour and the priority encoding makes it possible
to follow traditional genetic evolution. This approach retains generality in

[2] that the quality of the new edges should be high. The validity of these
criteria is demonstrated by comparing several crossovers. Experimental results
indicate that the performances of GAs using some previously proposed
crossovers can be explained by considering these criteria. Furthermore,
experiments with a new crossover designed by modifying a simple crossover
called EX in accordance with these criteria demonstrate that the performance

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have long been applied to tackling scheduling
problems, particularly Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), with varying degrees of
success. However despite advances in GA theory, GAs remain a computationally
expensive method of approaching scheduling problems. In particular for
practical scheduling problems, GAs require extensive resources. We propose a
grid based high-throughput computing framework that utilises spare computing
capacity, which is distributed across a network, to address real scheduling
problems. We use web-services as a gateway to this high-throughput computing

determine the settings itself by using self-adaptive techniques. This paper

selecting the most promising individuals. The model assistance on the

competitively against plants that were never a part of their environment.
Statistical tests show that populations of plants that have evolved for a

and statistically significant.  Analysis suggests that disruptive crossover
has a key effect.  In the presence of disruptive crossover, coevolution may
need to be modified to be effective.  The key method of dealing with
disruptive crossover is tracking the age of the Tartarus agents.  Using only
older agents to drive coevolution of test cases substantially enhances the

accurate classification technique would yield large benefits by permitting a
researcher to rationally chose algorithm and parameter setting based on past
experience.  This study uses a standard taxonomic technique, hierarchical
clustering, on a set of taxonomic characters derived from a comparative study
using graph based evolutionary algorithms.

This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm that adjusts the genetic

a randomized version of a learning rule mechanism for updating them. Given an
individual, one operator is selected according to the encoded rates and

updated according to the performance reached by the offspring (relative to its

The paper presents an evolutionary approach for generating fuzzy rule based

problems following a fuzzy round robin class binarization scheme; next, a
fuzzy rule is evolved (not only the condition but the fuzzy sets are evolved
(tuned) too) for each two-class problem using a Michigan iterative learning

binarization scheme. In particular, heaps encoding scheme is used for evolving
the fuzzy rules along with a set of special genetic operators (variable length

Niching techniques diversify the population of Evolutionary Algorithms,

selection strategy to cooperate across the kinship network. As agents have
more opportunities to exchange resources they produced more complex networks,
larger populations, and more resilient systems. Positive experiences were
collected within the CA to influence individual strategies. Agent memory
recalled the positive cooperating kin and a global memory was maintained to

stochastically, based on these pheromone tables. The pheromone tables are

An ad-hoc network is built, operated and maintained exclusively through the

participate in the route discovery process only to sabotage the network. In
this paper we present a novel and pragmatic mechanism for establishing trust
in ad-hoc networks using swarm intelligence. The proposed mechanism is based
upon maintaining and sharing pheromone (trust) levels so as to find
trustworthy routes. We believe that our model will be most suited to ad-hoc

Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) is computatinally demanding,
because one generally wishes to find the whole front of Pareto-optimal

looking for a number of Pareto-optimal solutions with different trade-offs
between the objectives, it seems natural to assign different parts of the
search space to different processors.  In this paper, we propose the idea of
cone separation which is used to divide up the search space by adding explicit
constraints for each process.  We show that the approach is more efficient
than simple parallelization schemes, and that it also works on problems with a
non-convex Pareto-optimal front.

However these uncertainties can be effectively modeled using fuzzy set theory.
This paper introduces the notion of multi-objective route selection in mobile

proposed technique over conventional MANET routing schemes.

This paper reports on experiments with an artificial society simulation
package. This work is part of a larger project whose main goal is to
investigate the emergence of cooperation and communication in response of
(scalable) environmental challenges. The specific goals of the experiments
reported here include 1) the study a number of extensions of the classical
SugarScape model, 2) to compare two radically different approaches to
communication among the individuals of the population. Our results demonstrate
that a number of the presented extensions should be taken up in future
experiments in artificial societies, and that the decentralised communication
protocol has negative effects on the system behaviour.

We studied how communication evolves in a genetic based Multi-Agent System
(MAS) using an Adapted Pittsburgh style Classifier System. This work is an
extension of a Minimal Model of Communication which consists in making two
agents communicating and playing a naming game with a limited number of
situations to recognize. We complexify that model by increasing both the
number of agents within the MAS and the number of words that can be used by
agents. We studied how confusion may emerge through communication and how
agents use their available cognitive ressources in order to learn to
communicate. We pointed out that further study with new measures is needed in
order to better understand how communication evolves in a genetic based MAS.

the world is stored every 500 generations.   Saved populations are placed in
competition with populations from generation 10,000.  This procedure is
repeated for varying levels of overall mutation rate, with and without tags,
and varying frequencies of tag related mutations.  Non-local adaptation is
observed in these populations, however, tags seem to slow the acquisition of

Recently, there has been a growing interest in classification of patient

difficult by the noisy nature of the data, and by the overwhelming number of
genes relative to the number of available training samples in the data set.
Moreover, many of these genes are irrelevant for classification and have
negative effect on the accuracy and on required learning time for the
classifier. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary computation method to
select the most useful subset of genes for molecular classification. We apply
this method to three bench-mark data sets and present our unbiased

the simplex algorithm has been modified for multi-objective optimization, by
introducing the concept of fuzzy dominance. A hybrid algorithm, the Fuzzy
Dominance based Simplex - Genetic Algorithm (FSGA) has been proposed. This
algorithm was shown to be a very effective search strategy when applied to a

investigation.  In classification tasks, the results show that GP is able to
evolve accurate classifiers based on texture features.  Moreover by using the
presented method, GP is able to evolve accurate classifiers without extracting
texture features.  In texture segmentation tasks, the investigation shows that
a fast and accurate segmentation method can be developed based on GP generated
texture classifiers.

This paper proposes a new face detection system using Quantum-inspired
Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA). The proposed system is based on elliptical blobs
and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The elliptical blobs in the
directional image are used to find the face candidate regions, and then PCA
and QEA are employed to verify faces. By PCA, we can obtain the optimal basis
but they may not be the optimal ones for discriminating faces from non-faces.
Moreover, a threshold value should be selected properly considering the
success rate and false alarm rate. To solve these problems, QEA is employed to
find out the optimal decision boundary under the predetermined threshold value
which distinguishes between face images and non-face images.

the exhaustive search over all features so that even very large feature sets
can be searched in reasonable time. Experiments on two different sets of
images prove that by the use of evolutionary search we are able to find object
detectors that are faster and have higher detection rates.

In evolutionary algorithms a critical parameter that must be tuned is that of
selection pressure.  If it is set too low then the rate of convergence towards
the optimum is likely to be slow.  Alternatively if the selection pressure is
set too high the system is likely to become stuck in a local optimum due to a
loss of diversity in the population. The recent Fitness Uniform Selection
Scheme (FUSS) is a conceptually simple but somewhat radical approach to
addressing this problem --- rather than biasing the selection towards higher
fitness, FUSS biases selection towards sparsely populated fitness levels. In
this paper we compare the relative performance of FUSS with the well known
tournament selection scheme on a range of problems.

different neighborhood-to-topology ratio, and asynchronous update policies are

Increasingly often artificial evolutionary techniques are coupled with
mechanisms abstracted from developmental biology. For instance, artificial
cells endowed with  genetic regulatory networks were used to evolve and
develop simulated creatures. With the evolution of a simple vermicular
structure it is shown that asymmetric cell division is useful for the
positioning of cells and that this mechanism can be integrated with other
developmental mechanisms such as genetic regulation and cell adhesion to get
moving artificial creatures. Surprisingly, the movements were controlled by
the genetic regulatory network alone without the need to evolve a neural
structure.

proposed crossover mechanism allows them to improve the mean performance

Partial recombination is a type of crossover for genetic algorithms that
focuses on a subset of the chromosome. It provides a means of doing crossover
were only the genes involved in producing the fitness are affected. In this
paper, we use it to evolve the parameters for a model that represents the
capabilities of a robot. The values of these parameters are evolved as the
robot periodically performs an action that is also being performed by the
model. Each action performed by the robot does not include every possible turn
command so using partial recombination allows the system to only change the
parameters involved in the action. Tests show that partial recombination makes
a significant difference in the co-evolution of model parameters.

Genetic algorithms have been extensively studied, yet what type of functions
are likely to demonstrate interaction between crossover and mutation, and,
what is the practical implication of interaction have been unanswered.

We find that as our test function increases in modality the interaction
between crossover and mutation becomes statistically significant. We
conjecture that for highly modal functions the possibility of interaction
between crossover and mutation must be considered.

The practical implication of interaction is that when attempting to fine tune
a genetic algorithm on a highly multi-modal problem the optimal rates for
crossover and mutation cannot be obtained independently.

proposed model solved by Particle Swarm Optimization provides better results
than a previously proposed heuristic.

we propose a novel memetic algorithm (MsMA),in which a new local search scheme
is introduced. We called it as random Multi-Local-Search (MLS).The MLS is
composed of several local search schemes,each of which executes with a
predefined probability.The combination of MsMA with the crossover EAX on the
Traveling Salesman Problem is studied,and comparisons are also made with some
best known MAs. We have found that it is significantly outperforming the known
MAs on the selected instances. Furthermore, we have proposed a new crossover
named M-EAX,which has more powerful local search ability than the EAX.The
experimental results show that the MsMA with M-EAX has given a further
improvement to the existing EAX.

Coevolution offers adaptive methods for the selection of tests used to
evaluate individuals, but the resulting evaluation can be unstable. Recently,
general archive-based coevolution methods have become available for which
monotonic progress can be guaranteed. The size of these archives may grow
indefinitely however, thus limiting their application potential. Here, we
investigate how the size of an archive for Pareto-Coevolution may be limited
while maintaining reliability. The LAyered Pareto-Coevolution Archive (LAPCA)
is presented, and investigated in experiments. LAPCA features a tunable degree
of reliability, and is found to provide reliable progress in a difficult test
problem while maintaining approximately constant archive sizes.

In this paper, infinite population models of CGA that consisting of two
populations coevolving on two-bit landscapes is described and investigated
with the context of four different partnering strategies. It is shown that
even in those simpest models of CGA, the dynamics changes dramatically with
different evolutionary scenarios that deserves our attention from the
perspective of coevolutionary algorithms design.

This paper details the application of a Multi-Objective Cooperative
Co-evolutionary On-Line EA to the guidance of a swarm of multiple missiles,
against multiple targets. The multi-objective algorithm is used to develop a
dynamic objective front which is used to trade the spatial distribution of
missiles at impact, against the time to impact.

Each missile optimises its own performance, based on limited information of
the current intended actions of the other missiles.  The decision making
process is thus distributed between the missiles giving distributed
coordination.

Results demonstrate the algorithm can form effective leader-less distributed
control for multiple missiles against multiple targets in noisy and
environments.

Conversion from a widely-used automotive fuel to an alternative fuel can be
seen as the coevolution of two systems: a societal system of vehicle owners
and a supply infrastructure that will provide the alternative fuel.  We
present a Cultural Algorithms model that allows us to assess the impact that
initial alternative fuel station distribution and cultural motivation have on
alternative fuel adoption, and the role that mass media may play in that
adoption.
