                 facilitates an understanding of their
                 inter-relationship. All the systems are described
                 focusing on the reasons for their development, what
                 their purpose was and how they were to be used. The
                 engineering methods, knowledge representations, tools
                 and architectures used for the systems are compared and
                 contrasted in a discussion covering all the stages of
                 the development life cycle of expert systems. The
                 review reveals that too often developers of expert
                 systems for chromatography do not justify their

                 given, together with a description of Golem and
                 previous applications of ILP. The advantages of ILP

                 the Top-Down-Induction-of-Decision-Tree family, are

                 attempted separations succeed or fail. The separation

                 human-comprehensible hypotheses from data are typically
                 open loop, with no direct link between the ML system
                 and the collection of data. This paper describes the
                 alternative, {\it Closed Loop Machine Learning}. This
                 is related to the area of Active Learning in which the
                 ML system actively selects experiments to discriminate
                 between contending hypotheses. In Closed Loop Machine
                 Learning the system not only selects but also carries
                 out the experiments in the learning domain. ASE-Progol,
                 a Closed Loop Machine Learning system, is proposed.
                 ASE-Progol will use the ILP system Progol to form the
                 initial hypothesis set. It will then devise experiments
                 to select between competing hypotheses, direct a robot
                 to perform the experiments, and finally analyse the
                 experimental results. ASE-Progol will then revise its
                 hypotheses and repeat the cycle until a unique
                 hypothesis remains. This will be, to our knowledge, the
                 first attempt to use a robot to carry out experiments

                 the examples and hypotheses define the same predicate.
                 However, in both scientific discovery and language
                 learning potential applications exist in which OPL does
                 not hold. OPL is ingrained within the theory and
                 performance testing of Machine Learning. A general ILP
                 technique called ``Theory Completion using Inverse
                 Entailment'' (TCIE) is introduced which is applicable
                 to non-OPL applications. TCIE is based on inverse
                 entailment and is closely allied to abductive
                 inference. The implementation of TCIE within Progol5.0
                 is described. The implementation uses contra-positives
                 in a similar way to Stickel's Prolog Technology Theorem
                 Prover. Progol5.0 is tested on two different data-sets.
                 The first dataset involves a grammar which translates
                 numbers to their representation in English. The second
                 dataset involves hypothesising the function of unknown
                 genes within a network of metabolic pathways. On both
                 datasets near complete recovery of performance is
                 achieved after relearning when randomly chosen portions
                 of background knowledge are removed. Progol5.0's
                 running times for experiments in this paper were

                 geneticists interested in what AI tools may do for

                 enterprise aimed at partially automating some aspects
                 of scientific work. These aspects include the processes
                 of forming hypotheses, devising trials to discriminate
                 between these competing hypotheses, physically
                 performing these trials and then using the results of
                 these trials to converge upon an accurate
                 hypothesis. As a potential component of the reasoning
                 carried out by an ``artificial scientist'' this paper
                 describes ASE-Progol, an Active Learning system which
                 uses Inductive Logic Programming to construct
                 hypothesised first-order theories and uses a CART-like
                 algorithm to select trials for eliminating ILP derived
                 hypotheses. In simulated yeast growth tests ASE-Progol
                 was used to rediscover how genes participate in the
                 aromatic amino acid pathway of {\em Saccharomyces
                 cerevisiae}. The cost of the chemicals consumed in
                 converging upon a hypothesis with an accuracy of around
                 $88\%$ was reduced by five orders of magnitude when
                 trials were selected by ASE-Progol rather than being
                 sampled at random. While the naive strategy of always
                 choosing the cheapest trial from the set of candidate
                 trials led to lower cumulative costs than ASE-Progol,
                 both the naive strategy and the random strategy took
                 significantly longer to converge upon a final
                 hypothesis than ASE-Progol. For example to reach an
                 accuracy of $80\%$, ASE-Progol required 4 days while
                 random sampling required 6 days and the naive strategy

                 representations are useful for learning cost-effective,
                 comprehensible predictors of members of biological
                 sequence families. The Inductive Logic Programming
                 (ILP) Bayesian approach to learning from positive
                 examples is used to generate a grammar for recognising
                 a class of proteins known as human neuropeptide
                 precursors (NPPs). Collectively, five of the co-authors
                 of this paper, have extensive expertise on NPPs and
                 general bioinformatics methods. Their motivation for
                 generating a NPP grammar was that none of the existing
                 bioinformatics methods could provide sufficient
                 cost-savings during the search for new NPPs. Prior to
                 this project experienced specialists at SmithKline
                 Beecham had tried for many months to hand-code such a
                 grammar but without success. Our best predictor makes
                 the search for novel NPPs {\bf more than 100 times more
                 efficient} than randomly selecting proteins for
                 synthesis and testing them for biological activity. As
                 far as these authors are aware, this is both the first
                 biological grammar learnt using ILP and the first
                 real-world scientific application of the ILP Bayesian
                 approach to learning from positive examples. A group of
                 features is derived from this grammar. Other groups of
                 features of NPPs are derived using other learning
                 strategies. Amalgams of these groups are formed. A
                 recognition model is generated for each amalgam using
                 C4.5 and C4.5rules and its performance is measured
                 using both predictive accuracy and a new cost function,
                 {\em Relative Advantage\/} ($RA$). The highest $RA$ was

                 is moving to determining the role of these genes
                 (functional genomics). To this end it is useful to view
                 the cell as a biochemical machine: it consumes simple
                 molecules to manufacture more complex ones by chaining
                 together biochemical reactions into long sequences
                 referred to as {\em metabolic pathways}. Such metabolic
                 pathways are not linear but often intersect to form
                 complex networks. Genes play a fundamental role in
                 these networks by providing the information to
                 synthesise the enzymes that catalyse biochemical
                 reactions. Although developing a complete model of
                 metabolism is of fundamental importance to biology and
                 medicine, the size and complexity of the network has
                 proven beyond the capacity of human reasoning. This
                 paper presents the first results of the Robot Scientist

                 the function of genes in the metabolism of the yeast

                 the first logical model of metabolism; (2) a method to
