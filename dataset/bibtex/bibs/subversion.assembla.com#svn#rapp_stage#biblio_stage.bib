We present a particle interaction method for simulating fluids. The underlyingequations of fluid motion are discretized using moving particles and their interactions. The method allows simulationand modeling of mixing fluids with different physical properties, fluid interactions with stationary objects, andfluids that exhibit significant interface breakup and fragmentation. The gridless computational method is suitedfor medium scale problems since computational elements exist only where needed. The method fits well into thecurrent user interaction paradigm and allows easy user control over the desired fluid motion. ",

SPH is a pure Lagrangian approach which can handle large deformations of the free surface with high accuracy. The governing equations are solved based on the SPH particle interaction models and the incompressible algorithm of pressure projection is implemented by enforcing the constant particle density. The two-equation k-r. model is an effective way of dealing with the turbulence and vortices during wave breaking and overtopping and it is coupled with the incompressible SPH numerical scheme. The SPH model is employed to reproduce the experiment and computations of wave overtopping of a sloping sea wall",
