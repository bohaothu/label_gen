    We propose an Online MultiTask Learning
    (OMTL) framework which simultaneously
    learns the task weight vectors as well as
    the task relatedness adaptively from the
    data. Our work is in contrast with prior
    work on online multitask learning which
    assumes fixed task relatedness, a priori.
    Furthermore, whereas prior work in such
    settings assume only positively correlated
    tasks, our framework can capture negative
    correlations as well. Our proposed
    framework learns the task relationship matrix
    by framing the objective function as
    a Bregman divergence minimization problem
    for positive definite matrices. Subsequently,
    we exploit this adaptively learned
    task-relationship matrix to select the most
    informative samples in an online multitask
    active learning setting. Experimental results
    on a number of real-world datasets
    and comparisons with numerous baselines
    establish the efficacy of our proposed approach.
