can provide an alternative form of output for mobile devices using audio and 
tactile modalities to communicate information. A complete set of crossmodal 
icons was created by encoding three dimensions of information in three 
crossmodal auditory/tactile parameters. Earcons were used for the audio and 
Tactons for the tactile crossmodal icons. The experiment investigated 
absolute identification of audio and tactile crossmodal icons when a user is 
trained in one modality and tested in the other (and given no training in the 
other modality) to see if knowledge could be transferred between modalities. 
We also compared performance when users were static and mobile to see any 
effects that mobility might have on recognition of the cues. The results 
showed that if participants were trained in sound with Earcons and then 
tested with the same messages presented via Tactons they could recognize 
85% of messages when stationary and 76% when mobile. When trained with 
Tactons and tested with Earcons participants could accurately recognize 
76.5% of messages when stationary and 71% of messages when mobile. These 
results suggest that participants can recognize and understand a message in 
a different modality very effectively. These results will aid designers of mobile 
displays in creating effective crossmodal cues which require minimal training 
for users and can provide alternative presentation modalities through which 
information may be presented if the context requires.},keywords = {Tactons (tactile icons), Earcons, crossmodal interaction, mobile interaction},Publisher =
