	abstract = {We report on the use of model checking techniques for
both the verification of a process control program and the derivation of
optimal control schedules.  Most of this work has been carried out as part of
a case study for the EU VHS project (Verification of Hybrid Systems), in which
the program for a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) of an experimental
chemical plant had to be designed and verified.  The original intention of
our approach was to see how much could be achieved here using the standard
model checking environment of SPIN/Promela.  As the symbolic calculations of
real-time model checkers can be quite expensive it is interesting to try and
exploit the efficiency of established non-real-time model checkers like SPIN in
those cases where promising work-arounds seem to exist. In our case we handled
the relevant real-time properties of the PLC controller using a
time-abstraction technique; for the scheduling we implemented in Promela a
so-called variable time advance procedure.  To compare and interpret the
results we carried out the same case study with the aid of the real-time model
checker Uppaal, enhanced with facilities for cost-guided state space
exploration.  Both approaches proved sufficiently powerful to verify the
design of the controller and/or derive (time-)optimal schedules within
reasonable time and space requirements.}

        algorithm for the construction of a quotient model under the
        equivalence induced by ACTL, the universal fragment of CTL. As
        this equivalence coincides with simulation equivalence, the
        achieved reduction is better than reductions achieved by
        methods based on bisimulation. Simulation equivalence is also
        the equivalence that is induced by ACTL*, hence, the reduced
        model allows model checking of any ACTL* formula. Furthermore
        it provides diagnostic information. In the second part, we
        restict our attention to single ACTL formulae. An algorithm is
        given that constructs a model which is reduced w.r.t.  a
        specific formula.

        The reduced models are constructed directly, without
        intermediate need for the full models. The approach, splitting
        of states w.r.t.  formulae, yields a sequence of successively
        more refined models which at any stage preserve truth of
        formulae."

Efficiency is one of the major concerns in the world of model checking.
Consequently, many techniques to optimize the time and space usage of
model checking algorithms have been invented.  One of these techniques is
reduction of the searchable state space through arguments of symmetry.
This technique can be very profitable and has been implemented in various model
checkers, but not yet in UPPAAL, a model checker for timed systems. This paper
proposes an enhancement of UPPAAL with symmetry reduction.  We adopt the theory
of symmetry of Ip and Dill and their scalarset data type, as implemented in
the model checker Murphi.  The main result of this paper is a soundness proof
of our symmetry enhancement, which does not follow trivially from the work of
Ip and Dill since the description languages of UPPAAL and Murphi, which are
used to detect the symmetries, are quite different.  A secondary result is a
proof of the computational difficulty of space-optimal exploitation of full
symmetry in a setting with DBM technology.

Different time scales do often occur in real-time systems, e.g., a polling
real-time system samples the environment many times per second, whereas the
environment may only change a few times per second.  When these systems are
modeled as (networks of) timed automata, the validation using symbolic model
checking techniques can significantly be slowed down by unnecessary
fragmentation of the symbolic state space. This paper introduces a syntactical
adjustment to a subset of timed automata that addresses this fragmentation
problem and can speed-up forward symbolic reachability analysis in a
significant way.  We prove that this syntactical adjustment does not alter
reachability properties and that it indeed is effective.  We illustrate our
exact acceleration tehnique with run-time date obtained with the model
checkers UPPAAL and KRONOS.
Moreover, we demonstrate that automated application of our exact
acceleration technique can significantly speed-up the verification of the
run-time behavior of LEGO Mindstorms programs.
