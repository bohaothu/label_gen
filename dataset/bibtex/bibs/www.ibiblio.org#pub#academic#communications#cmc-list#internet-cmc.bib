1    Explaining Computer-Mediated Communication

1.1   Meta-theories

* Rice (1992) recursively summarizes material from CMC reviews. Main
  point: "Even a general awareness of the diversity of these contexts, much
  less the numerous studies associated with the various contexts, should
  obviate the easy and ill-formed introduction found in many CMC studies,
  that `there is little theoretical or empirical research in this area.' "
* Rice (1989a) asserts that we need to integrate CMC research around
  four themes: stakeholders, goals, domains, and tools. Main point: [p. 436]
  Integrate CMC research across disciplines/tech/research processes via
  stakeholders, goals, analytical domain, and tools.
  
  
1.2   Conceptualizations of Computing
  
* Mowshowitz (1981) describes five positions underlying
  conceptualizations of computing: technicism, progressive individualism,
  elitism, pluralism, radical criticism.

* Burge (1992) presents a detailed bibliography for current literature in
  distance education and CMC.
* Rice (1992) recursively summarizes material from CMC reviews. Main
  point: "Even a general awareness of the diversity of these contexts, much
  less the numerous studies associated with the various contexts, should
  obviate the easy and ill-formed introduction found in many CMC studies,
  that `there is little theoretical or empirical research in this area.' "

  CMC is low in social presence (no noverbal); therefore, it is task-oriented
  and impersonal.
* Bowers (1992) claims artifacts have politics by analyzing formalisms of
  design or implementation. Main point: "If we are to take computer
  technology seriously, we will have to abandon innocent humanism in
  favor of a cyber politics."

  communication.
* Feenberg (1986) presents an operating manual for computer
  conferencing.
* Ghani (1988) describes flow theory in CMC.
* Kuehn (1990) asserts that play theory explains CMC as "communication
  play" when communicators can alter interaction and achieve goals.
  
  
  
1.4   Innovation Diffusion/Media Choice and Adoption/Critical Mass

  Reduce ambiguity through media selection.  
  
* Daft and Macintosh (1981)
  describes information richness theory in organizations.
* Daft and Lengel (1984) applies media richness theory to organizations.
  Main point: [p. 194] "organizational success is based on the organization's
  ability to process information of appropriate richness to reduce
  uncertainty and clarify ambiguity."
* Daft and Lengel (1986) describes theory of media richness used in
  organizations.
* Daft, Lengel, and Trevino (1987) uses media richness model applied to
  message equivocality and media selection.
* Trevino, Daft, and Lengel (1990) describes the use of symbolic
  interactionism to understand managers' media choices in terms of message
  equivocality, contextual determinants, and media symbolism.
* Trevino, Lengel, Bodensteiner, Gerloff, and Muir (1990) [p. 176] "This
  article proposes a new thesis about the role of individual differences in
  managers' media choice behavior." Main point: Media preferences operate
  when equivocality is low; in high equivocality situations, there is an
  imperative to use rich media.

  affects of CMC.
* Boshier (1990) discusses social/psychological factors in electronic
  networking, focusing on email role in adult education, identifying research

  and lifelong learning because they help increase interaction, provide for
  equal opportunity, and create a noncoercive, nonhierarchical, reciprocal
  environment.
* Cathcart and Gumpert (1985) communicating through computer creates
  interpersonal communication dyad (user & computer).
* Kling and Gerson (1977) explores social context features of CMC
  affecting communities of users.
* McGuire (1983) describes contextualism as a counterpoint to
  empiricism.
* Short, Williams, and Christie (1976) describes social presence theory for
  analyzing mediated communication. Main point: [p. 65] "We hypothesize
  that communications media vary in their degree of Social Presence, and
  that these variations are important in determining the way individuals
  interact."
  
  
1.7   Social Presence Model
  
* Short, Williams, and Christie (1976) describes social presence theory for
  analyzing mediated communication. Main point: [p. 65] "We hypothesize
  that communications media vary in their degree of Social Presence, and
  that these variations are important in determining the way individuals
  interact."
* Bales (1950)
* Short (1974) compared FTF, sound only, and CCTV communication to
  test social presence hypothesis about persuasion.
* Johansen (1977) uses social presence model to examine social aspects of
  teleconferencing.
  
  
1.8   Reduced Social Cues (RSC) Approach
  
  Basic Thesis: CMC features (reduced social/context cues) lead to
  psychological states (reduced impact of social norms and constraints)
  which undermine social, normative influences leading to deregulated
  behavior.  
  
* Kiesler (1986) describes how the social effects of computers
  may be greater and more important than you imagine. Main point: [p.
  46] Computers have social effects, cut down hierarchies, cut across norms
  and organization boundaries.

1.10    Social Information/Influence/Context Model
  
  Media perceptions and use are socially constructed.  
  
* Fulk, Schmitz, and
  Steinfield (1990) proposes a model for technology use which is based on
  social context effects: social influence model of media use. Main point: 
  [p. 121] Basic assumption of social influence model of media use: media
  perceptions are subjective/social constructed.

  propose a perspective on social context and context-behavior relations.
* Fulk, Steinfield, Schmitz, and Power (1987) explores social information
  processing as a model for media use.
* Bem (1972) describes attribution theory.

  organizational features guide the design of CC systems.
* Feenberg (1989) asserts that types and use of CMC systems must be
  based on the sociology of the group.

  videotex system in France.
* Gattiker (1992c) suggest directions for future research in
  technology-mediated communication.
* Georgoudi and Rosnow (1985) describes contextualism from the
  perspective of the nature of context (as opposed from mechanistic
  assumptions). Main point: Contextualism is marked by recognizing
  communication as a process embedded in a constantly changing, cultural,
  cognitive, and social context.
* Hellerstein (1986) presents study of social uses of CMC at
  UMass-Amherst; CMC mediates and facilitates social life.
* Schmitz and Fulk (1991) describes media richness, social influence
  theory applied to organizations.
* Matheson (1991) examines the extent to which social perceptions in
  CMC are influenced by social information availability and based on
  internalized social expectations.

  theory.
* Smilowitz, Compton, and Flint (1988) CMC changes the way people
  interact, accomplish comm. tasks.

  for organizations.
  
  
1.11    Language Aspects/Rhetorical
  
* Baron (1984) describes CMC as a force in language culture.
* Ferrara, Brunner, and Whittemore (1991) describes interactive written
  discourse (IWD, the written language occurring in simultaneous
  terminal-to-terminal typed dialogues.)

  communication technology.
* Lakoff (1982) Oral is becoming more valued than literacy, writing
  imitates oral.
* Murray (1991) describes the composing process for computer
  conversation.
* Ochs (1989) explores language use and culture.
* Ong (1977) Technology changed culture and thought.
* Ong (1982) Thought and expressed changed in the shift from orality to
  literacy.
* Shank (1993) argues network communication is not oral or written but
  semiotic.
* December (1993a) compares net discourse in USENET newsgroup with
  characteristics of orality as defined by Walter J. Ong. Main point: The
  discourse on the Internet brings back pre-literate characteristics; it is a
  tertiary form of orality (the first two being, pre-literature culture and
  widespread radio and tv broadcasting).
* Shaver (1990) describes measures of reliability and validity of attitude
  measures of writing with a computer.
* Spitzer (1986) describes writing style in computer conferences.

* Black, Levin, Mehan, and Quinn (1983) describes real and non-real time
  discourse.
* December (1994) discusses and analyzes the strategies communicators
  can use to exchange information on global computer networks. Main
  point: The communicator's task in creating and structuring information
  has always included considerations of purpose and audience. In
  communicating over networks, however, the communicator's task includes
  considerations of the nature of the medium_distribution, access,
  information-sharing practices, and social context.
  
  
1.12    Media Characteristics / Media Evolution

  transforming life and media.
* McLuhan (1964) explores the extensions of people through media. Main
  point: Media's characteristics create and operate in a social and historical
  context; electric technologies create an emphasis on effect and total
  involvement.
* McLuhan (1965) Technology revises the linearism of print. Main point:
  "The Gutenberg Galaxy is intended to trace the ways in which the forms
  of experience and of mental outlook and expression have been modified,
  first by the phonetic alphabet and then by printing."
* McLuhan and Fiore (1967) asserts that media extends consciousness.
  Main point: [p. 26] "All media work us over completely. They are so
  pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological,
  moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us
  untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the massage. Any
  understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a
  knowledge of the way media work as environments."
* Rice and Associates (1984) summarizes research dealing with computers
  and communication.
* Schement and Lievrouw (1987) describes assumptions of information
  society research.
* Smith (1980) traces development and transformation of newspaper

  social+cultural+tech and its effects indirect, unpredictable.
* Kiesler and Sproull (1987c)
* Kiesler, Zubrow, Moses, and Geller (1985) findings show that CMC,
  "rather than provoking emotionality per se, elicits asocial or unregulated
  behavior."
