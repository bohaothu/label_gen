   Title = {Argument schemes for two-phase democratic deliberation},
   BookTitle = {Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2011)},
   Abstract = {A formal two-phase model of democratic policy deliberation is presented,
in which in the first phase sufficient and necessary criteria
for proposals to be accepted are determined (the ‘acceptable’ criteria)
and in the second phase proposals are made and evaluated in
light of the acceptable criteria resulting from the first phase. Such a
separation gives the discussion a clear structure and prevents time
and resources from being wasted on evaluating arguments for proposals
based on unacceptable criteria. Argument schemes for both
phases are defined and formalised in a logical framework for structured
argumentation. The process of deliberation is abstracted from
and it is assumed that both deliberation phases result in a set of
arguments and attack and defeat relations between them. The acceptability
status of criteria and proposals within the resulting argumentation
framework is then evaluated using preferred semantics.
For cases where preferences are required to choose between proposals,
inference rules for deriving preferences between sets from
an ordering of their elements are given.},

   BookTitle = {13th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2010)},
   Abstract = {Preferences for objects are commonly derived from ranked sets
of properties or multiple attributes associated with these objects.
There are several options or strategies to qualitatively derive a preference
for one object over another from a property ranking. We introduce
a modal logic, called multi-attribute preference logic, that
provides a language for expressing such strategies. The logic provides
the means to represent and reason about qualitative multiattribute
preferences and to derive object preferences from property
rankings. The main result of the paper is a proof that various
well-known preference orderings can be defined in multi-attribute
preference logic.},

   Abstract = {Motivation – Elicitation of preferences is crucial in negotiation
support. This is a non-trivial task which could
be supported by computers.
Research approach – Experiment in which 32 participants
have to order holidays using different preference
elicitation techniques including a navigational task and
affective scoring. The results were used as input for a
lexicographic ordering algorithm.
Findings/design – Traditional property rating approach
seems most preferred by the participants and resulted in
one of the best orderings of the outcomes space to
match their preferences, at least when using the lexicographic
algorithm.
Originality/value – The elicitation process is approached
from an algorithmic perspective as well as
from a user-centred perspective for both navigation and
affective attitude.
Take away message – A multi-angle approach gives a
richer understanding of the process of preference elicitation.},

   Abstract = {Negotiation support systems (NSS) help users in the
complex process of reaching agreements about exchange of
goods or services. A difficult issue in the development of
NSS is how to extract knowledge from qualitative real-life
data and embed it into the system. We present a metamodel
for modeling domain, user and opponent (DUO) in
NSS with focus on four main concepts: issues, preferences,
interests and objective domain knowledge. We claim that
(a) these concepts are essential in extracting data from
unstructured sources, and (b) these concepts can be a basis
for formal reasoning about user preferences and bids. We
ground our meta-model in negotiation literature and data
gathered with case studies and interviews. Finally, we
formalize parts of the meta-model as a step towards a
computationally-oriented model.},

may be defeasible. We present an argumentation framework for deriving qualitative,
multi-attribute preferences and incorporate defeasible reasoning about
knowledge. Intuitively, preferences based on defeasible conclusions are not as
strong as preferences based on certain conclusions, since defeasible conclusions
may turn out not to hold. This introduces risk when such knowledge is used in
practical reasoning. Typically, a risk prone attitude will result in different preferences
than a risk averse attitude. In this paper we introduce qualitative strategies
for deriving risk sensitive preferences.},

   Abstract = {Preferences between different alternatives (products, decisions, agreements
etc.) are often based on multiple criteria. Qualitative Preference Systems
(QPS) is a formal framework for the representation of qualitative multi-criteria
preferences in which a criterion’s preference is defined based on the values of
attributes or by combining multiple subcriteria in a cardinality-based or lexicographic
way. In this paper we present a language and reasoning mechanism to
represent and reason about such qualitative multi-criteria preferences.We take an
argumentation-based approach and show that the presented argumentation framework
correctly models a QPS. Then we extend this argumentation framework in
such a way that it can derive missing information from background knowledge,
which makes it more flexible in case of incomplete specifications.},

   Abstract = {In the context of practical reasoning, such as decision making and negotiation, it is necessary to model preferences over possible outcomes. Such preferences usually depend on multiple criteria. We argue that the criteria by which outcomes are evaluated should be the satisfaction of a person's underlying interests: the more an outcome satisfies his interests, the more preferred it is. Underlying interests can explain and eliminate conditional preferences. Also, modelling interests will create a better model of human preferences, and can lead to better, more creative deals in negotiation. We present an argumentation framework for reasoning about interest-based preferences. We take a qualitative approach and provide the means to derive both ceteris paribus and lexicographic preferences.},
