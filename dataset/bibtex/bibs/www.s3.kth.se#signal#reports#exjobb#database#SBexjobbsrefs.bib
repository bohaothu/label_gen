  abstract = {Interference from other users is often a considerable problem in modern wireless systems. The pursuit for increased capacity means that many users often share a common frequency band which makes the transmission susceptible to interference. A well known example is the GSM system which uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to separate the users. This thesis considers interference suppression in an acoustic communication system us- ing Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation. A conventional equalizer is compared to a recently developed method which exploits the structure of BPSK modulation. The communication system is simulated and also implemented in real time, in order to assess the in uence from the nonideal behaviour of a true system. The real time implementation relies on assembler programs running on Digital Signal Processors (DSP:s). The theoretical results and measurements will show that an improvement of the per- formance is obtained when the structured method is used. The real time implementation allows easy demonstration of this fact by allowing the user to interactively switch equalizer while the received signal constellation and estimates of the biterror probability and SNR are displayed. A great deal of e ort has been spent optimizing the assembler programs to obtain the necessary processing power.}

  abstract = {Future wireless systems demand high bitrates to provide the users with more and more advanced services. A wireless local area network that already shows great performance and high bitrates is HIPERLAN/2. A potential application to improve the peak bit rate in HIPERLAN/2 is to introduce more than one antenna at the receiver and transmitter and apply some kind of space-time coding. One space-time technique that has shown enormous spectral efficiency and great theoretical possibilities to increase the bitrate is the BLAST technique. The BLAST technique transmits different information on different transmit antennas and detect them jointly in the receiver. In this thesis a combined OFDM and BLAST technique has been implemented and simulated for different channel properties in typical urban macrocell environment. The channel model used is a very realistic model called COST259. Simulations show that it is possible to double the bitrate and still get a FER=1% by adding one antenna at the receiver and transmitter and apply the V-BLAST technique. In the case when the distance between the antennas in the transmitter as well as the receiver is half a wavelength the transmit power from each transmit antenna has to be increased by 9 dB to keep the above performance. If the receiver antenna distance is increased by a factor of 6 the power only needs to be increased with 2 dB. This indicates that the V-BLAST technique suffers greatly when the channels are highly correlated.}

  abstract = {Third generation mobile communication systems will support higher bit rates compared to second generation digital systems, such as GSM. WCDMA is the main third generation air interface and is optimized to support multiple high speed mobile multimedia services. It is necessary to understand the capabilities and the limitations of mobile communication systems to utilize the systems in an effcient way; this is achieved via simulations. System simulations are used to determine the capacity of cellular systems, while link simulations, model aspects like the performance of modulation, coding and the behavior of the fading channel. System simulators usually operate on slot level, whereas link simulators operate on symbol, chip or sub-chip level. A process that translates the behavior of the link from link level to system level, which then will form the physical layer model used in the WCDMA system simulator, is needed. The ideal solution would be to nd one single process that describes dierent services, different mobile speeds and different channel environments. This would decrease the number of necessary link simulations. The problem today is that link simulations has to be performed for each service, mobile speed and channel environment that are simulated in the system simulator. A physical layer model that separates the demodulator and the decoder is expected to handle different mobile speeds and channel environments. The idea is that characteristics like imperfections in the channel estimation, different mobile speeds and channel environments will be modeled in the demodulator model and different services will be modeled in the decoder model. Therefore, physical layer models of carrier and noise powers after the RAKE receiver are analytically derived on slot level for the uplink. These are used to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after the RAKE receiver, which is used to estimate the decoder performance. Modeling of link performance has been performed for different mobile speeds and different channel environments for a speech service with a data rate of 12.2 kbps. Different channel estimation schemes are investigated and the effect of power control is also investigated. Link simulations show that there is performance deterioration for the decoder at high mobile speeds with real channel estimation, which is not desirable for the physical layer model. Two different solutions to handle this deterioration are suggested. One solution is to have a single table with shift factors for different channels and mobile speeds and the other solution is to have a two-dimensional lookup table using both the mean and the variance. }

  abstract = {The most important standard in the terrestrial air interface of the third generation of  mobile  communications  is  Wideband  Code  Division  Multiple  Access (WCDMA)  in  which  the  users  are  code  multiplexed.  Even  though  orthogonal Walsh codes are  utilised multipath propagation implies  that  the  desired  signal  is affected  of  multiuser  interference  which  result  in  a  loss  of  performance.  By suppressing the interference the performance of the system  is improved resulting in that additional users can be added to the system. In this report, interference suppression by utilising a Generalised Rake receiver in both  downlink  and  uplink  transmission  for  a  WCDMA  TDD  system  is investigated. The main  difference between  the conventional and  the Generalised Rake  receiver  is  that  the  conventional  Rake  receiver  models  the  overall interference  as  zero-mean  white  Gaussian  noise  while  the  Generalised  Rake receiver  takes  the  colour  of  the  overall  interference  into  account.  Hence  the Generalised  Rake  receiver  may  utilise  more  fingers  resulting  in  different combining weights for the Generalised Rake receiver. It is found that the Generalised Rake receiver improves the performance compared with  the  conventional  Rake  receiver.  The  size  of  the  improvement  is  mainly dependent on the type of channel, the number of  interfering  users, the spreading factor, the Signal-to-Noise ratio, the direction of transmission and the number of utilised Rake fingers and their placement. }

  abstract = {I en GSM radiobasstation används det ett flertal integrerade kretsar (RFIC). På Ericsson Radio på avdelningen för GSM, TDMA arbetar man med utveckling av RFIC kretsar. Urvalet av kretsar utvecklade vid denna avdelning kan delas upp i två huvudkatagorier där följande olika typer av kretsar ingår: - Mottagarkretsar: Lågbrusförstärkare, nedkonverterare, mixrar från RF (Radio Frequency) band till IF (Intermediate Frequency) band, mixrar från IF till basband samt kretsar för analog till digital omvandling. - Sändarkretsar: Digital till analog omvandlare, mixrar från basband till IF band och från IF till RF band, osv. För både sändar- och mottagarkretsar används olika teknologier (t.ex. Si, SiGe, och GaAs) och för dessa används både bipolära och FET baserade konstruktioner och/eller kombinationer av dessa.  En stor del av utvecklingsarbetet med en integrerad krets består av verifiering genom olika tester. Det är av yttersta vikt att kretsens funktion och prestanda kan säkerställas innan den går till produktion. För att verifiera en krets testas den i olika miljöer där t ex temperatur, matningsspänningar varieras. I varje testfall måste samtidigt en mängd olika parametrar, t ex spänningar och strömmar, mätas. Mätvärdena kan sedan jämföras mot de uppsatta kraven och på så sätt kontrollera om kretsen är klar för produktion.  Syftet med detta examensarbete har varit att utveckla en generell testmiljö bestående av olika mätinstrument sammankopplade i ett nätverk. Dessutom har ett grafiskt användargränssnitt till testskalet implementerats med hjälp av det grafiska programmeringsspråket VEE Pro (Visual Engingeering Environment Profile).}

A test of the design in a real-time environment requires that source code is generated, compiled and downloaded to the target hardware. As a first attempt to bridge this software gap, this thesis describes and evaluates a prototype laboratory environment, which directly links Simulink to a Texas Instrument DSP device. The prototype system converts graphical models and makes available various real-time signal processing algorithms, such as adders, delays, FFTs, IIR filters and multipliers. Future work is to consider modification of the prototype to allow for feedback in the graphical models and to find an efficient way of handling signal processing algorithms where variable buffer lengths are required.}

  abstract = {In recent years, with the evolution of wireless LAN (WLAN) standards such as IEEE 802.11a and Hiperlan/2, the possibilities of providing wireless wideband communication services have increased dramatically. These standards allow data rates in the range of 5-50 Mbps, which is in line with what most wired office networks provide today. However, judging from the evolution of communications in recent years, it will not be long before such data rates are insufficient to meet public demands. Consequently, extensive research is performed to develop methods of increasing the potential data rates of such wireless systems, without increasing the required bandwidth. <p> Operating in the 5 GHz frequency band, the previously mentioned WLAN standards are highly suitable for for different kinds of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. Using antenna arrays at both ends of the wireless link, these techniques exploit the spatial independence of the channels to provide diversity, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiving end. Consequently, the potential performance gain of MIMO schemes will decrease with increased correlation between adjacent antenna elements. Furthermore, MIMO schemes require channel information, making them sensitive to errors in the channel estimates. <p> This thesis evaluates the performance of four different MIMO techniques and compares them to the common single-input single-output (SISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) techniques used today. The evaluation is performed using MATLAB simulations and assuming dual transmit and receive antennas and frequency non-selective, slowly-fading channel with Rayleigh distributed channel coefficients. Furthermore, the spatial correlation of the channel is modelled using statistics obtained from measurements in an indoor office-like environment. The performance metric is average throughput, measured in bits/s/Hz, versus average SNR, given the expected correlation between true and estimated channel coefficients. <p> The evaluated MIMO schemes are: Space-time block codes, beamforming, waterfilling and a hybrid of beamforming and space-time block codes. The first scheme is based on the theory of orthogonal designs. The second and third schemes are based on the singular-value decomposition (SVD) theorem and the final one, being a hybrid of the first two schemes, is based on both the SVD theorem and orthogonal designs.  }

I militära scenarion används störsändare för att neutralisera SAR som en källa för strategisk information. Denna rapport tar upp ett tillvägagångssätt för att maximera störenergin i en SAR-mottagare med minimal utsänd störeffekt.  En snabb och noggrann signalanalys har utvecklats i syfte att undvika triggning på felaktiga signaler samt tillåta användning av en smalbandig störsignal. Simuleringar har genomförts för att utvärdera användandet av olika frekvensmätningsalgoritmer för signalanalysen. Ytterligare simuleringar och utvärderingar, med utgångspunkt från en SAR:s funktionalitet, har gjorts för att hitta en effektiv störform.  Resultat visar att störning av en SAR blir effektivare om den görs frekvenshoppande samt sker på frekvenser nära mittenfrekvensen i det momentana bandet. En signalanalys som använder en fasestimeringsalgoritm följd av en Goertzel algoritm tillåter användandet av en stegvist mer smalbandig störsignal, vilket medför en maximering av störenergin i en SAR-mottagare. Slutligen konstateras det att det bästa störalternativet i ett inledande stadie av signalanalysen, då ingen information om det momentana frekvensbandet finns, är repeterstörning.        }

  abstract = {Target tracking is the process of following the position of a moving target by using observations from some kind of sensor. The association of observations with the right target is an important issue in target tracking. This problem gets harder when ground targets are tracked; this is due to the large amount of clutter delivered by the sensor. A promising method to address this issue is Multi Hypothesis Tracking (MHT). This method &#64257;nds a solution by forming several hypotheses and then investigates which of these that get support from later measurements. To prevent the number of hypotheses from growing exponentially in course of time the most unlikely ones must me deleted in a suitable manner. A multi hypothesis tracker and a simple simulation environment have been implemented. A couple of different methods to reduce the amount of hypotheses and possible tracks have been investigated to evaluate how they a&#64256;ect the ability to track targets. In this report it is shown that by using a divided gate the processing time can be reduced without seriously affecting the performance. It is also shown that by using CJPDA (Cheap Joint Probabilistic Data Association) in the MHT algorithm it is possible to use a larger depth in time. Further it is shown that it is not necessary to form all possible hypotheses since even a smaller subset gives a good result.}

A Hiperlan/2 system can adjust the data rate depending on the quality of the current radio link, using link adaptation.  In this master thesis a new link adaptation technique for Hiperlan/2 is suggested. The algorithm makes its decisions based not only on the mean noise level on the channel, but also on the behavior of the channel for different frequencies.  The performance of the link adaptation technique is evaluated using simulations of a Hiperlan/2 system. A more conventional adaptation algorithm is also implemented for comparisons.  The simulations show that the adaptation technique suggested in this thesis will give higher throughput than the conventional type. }

  abstract = {In this master's thesis two types of dual-mode multiuser detectors is introduced that either dynamically switches its detection mode between matched-filter and decorrelator or matched-filter and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The reason for looking into these detectors is that in some cases the difference in performance between matched-filter and decorrelator and SIC is not enough to motivate the increase in complexity. When the background interferences dominates compared to the multiple access interference (MAI), the decorrelator performs worse than the matched-filter, and the faster matched-filter should be used. The SIC receiver is sensitive to poor channel estimates. When the channel is fast varying it is harder to obtain good estimates and the SIC will suffer a severe performance degradation under these conditions. This leads to that a dual-mode design can switch to the faster matched-filter without losing much in performance.  We have succeeded in creating a dual-mode detector design that reduces the overall computational requirement while maintaining similar performance as that of the single-mode detector, SIC. This design was compared to the already existing dual-mode detector that switches between matched-filter and decorrelator.  The evaluation was performed using MATLAB simulations and assuming a multiuser case with a slow, random and fast varying Rayleigh distributed channel coefficients. The performance metric is average BER, versus average SNR or number of active users. There are two types of dual-mode detectors in this thesis, type 1 is matched-filter and decorrelator, type 2, the new design, is matched-filter and SIC.  The results showed that type 1 detects 47 % of the bits in the faster matchedfilter mode if the case was a slow varying channel and still maintain a performance that is in between the single-mode matched-filter and decorrelator. For type 2 in the random varying channel case it detects 46 % of the bits in matched-filter and still has a performance in terms of BER that is close to that of the single-mode SIC detector. }

It is shown that the combinations tried in this report are slightly outperformed by a normal space-time trellis code of comparative complexity on a slowly fading channel (quasi-static). However, if the channel is more rapidly fading the turbo-space-time codes outperform the space-time trellis codes by a wide margin. }

  abstract = {The third generation mobile communication system, using WCDMA, is being deployed around the world. In the latest specification, Release 5, the support for packet data is significantly improved. This is achieved by introducing the High-Speed Downlink Shared Channel, HS-DSCH. This channel offers increased capacity, reduced delays and high peak rates, made possible thanks to fast adjustments of the transmission parameters. The main principles are channel dependent scheduling, fast link adaptation and fast hybrid ARQ with soft combining. The HS-DSCH delivers particularly good performance for best-effort data services, however some of the high-speed benefits can also be used to provide a speech service, called HS-speech. Instead of using a high bit rate, the channel-dependent scheduling and fast link adaptation are used to provide a quality of service, on a best-effort channel. This work will examine the possibilities with the HS-speech approach and measure how this would affect data traffic throughput, which the HS-DSCH normally is used for. The point is not to host only speech but to investigate the possibility to transmit speech in conjunction with data traffic on a shared downlink channel. Transmitting speech on the HS-DSCH is more power efficient than speech services on dedicated channels. On average the power consumption can nearly be halved, but still delivering the same or even better speech quality. These benefits are under the assumption that the associated DPCHs are excluded for the HS-speech. When the communication system is used both for speech and web traffic, the speech users will consume resources leading to a capacity degradation for the web users. This degradation will be comparable regardless of the channel type used to carry the voice service. }

  abstract = {Multiple user multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless systems have attracted interest lately due to their ability to allow for high data rate transmissions without increasing the available bandwidth. However in most studies, the channels between the different transmitters and receivers are assumed to be independent realizations of the same random distribution, which is not a true reflection of reality. This thesis studies the impact of channel characteristics on wireless multi-user MIMO systems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which offers the possibility of combating multi-path fading but with lower complexity compared to conventional equalization techniques, is used here in conjunction with SINR- based beamforming for joint allocation in space and frequency. The channel is modelled according to a Kronecker structure that has been proposed in literature. Results from simulations of different channel characteristics obtained via changing the correlation properties are presented here. It is found that correlation on the transmitter side have as large effects as correlation on the receiver side. Also, the larger the correlation, the higher the outage probability. Results suggest that at  high correlation values, the outage probability can be as high as a system without spatial multiplexing. In addition results from simulations performed on a set of measured channels, with the aim of seeing how well the theoretical values coincided with reality, are also presented. The outage probability in this case corresponds to that of theoretical values with medium to high correlation. However, it should be mentioned that the results obtained based on the measured data are somewhat pessimistic due to the limitations posed by the small amount of measured data available.}

  abstract = {Using information about the channel at the transmitter can improve the performance of Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) communication systems. When perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, data can be multiplexed and optimized over independent spatial channels. However, when the CSI is partial or imperfect, crosstalk between the spatial channels is inevitable which complicates the optimization of the data transmission. In this work, an approximate formula for the bit error rate (BER) of the spatial channels is derived for two types of CSI; channel mean CSI or spatial correlation CSI. The formula is applied to a bit and power loading algorithm that approximately maximizes the uncoded bit rate given a BER constraint and total power constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the BER formula and the performance of the loading algorithm.}

  abstract = {In Europe and in Asia UMTS, Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems, has been chosen as the third generation mobile network standard. To be able to maintain communication between a user and the system a concurrent synchronisation is necessary, since the system is asynchronous and does not have a global time reference. In this study two different synchronisation algorithms are compared regarding robustness to user movement, noise and interference. One algorithm calculates an average estimate of the signal delay during a specific time span for the synchronisation. The other algorithm is more complex and synchronises continuously.   The algorithms are realised in Matlab and simulations are done to analyse how the algorithms react to white noise, interference and a quickly changing environment. The more complex algorithm, the algorithm that synchronises continuously, performs better with regards to a changing environment but both algorithms performances degrade when interference is added to high noise levels. }

  abstract = {In this work downlink beamforming in wideband systems is treated. Downlink beamforming is possible when the base-station has multiple transmit antennas. The transmitted energy is directed to the preferable user so that the interference to other users is minimized. The frequency selective wideband channel is divided into a series of flat fading narrowband channels using OFDM. By doing this the ISI introduced by the wideband channel is mitigated. Two main systems are treated. One using multi-tap beamformers and one using single-tap beamformers. The single-tap beamformer system uses a single-tap beamformer on every sub-carrier of the OFDM system while the multi-tap beamformer system uses one multi-tap beamformer on the wideband channel after the OFDM scheme is applied. The single-tap system applies the beamformer in the frequency domain and the multi-tap system applies the beamformer in the time domain. In both systems perfect channel knowledge at the base-station is assumed. The single-tap system is proven to perform better than the multi-tap system, both in theory and by simulations. Waterfilling for OFDM systems is treated and some special techniques for multi-user waterfilling is covered and a joint beamforming and waterfilling algorithm is developed. The system performance in both the single- and multi-tap system is increased by the waterfilling.}

  abstract = {Lane departure crashes are the most serious crashes. They are responsible of 41% of all in-vehicle fatalities in USA [Pom99], and are often due to the drivers inattention. To prevent this kind of crashes, Lane Departure Warning Systems (LDWS) have been developed. Those systems warn the driver each time the vehicle crosses one of the lane boundaries. But those warnings are triggered regardless whether the driver is aware of what he is doing or not. So warnings are generated quite often and the redundant warnings bother the driver. An idea to suppress the redundant warnings is to detect if the driver is attentive.  This project tried to answer the two following questions: is it possible to detect if the driver is attentive only from vehicle based parameters? And if it is, how can this inattention detection be integrated in a LDWS? This project has been conducted at Scania, Sweden, in collaboration with Kalle Fagerberg. The distraction detection covers here two cases: drowsiness and distraction. However, this report only deals with the distraction detection part.  To answer the above questions, some experiments have been conducted on the road with several experienced drivers. The collected data has then been studied to see which parameters are affected by distraction. This study allowed us to select some parameters to create a distraction detection algorithm, working as a short term detection of inattention. This algorithm was tested by simulation on the collected data and showed quite good results.   The drowsiness detection, developed by Kalle Fagerberg and working as a long term detection of inattention, was combined with the distraction detection to create an inattention detection algorithm. This inattention detection was finally integrated with a lane departure warning algorithm in a global system called Adaptive Lane Departure Warning System. Tests on the road proved that the system was working in real time and simulations showed that it was able to suppress up to 70% of the redundant warnings, while keeping almost all the good warnings. }

  abstract = {This thesis describes the basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and investigates a newer method for detecting the MR signals, called Sensitivity Encoding, SENSE. It also simulates detector hardware specially adapted for pediatric brain imaging. MRI is an imaging tool widely used in clinical diagnosis of disease processes throughout the body and is based on the phenomena magnetic resonance. MRI uses the property that when certain nuclei are placed inside a static magnetic field they start to precess at a resonance frequency and absorb energy in the radio frequency range. When the nuclei return to their original state, they re-emit this energy in a detectable signal. In order to make images from these signals, the object being imaged is spatially encoded to frequency with magnetic field gradients. The signals are sampled directly into the frequency domain and then the Inverse 2D Fourier transform is applied to acquire the spatial image. It takes time to encode these signals and the scan time for a set of images can vary a lot and are normally around 5 to 10 minutes. To reduce the scan time SENSE was proposed in 1997, being able to reduce scan time with up to a factor of 4. SENSE uses the acquiring technique, parallel imaging, which means that the same signal is acquired with more than one detector (receiver coil), from different positions. The signal is acquired simultaneously and stored separately. The SENSE reconstruction technique then makes it possible to gain time by sampling fewer points. Fewer sample points over the same frequency domain will result in an aliasing effect when the inverse Fourier transform is applied and image pixel values will be superimposed. To unfold this overlapped image a least square problem is solved with the information gathered from the multiple detectors. The SENSE technique reduces scan time and improves Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the image. This thesis shows that SENSE is a highly effective way to reduce scan time. It also shows that receiver coils especially designed for pediatric imaging would improve image SNR, because SENSE receiver performance is highly dependent on the coil size, positioning and number of detectors used.}

They can change the way in which we think about medicine, sports and entertainment and how we experience them. The development of this technology will lead to a Body Area Network, where sensors placed in and around the body can communicate with the outside world using wireless networks and provide medical information. This project includes many research areas: biosensors, nanotechnology, wireless communication, system design technology, & In this work the simulation of the communication link is treated. With some limitations on the complexity of the system, an end-to-end model was derived, and implemented with Matlab. This model aims at testing different modulation techniques and system architectures, and compares their performances. In the early phase of the development of a Body Area Network, research groups are focusing on the very low power requirement of the sensors. The simulation environment we built in this thesis is a first tool for estimating the power consumption and make comparisons between different systems.}

Through different provocative reflex tests, the state of the autonomic nervous system can be assesssed.

This thesis will comprise the building of a prototype for the diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy with the aid of three cardiovascular reflextests. These tests try to provoke a response from the heart through different manoeuvres while the heart rate is measured. Through the use of HRV-analysis it is then possible to assess whether the patient is suffering the disease, and if so, how far it has progressed.      The measurement of the heart rate is done with a simple heart rate monitor from the field of sports medicine and the prototype is implemented in Matlab. }
