	of the art results on the MPQA corpus for the two problems, opinionated
	sentence recognition and opinion holder extraction. The results using
	the NTCIR-6 English corpus for both training and testing are certainly
	among the first ones. Our results on the opinionated sentence recognition
	sub-task of the NTCIR-6 were encouraging. The results on the English
	evaluation of the NTCIR-6 opinion analysis task were obtained from
	the models learned from the MPQA corpus. The lower results on the
	NTCIR-6 opinion holder extraction subtask, in comparison with those
	using each corpus for both training and testing, may possibly show
	that there exist substantial differences between the MPQA corpus
	and the NTCIR-6 English corpus},
