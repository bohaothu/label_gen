 abstract = {PDAs and mobile phones have become users main interactive media platform for
	digital information and services. Taking advantage of this development, the Agent
	Network for Bluetooth Devices uses personal mobile devices equipped with Bluetooth 
	connection capability as human\- environment interfaces to supply users with
	ad\- hoc information or services. Mobile agents are used for selecting information,
	composing dynamic networks, and defining service access modes.},
