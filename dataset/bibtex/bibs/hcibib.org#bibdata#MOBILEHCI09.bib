%X Speech and typed text are two common input modalities for mobile phones.
However, little research has compared them in their ability to support
annotation and retrieval of digital pictures on mobile devices. In this paper,
we report the results of a month-long field study in which participants took
pictures with their camera phones and had the choice of adding annotations
using speech, typed text, or both. Subsequently, the same subjects participated
in a controlled experiment where they were asked to retrieve images based on
annotations as well as retrieve annotations based on images in order to study
the ability of each modality to effectively support users' recall of the
previously captured pictures. Results demonstrate that each modality has
advantages and shortcomings for the production of tags and retrieval of
pictures. Several guidelines are suggested when designing tagging applications
for portable devices.

%X SenseCam is an automatic wearable camera, often seen as a tool for the
creation of digital memories. In this paper, we report findings from a field
trial in which SenseCams were worn by household members over the course of a
week. In interviews with these users, it became apparent that the way in which
SenseCam images were played back, the manner of which might be described as a
stilted movie, affected the values that were realised within them. The
time-lapse nature of the image stream led participants to romanticise the
mundane and find sentimentality in unexpected places, and was particularly
effective at portraying personality and play. In so doing, SenseCam images
enlivened the visual recording of everyday scenes. These values influenced what
the participants sought to capture and view, and have implications for
technologies that might support lifelogging or the development of
user-generated content.

%X In this paper we explore the design space of around-device interaction
(ADI). This approach seeks to expand the interaction possibilities of mobile
and wearable devices beyond the confines of the physical device itself to
include the space around it. This enables rich 3D input, comprising coarse
movement-based gestures, as well as static position-based gestures. ADI can
help to solve occlusion problems and scales down to very small devices. We
present a novel around-device interaction interface that allows mobile devices
to track coarse hand gestures performed above the device's screen. Our
prototype uses infrared proximity sensors to track hand and finger positions in
the device's proximity. We present an algorithm for detecting hand gestures and
provide a rough overview of the design space of ADI-based interfaces.

%X Interaction patterns with handheld mobile devices are constantly evolving.
Researchers observed that users prefer to interact with mobile device using one
hand. However, only few interaction techniques support this mode of operation.
We show that one-handed operations can be enhanced with coordinated interaction
using for input the front and back of a mobile device, which we term as
Dual-Surface interaction. We present some of the design rationale for
introducing coordinated Dual-Surface interactions. We demonstrate that several
tasks, including target selection, benefit from Dual-Surface input which allows
users to rapidly select small targets in locations that are less accessible
when interacting using the thumb with one-handed input. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the benefits of virtual enhancements that are possible with
behind-the-display relative input to perform complex tasks, such as steering.
Our results show that Dual-Surface interactions offer numerous benefits that
are not available with input on the front or the back alone.

%X Developing interfaces for mobile situations requires that devices are
useable on the move. Here, we explore head tilting as an input technique to
allow a user to interact with a mobile device 'hands free'. A Fitts' Law style
evaluation is described where a user acquires targets, moving the cursor by
head tilt. We explore d position and velocity control cursor mechanisms in both
static and mobile situations to see which provided the best level of
performance. Results show that participants could successfully acquire targets
using head tilting. Position control was shown to be significantly faster and
more accurate in a static context, but exhibited significantly poorer accuracy
and longer target acquisition times when the user was on the move. We further
demonstrate how analysis of user's gait shows consistent targeting biases at
different stages in the gait cycle.

%X As users enter web queries, real-time query expansion (RTQE) interfaces
offer suggestions based on an index garnered from query logs. In selecting a
suggestion, users can potentially reduce keystrokes, which can be very
beneficial on mobile devices with deficient input means. Unfortunately, RTQE
interfaces typically provide little assistance when only parts of an intended
query appear among the suggestion choices. In this paper, we introduce Phrase
Builder, an RTQE interface that reduces keystrokes by facilitating the
selection of individual query words and by leveraging back-off query techniques
to offer completions for out-of-index queries. We describe how we implemented a
small memory footprint index and retrieval algorithm, and discuss lessons
learned from three versions of the user interface, which was iteratively
designed through user studies. Compared to standard auto-completion and typing,
the last version of Phrase Builder reduced more keystrokes-per-character, was
perceived to be faster, and was overall preferred by users.

%X This paper describes the design and evaluation of a touch screen-based
pressure keyboard to investigate the possibilities of pressure as a new method
of input for mobile devices. A soft press on the touchscreen generated a
lowercase letter, a hard press an uppercase one. The aim was to improve input
performance when entering mixed-case text, or shifted characters often used for
emoticons, etc. An experiment compared two different forms of pressure input
(Dwell and Quick Release) against a standard shift key keyboard, with users
both sitting and walking. Results showed that Quick Release was the fastest for
input of mixed case text with Dwell being the most accurate, even when users
were mobile. The results demonstrate that pressure input can outperform a
standard shift-key keyboard design for mobile text entry.

%X This paper proposes Coupa, a novel pen interaction design to support
operations of users on portable devices. The design arranges a plurality of
labels on the interface, each of which has an identity. The user forms a
coupling by linking two graphical items together, and thus performs an action
dependent on the identities of the coupled items. During the course of
operation, any item on the screen is ready for linking and coupling. To reduce
mal-operations, two principles for linking are proposed, with their
effectiveness proved in the usability tests. Compared with traditional systems
with hierarchical menu structure and point-and-click interaction, the proposed
design prominently improves the efficiency and accuracy of pen-based systems
with enhanced usability.

%X A pressure sensing based single-handed interaction model is presented in
this paper. Unlike traditional desktop GUI model, mobile UI model has not been
established yet. For example, Apple iPhone proposed "Pinch" operation, which
use two fingers to zoom-in and zoom-out objects. However, in a today's
hand-held situation, manipulation methods using two fingers are not always good
solution because they require two hands in order to hold the device itself in
most cases. We propose a single-handed UI scheme "GraspZoom": multi-state input
model using pressure sensing. Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) attached on
backside of a mobile phone was employed in order to evaluate effectiveness of
pressure based control model. We also describe example applications which
enable intuitive and continuous zooming and scrolling. By using tiny thumb
gesture input along with this pressure sensing method, bi-directional
operations (e.g., zoom-in and -out) are also achieved.

cost approach to supporting the spontaneous discovery of geo-located
information. By sweeping a mobile device around their environment, users browse
for interesting information related to points of interest. We built a mobile
haptic prototype which encourages the user to explore their surroundings to
search for location information, helping them discover this by providing
directional vibrotactile feedback. Once potential targets are selected, the
interaction is extended to offer an hierarchy of information levels with a
simple method for filtering and selecting desired types of data for each
geo-tagged location. We describe and motivate our approach and present a short
field trial to situate our design in a real environment, followed by a more
detailed user study that compares it against an equivalent visual-based system.

%X Landmarks are a key element in navigation and have been used extensively to
provide navigation support to pedestrians through mobile devices in urban
areas. Natural environments differ significantly from built environments in a
number of ways including, for example, the degree of structure and regularity,
the types and density of landmarks, and the way in which people navigate in
those environments. In this paper, we investigate how people currently navigate
'in the wild', and whether landmark-based navigation support through mobile
devices is a feasible option in such settings. We present results from two
studies: a questionnaire-based study focussing on current practice and the use
of landmarks, and a qualitative lab-based study using immersive panoramic
photographs and photographs of (natural) landmarks investigating the
feasibility of landmark-based navigation support in natural environments. The
results indicate that a small number of means are currently used for navigation
in the wild, and that certain types of landmarks might be feasible for
navigation support on mobile devices. We also found initial evidence that
immersive panoramic photographs may constitute a promising way to evaluate
mobile applications.

%X In many mid- to large-sized cities public maps are ubiquitous. One can also
find a great number of maps in parks or near hiking trails. Public maps help to
facilitate orientation and provide special information to not only tourists but
also to locals who just want to look up an unfamiliar place while on the go.
These maps offer many advantages compared to mobile maps from services like
Google Maps Mobile or Nokia Maps. They often show local landmarks and sights
that are not shown on standard digital maps. Often these 'You are here' (YAH)
maps are adapted to a special use case, e.g. a zoo map or a hiking map of a
certain area. Being designed for a fashioned purpose these maps are often
aesthetically well designed and their usage is therefore more pleasant. In this
paper we present a novel technique and application called PhotoMap that uses
images of 'You are here' maps taken with a GPS-enhanced mobile camera phone as
background maps for on-the-fly navigation tasks. We discuss different
implementations of the main challenge, namely helping the user to properly
georeference the taken image with sufficient accuracy to support pedestrian
navigation tasks. We present a study that discusses the suitability of various
public maps for this task and we evaluate if these georeferenced photos can be
used for navigation on GPS-enabled devices.

%X We report a series of user studies that evaluate the feasibility and
usability of light-weight user authentication with a single tri-axis
accelerometer. We base our investigation on uWave, a state-of-the-art
recognition system for user-created free-space manipulation, or gestures. Our
user studies address two types of user authentication: non-critical
authentication (or identification) for a user to retrieve privacy-insensitive
data; and critical authentication for protecting privacy-sensitive data. For
non-critical authentication, our evaluation shows that uWave achieves high
recognition accuracy (98%) and its usability is comparable with text ID-based
authentication. Our results also highlight the importance of constraints for
users to select their gestures. For critical authentication, the evaluation
shows uWave achieves state-of-the-art resilience to attacks with 3% false
positives and 3% false negatives, or 3% equal error rate. We also show that the
equal error rate increases to 10% if the attackers see the users performing
their gestures. This shows the limitation of gesture-based authentication and
highlights the need for visual concealment.

in order to match the requirements on a risk information service with the
capabilities of the mobile phone and to evaluate different notification
mechanisms, the usage frequency, and the influence of costs. Based on the
results of the survey we confirm the suitability of the mobile phone to provide
risk-related information as well as the user's willingness to pay for the
service.

%X Mobile technologies, due to their ubiquitous nature, play an important role
in supporting health care. However, it is not easy to design useful integrated
mobile services without a systematic understanding of users, and this is
especially true for children. Therefore, we propose a new theoretical
perspective for generating design concepts in the early stage of the design
process. Our ecological model is based on Ecological Systems Theory which
approaches development in terms of the child's relationships and environmental
context. It leverages the fact that mobile technologies are deeply involved
with users' circumstances. We argue that the ecological model can provide a
heuristic to help researchers understand users' needs in context and generate
concepts logically and creatively. Here we explore pediatric asthma management
as a case study for this model. Finally, five promising mobile technology
concepts are provided as examples for further development of mobile
technologies related to pediatric asthma management.

%X An increasing number of households are equipped with a large number of TV
sets and more and more of them are large high-resolution displays. Furthermore,
we see the integration of web browsing and email functionalities in these
devices, which are then often controlled via a wireless mouse and keyboard. The
latter were rather designed for the usage on a desk, rather then by a person
sitting on their sofa in a living room. Therefore, this paper investigates the
usage of a PDA, as a replacement which can be used for controlling a remote
cursor and for text input. The results of the experimental comparison of these
input devices show, as expected, the superiority of mouse and keyboard (as the
study participants were very experienced with them). Surprising results were
the task completion time and usability satisfaction when using the mobile
device. These results show the applicability of using a mobile device for
controlling an application on a remote screen. Using a mobile device provides
the advantages that every person can e.g. use their own mobile phone or that
these devices can be used in multi-user scenarios.

usual design process for fixed technologies. In particular, it benefits greatly
from the ability to take the design process out of the lab, creating, designing
and evaluating applications within their natural usage context. However, this
process requires new and deeply refined approaches to traditional techniques
which are demanding and still avoided by designers. This paper presents a tool
that overcomes some of these issues by offering means to support in-situ
design. The tool supports prototyping of mobile applications and user
interfaces on real scenarios, also providing evaluation features that allow the
logging and analysis of usage information. We describe the tool's concept,
goals and design implications, focusing, in particular, its out-on-the-field,
in-situ design and prototyping features.

lessons for designing cycle-based interaction including: cycling proficiency,
physicality, impact of the environment, media and hardware design,

%X Touch-sensitive displays seem like a natural and promising option for
dealing with the increasing complexity of current in-vehicle information
systems (IVIS), but since they can hardly be used without visual attention
conventional point touch systems are rarely considered in cars. To ensure road
safety, the drivers' visual attention needs to be focused almost entirely to
the road. In order to integrate touch screens successfully into cars, new
concepts are needed to reduce visual demand. The adaptation of pie menus
serving as a visualisation of gestures reduces the user's cognitive load, and
we were able to achieve an almost blind interaction with the IVIS. We compared

%X Paper maps are a proven means for navigating in unfamiliar environments,
however, they do not prevent people from getting lost or taking unwanted
detours. A well-known issue is interpreting the map's geocentric content, which
is known to become prone to errors when the map is not aligned to the
environment. In this paper we report our investigation of providing a cue about
the destination's location from an egocentric perspective in order to improve
the interpretation of the map. We used a vibrotactile belt to continuously
indicate a destination's direction relative to the user's orientation. In an
outdoor field study we compared the performance of map-based navigation with
and without the added tactile cue. We found evidence that people take shorter
routes, consult the map less often, and were less often disoriented with the
tactile cue. Furthermore, females found the tactile cue more useful and used it
more often.

%X In this paper, we describe the design and ethnographic study of a phone
developed so as to allow people to glance at each other, rather than simply
message or voice call. Glancephones work through having a form factor that
allows them to be placed upright when a user wants to be available for
glancing, and support a web-based application that allows glances, bitmap
images, to be taken and sent to a remote viewer on request, via GPRS
connections. Glancephones were originally invented to allow callers to see if
it is appropriate to call or interrupt and thus act like normal glances in
face-to-face situations. Ethnographic studies of the use indicate that people
prefer using the devices not to support greeting sequences, however, but to
enable others to glance at them. It was found that Glacephones were used to
draw attention to oneself, not to encourage better control of interruption and
greeting sequences. The paper uses this data to remark on the concepts of human
expression that underscore much of the research reported in Mobile HCI, and it
proposes Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and relatedly, distinction, as
explanatory tools for this and other evidence about expression enabled by
mobile and other technologies of communication.

%X Whenever a pervasive game has to be developed for a group of children an
appropriate multi-user setting has to be found. If the pervasive game does not
support the children with an adequate multi-user setting, unintended situations
can emerge, such as a single user can dominate the game while the other users
are bored and disinterested. In our research we approach that problem by
investigating various multi-user settings that are characterized by a different
distribution of interaction devices. We describe three multi-user settings, a
pervasive game which we used as a test bed, and a user study with 18 children
to find out how the multiuser settings influence the children's social
behaviour as expressed by the level of activity for all group members, the
off-task behaviour and the level of task-related conversations.

%X The haptic modality -- the sense of touch -- is utilized very limitedly in
current human-computer interaction. Especially in mobile communication, the
haptic modality could provide a means for richer multimodal and emotional
communication between users over distance. Haptic user interface prototypes
have been developed but their user experience has not been studied extensively.
We conducted seven focus group sessions to study users' expectations for user
experience of haptic interaction, specifically focusing on mobile
communication. The paper presents the user experience factors that were
regarded by potential users as salient in haptic interaction: subjective
quality of the haptic stimuli, privacy, intimacy and spontaneity. Also the
possibilities, restrictions and suitability of the haptic mobile communication
are discussed. Most appropriate use cases for haptic communication were found
to be conveying emotions and binary information. As the main conclusion, we
present design guidelines for haptic mobile communication that were drawn up
based on the findings.

across the entire body that indicate how to move during physical activities.
This work investigates the perception and identification of such patterns,
based on two different metaphors, under stationary and active situations. We
further combine and sequentially trigger different patterns to explore whether
tactile motion instructions are understandable as a simple language. A tactile
language could represent motion sequences to guide students during demanding
exercises. Finally, the presented studies provide insights into perception and
interpretation of tactile feedback and help to inform a design space for
full-body vibrotactile cues.

%X In their role as personal communication devices, mobile phones are a natural
choice for sharing and communicating emotions. However, their functionalities
are currently very limited in power to express affective messages. In this
paper, we describe the design of a system that allows users to easily compose
melodies and share them via mobile phones. We show that by using these melodies
information about the current emotional state of the sender can be expressed
and recognized synchronously by the receiver in a simple, quick, and
unobtrusive way. Further, we reveal that self-composed melodies have a stronger
impact than pre-composed or downloaded messages, similar to crafted pieces of
art offered to a beloved person. We then present findings from a user study
that assesses the implementation of a functional prototype and the adequacy of
the system for emotional communication.

be used to operate home entertainment systems. This paper reports a subjective

significant differences on user expectations on and experiences with different
modalities. Speech input was received extremely well, even surpassing
expectations in some cases, while gestures and haptic feedback were almost
failing to meet the lowest expectations. The results can be applied for
designing similar multimodal applications in home environments.

users to interact with their thumb directly on the screen. Such kind of direct
approaches may be fussy for 3D interaction tasks, in particular because of
thumb occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a new 3D user interface for the
control of a planned trackball, where the users sketch horizontal or vertical
movements to observe an object. A user study revealed no significant difference
for error rate between this new approach and a standard trackball control.
Despite a better completion time with the direct control, the study showed that
the subjects preferred using the planned version of the trackball because it
limits disorientation.

songs. Browsing such libraries in mobile contexts is difficult due to
constraints of the context and devices. We explore the usage of physical
interaction with digital music to overcome these limitations. Our solution is
to utilize the physical orientation of a mobile device as a tool for exploring
music. We focus on allowing users to manage their music for easier mobile
access. We present a novel bimanual interaction method for mapping items from a
music library into different orientations of the mobile device. An experiment
was conducted to test our prototype, focusing on efficiency and impact on
users' ability to recall locations of items in the mapping. The interaction
method was found to be significantly faster than using a touch screen without
the mobile device. Subjectively users valued the bimanual method in ease of
use, efficiency, and pleasantness.

channel. In this paper we describe the results of a six-month field trial where
27 users were evaluating commercially available mobile TV services and 10
different pilot services. Mobile TV found a role in the everyday lives of the
users as an extension to ordinary TV. The users appreciated easy and continuous
access to TV contents. The results highlight that short usage situations
typical to mobile TV use are hindering the adoption of new add-on services. The
adoption can be supported by using content, appearance or functionality
familiar from other media. The main problems with add-on services were related
to knowing about the mere existence of these services and their contents as
well as understanding the concept of services available only during a certain
TV show.

%X In this paper we report on the first study of the uses of mobile video
telephony based on the collection and analysis of naturally occurring mobile
video telephony. We show how a characteristic feature of mobile video
telephony, which makes it differ from any other kind of mediated interaction,
is that: a) the participants may orient the camera at will to shoot almost any
feature within their environment; and b) what they actually show at a given
moment may be (and usually is) inspected by the recipient for its relevance to
the ongoing interaction, and is produced with an orientation towards such
scrutiny. A specific concern of mobile video call users at any time is
therefore what they should or should not show. We demonstrate how a partial
solution to that problem is the reliance on a particular (full) portrait-like
'talking heads' format as an expected default mode for interaction in mobile
video calls. Finally, we discuss the implications, for design, of such an
empirically grounded understanding of the specific practical concerns of mobile
video telephony users.

%X Exchanging data between a mobile phone and a computer such as a laptop is
still a very cumbersome process. This paper presents two different techniques,
touch & connect and touch & select, designed help to overcome this problem and
facilitate and speed up spontaneous interactions between such devices. Using
touch & connect, the user can physically touch a computer in order to pair a
Bluetooth connection and initiate a file transfer between these two devices.
Touch & select extends this concept in that users can select a specific object
or location on the computer screen by simply touching it with the mobile phone.
We report the implementation of these interaction techniques based on Near
Field Communication (NFC) tags and present a formal, comparative study focusing
on transferring images. The results provide clear evidence of the advantages of
touch & connect and touch & select when compared with current Bluetooth-based
implementations. Considering task completion time for uploading and downloading
pictures, touch &amp; select was 43% and touch & connect 31% faster than the
conventional Bluetooth-based approach.

and research has presented a variety of applications using NFC/RFID tags for
interaction between physical objects and mobile devices. Since this type of
interaction is widely novel for most users, there is a considerable initial
inhibition threshold for them. In order to get novice users started with this
physical interaction and its applications, we have designed different ways to
increase the learnability and guidance of such applications. Their
effectiveness was evaluated in a qualitative and quantitative user study with
40 participants, who interacted with NFC-equipped posters in different ways. We
report on the types of usage errors observed and show that future designs of
NFC/RFID-based mobile applications should consider using a dedicated start-tag
for interaction.

%X We conducted a user study to investigate the effect of visual context in
handheld augmented reality interfaces. A dynamic peephole interface (without
visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens
interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The
task was to explore objects on a map and look for a specific attribute shown on
the display. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different
numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. We found that visual
context is most effective for sparse item distributions and the performance
benefit decreases with increasing density. User performance in the magic lens
case approaches the performance of the dynamic peephole case the more densely
spaced the items are. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that
participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The
insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and
dynamic peephole interfaces by suggesting when external visual context is most
beneficial.

(and respective implementation details) of the touch & connect and touch &

exchange of pictures by touching the computer with the mobile device. The first
interaction technique: touch & connect, allows the user to touch a computer
with their mobile phone in order to establish a Bluetooth connection and
initiate a file transfer between the two devices. The second interaction
technique: touch & select, extends this concept and allows the selection of a
specific picture or location on the computer screen by touching it with the
mobile phone. The interaction techniques were implemented using Near Field

%X Cycling is a common leisure time sports in touristic regions. For us it was
the question how tourists actually find their paths in the area and what kind
of navigation aids might be helpful to them. In a requirements study on a
touristic island we learned that tourists rather explore the environment
spontaneously than efficiently navigating from on place to another such as the
beach or the light house, and just cycle on without much map or navigation aid.
While exploring the area, the cyclists however, sometimes lose their
orientation which they compensate for by accepting detours. We designed and
developed an orientation aid, Tacticycle that does not influence the cycling
experience but improve the orientation and awareness of the overall direction.
In order to ensure the cyclists' safety two vibrotactile actuators are used to
indicate directions and announce the presence of interesting places. In two
field studies we showed that despite the accuracy of the indicated direction
being rather coarse, the tactile user interface allows cyclists to reach a
presented destination easily. The visitor of the demo can experience a virtual
cycling tour supported by the Tacticycle demonstrator.

allows for rich 3D input, comprising coarse movement-based hand gestures, as
well as static position-based gestures. A demonstration application, HoverFlow,
illustrates the use of coarse hand gestures for interaction with mobile
applications. This type of interaction, which we call Around-Device Interaction
(ADI) has the potential to help to solve occlusion problems on small-screen
mobile devices and scales well to small device sizes.

%X Viewing and sharing media on mobile devices are popular scenarios, however,
the limited screen size results in multiple users having to gather around a
single display leading to an undesirable viewing experience. Similarly, sharing
a single image with a single person is cumbersome and requires several steps to
complete. This demonstration paper presents an approach in which a mobile phone
is coupled with a personal projector to overcome the output limitations of
mobile phones. The large mobile projected display allows several users to
simultaneously view media. We also present a group based sharing approach
allowing users to intuitively and easily share media between mobile devices. We
reverse the typical role of sharing and introduce a technique whereby the
receiver of the media is responsible for performing the sharing interaction.
This allows sharing with a single member or multiple members of the group.
Sharing with every member of the group is also easily possible.

%X Information empowers those who make sense from its successful
interpretation; this is especially true on the subject of weather where the
recipient is required to have prior forms of fundamental understanding towards
the natural occurring phenomenon and its effects. This study facilitates the
learning of complex weather phenomena for children using a unique educational
approach using mobile technology. The initiative runs under Singapore's
National Weather Study Project (NWSP), which already operates a network of mini
weather stations in schools across the state to promote environmental awareness
and support dynamic interactions with real time data. Its data is accessible
via Web, Microsoft SensorMap and Google Earth interfaces. IWIS, an application
for the recent Google Android mobile platform taps onto the fusion of mapping
and the weather project server's data to present to children accessible local
multi-variate weather data depicted using visual metaphors and propagates the
development of mobile learning applications in the imminent future.

%X Based on a consideration of usage and technological computing trends, we
reflect on the implications of cloud computing on mobile interaction with
applications, data and devices. We argue that by extending the interaction
capabilities of the mobile device by connecting it to external peripherals, new
mobile contexts of personal (and social) computing can emerge, thus creating
novel contexts of mobile interaction. In such a scenario, mobile devices can
act as context-adaptive information filters. We then present Focus, our work in
progress on a context-adaptive UI, which we can demonstrate at the MobileHCI
demo session as a clickable dummy on a mobile device.

traditional video navigation techniques, PocketDRAGON does not require any
overlay UI elements that occupy valuable screen real estate and obstruct the
users' view on the video. Also, direct manipulation video navigation techniques
have been shown to compare favorably to the established timeline slider
interfaces in terms of performance times, intuitiveness, precision, and
perceived ease of use. Our demonstrator system still uses a backend server for
the computationally expensive parts of the algorithms but delivers the
full-fledged user experience on the mobile device.

%X Exploration and navigation in multimedia data hierarchies (e.g., photos,
music) are frequent tasks on mobile devices. However, visualization and
interaction are impoverished due to the limited size of the screen and the lack
of precise input devices. As a result, menus on mobile devices do not provide
efficient navigation as compared to many innovative menu techniques proposed
for Desktop platforms. In this paper, we present Wavelet, the adaptation of the
Wave menu for the navigation in multimedia data on iPhone. Its layout, based on
an inverted representation of the hierarchy, is particularly well adapted to
mobile devices. Indeed, it guarantees that submenus are always displayed on the
screen and it supports efficient navigation by providing previsualization of
the submenus.

%X Mobile devices are becoming more and more difficult to use due to the sheer
number of functions now supported. In this paper, we propose a menu
customization system that ranks functions so as to make interesting functions,
both frequently used functions and rarely used functions, easy to access.
Concretely, we define the features of phone functions by extracting keywords
from the manufacturer's manual, and propose the method that ranks the functions
based on user operation history by using Ranking SVM (Support Vector Machine).
We conduct a home-use test for one week to evaluate the efficiency of
customization and the usability of menu customization. The results show that
the average rank of used functions on the last day of the test is half of that
of first day and almost 70% of the users are satisfied with the ranking
provided by menu customization and the usability of menus. In addition,
interviews show that automatic mobile menu customization is more appropriate
for mobile phone beginner rather than the master users.

%X Thanks to the development in the field of minicomputers high resolution
photo realistic maps can be shown in real time on car navigation systems. These
graphics are aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. However, they also have a
high impact on the user's cognitive load so the effort for their usage rises.
   This paper describes an approach for the integration of complex maps in car
navigation systems without harming its function. Referring to an empirical
research, we can support the thesis that the function of a map and its
aesthetic perception heavily depends on the user's situational cognitive load.
This thesis is confirmed by the Cognitive load theory. In the following, we
introduce a concept for the adaptation of a map's function and its design
according to the changing situations in the automotive context.

%X Returns caused by the delivery of incorrect items constitute a major problem
for non-automated warehouses. Returns not only create extra costs, they also
aggravate customers. Most errors in logistics occur during the picking process.
MICA -- a mobile assistance system for warehouse workers -- unobtrusively
navigates the worker on his way through the warehouse and effectively prevents
picking errors using RFID technology. Therefore, MICA reduces error rates, job
training periods, and the time required for picking and packing, leading to
lower costs for warehouse operators and increased customer satisfaction.
   In this paper you will read about a case study where the MICA prototype was
field-tested in the warehouse of a medium-sized enterprise.

more risky and more efficient or safer and less efficient use of the system. We
discuss this tradeoff and present a novel complementary experimental system
which provides researchers and corporations the ability to explore and model
the usability and security tradeoff in the context of user interaction with
security systems and psychological acceptability, even before the actual
development and implementation processes have ended.

Thereby, to analyse the requirement of the future users of learning programmes
to be designed is fundamental since little about their characteristics and
needs is known. A triangulation of data, consisting of academic literature
review, expert interview data and focus group data, led to valuable
conclusions.

more errors with Chinese HWR solutions than VKB solutions although there are no
significant differences between the two solutions in each category. Users are
significantly slower with the consonant plus vowel pinyin keyboard than the
other three solutions although the consonant plus vowel keyboard is better on
the measure of key stroke per character (KSPC).

marker at the top end of a controller device attached to the embedded camera.
In contrast to the conventional keypad which enables limited operability to
four discrete directions, the proposed controller brings not only an
unconstrained continuous input to arbitrary directions but also continuous
input for depth and for a rotation angle. In order to evaluate operability, we
conducted a user experiment of time trial for path tracing, and the results
showed that the subjects completed the task with the proposed controller in
27.9% less than with the conventional keypad input.

%X Gesture based interfaces provide a new way for us to interact with mobile
devices, but also require us to make new decisions about how we feel about this
new technology and which gestures we decide are usable and appropriate. These
decisions are based on the social and public settings where these devices are
used on a daily basis. Our ideas about which gestures are socially acceptable
or not are an important factor in whether or not these gestures will be
adopted. The ways in which users evaluate social acceptability is not only
highly variable, but with drastically different results amongst different
users. These differences are not dependant on factors such as age, gender,
occupation, geographic location, or previous technology usage. Future work into
the social acceptability perceptions of users will focus on personality traits
as a new way of understanding how social acceptability is determined.

beyond formbased applications, we argue that the approach comes especially at
hand when used in the context of modular reconfigurable mobile games: The
interfaces fusion can simplify the generation of complex adaptable game UIs and
form an integral aspect of a mobile game development kit.

%X Browsing the Web on mobile phones has finally hit the mass. The
visualization of websites on latest mobile phone models comes close to what we
are used from desktop computers. Tailoring websites for mobile phones seems to
be not mandatory anymore. But still the small display size limits the user
experience when browsing the web on these devices. As a result although access
to the full web is reasonably well working a tendency to providing additional
versions of mobile optimized versions of websites can be observed. This paper
presents a multidimensional study where usage scenarios as well as the
usability of mobile tailored compared to full websites were investigated. The

optimized versions. However content providers sometimes do not understand the
mobile scenarios in which their sites are used and consequently begin
optimizing the functionality at the wrong end.

%X Museums often use mobile devices and applications to let visitors explore
their exhibits and interact with them in order to make the user experience more
immersive and enjoyable. This paper presents a mobile museum guide based on the
physical interaction with a dynamic NFC-display, consisting of a grid of
NFC-tags and a projected GUI. Visitors can browse tours on the public display,
download them onto their mobile devices and use them for the exploration of the
museum. The paper presents the design of the museum guide, a first prototype
and a preliminary evaluation of its usability and the interaction with a
dynamic NFC-display.

approach works well for many tasks, it is not as useful for unconstrained
situations in which user goals and spatial landscapes are more fluid, such as
festivals or conferences. In this paper we describe the design and iteration of
the Kartta system, which we developed to answer a slightly different question:
"What are the most interesting areas here and how do I find them?"

game that combines mobile phone gestures and multi-touch tabletop interactions.
Conceptually based on interactions in traditional card games, our Poker game
application explores different natural ways of interaction, including touching
the table as well as tilting, throwing, and shaking a mobile phone. By
exemplarily translating traditional gestures into the digital domain, we
provide a use case to discuss useful gestures combing mobile phones with
tabletop surfaces, as well as to explore a private-public display setting for
digital card games at interactive tables. Additionally, the mobile phone
provides a tangible feeling similar to physical cards. The preliminary user
study showed that users preferred using mobile phones for interaction compared
to direct interaction on the multi-touch table.

%X Substantial research effort has been devoted to the design of mobile tourist
guides. Although a lot of these guides already provide some naturalness and
intelligence in the interaction with users, their user interfaces are mostly
object-based. In this article we will argue that, due to the users' limited
attention capacity and the great variety of tasks they have to perform on their
trips, more emphasis should be put on the integration of tasks within the
users' context of activity. Based on the preliminary results of a qualitative
user & task analysis, we suggest concrete guidelines and a task hierarchy for a
mobile tourist guide UI.

runners. We introduce entertaining and inspiring community notes that convey
emotional messages from other sportsmen who exercise on the same track. The
design and evaluation of Mobota provides an insight into the specifics of
visual and auditory design of running assistants.

%X Evaluating the user experience of mobile and ubiquitous applications is a
challenging task. They are becoming increasingly complex and tightly interwoven
into the fabric of everyday life and thus cannot easily be taken out of context
and evaluated in controlled experimental environments. Methods for studying the
user experience of such applications in the field tend to be cumbersome and
expensive with regard to time and manpower, and they generally do not scale
well with number of users and duration of studies. RECON addresses these
challenges and provides an addition to the methodological and practical toolbox
from which researchers and practitioners can draw when conducting field
experiments. It facilitates automated capture of general usage and application
specific interaction augmented with information about the context in which it
occurs. RECON enables researchers and practitioners to conduct large scale
remote studies of mobile and ubiquitous applications in real contexts.

mobile workers on-site in an unobtrusive manner. In this contribution, wearable

wearable computing technologies are checked against the requirements of the
application area to come to an usable and acceptable mobile solution in an

%X Older adults often struggle with everyday technology which is not designed
to accommodate their special needs and adapted to their specific cognitive,
sensory and motor abilities. Recently, a new generation of mobile devices has
been equipped with multitouch and acceleration sensors that allow for novel
ways of interacting with these devices. Interaction occurs through gestures,
such as finger movements on the device surface or movement patterns of the
device itself, which trigger the device functions. It remains unclear, however,
whether this gesture-based interaction indeed facilitates technology
interaction, especially with regard to elderly users, or whether it further
decreases accessibility and usability of such devices for this user group. In
the present study we compare younger and older users on a set of 42 simple
gestures with varying complexity and available gesture space regarding accuracy
and velocity scales. Results indicate that older users are slower, but not
necessarily less accurate, and that further factors such as familiarity can
influence gesture performance differentially for older and younger users.

%X Contact lists are one of the most frequently used applications on mobile
devices. They are used not only as contact detail repositories, but also as
temporary information storage for unrelated items, such as PINs or passwords.
Users are reluctant to delete or remove contacts from their repositories. As
such, these become increasingly large, sometimes measuring several hundred
entries. In this paper we present our findings from early investigations into
the use of mobile Contact Lists. We also propose a context oriented design
framework to aid the speed and efficacy of the information seeking and
retrieval process during the use of the Contact List application.

be used by any member of the public and then redesigned the system given
continuous feedback from three sets of local authority workers who were just
about to commence a walking led scheme. We logged their activity over a week

the design process of mobile applications. The "Mobile Oracle", as we have
called it, is intended to help developers and designers obtain a better
understanding of what the user wants at different points in space and time. It
is an extension of a lo-fi version of the well-established Wizard of Oz
technique, but it adds an "on demand" component to force users to explicitly
request the information they need. The technique has been tested in an
investigation involving 15 users (sighted, visually impaired, and elderly). Our
preliminary results show it to generate valuable information concerning the
ways people ask about directions and distances, as well as the services they
would like to have in future mobile applications.

to reveal users' individual preferences and methods for mobile device
personalization; to find out to which extent users have already adopted the

of location-based idle screens. Using our new interaction concept for a mobile
device, we found out that participants perceive the possibility to personalize
their mobile phones as important due to emotional bonding reasons with their
mobile device and still the method of touch based interaction has not been
fully adopted.

them in terms of their relatedness; the mobile device displays pictographic
cards according to the priority. This system can help people who have
speech-language difficulties by reducing the searching time and difficulties,

profits are no longer gained with standard services like voice calls or SMS but
with data services (e.g. Mobile TV or Location based services). Lots of these
services are not initially successful even though their high level of usability
was pre-estimated by means of traditional test procedures. Hence there is a
huge demand for a method to examine individuals' adoption and usage decisions
that provides acceptance explanations that are valid regarding reality not only

devices and services, for the accessing, making, and sharing of information,
taking into account the dynamic physical and social settings that embrace this
interaction. To narrow down this theme, the whole project focuses on the
exploitation of social interaction -- in particular among senior citizens -- to
enhance and support mobile interaction.

%X The goal of this research is the establishment of a usable and accessible
mobile learning system for the inclusion of both blind and vision-impaired
students within mainstream education through independent, collaborative and
ubiquitous mobile learning environments. An essential component of this work is
the enhancement of the field to enable all students to work successfully
together despite vision disabilities for the achievement of a learning outcome.
   Given the advancements in mobile technologies, and the personal nature of
mobile devices, there is a lot to be gained, especially for the
vision-impaired, by harnessing new technologies for education. Some
technological advances can increase the divide between such students and their
fully sighted peers. However the incorporation of technologies such as the
accelerometer, now standard within many modern mobile phones, provides an
opportunity to develop new inclusive mobile learning applications.
   The accelerometer could enable us to present a vision impaired student with
the capability to successfully play and interact directly with their fully
sighted peers within a collaborative game to achieve a single outcome. This
could be achieved without the heavy reliance on visual interfaces that were a
necessary part of earlier mLearning models. The student would interact with the
game through specific movements of their mobile handheld device. The device,
for example, would be moved in one direction to give a specific command, while
tilting and shaking the device would be used to command separate specific
functions of the game. The student's interaction through the accelerometer
could be enhanced through the provision of both haptic and audio feedback as
they twist and tilt the handheld mobile device to interact with a learning
game, removing altogether the need for the incorporation of a visual interface.
The incorporation of wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, would allow for
the provision of a collaborative environment for mobile learning, allowing all
students to communicate via their handheld device, regardless of the
disabilities faced by individual learners.
   Providing the ability to create an engaging, level playing field for such
students could reduce the digital divide currently in existence for the future
success of mobile learning environments.

%X Every day about 1 million people become mobile phone users -- 85% of these
live in the developing world. The biggest potential of future mobile
development will not be in the already saturated 1st economy market but in the
market of about one billion potential mobile users in emerging economies. In
contrast to the impressive rise of mobile phone usage, the mobile services and
applications provided for this new market are far behind expectations. Due to
infrastructural (low, erratic and expensive bandwidth, low end devices) and
social (illiteracy, novice ICT users) impediments a copy&amp;paste approach of
well known application and architecture concepts from the 1st economy will not
work. My research goal is the development of a Mobile Application Framework
(MAF) containing guidelines, concepts, and best practices to provide novice IT
users in rural areas of emerging economies with the most appropriate access to
ICT according to the infrastructural and cultural impediments.

theoretical framework for mobile attachment together with influencing factors
that indicate user's emotional attachment (EA) to mobile devices and services.
I investigate how the concept of user experience (UX) and EA are linked
together and I outline how user behavior driven experience sampling can be
exploited to measure mobile attachment. My research will result in design
suggestions how the creation of EA to mobile devices and services can be
facilitated.

%X In this workshop we are interested in usability, context and user practices
related to uses of social mobile media for sharing human experiences. There is
a growing trend pointing to life publishing and life logging using mobile
devices. Users are sharing their experiences and their life with friends in
real-time by posting blog notes, images and video clips from their phones to
social media services. In addition, people are tagging content either by
manually or using sensory data with their phones. An interesting question to be
asked is; How users are experiencing these applications and what issues make
them to be successfully adopted? This workshop will offer an interdisciplinary
discussion forum for both practitioners and academics interested in
conceptualizing, designing and evaluating emerging social mobile media concepts
and applications. The workshop, through a series of interactive presentations,
will facilitate discussions aiming at identify and summarize main theoretical
and interaction design concerns related to the increasing use of social mobile
media in a variety of settings. The main goal of the workshop is to find out
ideas that suggest promising directions for future research on social mobile
media.

%X With the proliferation of pervasive devices and the increase in their
processing capabilities, client-side speech processing has been emerging as a
viable alternative.
   SiMPE 2009, the fourth in the series, will continue to explore issues,
possibilities, and approaches for enabling speech processing as well as
convenient and effective speech and multimodal user interfaces. One of our
major goals for SiMPE 2009 is to increase the participation of
speech/multimodal HCI designers, and increase their interactions with speech
processing experts.
   Multimodality got more attention in SiMPE 2008 than it has received in the
previous years. In SiMPE 2007 [3], the focus was on developing regions. Given
the importance of speech in developing regions, SiMPE 2008 had "SiMPE for
developing regions" as a topic of interest. We think of this as a key emerging
area for mobile speech applications, and will continue this in 2009 as well.

physical location or social setting in which the interaction occurs, but rather
about situating the media within a community of practice. This workshop will
provide the environment for researchers to explore the potential for locative
media applications to support community practices. The workshop will highlight
the many open areas that require research attention, identify key problems that
need to be addressed, and also discuss approaches for solving these issues. In
particular the workshop will focus on appropriate methodologies for identifying
requirements, evaluating behaviour and integrating locative media in specific
real-world community structures.

%X The workshop on Mobile Interaction with the Real World (MIRW 2009) will
invite papers which focus on new mobile and wearable input and output
interfaces which allow simpler and straightforward interactions with mobile
services and applications. An inherit problem of current mobile devices are
their limited output and input capabilities. This workshop continues a
successful series of workshops (2006-2008) that focus on new approaches to
overcome these issues. Examples are the usage of external visual interfaces
(e.g. projector phones, public displays, interactive surfaces) and additional
input capabilities (e.g. gestures, on-body interfaces, pointing) and innovative
feedback mechanisms (e.g. tactile feedback). The workshop combines technical
presentations with the presentation of prototypes and focused discussions to
drive interaction between participants.

prototypes in real-life settings. In other words, the lab is brought to the
people. This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to
share experiences and issues with methods and tools for Mobile Living Labs. In
particular, we seek to bring together people who have applied methods for
Mobile Living Labs and people who build tools for those methods.
   The aim of the workshop is twofold. First, to make an up-to-date overview of
current methods and tools for conducting user studies in Mobile Living Labs --
highlighting their individual strengths and weaknesses. Second, to uncover
challenges that are not adequately addressed by current methods and tools and
to come up with ideas and requirements that could fill this gap thus serving as
beacons for further research and development in this area.

domains (neuroscience, psychology, medicine, criminology and more recently in
user experience research). This workshop addresses multidisciplinary
approaches, discussing ways of implementing mobile research about emotions.
Particularly, this workshop aims to improve the assessment of emotions in the
mobile context of field research. The workshop addresses particularly the
state-of-the-art in emotion measurement and investigates the possibilities to
apply and adopt these methods in the field of mobile HCI.
