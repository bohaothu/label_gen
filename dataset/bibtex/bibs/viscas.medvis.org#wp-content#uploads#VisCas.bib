  volume = {11},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {The main advantages of robot-assisted orthopedic surgery over conventional
	orthopedic techniques are improved accuracy and precision in the
	preparation of bone surfaces, more reliable and reproducible outcomes,
	and greater spatial accuracy. Orthopedic surgery is ideally suited
	for the application of robotic systems. The ability to isolate and
	rigidly fix bones in known positions allows robotic devices to be
	securely fixed to the bone. As such, the bone is treated as a fixed
	object, simplifying the computer control of the robotic system. Commercially
	available robotic systems can be categorized as either passive or
	active devices, or can be categorized as positioning or milling/cutting
	devices. Computer assisted orthopedic surgery is a related area of
	technological development in orthopedics; however, robot-assisted
	orthopedic surgery can achieve levels of accuracy, precision, and
	safety not capable with computer assisted orthopedic surgery. Applications
	of robot-assisted orthopedic surgery currently under investigation
	include total hip and knee replacement, tunnel placement for reconstruction
	of knee ligaments, and trauma and spinal procedures. Several short-term
	studies demonstrate the feasibility of robotic applications in orthopedics,
	however, there are no published long-term data defining the efficacy
	of robotassisted orthopedic surgery. Issues of cost, training, and
	safety must be addressed before robot-assisted orthopedic surgery
	becomes widely available. Robot-assisted orthopedic surgery is still
	very much in its infancy but it has the potential to transform the
	way orthopedic procedures are done in the future.},

	the potential to become an important clinical evaluation method.
	However, no standardized protocol for clinical application has yet

	problems include the lack of a single representative function, the
	wide range of motion of joints and the complexity of the anatomical
	structures. A useful protocol would focus on the functional status
	of the arm and particularly the orientation of the hand. The aim
	of this work was to develop a standardized measurement method for
	unconstrained movement analysis of the UX that includes hand orientation,
	for a set of functional tasks for the UX and obtain normative values.
	Ten healthy subjects performed four representative activities of
	daily living (ADL). In addition, six standard active range of motion
	(ROM) tasks were executed. Joint angles of the wrist, elbow, shoulder
	and scapula were analyzed throughout each ADL task and minimum/maximum
	angles were determined from the ROM tasks. Characteristic trajectories
	were found for the ADL tasks, standard deviations were generally
	small and ROM results were consistent with the literature. The results
	of this study could form the normative basis for the development
	of a 'UX analysis report' equivalent to the 'gait analysis report'

  abstract = {Surgical approaches tailored to an individual patient's anatomy and
	pathology have become standard in neurosurgery. Precise preoperative
	planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an
	optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging
	modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy,
	neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional
	perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still
	done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization
	of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly.
	In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual
	neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal
	volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules
	which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of
	the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial
	brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific
	approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is
	based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where
	multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently
	at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided
	by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks
	such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are
	integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow
	of preoperative planning.},

	head on shoulder biomechanics and then to evaluate the benefits of
	an anatomical reconstruction of the humeral head after shoulder arthroplasty.
	Design. A 3D numerical model of a healthy shoulder was reconstructed.
	The model included the proximal humerus, the scapula and, for stability
	purposes, the subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus rotator
	cuff muscles. Background. Shoulder prostheses used nowadays, called
	third generation, allow for a better adaptation of the implant to
	the anatomy of the proximal humerus than previously used implants.
	However, no biomechanical study has shown the benefits of this anatomical
	reconstruction of the humeral head. Methods. The model was used to
	compare the biomechanics of a shoulder without implant with the biomechanics
	of the same shoulder after humeral hemiarthroplasty. Two humeral
	components were tested: a second-generation prosthesis and an implant
	with an anatomically reconstructed humeral head. Results. The anatomical
	reconstruction of the humeral head restored the physiological motions
	and limited eccentric loading of the glenoid. Conversely, the second-generation
	implant produced contact forces in the superior extremity of the
	glenoid surface leading to bone stresses up to 8 times higher than
	for the intact shoulder. Conclusions. This analysis provided insights
	into the mechanical effects of different reconstructions of the humeral
	head and highlighted the advantages of anatomical reconstructions
	of the humeral head during shoulder arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {A connected network of blood vessels surrounds and permeates almost
	every organ of the human body. The ability to define detailed blood
	vessel trees enables a variety of clinical applications. This paper
	discusses four such applications and some of the visualization challenges
	inherent to each. Guidance of endovascular surgery: 3D vessel trees
	offer important information unavailable by traditional x-ray projection
	views. How best to combine the 2- and 3D image information is unknown.
	Planning/guidance of tumor surgery: During tumor resection it is
	critical to know which blood vessels can be interrupted safely and
	which cannot. Providing efficient, clear information to the surgeon
	together with measures of uncertainty in both segmentation and registration
	can be a complex problem. Vessel-based registration: Vessel-based
	registration allows pre-and intraoperative images to be registered
	rapidly. The approach both provides a potential solution to a difficult
	clinical dilemma and offers a variety of visualization opportunities.
	Diagnosis/staging of disease: Almost every disease affects blood
	vessel morphology. The statistical analysis of vessel shape may thus
	prove to be an important tool in the noninvasive analysis of disease.
	A plethora of information is available that must be presented meaningfully
	to the clinician. As medical image analysis methods increase in sophistication,
	an increasing amount of useful information of varying types will
	become available to the clinician. New methods must be developed
	to present a potentially bewildering amount of complex data to individuals
	who are often accustomed to viewing only tissue slices or flat projection
	views.},

	eight hepatic resection procedures. Preoperative tomographic image
	data were acquired and processed. Accompanying intraoperative data
	on liver shape and position were obtained through optically tracked
	probes and laser range scanning technology. The preoperative and
	intraoperative representations of the liver surface were aligned
	using the iterative closest point surface matching algorithm. Surface
	registrations resulted in mean residual errors from 2 to 6 mm, with
	errors of target surface regions being below a stated goal of 1 cm.
	Issues affecting registration accuracy include liver motion due to
	respiration, the quality of the intraoperative surface data, and
	intraoperative organ deformation. Respiratory motion was quantified
	during the procedures as cyclical, primarily along the cranial–caudal
	direction. The resulting registrations were more robust and accurate
	when using laser range scanning to rapidly acquire thousands of points
	on the liver surface and when capturing unique geometric regions
	on the liver surface, such as the inferior edge. Finally, finite
	element models recovered much of the observed intraoperative deformation,

	image segmentation, their usefulness has been limited by two problems.
	First, 3D level sets are relatively slow to compute. Second, their
	formulation usually entails several free parameters which can be
	very difficult to correctly tune for specific applications. The second
	problem is compounded by the first. This paper describes a new tool
	for 3D segmentation that addresses these problems by computing level-set
	surface models at interactive rates. This tool employs two important,
	novel technologies. First is the mapping of a 3D level-set solver
	onto a commodity graphics card (GPU). This mapping relies on a novel
	mechanism for GPU memory management. The interactive rates level-set
	PDE solver give the user immediate feedback on the parameter settings,
	and thus users can tune free parameters and control the shape of
	the model in real time. The second technology is the use of intensity-based
	speed functions, which allow a user to quickly and intuitively specify
	the behavior of the deformable model. We have found that the combination
	of these interactive tools enables users to produce good, reliable
	segmentations. To support this observation, this paper presents qualitative
	results from several different datasets as well as a quantitative

  abstract = {This paper addresses the prediction of face soft tissue deformations
	resulting from bone repositioning in maxillofacial surgery. A generic
	3D Finite Element model of the face soft tissues was developed. Face
	muscles are defined in the mesh as embedded structures, with different
	mechanical properties (transverse isotropy, stiffness depending on
	muscle contraction). Simulations of face deformations under muscle
	actions can thus be performed. In the context of maxillofacial surgery,
	this generic soft-tissue model is automatically conformed to patient
	morphology by elastic registration, using skin and skull surfaces
	segmented from a CT scan. Some elements of the patient mesh could
	be geometrically distorted during the registration, which disables
	Finite Element analysis. Irregular elements are thus detected and
	automatically regularized. This semi-automatic patient model generation
	is robust, fast and easy to use. Therefore it seems compatible with
	clinical use. Six patient models were successfully built, and simulations
	of soft tissue deformations resulting from bone displacements performed
	on two patient models. Both the adequation of the models to the patient
	morphologies and the simulations of post-operative aspects were qualitatively
	validated by five surgeons. Their conclusions are that the models
	fit the morphologies of the patients, and that the predicted soft
	tissue modifications are coherent with what they would expect.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a technique for converting computed tomography
	(CT) data into a fully three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR)
	environment. Preoperative simulation in 3D VR facilitates liver resection
	owing to the ability to view the tumor and its relative vessels.
	METHODS: 3D-reconstruction of the liver was restored from spiral
	CT data by using LiVirtue software and the Dextrobeam (Volume Interactions
	Pte Ltd, Singapore) was applied to view this 3D model in the VR environment.
	In order to design a rational plan of operation, the liver and its
	anatomic structure were reconstructed to illuminate the location
	of the tumor and its related vessels. RESULTS: In our series of 38
	hepatic resections, there was no significant difference between preoperatively
	calculated volumes of virtual resection part and actual volumes of
	resected specimen's weight. The LiVirtue can provide accurate and
	rapid results of individual hepatic volume and the character of anatomy
	structures. These models can be viewed and manipulated in the VR
	environment and on a personal computer. This preoperative simulation
	allowed surgeons to dissect the liver with reduced complications.
	Preoperative planning and intra-operative navigation based on this
	technique ensured the safety of liver resection. CONCLUSIONS: 3D
	models of the liver and its detailed structure articulate the possibility
	of intricate liver resection and the risk of the operation. This
	preoperative estimation from a 3D model of the liver benefits complicated
	liver resections greatly.},

  journal = {International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {57 - 67},
  abstract = {PurposeÂ Â Most software systems for oral implantology are based on
	a two-dimensional multi-view approach, often accompanied with a surface
	rendered model. Usually they are affected by common errors like anisotropy
	of the volume and distortion on measurements. A more integrated and
	realistic 3D approach for implant surgery is desirable in order to
	gain a deeper and surer knowledge of patientâ€™s anatomy before inserting
	the implants, thus reducing the risk of damaging surrounding structures.
	MethodsÂ Â We present a 3D software system for oral implant planning
	where computer graphic techniques have been used to create a smooth
	and user-friendly fully integrated 3D environment to work in. Both
	volume isotropy and correctness in measurements are obtained through
	slices interpolation to achieve, respectively, an isotropic voxel
	and the freedom of choosing arbitrarily, during the planning, the
	best cross-sectional plane. Correct orientation of the planned implants
	is also easily computed, by exploiting a radiological mask with radio-opaque
	markers, worn by the patient during the CT scan. ResultsÂ Â Precision
	in measures was validated by considering several different scans
	and comparing the measures achieved with the ones got through the
	common methodology. It has been also calculated error percentages,
	algorithms efficiencies, and performances. Precision achieved outperforms
	usual DentaScan multi-view approach one, and it is comparable with
	or better than that obtained by the DentalVox tool (from 0.16 to
	0.71% error in measures). ConclusionsÂ Â The proposed software system
	provides a user-friendly, correct and precise work context for oral
	implant planning, avoiding similar software common errors. The 3D
	environment can be also exploited in the final surgical phase, in
	order to provide a flapless surgical guide, through the use of an
	anthropomorphic robot.},

	The program consists of two closely integrated tools, the 3D viewing

	virtual model of a fractured pelvis is built. This procedure is performed
	by computer engineers. Data from CT of a real injury in DICOM format
	are used. With segmentation process each fracture segment becomes
	a separate object and is assigned a different colour. The virtual
	object is then transferred to the personal computer of the surgeon.
	Bone fragments can be moved and rotated in all three planes and reduction
	is performed. After reduction, fixation can be undertaken. The appropriate
	ostheosynthetic material can be chosen. Contouring of the plate is
	performed automatically to the reduced pelvis. The screws can be
	inserted into the plate or across the fracture. The direction and
	length of the screws is controlled by turning the pelvis or by making
	bones more transparent. The modeling of the plate in all three axes
	can be recorded as the exact length of the screws. There is also
	a simulation tool for intraoperative C-arm imaging in all directions.
	All the steps of the procedure are recorded and printed out. Postoperative

  abstract = {The objective of the present study was to analyze the mechanical effect
	of some of the surgical variables encountered during shoulder arthroplasty
	using the finite element method. The effect of one eccentric load
	case, cement thickness and conformity has been investigated. DESIGN:
	A 3D finite element model of a healthy cadaveric scapula implanted
	with an anatomically shaped glenoid has been developed from computed
	tomography (CT) images. BACKGROUND: Glenoid component fixation can
	present the most difficult problem in total shoulder arthroplasty,
	loosening of this component remains one of the main complications.
	METHODS: The 3D finite element model was first validated by comparison
	with experimental measurements and by fitting of the mechanical properties
	of the cortical bone. Then the articular pressure location, the surface
	contact geometry and the cement thickness have been analyzed to observe
	their effect on stresses and displacements at the interfaces and
	within the scapular bone. RESULTS: The antero-posterior bending of
	the scapula was a notable feature and this was accentuated when an
	eccentric load was applied. The gleno-humeral contact area had a
	major role on the stress level in the supporting structures though
	but not on the global displacements. Varying the cement mantle modified
	stresses according to the load case and it essentially changed the
	latero-medial displacement of the cement relatively to the bone.
	CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provided an insight into the mechanical
	effects of an implanted scapula according to different parameters
	related to implantation technique. RELEVANCE: Results emphasized
	the role of some of the parameters a clinician may face. They demonstrated
	the importance of the humeral head centering in the horizontal plane.
	Conformity decreasing may involve drastic increase of stresses within
	structures and a thick cement mantle is not necessarily advantageous
	relatively to the stresses at the cement/bone interface.},

	allows three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomography (CT) data to be
	used to manufacture solid plastic replicas of anatomical structures
	(biomodels). A prospective trial with the objective of assessing
	the utility of biomodelling in complex surgery has been performed.
	Forty-five patients with craniofacial, maxillofacial, skull base
	cervical spinal pathology were selected. 3-D CT or MR scanning was
	performed and the data of interest were edited and converted into
	a form acceptable to the rapid prototyping technology SL. The data
	were used to guide a laser to selectively polymerize photosensitive
	resin to manufacture biomodels. The biomodels were used by surgeons
	for patient education, diagnosis and operative planning. An assessment
	protocol was used to test the hypothesis that [`]biomodels in addition
	to standard imaging had greater utility in the surgery performed
	than the standard imaging alone'. Biomodels significantly improved
	operative planning (images 44.09%, images with biomodel 82.21%, P<.01)
	and diagnosis (images 65.63%, images with biomodel 95.23%, P<.01).
	Biomodels were found to improve measurement accuracy significantly
	(image measurement error 44.14%, biomodel measurement error 7.91%,
	P<.05). Surgeons estimated that the use of biomodels reduced operating
	time by a mean of 17.63% and were cost effective at a mean price
	of $1031 AUS. Patients found the biomodels to be helpful for informed
	consent (images 63.53%, biomodels 88.54%, P<.001). Biomodelling is
	an intuitive, user-friendly technology that facilitated diagnosis
	and operative planning. Biomodels allowed surgeons to rehearse procedures
	readily and improved communication between colleagues and patients.},

	and prefabrication have been reported to reduce operating time and
	improve cosmesis. An original technique for the manufacture of customised
	cranioplastic implants has been developed and tested in 30 patients.
	Thirty patients requiring cranioplasties were selected. Data acquired
	from computed tomography (CT) were used to manufacture exact plastic
	replicas (biomodels) of craniotomy defects and master cranioplastic
	implants using the rapid prototyping technology of stereolithography
	(SL). The three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques of mirroring
	and interpolation were used to extrapolate on existing anatomy to
	design the master implants. The master implants were hand finished
	to fit the defect in the corresponding cranial biomodel exactly and
	were then used to create a cavity mould. The mould was used to cast
	thermally polymerised custom acrylic implants. The surgeons reported
	that the customised implants reduced operating time, afforded excellent
	cosmesis and were cost effective. The patients reported that the
	opportunity to see the biomodel and implant preoperatively improved
	their understanding of the procedure. Two complications were noted,
	one infection and one implant required significant trimming. The
	simultaneous manufacture of the master implant (male) and biomodel
	(female) components from SL allowed custom accurate implants to be
	manufactured. Disadvantages identified were the time required for
	computer manipulations of the CT data (up to 2 h), difficulty in
	assessing the accuracy of the computer generated master as a 3D rendering,
	the potential for SL parts to warp, manufacturing time (minimum 2
	days) and the cost of approximately $1300 US per case ($1000 for
	the SL biomodel and $300 for the acrylic casting). },

	conventional total shoulder arthroplasty. This study tests the hypothesis
	that certain implant component positioning configurations may lead
	to impingement within the physiological range of motion. METHODS:
	A rigid-body model of the shoulder comprising the scapula and humerus
	was constructed. Within this 3D model, a commercially available total
	shoulder arthroplasty implant was positioned according to manufacturer
	guidelines. The configuration was modified around this default position
	to investigate the associated angle of inferior and superior impingement
	during glenohumeral elevation, as well as in lateral impingement
	during axial rotation at both 0 degrees and 60 degrees of glenohumeral
	elevation. Glenoid component size, version, inclination and inferior-superior
	offset as well as humeral component size, torsion, inclination, offset
	and height were examined. The influence of the humeral calcar anatomy
	was also investigated. FINDINGS: Certain implant configurations caused
	component impingement in the physiological range of motion. The most
	sensitive parameters affecting impingement were: (1) the inclination
	of the glenoid component, (2) the inferior-superior position of the
	humeral component along the resection line and (3) the prominence
	of the humeral calcar. Glenoid offset and inclination and humeral
	head offset and height directly affected subacromial impingement.
	INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that several intraoperatively
	adjustable implant positioning parameters can influence the likelihood
	of implant impingement in conventional total shoulder arthroplasty,
	and that the geometry of the humeral calcar should be taken into
	consideration when designing an operative strategy for shoulder joint

	data set is acquired while contrasting the liver vessels. Immediately
	prior to the intervention, the laparoscope is moved around these
	fiducials, which are automatically reconstructed to register the
	patient to its preoperative imaging data set. This enables the simulation
	of a camera flight through the patient's interior along the laparoscope's
	or instruments' axes to easily validate potential ports. Intraoperatively,
	surgeons need to update their surgical planning based on actual patient
	data after organ deformations mainly caused by application of carbon
	dioxide pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, preoperative imaging data can
	hardly be used. Instead, we propose to use an optically tracked mobile
	C-arm providing cone-beam CT imaging capability intraoperatively.
	After patient positioning, port placement, and carbon dioxide insufflation,
	the liver vessels are contrasted and a 3-D volume is reconstructed
	during patient exhalation. Without any further need for patient registration,
	the reconstructed volume can be directly augmented on the live laparoscope
	video, since prior calibration enables both the volume and the laparoscope
	to be positioned and oriented in the tracking coordinate frame. The
	augmentation provides the surgeon with advanced visual aid for the

  abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of liver tumor indications were
	treated by minimally invasive laparoscopic resection. Besides the
	restricted view, a major issue in laparoscopic liver resection is
	the enhanced visualization of (hidden) vessels, which supply the
	tumorous liver segment and thus need to be divided prior to the resection.
	To navigate the surgeon to these vessels, pre-operative abdominal
	imaging data can hardly be used due to intra- operative organ deformations
	mainly caused by appliance of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and
	respiratory motion. While regular respiratory motion can be gated
	and synchronized intra-operatively, motion caused by pneumoperitoneum
	is individual for every patient and difficult to estimate. Therefore,
	we propose to use an optically tracked mobile C-arm providing cone-beam
	CT imaging capability intra- operatively. The C-arm is able to visualize
	soft tissue by means of its new flat panel detector and is calibrated
	offline to relate its current position and orientation to the coordinate
	system of a reconstructed volume. Also the laparoscope is optically
	tracked and calibrated offline, so both laparoscope and C-arm are
	registered in the same tracking coordinate system. Intra-operatively,
	after patient positioning, port placement, and carbon dioxide insufflation,
	the liver vessels are contrasted and scanned during patient exhalation.
	Immediately, a three-dimensional volume is reconstructed. Without
	any further need for patient registration, the volume can be directly
	augmented on the live laparoscope video, visualizing the contrasted
	vessels. This augmentation provides the surgeon with advanced visual

	Image processing was easy to perform within 23 min. Of the 56 potential

	parenchyma or vascular architecture. Two recipients were not transplanted
	due to poor clinical conditions. In the 27 transplanted cases, preoperatively

	interventional imaging to expedite tissue characterization and precise
	localization and targeting. As the surgery progresses, and anatomical
	changes subsequently reduce the relevance of pre-operative data,
	interventional data is refreshed for software navigation in true

	Materials and Methods: A one-degree-of-freedom needle insertion simulator

	perceptual experiments. The objective of the 14 subjects was to detect
	the puncture of each tissue layer using varying haptic and visual
	cues. Performance was measured by overshoot error—the distance traveled
	by the virtual needle after puncture. Results: Without force feedback,
	real-time visual feedback reduced error by at least 87% in comparison
	to static image overlay. Force feedback, in comparison to no force
	feedback, reduced puncture overshoot by at least 52% when visual
	feedback was absent or limited to static image overlay. A combination
	of force and visual feedback improved performance, especially for
	tissues with low stiffness, by at least 43% with visual display of
	the needle position, and by at least 67% with visual display of layer
	deﬂection. Conclusion: Real-time image overlay signiﬁcantly enhances

	anatomic structures in three dimensions for interventional planning
	and academic research. METHODS: Volumetric chest computed tomography
	was performed on a healthy volunteer. Computed tomographic images
	of the larger bronchial branches were segmented by an extended three-dimensional
	region-growing algorithm, converted into a stereolithography file,
	and used for computer-aided design on a laser sintering machine.
	The injection of gases for respiratory flow modeling and measurements
	using magnetic resonance imaging were done on a hollow cast. RESULTS:
	Manufacturing the rapid prototype took about 40 minutes and included
	the airway tree from trackea to segmental bronchi (fifth generation).
	The branching of the airways are clearly visible in the (3)He images,
	and the radial imaging has the potential to elucidate the airway
	dimensions. CONCLUSION: The results for flow patterns in the human
	bronchial tree using the rapid-prototype model with hyperpolarized
	helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging show the value of this model

  abstract = {The article comprises three main parts: a historical review on navigation,
	the mathematical basics for calculation and the clinical applications
	of navigation devices. Main historical steps are described from the
	first idea till the realisation of the frame-based and frameless
	
	navigation devices including robots. In particular the idea of robots
	can be traced back to the Iliad of Homer, the first testimony of
	European literature over 2500 years ago. In the second part the mathematical
	calculation of the mapping between the navigation and the image space
	is demonstrated, including different registration modalities and
	error estimations. The error of the navigation has to be divided
	into the technical error of the device calculating its own position
	in space, the registration error due to inaccuracies in the calculation
	of the transformation matrix between the navigation and the image
	space, and the application error caused additionally by anatomical
	shift of the brain structures during operation. In the third part
	the main clinical fields of application in modern neurosurgery are
	demonstrated, such as localisation of small intracranial lesions,

  abstract = {For more than a decade neurosurgeons have become increasingly dependent
	on image guidance to perform safe, efficient, and cost-effective
	surgery. Neuronavigation is frame-based or frameless and requires
	obtaining computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	scans several days or immediately before surgery. Unfortunately,
	these systems do not allow the neurosurgeon to adjust for the brain
	shift that occurs once the cranium is open. This technical inability
	has led to the development of intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) systems
	ranging from 0.12-3.0T in strength. The advantages of ioMRI are the
	excellent soft tissue discrimination and the ability to view the
	operative site in three dimensions. Enhanced visualization of the
	intracranial lesion enables the neurosurgeon to choose a safe surgical
	trajectory that avoids critical structures, to maximize the extent
	of the tumor resection, and to exclude an intraoperative hemorrhage.
	All ioMRI systems provide basic T1- and T2-weighted imaging capabilities
	but high-field (1.5T) systems can also perform MR spectroscopy (MRS),
	MR venography (MRV), MR angiography (MRA), brain activation studies,
	chemical shift imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Identifying
	vascular structures by MRA or MRV may prevent injury during surgery.
	Demonstrating elevated phosphocholine within a tumor may improve
	the diagnostic yield of brain biopsy. Mapping out neurologic function
	may influence the surgical approach to a tumor. The optimal strength

	for evaluating different resection strategies preoperatively.With
	such virtual resections, predictions and quantitative analyses may
	be carried out to assess the resec- tion feasibility with respect
	to tumors and risk structures. In oncologic liver surgery, additional
	tumors that were not seen in the preoperative images are often found
	during the intervention using intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). Due
	to such findings, the resection strategy must be updated or com-
	pletely revised. Materials and methods Therefore, we have developed
	meth- ods for the intraoperative modification of resection plans.
	The probe of an ultrasound-based navigation system and alternatively
	the pointing device Wiimote are proposed as intraoperative interaction
	devices. Fast adaptation of plan- ning information and the communication
	with both interac- tion devices is supported by our system, the Intraoperative
	Planning Assistant (IPA). The IPA has been evaluated in the operation
	room (OR) during laparoscopic liver interventions on pigs. Results
	Our preliminary results confirm that intraoperative modifications
	of resection plans are both feasible and bene- ficial for liver surgery.
	After the intraoperative modification task, updated remaining liver
	volume and resection volume were displayed and quantified within
	10s. Conclusion For the first time, surgeons are provided with a
	system for intraoperative modification of resection plans that offers
	a crucial decision support, is easy to use and integrates smoothly
	into the clinical workflow. The new system pro- vides major support

	takes the form of such passive tools for the support of intraoperative
	orientation as well as so-called [`]tracking systems' (semi-active
	systems) which accompany and support the surgeons' work. The final
	form are robots which execute specific steps completely autonomously.
	The techniques of virtual reality and computer assisted surgery are
	increasingly important in their medical applications. Many applications
	are still being developed or are still in the form of a prototype.
	It is already clear, however, that developments in this area will
	have a considerable effect on a surgeon's routine work.},

	rendering has demonstrated improvements in clinical care for several
	areas of radiological imaging. We test whether advanced real-time
	rendering techniques combined with an effective user interface will
	allow radiologists and surgeons to improve their performance for
	cardiothoracic surgery planning and diagnostic evaluation. MATERIAL
	AND METHODS: An interactive combination 3D and 2D visualization system
	developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was
	compared against standard tiled 2D slice presentation on a viewbox.
	The system was evaluated for 23 complex cardiothoracic computed tomographic
	(CT) cases including heart-lung and lung transplantation, tumor resection,
	airway stent placement, repair of congenital heart defects, aortic
	aneurysm repair, and resection of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
	Radiologists and surgeons recorded their impressions with and without
	the use of the interactive visualization system. RESULTS: The cardiothoracic
	surgeons reported positive benefits to using the 3D visualizations.
	The addition of the 3D visualization changed the surgical plan (65\%
	of cases), increased the surgeon's confidence (on average 40\% per
	case), and correlated well with the anatomy found at surgery (95\%
	of cases). The radiologists reported fewer and less major changes
	than the surgeons in their understanding of the case due to the 3D
	visualization. They found new findings or additional information
	about existing findings in 66\% of the cases; however, they changed
	their radiology report in only 14\% of the cases. CONCLUSION: With
	the appropriate choice of 3D real-time volume rendering and a well-designed
	user interface, both surgeons and radiologists benefit from viewing
	an interactive 3D visualization in addition to 2D images for surgery
	planning and diagnostic evaluation of complex cardiothoracic cases.
	This study finds that 3D visualization is especially helpful to the
	surgeon in understanding the case, and in communicating and planning
	the surgery. These results suggest that including real-time 3D visualization
	would be of clinical benefit for complex cardiothoracic CT cases.},

	and restoration to neutral version is recommended. While a method
	for measurement of glenoid version using axial computed tomography
	(CT) has been reported and has been widely accepted, its accuracy
	and reproducibility has not been established. METHODS: In 33 patients
	scheduled for shoulder arthroplasty, glenoid version and maximum
	wear of the glenoid articular surface were measured with respect
	to the scapular body axis on 2-dimensional- (2D) CT slices as well
	as on 3-dimensional- (3D) reconstructed models of the same CT slices.
	RESULTS: Clinical CT scans were axially aligned with the patient's
	torso but were almost never perpendicular to the scapular body. The
	average absolute error in version measured on the 2D-CT slice passing
	through the tip of the coracoid was 5.1 degrees (range, 0 - 16 degrees
	, P < .001). On high-resolution 3D-CT reconstructions, the location
	of maximum wear was most commonly posterior and was missed on the
	clinical 2D-CT slices in 52\% of cases. CONCLUSION: Error in measuring
	version and depth of maximum wear can substantially affect the determination
	of the degree of correction necessary in arthritic glenoids. Accurately
	measuring glenoid version and locating the direction of maximum wear
	requires a full 3D-CT reconstruction and analysis.},

	magnetic resonance and computed tomography image data to guide instruments

	for planning procedures; it also requires sensors for registering
	the patient's anatomy with the preoperative image data. Minimally

	Specialized mechanical designs and sensing technologies are needed
	to maximize dexterity under these access constraints. Robots have

	robots can biopsy brain lesions with minimal damage to adjacent tissue.
	In orthopedic surgery, robots are routinely used to shape the femur
	to precisely fit prosthetic hip joint replacements. Robotic systems
	are also under development for closed-chest heart bypass, for microsurgical
	procedures in ophthalmology, and for surgical training and simulation.
	Although results from initial clinical experience is positive, issues

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) displays of anatomic structures
	have become feasible for preoperative planning in some surgical procedures.
	There have been no reports, however, on the use of 3D displays for
	surgical treatment of lung cancer. We hypothesized that 3D displays
	of the thorax are useful for preoperative planning for lung cancer.
	METHODS: Based on virtual reality technologies, we rendered 3D displays
	of the thorax from two-dimensional (2D) computed tomographic (CT)
	images of six anonymous patients, some of whom underwent surgical
	removal of lung cancer. For determining the resectability of lung
	cancer, we tested 17 participants with varying degrees of surgical
	skills to view 3D displays and read 2D CT images of these thoracic
	cavities in a randomized order. We measured their performance in
	terms of the accuracy of predicted resectability, the confidence
	of their prediction, planning time used, and workload experienced.
	RESULTS: The results demonstrated that viewing 3D displays of thoracic
	cavities has significant advantages over reading 2D CT images in
	determining the resectability of lung cancer: increasing the accuracy
	of predicted resectability by about 20\%, enhancing the confidence
	of the prediction by about 20\%, decreasing planning time by about
	30\%, and reducing workload by about 50\%. All participants preferred
	viewing 3D displays to reading 2D CT images for preoperative planning.
	Junior residents found 3D displays of thoraces more useful than senior
	residents. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use 3D displays of the
	thorax for preoperative planning in treating lung cancer. Using 3D
	displays in surgical treatment of lung cancer has potential benefits,
	once the technique is perfected.},

  abstract = {Though the conventional C-arm fluoroscope is used in bone surgeries
	for decades, two outstanding disadvantages remain. One is that it
	is not well adapted to the image-guided orthopaedic surgery procedures.
	Another is exposure of patients and surgeons in the radiation environment
	are harmful. At present, computer aided surgical navigation system
	is more and more used in surgery, but it is only connected to MRI
	( magnetic resonance imaging ) or CT (computerised tomography ).
	This research addresses these issues. Using the C-arm and binocular
	spatial position system to navigate, with the help of the computer,
	is studied in our laboratory. The new system is called CASNC (Computer
	Aided Surgical Navigation system based on C-arm). As a special example,
	the position of determining distal interlocking of tibia or femoral
	intramedullary nail using the CASNC system is also a main point in
	this research. The position of the C-arm and patient are detected
	at the same time when a preoperative patient X-ray fluoroscope was
	taken, and transfer them to the computer. Then the system has to
	establish a correlation between preoperative image data and intraoperative
	patientpsilas position and surgical tools. At last, the deviation
	of the spatial position of the hole on the nail and surgical tools
	are shown on the monitor, and it illustrates correct position and
	orientation. This system not only can maximise the advantages of
	the conventional C-arm and accuracy of drilling, but also reduce
	surgeon and stuff in the operating theatre, especially patients suffering
	the X-ray radiation exposure.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective: Effective utilization of an optical tracking system
	for image-based surgical guidance requires optimal placement of the
	dynamic reference frame (DRF) with respect to the tracking camera.
	Unlike other studies that measure the overall accuracy of a particular
	navigation system, this study investigates the precision of one component
	of the navigation system: the optical tracking system (OTS). The
	precision of OTS measurements is quantified as jitter. By measuring
	jitter, one can better understand how system inaccuracies depend
	on the position of the DRF with respect to the camera.Materials and
	Methods: Both FlashPointâ„¢ (Image Guided Technologies, Inc., Boulder,
	Colorado) and Polarisâ„¢ (Northern Digital Inc., Ontario, Canada)
	optical tracking systems were tested in five different camera and
	DRF configurations. A linear testing apparatus with a software interface
	was designed to facilitate data collection. Jitter measurements were
	collected over a single quadrant within the camera viewing volume,
	as symmetry was assumed about the horizontal and vertical axes.Results:
	Excluding the highest 5% of jitter, the FlashPoint cameras had an
	RMS jitter range of 0.028 Â± 0.012 mm for the 300 mm model, 0.051
	Â± 0.038 mm for the 580 mm model, and 0.059 Â± 0.047 mm for the 1
	m model. The Polaris camera had an RMS jitter range of 0.058 Â± 0.037
	mm with an active DRF and 0.115 Â± 0.075 mm with a passive DRF.Conclusion:
	Both FlashPoint and Polaris have jitter less than 0.11 mm, although
	the error distributions differ significantly. Total jitter for all
	systems is dominated by the component measured in the axis directed
	away from the camera. Comp Aid Surg 5:98â€“107 (2000). Â© 2000 Wiley-Liss,

	This prospective, randomized clinical study comprised 2 groups of
	10 patients each with osteoarthritis of the shoulder TSA, with or
	without intraoperative navigation. Glenoid version was measured on
	axial computed tomography scans preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively.
	RESULTS: The operating time was significantly longer in the navigation
	group (169.5 +/- 15.2 vs 138 +/- 18.4 min). We found an average change
	of retroversion from 15.4 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees (range, 3.0 degrees
	-24.0 degrees) preoperatively to 3.7 degrees +/- 6.3 degrees (range,
	-8.0 degrees to 15.0 degrees) postoperatively in the navigation group

	degrees) preoperatively to 10.9 degrees +/- 6.8 degrees (range, 0.0
	degrees -19.0 degrees) postoperatively in the group without navigation
	(P = .021). CONCLUSION: We found an improved accuracy in glenoid
	positioning in the transverse plane using intraoperative navigation.
	The validity of the study is limited by the small number, which advocates
	continuation with more patients and longer follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

  abstract = {In shoulder arthroplasty, malpositioning of pros-theses often leads
	to reduced post- operative range of motion (ROM) and complications
	such as impingement, loosening, and dislocation. Furthermore, the
	risk of impingement complications increases when reverse total prostheses
	are used. For this purpose a pre-operative planning system was developed
	that enables surgeons to perform a virtual shoulder replacement procedure.
	Our pre-operative planning system simulates patient-specific bone-determined
	ROM meant to reduce the risk of impingement complications and to
	improve the ROM of patients undergoing shoulder replacement surgery.
	This paper describes a validation experiment with the purpose of
	ratifying the clinical applicability and usefulness of the ROM simulation
	module for shoulder replacement surgery. The experiment was performed
	on cadaveric shoulders. A data connection was set up between the
	software environment and an existing intra-operative guidance system
	to track the relative positions of the bones. This allowed the patient-specific
	surface models to be visualized within the software for the position
	and alignment of the tracked bones. For both shoulders, ROM measurements
	were recorded and tagged with relevant information such as the type
	of prosthesis and the type ofmovement that was performed. The observed
	ROM and occurrences of impingement were compared with the simulated
	equivalents. The median deviation between observed impingement angles
	and simulated impingement angles was 20.30u with an interquartile
	range of 5.20u (from 23.40u to 1.80u). It was concluded that the
	ROM simulator is sufficiently accurate to fulfil its role as a supportive
	instrument for orthopaedic surgeons during shoulder replacement surgery.},

  abstract = {Kinematics is the analysis ofmotionswithout regarding forces or inertial
	effects,with the purpose of understanding joint behaviour. Kinematic
	data of linked joints, for example the upper extremity, i.e. the
	shoulder and arm joints, contains many related degrees of freedom
	that complicate numerical analysis. Visualisation techniques enhance
	the analysis process, thus improving the effectiveness of kinematic
	experiments. This paper describes a new visualisation systemspecifically
	designed for the analysis of multi-joint kinematic data of the upper
	extremity. The challenge inherent in the data is that the upper extremity
	is comprised of five cooper- ating joints with a total of fifteen
	degrees of freedom. The range of motion may be affected by subtle
	deficiencies of individual joints that are difficult to pinpoint.
	To highlight these subtleties our approach combines interactive filtering
	and multiple visualisation techniques. Our system is further differentiated
	by the fact that it integrates simultaneous acquisition and visual
	analysis of biokinematic data. Also, to facilitate complex queries,
	we have designed a visual query interface with visualisation and
	interaction elements that are based on the domain-specific anatomical
	representation of the data. The combi- nation of these techniques
	form an effective approach specifically tailored for the investigation
	and comparison of large collections of kinematic data. This claim
	is supported by an evaluation experiment where the technique was
	used to inspect the kinematics of the left and right arm of a patient

	task. The pathological state of the joint results in a non-uniformdensity

	This paper describes a novel method for the segmentation of these

	that encircles the joint is extracted by calculating theminimum curvature
	of the surfacemodel. The intersection points of this loopwith the
	separate CT-slices are connected bymeans of a path search algorithm.
	Inaccurate sections are corrected by iteratively apply- ing a Hough

	2-dimensional analysis of the glenoid through either standard radiographs

	(3D) anatomy of the glenoid. Because 3D reconstructions of CT images
	allow 3D visualization and analysis of the scapula as a free body,
	we hypothesized that they can reflect the true anatomy of the glenoid
	more accurately. To test this hypothesis, we obtained various glenoid
	morphometric measurements from excised cadaveric scapulae as well
	as their respective 3D CT images. On average, the glenoid version
	angles measured from the 3D CT images were within 1.0 degrees +/-
	0.7 degrees (mean +/- SD) of those from the actual specimen (95\%

	from the 3D CT images showed high interobserver and intraobserver
	reliability (interobserver and intraobserver correlation coefficients,
	0.983 and 0.978, respectively). Similarly, measured glenoid surface
	width and length from the 3D CT images were within 1.8 +/- 1.2 mm
	and 1.4 +/- 1.1 mm, respectively, of those from the actual specimen.
	In addition, we were able to estimate the glenoid surface area as

	were 8.67 +/- 2.73 cm2 and 11.86 +/- 5.06 cm3, respectively. The

	to an improvement of the ability to localize the tumor and an increased
	precision in operation planning in liver surgery. DESIGN: We developed
	a new interactive computer-based quantitative 3-D operation planning
	system for liver surgery, which is being introduced to the clinical
	routine. To evaluate whether 3-D reconstruction leads to improved
	operation planning, we conducted a clinical trial. The data sets
	of 7 virtual patients were presented to a total of 81 surgeons in
	different levels of training. The tumors had to be assigned to a
	liver segment and subsequently drawn together with the operation
	proposal into a given liver model. The precision of the assignment
	to a liver segment according to Couinaud classification and the operation
	proposal were measured quantitatively for each surgeon and stratified
	concerning 2-D and different types of 3-D presentations. RESULTS:
	The ability of correct tumor assignment to a liver segment was significantly
	correlated to the level of training (P<.05). Compared with 2-D computed
	tomography scans, 3-D reconstruction leads to a significant increase
	of precision in tumor localization by 37\%. The target area of the
	resection proposal was improved by up to 31\%. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional
	reconstruction leads to a significant improvement of tumor localization
	ability and to an increased precision of operation planning in liver

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer systems allow the planning of complex liver operations.
	The segmentation of intrahepatic vessels builds the basis for the
	calculation of liver segments and resection proposals. For surgical
	use, it is essential to know the capabilities and limitations of
	the segmentation. The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity
	and precision of the portal vein segmentation of a computer planning
	system for liver surgery in vivo. METHODS: Segmentations were performed
	with the software system HepaVision on computed tomography (CT) scan
	data of domestic pigs. An in situ corrosion cast of the portal vein
	served as the gold standard. The segmentation results of the portal
	vein and the corrosion cast were compared with regard to sensitivity,
	precision, and amount of short-circuit segmentations. RESULTS: The
	methodology demonstrated high resolution ex situ. The in vivo sensitivity
	of the portal vein segmentation was 100\% for vessels of more than
	5 mm in diameter and 82\% for vessels of 3-4 mm. All segment branches
	were detected as well as 84\% of the first subsegment branches with
	a diameter of more than 3 mm. The precision of the system was 100\%
	for segment branches and 89\% for the first subsegment vessels. The
	amount of internal short-circuit segmentations was less than 3.0\%.
	No external short-circuits were found. CONCLUSION: The system has
	a high precision and sensitivity under clinical conditions. The segmentation
	is suitable for portal vein branches of the first and second order
	and for vessels of >/=3 mm in diameter.},

  abstract = {In order to provide navigational guidance during computer-integrated
	orthopedic surgery, the anatomy of the patient must first be registered
	to a medical image or model. A common registration approach is to
	digitize points from the surface of a bone and then find the rigid
	transformation that best matches the points to the model by constrained
	optimization. Many optimization criteria, including a least-squares
	objective function, perform poorly if the data include spurious data
	points (outliers). This paper describes a statistically robust, surface-based
	registration algorithm that we have developed for orthopedic surgery.
	To find an initial estimate, the user digitizes points from predefined
	regions of bone that are large enough to reliably locate even in
	the absence of anatomic landmarks. Outliers are automatically detected
	and managed by integrating a statistically robust M-estimator with
	the iterative-closest-point algorithm. Our in vitro validation method
	simulated the registration process by drawing registration data points
	from several sets of densely digitized surface points. The method
	has been used clinically in computer-integrated surgery for high
	tibial osteotomy, distal radius osteotomy, and excision of osteoid
	osteoma.},

  abstract = {Summary Computer-assisted bone segment navigation is defined as the
	precise 3-D positioning of geometrically mapped and mathematically
	described skeletal segments. These bone segments are osteotomized,
	fractured or prefabricated according to a surgical plan. The high-precision
	positioning should have an accuracy of 1 mm or better. Segment navigation
	should be prepared with plain computed tomography (CT) without the
	implantation of registration markers before CT in order to reduce
	the number of CTs and operations. The Surgical Segment Navigator
	(SSN) was developed at the University of Regensburg with the support
	of Carl Zeiss. This is the first system to meet these criteria. The
	SSN is based on an infrared positioning device which is connected
	to a Hewlett Packard LD Pro Workstation. Infrared transmitters are
	connected to individual templates which are fixed to the bone segment
	by osteosynthesis screws. Intraoperative correlation between surgical
	planning and surgical site is achieved by use of a surface-pattern
	of the bone segment which fits equally well to the laboratory model
	and the conditions encountered in the patient. The concept of the
	SSN was submitted by Carl Zeiss as German Patent DE 19747427 A1 in
	1997. The SSN system presented here has already been applied clinically
	and its precision has been evaluated by bone segment navigation in
	human cadavers.},

  abstract = {In order to help to understand the loosening phenomenon around gleno\"{\i}d
	prostheses, a 3D finite element model of a previously tested implanted
	scapula has been developed. The construction of the model was done
	using CT scans of the tested scapula. Different bone material properties
	were tested and shell elements or 8 nodes hexaedric elements were
	used to model the cortical bone. Surface contact elements were introduced
	on one hand between the bone and the lower part of the plate of the
	implant, and on the other, between the loading metallic ball and
	the upper surface of the implant. The results of the model were compared
	with those issued from in vitro experiments carried out on the same
	scapula. The evaluation of the model was done for nine cases of loading
	of 500 N distributed on the implant, in terms of strains (principal
	strains of six spots around peripheral cortex of the gleno\"{\i}d)
	and displacement of four points positioned on the implant. The best
	configuration of the model presented here, fits with experiments
	for most of the strains (difference lower than 150microdef) but it
	seems to be still too stiff (mainly in the lower part). Nevertheless,
	we want, in this paper, to underline the importance of doing a multiparametric
	validation for such a model. Indeed, some models can give correct
	results for one case of loading but bad results for another kind
	of loading, some others can give good results for one kind of compared
	parameters (like strains for instance) but bad results for the other
	one (like displacements).},

	part of image-guided surgery. Since the needle appears as a straight

	is a natural and powerful choice for needle segmentation. However,

	is ineffective for real-time segmentation applications. We propose
	a dedicated hardware architecture for the Hough transform based on
	distributed arithmetic (DA) principles that results in a real-time
	implementation. This architecture exploits the inherent parallelism
	of the Hough transform, and reduces the overall computation time.
	This procedure, combined with the parallel structure significantly
	reduces computation times, thus facilitating real-time implementation.
	The DA-Hough transform architecture has been implemented using the
	Xilinx FPGA. For a 256times256 image, the proposed design takes 0.1
	ms to 1.2 ms to process the Hough transform when the feature points
	in the image are varied from 2% to 50% of the total image, which

	a polyethylene insert that is flat. This design is the "reverse"
	configuration of that seen with a conventional arthroplasty, in which
	the spherical component is part of the humeral component. The indications

	failed hemiarthroplasty with irreparable rotator cuff tears, (3)
	pseudoparalysis due to massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears, (4)
	some reconstructions after tumor resection, and (5) some fractures
	of the shoulder not repairable or reconstructable with other techniques.
	This prosthesis can produce a significant reduction in pain and some
	improvement in function for most of the indications mentioned. However,
	the unique configuration and the challenge of its insertion can result
	in a high incidence of a wide variety of unusual complications. Some
	of these complications, such as dislocation of the components, are
	similar to conventional shoulder replacement. Other complications,

	a general direction from anterior to posterior, and from inside to
	outside. The abdominal wall dissection is performed first, and dissection
	of the vessels and femoral nerve often follows logically. This will
	lead the surgeon posteriorly to the sacroiliac joint and the sciatic
	notch. Completing the intrapelvic dissection allows identification
	of bony landmarks for osteotomy planning. The extrapelvic approach

	case report, we present the utility of computer-assisted surgical
	planning and image-guided surgical navigation in the planning and
	execution of a major osteotomy to correct severe kyphoscoliosis.
	SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Computer-assisted surgical planning is
	useful to appreciate the three-dimensional nature of scoliotic deformities
	and allows for operative maneuvers to be simulated on a computer
	before their implementation in the operating room. Image-guided surgical
	navigation improves surgical accuracy and can help translate a virtual
	surgical plan to the operative setting. METHODS: We report the case
	of a 38-year-old woman with severe, congenital kyphoscoliosis refractory
	to many previous surgeries, who presents with moderate progressive
	myelopathy and severe pain attributable to a sharp angular deformity
	at T12. Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction and
	computer-assisted surgical planning were used to determine the optimal
	corrective osteotomy. The surgical plan was translated to the operating
	room where a posterior vertebrectomy and instrumented correction
	were executed with the aid of image-guided surgical navigation. RESULTS:
	The osteotomy was safely performed resulting in improved sagittal
	and coronal alignments, as well as, correction of the sharp kyphoscoliotic
	deformity at the thoracolumbar junction. At 6-month follow-up, the
	patient's myelopathy and pain had largely resolved and she expressed
	high satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSION: We advocate this
	novel application of virtual surgical planning and intraoperative
	surgical navigation to improve the safety and efficacy of complex
	spinal deformity corrections.},

	translocation of bony segments. In a feasibility study X-Scope was
	used in orthognatic surgery to control the translocation of the maxilla
	after Le Fort I osteotomy within a bimaxillary procedure. The achieved
	situation was compared with the computer-based preoperative planning
	by means of cephalometric analysis on lateral and frontal cephalograms.
	In addition to the clinical feasibility study, an experimental evaluation
	of system accuracy was performed. The technique could be successfully
	applied in 5 patients. The maxillary positioning using X-Scope was
	accomplished with accuracy within a range of 1 mm. The tool was used
	in all cases in addition to the usual intra-operative splints. A
	stand-alone application without conventional control mechanism seems
	to be not reasonable yet. The final analysis of data obtained from
	the accuracy study is not completed yet. The preliminary results
	indicate a deviation of the X-Scope system not significantly greater
	then the deviation of the navigation system itself with a given registration
	method. Augmented reality tools like X-Scope may be helpful for control
	of maxillary translocation in orthognathic surgery. The application
	to other types of interventions in cranio-maxillofacial surgery associated
	with movement of bony segments as Le Fort III osteotomy, fronto-orbital
	advancement, and cranial vault reshaping or reconstruction may be
	considered as well.},

	the maxillofacial area based on three-dimensional imaging obtained
	by a cone-beam device. Digital volume tomograms (DVT) were obtained
	by the prototype of GALILEOS (Sirona Dental Systems Inc., Bensheim,
	Germany), a newly developed, compact size, cone-beam machine with
	a scan volume of 15 cm × 15 cm × 15 cm. Intraoperative navigation
	was performed in 12 patients in three selected indications. Target
	detection error expressing the accuracy of DVT navigation and registration
	performance of specially developed methods for image-to-patient registration
	was estimated. Target detection error was maximally 2 mm and depended
	on the registration method chosen. The automatic detection rate of
	the fiducial markers ranged between 0.64 and 0.32. The preoperatively
	defined treatment plan was fully accomplished in 11 out of 12 cases.
	A favourable surgical outcome was achievable in all cases. Intraoperative
	complications were not observed. Intraoperative navigation based
	on DVT imaging can be considered as a valuable alternative to CT-based
	procedures. Special characteristics of the cone-beam technique, in
	terms of contrast resolution and the limited field-of-view size of
	the devices, restrict the indication spectrum and create a demand
	for modifications of the usual registration methods.},

	can be easily applied to new datasets to create similar visualizations.
	Keystates can be shared between surgeons of one spe- cialization
	to reproduce and document the planning process for collaborative

	exploration and are also useful in collaborative environments, where
	complex issues must be presented in a short time. Therefore, we provide
	a framework, where animations can be visually designed by surgeons
	during their exploration process without any programming or authoring

	either hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis liver carcinoma. In
	order to resect large lesions, the surgeon has to perform multiple
	time-consuming destruction cycles and reposition the RFA needle for
	each of them. The critical step in handling a successful ablation
	and preventing local recurrence is the correct positioning of the
	needle. For small tumors, the surgeon places the middle of the active
	needle tip in the center of the tumor under intra-operative ultrasound
	guidance. When one application is not enough to cover the entire
	tumor, the surgeon needs to repeat the treatment after repositioning
	of the needle, but US guidance is obstructed by the opacity stemming
	from the first RFA application. In this case the surgeon can only
	rely on anatomical knowledge and the repositioning of the RFA needle
	becomes a subjective task limiting the treatment accuracy. We have
	developed a computer assisted surgery guidance application for this

	process and extract feature points. Since the guidance interface
	is also a major component of the system effectiveness, we validate
	the overall targeting accuracy on an abdominal phantom. This experiment
	showed that a practitioner can reach a predefined target with an
	accuracy of 2 mm with an insertion time below one minute. Finally,
	we propose a passive evaluation protocol of the overall system in

	and accuracy. In this paper we show how to combine a relatively accurate
	deformation model—the Finite Element (FE) method— and interactive
	cutting without requiring expensive matrix updates or precomputation.
	Our approach uses an iterative algorithm for an interactive linear
	FE deformation simulation. The iterative process requires no global
	precomputation, so runtime changes of the mesh, i.e. cuts, can be
	simulated efficiently. Cuts are performed along faces of the mesh;
	this prevents growth of the mesh. We present a provably correct method
	for changing the mesh topology, and a satisfactory heuristic for
	determining along which faces to perform cuts. Nodes within the mesh
	are relocated to align the mesh with a virtual scalpel. This prevents
	a jagged surface appearance, but also generates degeneracies, which
	are removed afterwards.},

	it integrates previously acquired radiological or nuclear medicine
	images with the operative field. In conventional image-guided surgery,
	a surgeon uses a surgical instrument or a pointer to establish correspondence
	between features in the preoperative images and the surgical scene.
	This is not ideal because the surgeon has to look away from the operative
	field to view the data. Augmented reality guidance systems offer
	a solution to this problem but are limited by deformation of soft
	tissues. Real-time intraoperative imaging offers a potential solution
	but is currently only experimental. The additional precision and
	confidence that this technology provides make it a useful tool, and
	recent advances in image-guided surgery offer new opportunities in
	the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Here, we review the
	development, current technologies, and applications of image-guided
	surgery and illustrate them with two case reports.},

	cadaveric lumbar spines. An analysis in 77 histological cuts showed

	onto an external screen during surgery. A calibrated stereovision
	system was set up between the surgical microscope and the binocular

	then generated using stereopsis. These reconstructed 3-D surface
	meshes were directly displayed without any additional geometrical
	transform over preoperative images of the patient in the physical

	skull phantom. Accuracy of the reconstruction method itself was shown

	overall approach was shown to be within 3 mm (median: 2.29 mm 0.59),
	including the image-to-physical space registration error.
	
	We report the results of six surgical cases where AV was used in conjunction

  abstract = {Contemporary imaging modalities can now provide the surgeon with high
	quality three- and four-dimensional images depicting not only normal
	anatomy and pathology, but also vascularity and function. A key component
	of image-guided surgery (IGS) is the ability to register multi-modal
	pre-operative images to each other and to the patient. The other
	important component of IGS is the ability to track instruments in
	real time during the procedure and to display them as part of a realistic
	model of the operative volume. Stereoscopic, virtual- and augmented-reality
	techniques have been implemented to enhance the visualization and
	guidance process. For the most part, IGS relies on the assumption
	that the pre-operatively acquired images used to guide the surgery
	accurately represent the morphology of the tissue during the procedure.
	This assumption may not necessarily be valid, and so intra-operative
	real-time imaging using interventional MRI, ultrasound, video and
	electrophysiological recordings are often employed to ameliorate
	this situation. Although IGS is now in extensive routine clinical
	use in neurosurgery and is gaining ground in other surgical disciplines,
	there remain many drawbacks that must be overcome before it can be
	employed in more general minimally-invasive procedures. This review
	overviews the roots of IGS in neurosurgery, provides examples of
	its use outside the brain, discusses the infrastructure required
	for successful implementation of IGS approaches and outlines the

  abstract = {Segmentation of 3D data is one of the most challenging tasks in medical
	image analysis. While reliable automatic methods are typically preferred,
	their success is often hindered by poor image quality and signiﬁcant
	variations in anatomy. Recent years have thus seen an increasing
	interest in the development of semi-automated segmentation methods
	that combine computational tools with intuitive, minimal user interaction.
	In an earlier work, we introduced a highly-automated technique for
	medical image segmentation, where a 3D extension of the traditional
	2D Livewire was proposed. In this paper, we present an enhanced and
	more powerful 3D Livewire-based segmentation approach with new features
	designed to primarily enable the handling of complex object topologies
	that are common in biological structures. The point ordering algorithm
	we proposed earlier, which automatically pairs up seedpoints in 3D,
	is improved in this work such that multiple sets of points are allowed
	to simultaneously exist. Point sets can now be utomatically merged
	and split to accommodate for the presence of concavities, protrusions,
	and non-spherical topologies. The robustness of the method is further
	improved by extending the ‘turtle algorithm’, presented earlier,
	by using a turtle-path pruning step. Tests on both synthetic and
	real medical images demonstrate the eﬃciency, reproducibility, accuracy,
	and robustness of the proposed approach. Among the examples illustrated
	is the segmentation of the left and right ventricles from a T1-weighted
	MRI scan, where an average task time reduction of 84.7% was achieved
	when compared to a user performing 2D Livewire segmentation on every

  abstract = {Realistic modeling of soft tissue deformation is crucial to virtual
	orthopedic surgery, especially orthopedic trauma surgery which involves
	layered heterogeneous soft tissues. In this paper, a novel modeling
	framework for multilayered soft tissue deformation is proposed in
	order to facilitate the development of orthopedic surgery simulators.
	We construct our deformable model according to the layered structure
	of real human organs, and this results in a multilayered model. The
	division of layers is based on the segmented Chinese Visible Human
	(CVH) dataset. This enhances the realism and accuracy in the simulation.
	For the sake of efficiency, we employ 3D mass-spring system to our
	multilayered model. The nonlinear passive biomechanical properties
	of skin and skeletal muscle are achieved by introducing a bilinear
	elasticity scheme to the springs in the mass-spring system. To efficiently
	and accurately reproduce the biomechanical properties of certain
	human tissues, an optimization approach is employed in configuring
	the parameters of the springs. Experimental data from biomechanics
	literatures are used as benchmarking references. With the employment
	of Physics Processing Unit (PPU) and high quality volume visualization,
	our framework is developed into an interactive and intuitive platform
	for virtual surgery training systems. Several experiments demonstrate
	the feasibility of the proposed framework in providing interactive
	and realistic deformation for orthopedic surgery simulation.},

  abstract = {Because of the increasing complexity of surgical interventions research
	in surgical simulation became more and more important over the last
	years. However, the simulation of tissue deformation is still a challenging
	problem, mainly due to the short response times that are required
	for real-time interaction. The demands to hard and software are even
	larger if not only the modeled human anatomy is used but the anatomy
	of actual patients. This is required if the surgical simulator should
	be used as training medium for expert surgeons rather than students.
	In this article, suitable visualization and simulation methods for
	surgical simulation utilizing actual patientâ€™s datasets are described.
	Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect
	volume rendering for the visualization are discussed and a neuro-fuzzy
	system is described, which can be used for the simulation of interactive
	tissue deformations. The neuro-fuzzy system makes it possible to
	define the deformation behavior based on a linguistic description
	of the tissue characteristics or to learn the dynamics by using measured
	data of real tissue. Furthermore, a simulator for minimally-invasive
	neurosurgical interventions is presented that utilizes the described
	visualization and simulation methods. The structure of the simulator
	is described in detail and the results of a system evaluation by
	an experienced neurosurgeonâ€”a quantitative comparison between different
	methods of virtual endoscopy as well as a comparison between real
	brain images and virtual endoscopiesâ€”are given. The evaluation
	proved that the simulator provides a higher realism of the visualization

	visualize 3D renderings of CT and MRI data with hands-free manipulation
	of the virtual display. The surgeon will be able to scale, orient,
	and position prescanned body imagery on-line in real time from any
	desired perspective. The clinical goal is dynamic fusing of 3D body

	three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipeline that uses relatively
	low-level segmentation operations and provides two-dimensional and
	3D visualization through a user-friendly graphical interface. MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: The low-level segmentation processes were implemented
	on a massively parallel computer; the graphical user interface was
	written with a public domain software toolkit. Since their implementation
	2 years ago, these segmentation tools have been applied to approximately
	300 computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging data sets.
	Two typical clinical cases are presented to demonstrate their applications.
	RESULTS: The entire processing pipeline can be executed in a few
	seconds. The tools are simple to learn because they involve the use
	of low-level procedures and a user-friendly graphical interface with
	a short interactive response time. Segmentation of the bones, aorta,
	kidneys, and kidney cysts in case 1 could be performed in about 16
	minutes. The time needed to segment each organ in case 2 ranged from
	about 15 minutes for the skin and brain to about 1 minute for the
	tumor. CONCLUSION: Satisfactory results can be obtained in a relatively
	short time with the real-time interactive 3D segmentation system.
	Operation of the system can be easily learned by a wide variety of
	nonspecialized users with some medical background.},

	has several forms, inorganic (synthetic & computer) and organic (animal
	or cadaver). Surgical simulation is a mode of training which is promising
	and may be effective. Technical errors in the simulated environment
	do not have clinical consequences and does not have a morbidity or
	mortality. We must ensure that the competent skills learnt in the
	simulation environment are translated to the real environment. This
	can be achieved if the same assessment tools are used in both environments.
	Surgical training is entering a new era, with increased scrutiny
	and an evolving work and training environment. We as surgical teachers
	must ensure that the surgeons of the future are as competent as or
	better than their predecessors using these new modes of training
	which we have access to.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought was to quantify and visualize the regeneration
	of the remnant liver after living donor liver transplantation using
	computed tomographic (CT) data. METHODS: For the evaluation of preoperative
	and follow-up data, we developed a software assistant that was able
	to compute the volume growth of the remnant liver and liver territories
	as well as visualize the individual growth of hepatic vessels over
	time. The software was applied to CT data of 20 donors who underwent
	right hepatectomy including the middle hepatic vein with at least
	3 follow-up examinations in the first year after transplantation.
	RESULTS: After donation of a right lobe graft, the remnant liver
	regenerated by an average 77\% of the original volume within the
	first 3 postoperative months and to 86\% within the first year. The
	growth of the left lateral segments was increased compared with that
	of segment IV in all cases. The visualization showed the growth of
	the portal vein and the hepatic veins. With the simultaneous display
	of pre- and postoperative results, it was possible to detect the
	formation of collaterals between truncated segment IVb veins and
	the veins of segment IVa or of the left lateral lobe. CONCLUSION:
	The software-assisted analysis of follow-up data yielded additional
	insight into territorial liver regeneration after living donor liver
	transplantation and allowed for reliable detection of relevant hepatic
	vein collaterals using CT data.},

	made this data available to mathematical and scientific 
	
	methods. With the step from subjective interpretation to reproducible

	develop and apply models that give additional information which is
	not directly visible in the data. In this context, it is 
	
	important to know the characteristics and limitations of each model.
	Four characteristics assure the clinical relevance of 
	
	models for computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy: ability of patient
	individual adaptation, treatment of errors and
	
	
	uncertainty, dynamic behavior, and in-depth evaluation. We demonstrate
	the development and clinical application of a 
	
	model in the context of liver surgery. Here, a model for intrahepatic
	vascular structures is combined with individual, but 
	
	in the degree of vascular details limited anatomical information from
	radiological images. As a result, the model allows 
	
	for a dedicated risk analysis and preoperative planning of oncologic
	resections as well as for living donor liver 
	
	transplantations. The clinical relevance of the method was approved

  abstract = {Minimally invasive liver interventions demand a lot of experience
	due to the limited access to the ﬁeld of operation.
	
	In particular, the correct placement of the trocar and the navigation
	within the patient’s body are hampered. In
	
	this work, we present an intraoperative augmented reality system (IARS)
	that directly projects preoperatively
	
	planned information and structures extracted from CT data, onto the
	real laparoscopic video images. Our system
	
	consists of a preoperative planning tool for liver surgery and an
	intraoperative real time visualization component.
	
	The planning software takes into account the individual anatomy of
	the intrahepatic vessels and determines the
	
	vascular territories. Methods for fast segmentation of the liver parenchyma,
	of the intrahepatic vessels and of
	
	liver lesions are provided. In addition, very eﬃcient algorithms for
	skeletonization and vascular analysis allowing
	
	the approximation of patient-individual liver vascular territories
	are included. The intraoperative visualization is
	
	based on a standard graphics adapter for hardware accelerated high
	performance direct volume rendering. The
	
	preoperative CT data is rigidly registered to the patient position
	by the use of ﬁducials that are attached to

  abstract = {In orthopaedic surgery there is a well-recognised relation- ship between
	accuracy and outcome. Accurate reduction of fractures improves the
	chance of union and the cosmetic and the functional results. Precise
	correction of childhood deformities is necessary to ensure growth
	in a mechanically appropriate direction. A well-aligned hip or knee
	replace- ment is less likely to dislocate and will last longer.1,2
	Surgeons respond to the need for accuracy by taking care and continually
	modifying their techniques to improve their performance. They have
	been helped enormously by the increased and increasing safety of
	anaesthesia.3 In most operations there is no longer any premium on
	operating time. Patients having joint replacements do not suffer
	if the surgeon takes an extra 30 minutes to produce improved overall
	alignment. A better technical outcome now usually takes precedence
	over a quick operation. In striving to improve accuracy we have called
	on a large array of tools and aids. Intraoperative radiology is used
	rou- tinely in fracture surgery. Endoscopy has allowed a much more
	focused approach than is possible with open pro- cedures. Nerve stimulators
	identify nerves which may be at risk. In joint replacement freehand
	techniques have been augmented by the introduction of mechanical
	alignment jigs and cutting blocks. Each of these technical refinements
	has initially met with some resistance, but has become estab- lished
	as the resulting improvement in outcome has become clear. We are
	now being presented with another technical aid, which promises to
	do much for accuracy in a wide range of surgical endeavour. In some
	respects it is little different from other tools and aids which we
	have accepted in the past. It is going through the similar stages
	of introduction, assessment and acceptance as did fluoroscopy or
	arthro-scopy. It promises to have an impact of similar magnitude.
	Yet computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) is dif- ferent in
	some important respects.},

  abstract = {During the past year our group has been developing HipNav, a system
	which helps surgeons determine optimal, patient-specific acetabular
	implant placement and accurately achieve the desired implant placement
	during surgery. HipNav includes three components: a pre-operative
	planner, a range of motion simulator, and an intra-operative tracking
	and guidance system. The goals of the current HipNav system are to:
	1) reduce dislocations following total hip replace- ment surgery
	due to acetabular malposition; 2) determine and potentially increase
	the "safe" range of motion; 3) reduce wear debris resulting from
	impingement of the implant's femoral neck with the acetabular rim;
	and 4) track in real-time the position of the pelvis and acetabulum
	during surgery. The original implementation of the HipNav system
	was a proof-of-concept pro- totype which was useful for demonstrating
	the efficacy of this technology in-vit- ro. As the HipNav system
	progressed towards a clinical implementation, our efforts focussed
	on several practical development and validation issues. This pa-
	per describes our experience transforming HipNav from a proof-of-concept
	pro- totype into a robust clinical system, with emphasis on technical
	development and validation. Despite the highly applied nature of
	this endeavor, many fundamental research issues exist. The benefits
	of tightly coupling fundamental research to- gether with applied

	prototyping (RP) systems for the preoperative planning and fabrication
	of custom-made implant. Design/methodology/approach – A patient with
	mandible defect underwent reconstruction using custom-made implant.
	3D models of the patient’s skull are generated based on computed
	tomography image data. After evaluation of the 3D reconstructed image,
	it was identified that some bone fragment was moved due to the missing
	segment. During the implant design process, the correct position
	of the bone fragment was defined and the geometry of the custom-made
	implant was generated based on mirror image technique and is fabricated
	by a RP machine. Surgical approach such as preoperative planning
	and simulation of surgical procedures was performed using the fabricated
	skull models and custom-made implant. Findings – Results show that
	the stereolithography model provided an accurate tool for preoperative,
	surgical simulation. Research limitations/implications – The methods
	described above suffer from the expensive cost of RP technique. Practical
	implications – This method allows accurate fabrication of the implant.
	The advantages of using this technique are that the physical model
	of the implant is fitted on the skull model so that the surgeon can
	plan and rehearse the surgery in advance and a less invasive surgical
	procedure and less time-consuming reconstructive and an adequate
	esthetic can result. Originality/value – The method improves the
	reconstructive surgery and reduces the risk of a second intervention,
	and the psychological stress of the patient will be eliminated.},

  abstract = {Liver surgery is still one of the most demanding fields in surgery,
	and planning a liver resection always presents a challenge for a
	surgeon. Many authors have already described three-dimensional (3D)
	reconstructions of conventional computer tomography (CT) and nuclear
	magnetic resonance (NMR) scans, which enable precise surgery planning.
	But while the reconstruction can be seen, the user cannot simulate
	surgery. The ultimate goal has been to produce 3D reconstructions
	of the conventional CT or NMR slices and thus virtual environment
	that allows planning and simulation of the surgical procedure. The
	project of developing a computer program for planning and simulating
	liver surgery had three steps: The first step was creating a 3D virtual
	liver and virtual environment. The second step was developing the
	method to reconstruct the liver from conventional CT scans. The final
	step was transferring the data obtained to the previously created
	virtual environment for manipulation. The result of this process
	is a liver surgery educational tool, which produces a virtual environment
	using PC based software. It provides the opportunity to manipulate
	a 3D liver and it is tool for studying the internal liver structures
	for all four vessels systems. The virtual environment portrays a
	detailed liver segmentation. The program's most important function
	is allowing the opportunity to perform virtual intraoperative ultra
	sound on a virtual liver. The virtual liver can be dissected; the
	vessels can be clipped, ligated and cut. The program for 3D reconstruction
	from conventional CT scans has been developed so that the obtained
	data may be used for simulated surgery in the virtual environment.
	The virtual liver of the real patient has the capacity to be manipulated,
	cut, dissected; moreover, the intraoperative ultra sound can be performed
	as in the real surgery. First simulations have shown clear benefits
	in planning liver surgery. The rapid development of computer technology
	offers many possibilities in education and surgery planning. The
	group successfully developed the PC based application for surgery
	planning and simulation in virtual environment as well as for educational
	purposes.},

	to carry out the surgical procedure via a miniaturized camera represented
	the major change the surgical world experienced during the twentieth
	century: the minimally invasive surgery era was born. This revolution
	is about to experience a new twist linked to the appearance of a
	new original technique called Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic
	Surgery (NOTES) that could replace traditional laparoscopic surgery
	for a large set of procedures. By replacing the rigid optic that
	is introduced through the skin by a flexible optic that is introduced
	through a natural orifice such as stomach, vagina or colon, this
	new technique should eliminate all visible incisions. If the benefits
	for patients have clearly been proved for laparoscopic surgery, and
	whatever the result for NOTES, such minimally invasive techniques
	bring up new difficulties for surgeons, thus reducing their gesture
	capacity. The first difficulty is the loss of several senses such
	as the sense of touch and a modification of the force feedback feeling.
	In NOTES, this loss is greatly amplified due to the length of instruments
	making it difficult to feel a contact between an instrument and an
	organ. This lack of force feedback is also featured by current robotic
	systems, such as the Da Vinci robot from the Intuitive Surgical Company,
	currently the most used surgical robot worldwide. The use of stereoscopic
	vision, however, allowed to lessen that perception limit, compensating
	it by a 3D view of the operative scene filmed by two cameras. But
	this technique will be difficult to implement for transluminal endoscopic
	surgery, since it requires the extreme miniaturization of cameras
	while maintaining a high image resolution. Another solution consists
	in using virtual reality and augmented reality. Indeed, virtual reality
	allows to provide a preoperative 3D view of patients, operated from
	their medical image (CT scan or MRI). This virtual copy of patients
	can then be used in a preoperative simulator, what provides a realistic
	3D view of patients.},

	system for planning minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures.
	METHODS: Between October 2002 and April 2006, the authors used the
	Dextroscope (Volume Interactions, Ltd.) to plan neurosurgical procedures
	in 106 patients, including 100 with intracranial and 6 with spinal
	lesions. The planning was performed 1 to 3 days preoperatively, and
	in 12 cases, 3D prints of the planning procedure were taken into
	the operating room. A questionnaire was completed by the neurosurgeon
	after the planning procedure. RESULTS: After a short period of acclimatization,
	the system proved easy to operate and is currently used routinely
	for preoperative planning of difficult cases at the authors' institution.
	It was felt that working with a virtual reality multimodal model
	of the patient significantly improved surgical planning. The pathoanatomy
	in individual patients could easily be understood in great detail,
	enabling the authors to determine the surgical trajectory precisely
	and in the most minimally invasive way. CONCLUSIONS: The authors
	found the preoperative 3D model to be in high concordance with intraoperative
	conditions; the resulting intraoperative "d\'{e}j\`{a}-vu" feeling
	enhanced surgical confidence. In all procedures planned with the
	Dextroscope, the chosen surgical strategy proved to be the correct
	choice. Three-dimensional virtual reality models of a patient allow
	quick and easy understanding of complex intracranial lesions.},

	optimize the planning of surgical processes. METHODS: Segmentation
	algorithms for Computed Tomography (CT) images: a region growing
	procedure was used for soft tissues and a thresholding algorithm
	was implemented to segment bones. The algorithms operate semiautomati-
	cally since they only need seed selection with the mouse on each
	tissue segmented by the user. The novelty of the paper is the adaptation
	of an enhancement method based on histogram thresholding applied
	to CT images for surgical planning, which simplifies subsequent segmentation.
	A substantial improvement of the virtual reality tool VirSSPA was
	obtained with these algorithms. RESULTS: VirSSPA was used to optimize
	surgical planning, to decrease the time spent on surgical planning
	and to improve operative results. The success rate increases due
	to surgeons being able to see the exact extent of the patient's ailment.
	This tool can decrease operating room time, thus resulting in reduced
	costs. CONCLUSION: Virtual simulation was effective for optimizing
	surgical planning, which could, consequently, result in improved

  abstract = {Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) utilizing robotic or image-guided
	technologies has been introduced into various orthopedic fields.
	Navigation and robotic systems are the most advanced parts of CAS,
	and their range of functions and applications is increasing. Surgical
	navigation is a visualization system that gives positional information
	about surgical tools or implants relative to a target organ (bone)
	on a computer display. There are three types of surgical planning
	that involve navigation systems. One makes use of volumetric images,
	such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound
	echograms. Another makes use of intraoperative fluoroscopic images.
	The last type makes use of kinetic information about joints or morphometric
	information about the target bones obtained intraoperatively. Systems
	that involve these planning methods are called volumetric image-based
	navigation, fluoroscopic navigation, and imageless navigation, respectively.
	To overcome the inaccuracy of hand-controlled positioning of surgical
	tools, three robotic systems have been developed. One type directs
	a cutting guide block or a drilling guide sleeve, with surgeons sliding
	a bone saw or a drill bit through the guide instrument to execute
	a surgical action. Another type constrains the range of movement
	of a surgical tool held by a robot arm such as ACROBOT. The last
	type is an active system, such as ROBODOC or CASPAR, which directs
	a milling device automatically according to preoperative planning.
	These CAS systems, their potential, and their limitations are reviewed
	here. Future technologies and future directions of CAS that will
	help provide improved patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner
	are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Interactive visual analysis of a patient’s anatomy by means of computer-generated
	3D imagery is crucial for diagnosis, pre-operative planning, and
	surgical training. The task of visualization is no longer limited
	to producing images at interactive rates, but also includes the guided
	extraction of significant features to assist the user in the data
	exploration process. An effective visualization module has to perform
	a problem-specific abstraction of the dataset, leading to a more
	compact and hence more efficient visual representation. Moreover,
	many medical applications, such as surgical training simulators and
	pre- operative planning for plastic and reconstructive surgery, require
	the visualization of datasets that are dynamically modified or even
	generated by a physics-based simulation engine. In this paper we
	present a set of approaches that allow interactive exploration of
	medical datasets in real time. Our method combines direct volume
	rendering via ray-casting with a novel approach for isosurface extraction
	and re-use directly on graphics processing units (GPUs) in a single
	framework. The isosurface extraction technique takes advantage of
	the recently introduced Microsoft DirectX r 10 pipeline for dynamic
	surface extraction in real time using geometry shaders. This surface
	is constructed in polygonal form and can be directly used post-extraction
	for collision detection, rendering, and optimization. The resulting
	polygonal surface can also be analyzed for geometric properties,
	such as feature area, volume and size deviation, which is crucial
	for semi-automatic tumor analysis as used, for example, in colonoscopy.
	Additionally, we have developed a technique for real-time volume
	data analysis by providing an interactive user interface for designing
	material properties for organs in the scanned volume. Combining isosurface
	with direct volume rendering allows visualization of the surface
	properties as well as the context of tissues surrounding the region
	and gives better context for navigation. Our application can be used
	with CT and MRI scan data, or with a variety of other medical and
	scientific applications. The techniqueswepresent are general and
	intuitive to implement and can be used for many other interactive
	environments and effects, separately or together.},

	surgery (IGS) has been introduced successfully in many modern operating

	a standard computer monitor. Alter- natively, one could enhance the
	direct sight of the physician by an overlay of the virtual data onto
	the real patient view. Such in situ visualization methods have been
	proposed in the literature for pro- viding a more intuitive visualization,
	improving the ergonomics as well as the hand-eye coordination. In
	this paper,we first discuss the fundamental issues and the recent
	endeavors in advanced display and visualization for IGS.We then present
	some of our recentwork comparing two navigation systems: 1) a classical
	monitor based navigation and 2) a new navigation system we had developed
	based on in situ visualization. As both solutions reveal shortcomings
	as well as complementary advantages, we introduce a new solution
	that combines both concepts into one hybrid user interface. Finally,
	experimental results report on the performance of several surgeons
	using an external monitor as well as a stereo video see-through head-mounted
	display (HMD). The experiments consist of drilling into a phantom
	in order to reach planted deep-seated targets only visible inComputedTomography(CT)data.We
	evaluate several vi- sualization techniques, including thenewhybridsolution,andstudy
	their influence on the performance of the participant surgeons.},

	curves to approximate ellipse-like shoulder structures including
	the humeral stem, tubercle and contact joint as well as the glenoid
	on every CT transverse section. Radius changes from structure centers
	to bone boundaries are recognized as convex, concave, separate and
	hole features that are then identified as pathological spurs, fractures
	and tumors. The centers and radii of these structures from the transverse
	sections are integrated to determine the properties of the humeral
	stem and contact joint with the glenoid, including the stem axis
	as well as the contact joint and glenoid centers, radii and attitudes.
	Based on the geometric evaluations of these structures and features,
	the GH joint surgery including tumor dissect and bone graft, open
	reduction using screws and plate or nails, and arthroplasty are automatically
	managed to achieve the normal GH joint functions including dissection
	of tumors, reduction of fractures or dislocations, and free GH joint
	motions. This prototype system can be used as a qualitative and quantitative
	tool for the GH joint diseases diagnoses and surgery managements.

	useful for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome measurement,
	but precision of 3-dimensional (3D) surgical simulation still needs
	to be tested. This study was conducted to determine whether the virtual
	surgery performed on 3D models constructed from cone-beam computed
	tomography (CBCT) can correctly simulate the actual surgical outcome
	and to validate the ability of this emerging technology to recreate
	the orthognathic surgery hard tissue movements in 3 translational
	and 3 rotational planes of space. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Construction
	of pre- and postsurgery 3D models from CBCTs of 14 patients who had
	combined maxillary advancement and mandibular setback surgery and
	6 patients who had 1-piece maxillary advancement surgery was performed.
	The postsurgery and virtually simulated surgery 3D models were registered
	at the cranial base to quantify differences between simulated and
	actual surgery models. Hotelling t tests were used to assess the
	differences between simulated and actual surgical outcomes. RESULTS:
	For all anatomic regions of interest, there was no statistically
	significant difference between the simulated and the actual surgical
	models. The right lateral ramus was the only region that showed a
	statistically significant, but small difference when comparing 2-
	and 1-jaw surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual surgical methods were reliably
	reproduced. Oral surgery residents could benefit from virtual surgical
	training. Computer simulation has the potential to increase predictability
	in the operating room.},

	for the upper extremities (DIPEX), as this effort is called, is a
	clinically driven multidisciplinary programme consisting of many
	contributory aspects. A part of this research programme focuses on
	the pre-operative planning and per-operative guidance issues. The
	ultimate goal of this part of the DIPEX project is to create a surgical
	support infrastructure that can be used to predict the optimal surgical
	protocol and can assist with the selection of the most suitable endoprosthesis
	for a particular patient. In the pre-operative planning phase, advanced
	biomechanical models of the endoprosthesis fixation and the musculo-skeletal
	system of the shoulder will be incorporated, which are adjusted to
	the individualâ€™s morphology. Subsequently, the support infrastructure
	must assist the surgeon during the operation in executing his surgical
	plan. In the per-operative phase, the chosen optimal position of
	the endoprosthesis can be realised using camera-assisted tools or
	mechanical guidance tools. In this article, the pathway towards the
	desired surgical support infrastructure is described. Furthermore,
	we discuss the pre-operative planning phase and the per- operative
	guidance phase, the initial work performed, and finally, possible

  abstract = {Attaching tantalum markers to prostheses for Roentgen stereophotogrammetry
	(RSA) may be diffcult and is sometimes even impossible. In this study,
	a model-based RSA method that avoids the attachment of markers to
	prostheses is presented and validated. This model-based RSA method
	uses a triangulated surface model of the implant. A projected contour
	of this model is calculated and this calculated model contour is
	matched onto the detected contour of the actual implant in the RSA
	radiograph. The diﬀerence between the two contours is minimized by
	variation of the position and orientation of the model. When a minimal
	diﬀerence between the contours is found, an optimal position and
	orientation of the model has been obtained. The method was validated
	by means of a phantom experiment. Three prosthesis components were
	used in this experiment: the femoral and tibial component of an Interax
	total knee prosthesis (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics Corp., Rutherfort,
	USA) and the femoral component of a Proﬁx total knee prosthesis (Smith
	& Nephew, Memphis, USA). For the prosthesis components used in this
	study, the accuracy of the model-based method is lower than the accuracy
	of traditional RSA. For the Interax femoral and tibial components,
	signiﬁcant dimensional tolerances were found that were probably caused
	by the casting process and manual polishing of the
	
	components surfaces. The largest standard deviation for any translation
	was 0.19 mm and for any rotation it was 0.528. For the Proﬁx femoral
	component that had no large dimensional tolerances, the largest standard
	deviation for any translation was 0.22 mm and for any rotation it
	was 0.228. From this study we may conclude that the accuracy of the
	current model-based RSA method is sensitive to dimensional tolerances
	of the implant. Research is now being conducted to make model-based
	RSA less sensitive to dimensional tolerances and thereby improving
	its accuracy.},

	Collision detection is a promising means to achieve this simulation.
	In this paper, therefore, an efficient collision detection method
	based on a new 3D signed distance field algorithm is proposed to
	accurately detect the contact positions and compute the penetration
	depth with the moving of the bones in the simulation, and thus the
	contact force between the bones and the soft tissues can be estimated
	using penalty methods. Thereafter, a nonlinear finite element model
	is employed to compute the deformation of the soft tissue model.
	The performance of the proposed collision detection algorithm has
	been improved in memory requirements and computational efficiency
	against the conventional methods. In addition, the proposed approach
	has the superior convergence characteristics against other methods.
	Therefore, the usage of the collision detection method can effectively

	The new algorithm is a form of spatially varying statistical classification,

	consists of an iterated sequence of spatially varying classification
	and nonlinear registration, which forms an adaptive, template moderated

	methods and nonlinear registration methods are often complementary,

	of the disadvantages of each approach alone while exploiting the
	combination. The ATM SVC algorithm was applied to several segmentation
	problems, involving different image contrast mechanisms and different

	carried out for problems involving the quantification of normal anatomy
	(MRI of brains of neonates) and pathology of various types (MRI of

	cup placement, the system was introduced into clinical routine. The
	computation of the angular orientation of the cup is based on reference
	coordinates from the anterior pelvic plane (APP) concept. A hybrid
	strategy for pelvic land- mark acquisition has been introduced involving
	percuta- neous pointer-based digitization with the noninvasive bi-
	planar landmark reconstruction using multiple registered fluoroscopy
	images. From January 2001 to May 2002, 118 consecutive patients (mean
	age 68 years, 82 male, 36 female, and 62 left and 56 right hip joints)
	were oper- ated on with the hybrid CT-free navigation system. Dur-
	ing each operation, the angular orientation of the inserted implant
	was recorded. To determine the placement accu- racy of the acetabular
	components, the first 50 consecu- tive patients underwent a CT scan
	7â€“10 days postopera- tively to analyze the cup position relative
	to the APP. This was done blinded with commercial planning soft-
	ware. There was no significant learning curve observed for the use
	of the system. Mean values for postoperative inclination read 43Â°
	(SD 3.0, range 37â€“49) and antever- sion 19Â° (SD 3.9, range 10â€“28).
	The resulting system ac- curacy, i.e., the difference between intraoperatively
	cal- culated cup orientation and postoperatively measured implant
	position, shows a maximum error of 5Â° for the inclination (mean
	1.5Â°, SD 1.1) and 6Â° for the antever- sion (mean 2.4Â°, SD 1.3).
	An accuracy of better than 5Â° inclination and 6Â° anteversion was
	achieved under clini- cal conditions, which implies that there is
	no significant difference in performance from the established CT-based
	navigation methods. Image-guided CT-free cup naviga-tion provides
	a reliable solution for future total hip ar- throplasty (THA).},

  abstract = {The articular surface of the normal humeral head has a variable posterior
	and medial offset with respect to the central axis of the humeral
	shaft. Recreation of the normal humeral head shaft offset is postulated
	to be an important consideration during shoulder arthroplasty. However,
	the effect of humeral head malposition is unknown. The purpose of
	this study was to determine the effect of articular malposition after
	total shoulder arthroplasty on glenohumeral translation, range of
	motion, and subacromial impingement. Twenty-one human cadavers were
	dissected and tested with the use of an active or passive shoulder
	model. Range of motion and translation were recorded by means of
	an electromagnetic tracking device. The experiment was performed
	in 2 phases. For kinematics study, 11 cadaver shoulders were positioned
	both passively and actively from maximum internal rotation to maximum
	external rotation at 90 degrees of total elevation in the scapular
	plane. Three rotator cuff and 3 deltoid muscle lines of action were
	simulated for active joint positioning. Passive joint positioning
	was accomplished with the use of a torque wrench and a nominal centering
	force. The testing protocol was used for the natural joint as well
	as for 9 prosthetic head locations: centered and 2- and 4-mm offsets
	in the anterior, posterior, inferior, and superior directions. Repeated-measures
	analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences
	in the range of motion and translation between active and passive
	positioning of the natural joint as well as all prosthetic head positions.
	(2) For impingement study, 10 cadaver shoulders were used in a passive
	model, loading the tendons of the rotator cuff with a 30-N centering
	force. The humerus was passively rotated from maximum internal rotation
	(1500 Nmm) to maximum external rotation (1500 Nmm) by means of a
	continuous-recording digital torque wrench. Trials were performed
	with the use of centered, 4-, 6-, and 8-mm offset heads in the anterior,
	posterior, superior, and inferior positions before and after removal
	of the acromion and coracoacromial ligament. The relation between
	change in mean peak torque (with and without acromion), passive range
	of motion, and humeral head offset was analyzed by means of repeated-measures
	analysis of variance. In the kinematics study, total range of motion
	and all humeral translations were greater with passive joint positioning
	than with active positioning (P =.01) except for total superior-inferior
	translation and superior-inferior translation in external rotation.
	Anterior to posterior humeral head offset was associated with statistically
	significant changes in total range of motion (P =.02), range of internal
	rotation (P =.02), range of external rotation (P =.0001), and total
	anterior-posterior translation (P =.01). Superior to inferior humeral
	head offset resulted in statistically significant changes in total
	range of motion (P =.02), range of internal rotation (P =.0001),
	anterior-posterior translation during external rotation (P =.01),
	and total superior-inferior translation (P =.03). In the impingement
	study, there was a significant increase in torque from centered to
	4-mm inferior offset (P =.006), 6-mm inferior offset (P <.001), and
	8-mm inferior offset (P <.001). There was no significant increase
	in torque with superior, anterior, and posterior offsets. Glenohumeral
	motion significantly decreased from 129 degrees for centered head
	to 119 degrees for 8-mm superior (P =.002), 119 degrees for 8-mm
	anterior (P =.014), 118 degrees for 8-mm inferior (P <.001), and
	114 degrees for 8-mm posterior (P =.001). Humeral articular malposition
	of 4 mm or less during prosthetic arthroplasty of the glenohumeral
	joint may lead to small alterations in humeral translations and range
	of motion. Inferior malposition of greater than 4 mm can lead to
	increased subacromial contact; offset of 8 mm in any direction results
	in significant decreases in passive range of motion. Therefore if
	subacromial contact is to be minimized and glenohumeral motion maximized
	after shoulder replacement, anatomic reconstruction of the humeral
	head-humeral shaft offset to within 4 mm is desirable.},

	algorithmic scope of medical imaging, especially for segmentation

	applied to be useful, which additionally requires visualization and
	interaction. The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has powerful visualization
	capabilities, but only low-level support for interaction. In this
	paper, we present the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK).
	The goal of MITK is to significantly reduce the effort required to
	construct specifically tailored, interactive applications for medical
	image analysis. MITK allows an easy combination of algorithms developed
	by ITK with visualizations created by VTK and extends these two toolkits
	with those features, which are outside the scope of both. MITK adds
	support for complex interactions with multiple states as well as
	undo-capabilities, a very important prerequisite for convenient user
	interfaces. Furthermore, MITK facilitates the realization of multiple,
	different views of the same data (as a multiplanar reconstruction
	and a 3D rendering) and supports the visualization of 3D+t data,
	whereas VTK is only designed to create one kind of view of 2D or
	3D data. MITK reuses virtually everything from ITK and VTK. Thus,
	it is not at all a competitor to ITK or VTK, but an extension, which
	eases the combination of both and adds the features required for
	interactive, convenient to use medical imaging software. MITK is
	an open-source project (www.mitk.org).},

	object from 2D cross sectional images is influenced by displacing
	the images from the source object, as is customary in medical imaging.
	Three experiments were conducted to assess people's ability to integrate
	spatial information over a series of cross sectional images in order
	to visualize an object posed in 3D space. Participants used a hand-held
	tool to reveal a virtual rod as a sequence of cross-sectional images,
	which were displayed either directly in the space of exploration
	(in-situ) or displaced to a remote screen (ex-situ). They manipulated
	a response stylus to match the virtual rod's pitch (vertical slant),
	yaw (horizontal slant), or both. Consistent with the hypothesis that
	spatial colocation of image and source object facilitates mental
	visualization, we found that although single dimensions of slant
	were judged accurately with both displays, judging pitch and yaw
	simultaneously produced differences in systematic error between in-situ
	and ex-situ displays. Ex-situ imaging also exhibited errors such
	that the magnitude of the response was approximately correct but
	the direction was reversed. Regression analysis indicated that the
	in-situ judgments were primarily based on spatiotemporal visualization,
	while the ex-situ judgments relied on an ad hoc, screen-based heuristic.
	These findings suggest that in-situ displays may be useful in clinical
	practice by reducing error and facilitating the ability of radiologists
	to visualize 3D anatomy from cross sectional images.},

	the treatment of patients with complex CMF deformities. PATIENTS
	AND METHODS: Five patients with complex CMF deformities were enrolled.
	Surgeries were planned with the CASS planning method. Surgical plans
	were transferred to patients at the time of surgery via computer-generated
	splints. After surgery, outcome evaluation was completed by first
	superimposing the postoperative computed tomography (CT) model onto
	the planned model, and then measuring the differences between planned
	and actual outcomes. The criteria used to determine the accuracy
	of the technique were as follows: a linear difference between planned
	and actual outcomes of less than 2 mm, and an angular difference
	of less than 4 degrees . RESULTS: All patients underwent surgery
	as planned. With the use of CASS planning, medians of the differences
	between planned and actual postoperative outcomes were limited to
	0.9 mm and 1.7 degrees . CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study
	are promising. They will be used as the basis of calculations needed

	to undergo a computed tomography scan and a stereolithographic model
	is necessary for the surgical planning process. The costs for each
	method can be divided into time and other costs. The time was estimated
	based on the authors' experience as well as on a survey of a small
	group of 6 experienced CMF surgeons in the United States. The other
	costs were estimated based on the authors' experience.Results CASS
	has lower costs in terms of surgeon time, patient time, and material
	costs. Specifically, total surgeon hours spent in planning are 5.25
	hours compared with 9.75 for current standard methods. Material and
	scanning costs are $1,900 for CASS compared with about $3,510 for
	standard methods. Patient time for planning is reduced from 4.75
	hours to 2.25 hours with CASS. The reduction in both time and other
	costs remains when the fixed fee costs of CASS are added to the variable
	costs. Amortized across the 600 patients per year (1,800 for the
	assumed 3-year life of the training and software), this adds only
	a few dollars and a fraction of an hour per surgery. Even in the
	case of a small clinic when the cost is amortized for 6 patients
	per year (18 patients for the assumed 3-year life of the training
	and software), the per surgery costs (9.65 hours and $2,456) will
	still favor CASS.Conclusion Any great new design should consist of
	at least 2 of the 3 following features: faster, cheaper, and better
	outcome. This analysis demonstrates that CASS is faster and less
	costly than the current standard planning methods for complex CMF
	surgery. Previous studies have also shown that CASS results in better
	surgical outcomes. Thus, in all regards, CASS appears to be at least
	as good as the current methods of surgical planning.},

  abstract = {Image-based computational fluid dynamics provides great promise for
	evaluation of vascular devices and assessment of surgical procedures.
	However, many previous studies employ idealized arterial and device
	models or patient-specific models with a limited number of cases,
	since the model construction process is tedious and time-consuming.
	Moreover, in contrast to retrospective studies from existing image
	data, there is a pressing need of prospective analysis with the goal
	of surgical planning. Therefore, it is necessary to construct models
	with implanted devices in a fast, virtual and interactive fashion.
	The goal of this paper is to develop new geometric methods to deploy
	stent grafts virtually to patient-specific models constructed from
	direct 3D segmentation of medical images. A triangular surface representing
	vessel lumen boundary is extracted from the segmentation. The diseased
	portion is then clipped and replaced by the surface of a virtual
	stent graft following the centerline obtained from the clipped portion.
	A Y-shape stent graft is employed in case of bifurcated arteries.
	A method to map a 2D strut pattern on the stent graft is also presented.
	We demonstrate the application of our methods to quantify wall shear
	stresses and forces acting on stent grafts in personalized surgical
	planning for endovascular treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic
	aneurysms. Our approach enables prospective model construction and
	may help to increase its throughput required by routine clinical
	uses in the future.},

	On the basis of these criteria, one can assess whether an algorithm

	Currently, the only registration algorithms that address these criteria

  abstract = {Image segmentation is an important processing step in many image,
	video and computer vision applications. Extensive research has been
	done in creating many different approaches and algorithms for image
	segmentation, but it is still difficult to assess whether one algorithm
	produces more accurate segmentations than another, whether it be
	for a particular image or set of images, or more generally, for a
	whole class of images. To date, the most common method for evaluating
	the effectiveness of a segmentation method is subjective evaluation,
	in which a human visually compares the image segmentation results
	for separate segmentation algorithms, which is a tedious process
	and inherently limits the depth of evaluation to a relatively small
	number of segmentation comparisons over a predetermined set of images.
	Another common evaluation alternative is supervised evaluation, in
	which a segmented image is compared against a manually-segmented
	or pre-processed reference image. Evaluation methods that require
	user assistance, such as subjective evaluation and supervised evaluation,
	are infeasible in many vision applications, so unsupervised methods
	are necessary. Unsupervised evaluation enables the objective comparison
	of both different segmentation methods and different parameterizations
	of a single method, without requiring human visual comparisons or
	comparison with a manually-segmented or pre-processed reference image.
	Additionally, unsupervised methods generate results for individual
	images and images whose characteristics may not be known until evaluation
	time. Unsupervised methods are crucial to real-time segmentation
	evaluation, and can furthermore enable self-tuning of algorithm parameters
	based on evaluation results. In this paper, we examine the unsupervised
	objective evaluation methods that have been proposed in the literature.
	An extensive evaluation of these methods are presented. The advantages
	and shortcomings of the underlying design mechanisms in these methods

	Based on computer- tomography multi-slice images of the liver, the

	The identification and quantitative assessment of regions, which

	in several evaluation studies of our medical partners and more than
	2900 complex surgical cases have been analyzed since 2002. the To
	transfer these pre-operative planning information into intra-operative
	stage, it is of crucial importance to understand the user needs and

  abstract = {We describe a series of experiments that compared 2D/3D input methods
	for selection and positioning tasks related to medical image analysis.
	For our study, we chose a switchable P5 Glove Controller, which can
	be used to provide both 2DOF and 6DOF input control. Our results
	suggest that for both tasks the overall performance and accuracy
	can be improved when the input device with more degrees of freedom
	(DOF) is used for manipulation of the visualized medical data. 3D
	input turned out to be more beneficial for the positioning task than
	for the selection task. In order to determine a potential source
	of the difference in the task completion time between 2D and 3D input,
	we also investigated whether there was a significant difference between
	2DOF and 6DOF input methods with regard to the time spent on task-specific
	basic manipulations.},
