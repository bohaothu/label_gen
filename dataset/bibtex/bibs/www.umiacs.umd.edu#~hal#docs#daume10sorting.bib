    Kernelized sorting is an approach for matching objects from
    two sources (or domains) that does not require any prior notion
    of similarity between objects across the two sources. Unfortunately,
    this technique is highly sensitive to initialization
    and high dimensional data. We present variants of kernelized
    sorting to increase its robustness and performance on several
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: document matching
    from parallel and comparable corpora, machine transliteration
    and even image processing. Empirically we show that,
    on these tasks, a semi-supervised variant of kernelized sorting
    outperforms matching canonical correlation analysis.
