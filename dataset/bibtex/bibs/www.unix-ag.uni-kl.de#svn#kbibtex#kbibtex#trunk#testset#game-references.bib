The definition shows games to be transmedial: There is no single game medium, but rather a number of game media, each with its own strengths. The computer is simply the latest game medium to emerge. While computer games1 are therefore part of the broader area of games, they have in many cases evolved beyond the classic game model. Keywords Game definition, game history, transmedial gaming; computer game history. ",
