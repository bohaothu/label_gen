  abstract	= {In this report we give an overview of usability aspects
		  applicable to mobile devices and systems. A number of
		  research projects from three different application areas
		  are presented and experiences from the projects are
		  discussed. To successfully design usable products, services
		  and systems both for leisure and for mobile work practice
		  has turned out to be a difficult undertaking. Many systems
		  fail because of a number of reasons. Some systems do not
		  fail, but remains difficult and cumbersome to use. A
		  certain immaturity can be observed since developers and
		  designers do not fully utilise the benefits and assets
		  provided by today's technology in design of mobile systems.
		  For mobile systems, the varying contexts of use become more
		  important. When only relying on existing knowledge of
		  design for stationary systems, important possibilities are
		  often lost and the system has gone astray.}
