ABSTRACT:: 
Unlike traditional authoring, multimedia authoring involves making hard
choices, forecasting technological evolution and adapting to software and
hardware technology changes.  It is, perhaps, an unstable field of endeavor for
an academic to be in.  Yet, it is important that academics are, in fact, part
of this process.  This paper discusses some of the common threads shared by
three dissimilar cases of multimedia authoring which we have experimented with,
that of multimedia conference proceedings, multimedia courseware development
and multimedia information kiosks.  We consider these applications from an
academic point of view and review the benefits and pitfalls of academic
development while sharing points of hard-learned wisdom.  We draw on
experiences from some of the projects run at the Dartmouth Experimental
Visualization Laboratory (DEVlab), where we have been developing different
types of multimedia applications.
