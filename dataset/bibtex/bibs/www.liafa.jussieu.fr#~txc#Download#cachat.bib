  title = {Games on Pushdown Graphs and Extensions},
  year = {2003},
  abstract  = {Two player games are a standard model of reactive computation, 
where e.g. one player is the controller and the other is the environment. A 
game is won by a player if she has a winning strategy, i.e., if she can win 
every play. Given a finite description of the game, our aim is to compute the 
winner and a winning strategy. For finite graphs these problems have been 
solved for a long time, although some complexity questions remain open.

We consider several classes of infinite graphs, from transition graphs of 
pushdown automata up to graphs of the Caucal hierarchy, and we investigate 
different winning conditions: reachability, recurrence (Büchi), parity, and 
a Sigma_3-condition.

Two kinds of techniques are developed: a symbolic approach based on finite 
automata recognizing infinite sets of configurations and a game simulation 
which reduces a given game into a simpler one and solves it. Different kinds 
of strategies are also constructed: either positional or based on pushdown 
stack memories.

that such games are determined and that each of both players has a memoryless 
winning strategy on his winning region. The aim of this paper is to show
how to compute 
effectively the winning region of Player 0 and a memoryless winning strategy.
The idea is to simulate the pushdown system in the
full W-tree, where W is a finite set of directions,
and to use the expressive power of alternating two-way tree
automata to answer these questions. Finally it is necessary to translate the
2-way tree automaton into an equivalent nondeterministic one-way tree
automaton.

  abstract =  {We study infinite two-player games over pushdown graphs 
with a winning condition that refers explicitly to the infinity 
of the game graph: A play is won by player 0 if some vertex 
is visited infinity often during the play. We show that the set 
of winning plays is a proper Sigma-3-set in the Borel hierarchy,
thus transcending the Boolean closure of Sigma-2-sets which 
arises with the standard automata theoretic winning conditions
(such as the Muller, Rabin, or parity condition). We also show 
that this Sigma-3-game over pushdown graphs can be solved 
effectively (by a computation of the winning region of player 0 
and his memoryless winning strategy). This seems to be a first 
example of an effectively solvable game beyond the second level of 
the Borel hierarchy.

many primes.}
