    abstract    ={
               The article that made him famous as a bibliometrician (avant la lettre) is just
               a footnote in his oeuvre. He showed that the number of authors with n
               publications in a bibliography is described by a power law of the form
               C/n$, where C is a constant. The exponent  $ is often close to 2. Rewriting
               this equation as a statistical distribution (so that the sum over all n becomes
               1), he showed that in the case that $ is exactly equal to two, C must be
               6/B², or approximately 0.61. This means that if a bibliography can be
               described by Lotka's square law, approximately 61% of all authors have
               contributed just one article to this bibliography.}
