%X Dynamic environments represent a quite complex domain, where the information available changes continuously. In this paper, a contingency response system for dynamic environments called MACSDE is presented. The explained system allows the introduction of information, the monitoring of the process and the generation of predictions. The system makes use of a Case-Based Reasoning system which generates predictions using previously gathered information. It employs a distributed multi-agent architecture so that the main components of the system can be accessed remotely. Therefore, all functionalities can communicate in a distributed way, even from mobile devices. The core of the system is a group of deliberative agents acting as controllers and administrators for all functionalities. The system explained includes a novel network for data classification and retrieval. Such network works as a summarization algorithm for the results of an ensemble of Self-Organizing Maps. The presented system has been tested with data related with oil spills and forest fire, obtaining quite hopeful results.
