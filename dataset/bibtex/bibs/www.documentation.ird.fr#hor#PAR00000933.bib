  abstract = {{I}n vitro micropropagation based on somatic embryogenesis provides an efficient means to multiply selected genotypes of oil palm ({E}laeis guineensis {J}acq.). {D}espite its considerable potential, somatic embryogenesis can yield plants bearing a homeotic flowering abnormality known as mantled. {B}ecause the mantled abnormality is epigenetic, it cannot be detected with conventional structural molecular markers. {T}hus, to develop a means of discriminating among callus cultures carrying or lacking the mantled abnormality, we used a gene expression approach. {W}e describe two novel oil palm genes, {E}g{M}39{A} and {E}g{IAA}1, both of which display increased transcript accumulation in epigenetically abnormal calli. {E}g{IAA}1 codes for an oil palm relative of the {A}rabidopsis thaliana ({L}.) {H}eynh. {AXR}3/{IAA}17 protein involved in early auxin response and {E}g{M}39{A} codes for a protein of unknown function sharing sequence similarities with asparagine synthetases. {I}n addition to their enhanced expression in somaclonal variant callus lines, both genes displayed increased transcript accumulation in response to auxin treatment. {N}ormal seed-derived zygotic embryos germinated in the presence of auxin accumulated increased amounts of {E}g{IAA}1 transcripts after a few hours of treatment, suggesting a role in auxin response similar to that demonstrated for {IAA} genes in other species. {T}he {E}g{M}39{A} gene also displayed enhanced transcript accumulation in auxin-treated zygotic embryos. {A}lthough only a small increase was seen after 24 h, greater changes were observed after 15 days. {B}oth genes show potential as early markers of clonal conformity and may help to elucidate the nature of the epigenetic changes causing the mantled abnormality.},
