  abstract =     "Investigating virtual environments has become an
                 increasingly interesting research topic for engineers,
                 computer and cognitive scientists, and psychologists.
                 Although there have been several recent studies focused
                 on the development of multimodal virtual environments
                 (VEs) to study human-machine interactions, less
                 attention has been paid to human-human and
                 human-machine interactions in shared virtual
                 environments (SVEs), and to our knowledge, no attention
                 paid at all to what extent the addition of haptic
                 communication between people would contribute to the
                 shared experience. We have developed a multimodal
                 shared virtual environment and performed a set of
                 experiments with human subjects to study the role of
                 haptic feedback in collaborative tasks and whether
                 haptic communication through force feedback can
                 facilitate a sense of being and collaborating with a
                 remote partner. The study concerns a scenario where two
                 participants at remote sites must cooperate to perform
                 a joint task in an SVE. The goals of the study are (1)
                 to assess the impact of force feedback on task
                 performance, (2) to better understand the role of
                 haptic communication in human-human interactions, (3)
                 to study the impact of touch on the subjective sense of
                 collaborating with a human as reported by the
                 participants based on what they could see and feel, and
                 (4) to investigate if gender, personality, or emotional
                 experiences of users can affect haptic communication in
                 SVEs. The outcomes of this research can have a powerful
                 impact on the development of next-generation
                 human-computer interfaces and network protocols that
                 integrate touch and force feedback technology into the
                 Internet, development of protocols and techniques for
                 collaborative teleoperation such as hazardous material
                 removal, space station.",

  abstract =     "The information explosion across the Internet and
                 elsewhere offers access to an increasing number of
                 document collections. In order for users to effectively
                 access these collections, information retrieval (IR)
                 systems must provide coordinated, concurrent, and
                 distributed access. In this article, we explore how to
                 achieve scalable performance in a distributed system
                 for collection sizes ranging from 1GB to 128GB. We
                 implement a fully functional distributed IR system
                 based on a multithreaded version of the Inquery
                 simulation model. We measure performance as a function
                 of system parameters such as client command rate,
                 number of document collections, ter ms per query, query
                 term frequency, number of answers returned, and command
                 mixture. Our results show that it is important to model
                 both query and document commands because the
                 heterogeneity of commands significantly impacts
                 performance. Based on our results, we recommend simple
                 changes to the prototype and evaluate the changes using
                 the simulator. Because of the significant resource
                 demands of information retrieval, it is not difficult
                 to generate workloads that overwhelm system resources
                 regardless of the architecture. However under some
                 realistic workloads, we demonstrate system
                 organizations for which response time gracefully
                 degrades as the workload increases and performance
                 scales with the number of processors. This scalable
                 architecture includes a surprisingly small number of
                 brokers through which a large number of clients and
                 servers communicate.",

                 ``World Wide Web'' security has become a very important
                 concern in the design and implementation of software
                 systems. Since security has become an important issue,
                 the number of protocols in this domain has become very
                 large. These protocols are very diverse in nature. If a
                 software architect wants to deploy some of these
                 protocols in a system, they have to be sure that the
                 protocol has the right properties as dictated by the
                 requirements of the system. In this article we present
                 BRUTUS, a tool for verifying properties of security
                 protocols. This tool can be viewed as a special-purpose
                 model checker for security protocols. We also present
                 reduction techniques that make the tool efficient.
                 Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the
                 efficiency of BRUTUS.",

  abstract =     "In this paper we review studies of the growth of the
                 Internet and technologies that are useful for
                 information search and retrieval on the Web. We present
                 data on the Internet from several different sources,
                 e.g., current as well as projected number of users,
                 hosts, and Web sites. Although numerical figures vary,
                 overall trends cited by the sources are consistent and
                 point to exponential growth in the past and in the
                 coming decade. Hence it is not surprising that about
                 85% of Internet users surveyed claim using search
                 engines and search services to find specific
                 information. The same surveys show, however, that users
                 are not satisfied with the performance of the current
                 generation of search engines; the slow retrieval speed,
                 communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved
                 results (e.g., noise and broken links) are commonly
                 cited problems. We discuss the development of new
                 techniques targeted to resolve some of the problems
                 associated with Web-based information retrieval and
                 speculate on future trends.",

  abstract =     "Java bytecode verification forms the basis for
                 Java-based Internet security and needs a rigorous
                 description. One important aspect of bytecode
                 verification is to check if a Java Virtual Machine
                 (JVM) program is statically well-typed. So far, several
                 formal specifications have been proposed to define what
                 the static well-typedness means. This paper takes a
                 step further and presents a chaotic fixpoint iteration,
                 which represents a family of fixpoint computation
                 strategies to compute a least type for each JVM program
                 within a finite number of iteration steps. Since a
                 transfer function in the iteration is not monotone, we
                 choose to follow the example of a nonstandard fixpoint
                 theorem, which requires that all transfer functions are
                 increasing, and monotone in case the bigger element is
                 already a fixpoint. The resulting least type is the
                 artificial top element if and only if he JVM program is
                 not statically well-typed. The iteration is standard
                 and close to Sun's informal specification and most
                 commercial bytecode verifiers.",

  abstract =     "In order to run untrusted code in the same process as
                 trusted code, there must be a mechanism to allow
                 dangerous calls to determine if their caller is
                 authorized to exercise the privilege of using the
                 dangerous routine. Java systems have adopted a
                 technique called stack inspection to address this
                 concern. But its original definition, in terms of
                 searching stack frames, had an unclear relationship to
                 the actual achievement of security, overconstrained the
                 implementation of a Java system, limited many desirable
                 optimizations such as method inlining and tail
                 recursion, and generally interfered with
                 interprocedural optimization. We present a new
                 semantics for stack inspection based on a belief logic
                 and its implementation using the calculus of {\em
                 security-passing style\/} which addresses the concerns
                 of traditional stack inspection. With security-passing
                 style, we can efficiently represent the security
                 context for any method activation, and we can build a
                 new implementation strictly by rewriting the Java
                 bytecodes before they are loaded by the system. No
                 changes to the JVM or bytecode semantics are necessary.
                 With a combination of static analysis and runtime
                 optimizations, our prototype implementation shows
                 reasonable performance (although traditional stack
                 inspection is still faster), and is easier to consider
                 for languages beyond Java. We call our system SAFKASI
                 (the Security Architecture Formerly Known as Stack
                 Inspection).",

  abstract =     "The components of a loosely coupled system are
                 typically designed to operate by generating and
                 responding to asynchronous events. An {\em event
                 notification service\/} is an application-independent
                 infrastructure that supports the construction of
                 event-based systems, whereby generators of events
                 publish event notifications to the infrastructure and
                 consumers of events subscribe with the infrastructure
                 to receive relevant notification. The two primary
                 services that should be provided to components by the
                 infrastructure are notification selection (i.e.,
                 determining which notifications match which
                 subscriptions) and notification delivery (i.e., routing
                 matching notifications from publishers to subscribers).
                 Numerous event notification services have been
                 developed for local-area networks, generally based on a
                 centralized server to select and deliver event
                 notifications. Therefore, they suffer from an inherent
                 inability to scale to wide-area networks, such as the
                 internet, where the number and physical distribution of
                 the service's clients can quickly overwhelm a
                 centralized solution. The critical challenge in the
                 setting of a wide-area network is to maximize the
                 expressiveness in the selection mechanism without
                 sacrificing scalability in the delivery mechanism. This
                 paper presents Siena, an event notification service
                 that we have designed and implemented to exhibit both
                 expressiveness and scalability. We describe the
                 service's interface to applications, the algorithms
                 used by networks of servers to select and deliver event
                 notifications, and the strategies used to optimize
                 performance. We also present results of simulation
                 studies that examine the scalability and performance of
                 the service.",

                 will use the global internet, or Internet, technology.
                 This system is a natural application of multicast
                 because there are a large number of receivers that
                 should receive the same information simultaneously. The
                 data requirements for the stock exchange are discussed.
                 The current multi-cast protocols lack the reliability,
                 fairness, and scalability needed in this application.
                 We describe a distributed architecture and a timed
                 reliable multicast protocol, TRMP, that has the
                 appropriate characteristics. We consider three
                 applications: (1) A unified stock ticker of the
                 transactions that are being conducted on the various
                 physical and electronic exchanges. Our objective is to
                 deliver the same combined ticker reliably and
                 simultaneously to all receivers, anywhere in the world.
                 (2) A unified sequence of buy and sell offers that are
                 delivered to a single exchange or a collection of
                 exchanges. Our objectives is to give all traders the
                 same fair access to an exchange independent of their
                 relative distances to the exchange or the delay and
                 loss characteristics of the international network. (3)
                 A distributed, electronic trading floor that can
                 replace the current exchanges. This application has the
                 fairness attributes of the first two applications and
                 uses TRMP to conduct irrefutable, distributed trades.",

                 performance of a network processor can be significantly
                 improved by caching ranges of lookup/classification
                 keys rather than individual keys. While the previous
                 work focused specifically on reducing capacity misses,
                 we address two other important aspects --- (a) reducing
                 conflict misses and (b) cache consistency during
                 frequent route updates. We propose two techniques to
                 minimize conflict misses that aim to balance the number
                 of cacheable entries mapped to each cache set. They
                 offer different tradeoffs between performance and
                 simplicity while improving the average route lookup
                 time by 76\% and 45.2\% respectively. To maintain cache
                 consistency during frequent route updates, we propose a
                 selective cache invalidation technique that can limit
                 the degradation in lookup latency to within 10.2\%. Our
                 results indicate potentially large improvement in
                 lookup performance for network processors used at
                 Internet edge and motivate further research into
                 caching at the Internet core.",

                 support both high packet forwarding performance and
                 versatile and efficient packet processing capabilities.
                 The thesis of this research project is that a cluster
                 of PCs connected by a high-speed system area network
                 provides an effective hardware platform for building
                 routers to be used at the edges of the Internet. This
                 paper describes a scalable and extensible edge router
                 architecture called Panama, which supports a novel
                 aggregate route caching scheme, a real-time link
                 scheduling algorithm whose performance overhead is
                 independent of the number of real-time flows, a highly
                 efficient kernel extension mechanism to safely load
                 networking software extensions dynamically, and an
                 integrated resource scheduler which ensures that
                 real-time flows with additional packet processing
                 requirements still meet their end-to-end performance
                 requirements. This paper describes the implementation
                 and evaluation of the first Panama prototype based on a
                 cluster of PCs and Myrinet.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents a case study of the 10-Gigabit
                 Ethernet (10GbE) adapter from Intel R . Specifically,
                 with appropriate optimizations to the configurations of
                 the 10GbE adapter and TCP, we demonstrate that the
                 10GbE adapter can perform well in local-area,
                 storage-area, system-area, and wide-area networks. For
                 local-area, storage-area, and system-area networks in
                 support of networks of workstations, network-attached
                 storage, and clusters, respectively, we can achieve
                 over 7-Gb/s end-to-end throughput and 12$\mu$s
                 end-to-end latency between applications running on
                 Linux-based PCs. For the wide-area network in support
                 of grids, we broke the recently-set Internet2 Land
                 Speed Record by 2.5 times by sustaining an end-to-end
                 TCP/IP throughput of 2.38 Gb/s between Sunnyvale,
                 California and Geneva, Switzerland (i.e., 10,037
                 kilometers) to move over a terabyte of data in less
                 than an hour. Thus, the above results indicate that
                 10GbE may be a cost-effective solution across a
                 multitude of computing environments.",

  abstract =     "Realistic workloads are essential in evaluating
                 middleware for computational grids. One important
                 component is the raw grid itself: a network topology
                 graph annotated with the hardware and software
                 available on each node and link. This paper defines our
                 requirements for grid generation and presents GridG,
                 our extensible generator. We describe GridG in two
                 steps: topology generation and annotation. For topology
                 generation, we have both model and mechanism. We extend
                 Tiers, an existing tool from the networking community,
                 to produce graphs that obey recently discovered power
                 laws of Internet topology. We also contribute to
                 network topology theory by illustrating a contradiction
                 between two laws and proposing a new version of one of
                 them. For annotation, GridG captures intra- and
                 inter-host correlations between attributes using
                 conditional probability rules. We construct a set of
                 rules, including one based on empirical evidence of OS
                 concentration in subnets, that produce sensible host
                 annotations.",

  abstract =     "Cluster-based servers can substantially increase
                 performance when nodes cooperate to globally manage
                 resources. However, in this paper we show that
                 cooperation results in a substantial availability loss,
                 in the absence of high-availability mechanisms.
                 Specifically, we show that a sophisticated
                 cluster-based Web server, which gains a factor of 3 in
                 performance through cooperation, increases service
                 unavailability by a factor of 10 over a non-cooperative
                 version. We then show how to augment this Web server
                 with software components embodying a small set of
                 high-availability techniques to regain the lost
                 availability. Among other interesting observations, we
                 show that the application of multiple high-availability
                 techniques, each implemented independently in its own
                 subsystem, can lead to inconsistent recovery actions.
                 We also show that a novel technique called Fault Model
                 Enforcement can be used to resolve such
                 inconsistencies. Augmenting the server with these
                 techniques led to a final expected availability of
                 close to 99.99\%.",

                 are equivalent to those existing today for wire-based

                 technology frameworks for designing and maintaining
                 secure, reliable operations. From basic concepts to
                 designing principles to deployment, all critical
                 concepts and phases are explained in detail. The book
                 also includes coverage of wireless security testing
                 techniques and intrusion prevention
                 techniques.\par

  abstract =     "Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors
                 (ASIPs) are becoming increasingly popular in the world
                 of customized, application-driven System-on-Chip (SoC)
                 designs. Efficient ASIP design requires an iterative
                 architecture exploration loop---gradual refinement of
                 the processor architecture starting from an initial
                 template. To accomplish this task, design automation
                 tools are used to detect bottlenecks in embedded
                 applications, to implement application-specific
                 processor instructions, and to automatically generate
                 the required software tools (such as instruction-set
                 simulator, C-compiler, assembler, and profiler), as
                 well as to synthesize the hardware. This paper
                 describes an architecture exploration loop for an ASIP
                 coprocessor that implements common encryption
                 functionality used in symmetric block cipher algorithms
                 for internet protocol security (IPSec). The coprocessor
                 is accessed via shared memory and, as a consequence,
                 our approach is easily adaptable to arbitrary main
                 processor architectures. This paper presents the
                 extended version of our case study that has been
                 already published on the SCOPES conference in 2004. In
                 both papers, a MIPS architecture is used as the main
                 processor and Blowfish as encryption algorithm.",

  abstract =     "Packet classification is crucial for the Internet to
                 provide more value-added services and guaranteed
                 quality of service. Besides hardware-based solutions,
                 many software-based classification algorithms have been
                 proposed. However, classifying at 10 Gbps speed or
                 higher is a challenging problem and it is still one of
                 the performance bottlenecks in core routers. In
                 general, classification algorithms face the same
                 challenge of balancing between high classification
                 speed and low memory requirements. This paper proposes
                 a modified recursive flow classification (RFC)
                 algorithm, Bitmap-RFC, which significantly reduces the
                 memory requirements of RFC by applying a bitmap
                 compression technique. To speed up classifying speed,
                 we exploit the multithreaded architectural features in
                 various algorithm development stages from algorithm
                 design to algorithm implementation. As a result,
                 Bitmap-RFC strikes a good balance between speed and
                 space. It can significantly keep both high
                 classification speed and reduce memory space
                 consumption. This paper investigates the main NPU
                 software design aspects that have dramatic performance
                 impacts on any NPU-based implementations: memory space
                 reduction, instruction selection, data allocation, task
                 partitioning, and latency hiding. We experiment with an
                 architecture-aware design principle to guarantee the
                 high performance of the classification algorithm on an
                 NPU implementation. The experimental results show that
                 the Bitmap-RFC algorithm achieves 10 Gbps speed or
                 higher and has a good scalability on Intel IXP2800
                 NPU.",
