                 amounts of data are being processed, and the effect of
                 new techniques on the printing industry. A selection of
                 current and potential applications is reported under
                 sectional headings to illustrate the range and volume
                 of possible development. The use of data banks to
                 provide a source of copy for the production of varied
                 publications is dealt with, and an estimate of future
                 trends is offered. (Author)",

                 the appearance of text in order to provide a visual
                 distinction between different levels of text content.
                 An experiment is reported in which three cueing
                 conditions were compared. One format used capitals for
                 the cued material, a second used bold setting, and the
                 third was control condition. In an attempt to determine
                 the influence of providing a pre-test on the outcome of
                 cueing experiments, three pre-testing conditions were
                 provided: pre-test of cued information, of noncued
                 information, no pre-test. Subjects read a passage for 3
                 min, and were then given separate tests of cued and
                 noncued information. The results of the test of cued
                 information are interpreted as supporting the
                 hypothesis that cueing yields higher scores if a
                 pre-test of cued information or no pre-test has been
                 administered. It seems that with capital cueing, the
                 benefit on the test of cued information is
                 counter-balanced by a decline in the test of uncued
                 information. As such a trade-off did not occur with the
                 bold cueing, this would seem a preferable format.",

                 across the paper a single column at a time. The line

                 hammers in a vertical (drum) or horizontal (band-train)
                 format. The print mechanism contains one hammer per
                 column of print position. The printable character set
                 is scanned past the hammers at a constant velocity.
                 When a character reaches the column to be printed with
                 that character, the printer control causes the hammer
                 to impact the character at that column. This can only
                 be achieved by the character set speed being controlled

                 be ``blocked out'', justified. The author argues that
                 such a view is the product of closed minds, and shows
                 that there are significant advantages to leaving the
                 right edge ragged. Examples are given of the same
                 paragraph: (1) set in traditional justified
                 (blocked-out) style; (2) set to the same column width,
                 but unjustified and without end-of-line hyphens,
                 resulting in one additional line of type; (3) set in a
                 column one-half -pica wider, set ``tight-ragged'', with
                 hyphenation reduced but not completely eliminated, with
                 word spacing that is even; the number of lines is the
                 same as the original justified version. Examples (1)
                 through (3) are set ``flush left'', as is normally the
                 case. Example (4) is set ``flush right, ragged left'',
                 the reverse of (2); reduced legibility results because
                 a vertical reference line on the left is missing,
                 requiring the eye to search for the beginning of each
                 new line. Example (5) is set ``ragged right and left''
                 (centered); again legibility is reduced because the
                 vertical reference line on the left is missing. The
                 author recommends the setting of Example (3) for
                 legibility and economy in number of lines.",

                 is usually attributed to the distinctive shape of lower

                 capital letters at the start of sentences and for

  abstract =     "For over seventy-five years the University of Chicago
                 Press `Manual of Style' has been the standard reference
                 tool for authors, editors, copywriters, and
                 proofreaders. Updated many times since 1906, it now
                 goes into its thirteenth edition---the first to
                 introduce a change in title. Bowing to what has become
                 nearly universal usage, we now call the `Manual' what
                 everybody else calls it, `The Chicago Manual of
                 Style'---or, for short, `The Chicago Manual'.\par Two
                 pervasive features characterize the present edition: it
                 reflects the impact of the new technology on the entire
                 editing and publishing process, and it spells out, in
                 greater detail and with many more examples, the
                 procedures with which it deals. It is, in short, much
                 more a ``how-to'' book for authors and editors than was
                 its predecessor. In chapter 2, on manuscript
                 preparation and copyediting, for example, new sections
                 have been added on how to mark a manuscript and how to
                 mark type specifications on a script. Chapter 12
                 (``Tables''), completely rewritten, begins with advice
                 on how to make a table from raw data. Chapters 15
                 through 17, on documentation, have been reorganized and
                 greatly expanded, offering many more alternative
                 methods of citation and a wealth of examples. In
                 chapter 18 (``Indexes''), clear step-by-step procedures
                 for the mechanics of index making are set forth. The
                 terminology and methodology of technological advances
                 (in word processing, computerized electronic
                 typesetting, and the like) are reflected most
                 prominently in chapter 20, ``Composition, Printing, and
                 Binding'' (new to this edition), and in the Glossary.
                 Other notable features of the present edition are
                 chapter 4 (``Rights and Permissions''), rewritten in
                 light of the new copyright law, and chapter 9
                 (``Foreign Languages''), which includes a new table of
                 dicritics, a pinyin (Chinese) conversion chart and data
                 on several more languages.\par Throughout, `The Chicago
                 Manual' aims to give clear and straightforward
                 guidelines for preparing and editing copy---with the
                 emphasis on the sensible, the practical, and the
                 economical. As did its predecessors, the thirteenth
                 edition of the `Manual' states the style preferences of
                 the University of Chicago Press and reflects the
                 current practices and requirements of the great
                 majority of American publishers.",

                 serif). In addition, there are three standard pitches
                 and ten resident languages, all of which can be
                 selected from the printer's front panel or under host

                 the HPWord word processing software for HP 3000
                 Computer Systems. HPWord has multilingual capabilities,
                 that is, documents can be produced in different
                 languages. This affects some layout features as well as
                 the hyphenation of words, which is done automatically.
                 The main advantage of the algorithm is its flexibility;
                 the linguistic rules can be changed without changing
                 the program. This makes it possible to use the program
                 for other languages as well. The same program is being
                 implemented in the Danish version of HPWord. It can
                 also be implemented easily in other text processing
                 programs. It is, for instance, easy to convert he the
                 algorithm to other programming languages such as

                 information for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and
                 patients. In 1983, the authors began exploring the
                 feasibility of converting the entire text, which is
                 prepared on an in-house electronic typesetting system,
                 into a computer-readable database. This experiment in
                 simultaneous print and electronic publishing was the
                 result of a desire to make the information more readily
                 available and to respond to inquiries from a variety of
                 vendors and potential users who were interested in an
                 electronic form of the printed text. This project has
                 led to a better understanding of the typesetting system
                 used to prepare the printed text, the successes and
                 problems encountered in automatic conversion of
                 electronic typesetting to a computer database, the
                 variety of potential users for such a database and
                 their individual requirements, and the variety of
                 magnetic tape formats which might be used to distribute
                 such an electronic textbook.",

                 many qualities, among them the intuitive relationship

                 of the curve, and the case of computation and
                 subdivision. Other formulations, however, have become
                 more popular because they offer local control, or
                 because they are interpolating, or even more recently
                 because they provide the added flexibility of shape
                 parameters. We present here techniques to use the
                 B{\'e}zier formulation to interpolate the
                 two-dimensional points given by a user with cubic

                 images in various sizes, proportions, weights, and
                 contrasts of line thickness, etc. using the same data.

                 producing documents in an office environment and have
                 been readily accepted as a replacement for the
                 typewriter. Along with WP has come the opportunity to
                 create typesetting from a WP --- with interfacing being
                 the facilitating link. Book publishers, associations,
                 colleges and universities, corporations, government
                 bodies and financial institutions are all making the
                 move to electronic manuscripts due to the savings in
                 time and costs. Unfortunately, only a small proportion
                 of the output from a WP is printed\slash typeset, most
                 of it is photocopied which further reduces the quality
                 of the finished product. In parallel with the
                 automation of typewriting, printing had become
                 automated; influenced and driven by the changing
                 requirements of the publishing industry. There are now
                 opportunities for bringing together the two
                 technologies (PTS\slash WP) to enhance the capability
                 of the automated office. This paper introduces the
                 concepts of interfacing the two technologies as well as
                 providing a brief overview of phototypesetting plus

                 magnetic and an optical read head and parallel
                 processing to distinguish between magnetic and OCR
                 (optical character recognition) input. The system
                 optically recognizes four different fonts and one font
                 combination, and identifies which font is being read.
                 The present system stores, in parallel, the information
                 obtained from a magnetic read head and an optical read
                 head in separate magnetic and optical processing units.
                 The optical unit processes the video from the optical
                 read head and determines if the input is readable as
                 one of the valid character fonts. The magnetic
                 processing unit simultaneously processes the magnetic
                 read head data and stores the results in a magnetic
                 recognition buffer. If the input is not readable by the
                 optical processor, the information in the magnetic
                 recognition buffer is returned as the output data of

                 recognition system that recognizes a wide range of
                 fonts, including handprinted characters. A structural
                 pattern-matching approach is used. Essentially, a set
                 of loosely constrained rules specify pattern components
                 and their interrelationships. The robustness of the
                 system is derived from the orthogonal set of pattern
                 descriptors, location functions, and the manner in
                 which they are combined to exploit the topological
                 structure of characters. By virtue of the new pattern
                 description language, PDL, the user may easily write
                 rules to define new patterns for the system to
                 recognize. The system also features scale-invariance
                 and user-definable sensitivity to tilt orientation. The
                 system has achieved a 95. 2\% recognition rate.",

                 to a colleague over the telephone. CHEM is implemented
                 as a PIC preprocessor, and runs under the UNIX
                 operating system. Its textural input makes CHEM
                 input-device independent and does not require a
                 graphics terminal. CHEM diagrams can be integrated with
                 text, and can also be used to produce slides and
                 viewgraphs. CHEM is best suited for organic chemists,
                 natural products chemists, and polymer chemists,
                 although it can also be used for inorganic structure
                 diagrams. This manuscript describes the design of CHEM

                 availability of machine-readable files of books

                 provide end users electronic access to the full text of
                 books seem a real possibility. Based on an OCLC study
                 of the use and users of nonfiction books in a public
                 library, this paper identifies design considerations
                 for systems that offer access to full-text nonfiction
                 databases. The study focused on features that public
                 library patrons use in selecting nonfiction books and
                 for finding specific information. The study's results
                 suggest that providing subject access for selecting
                 nonfiction, displaying or highlighting new
                 acquisitions, and facilitating known-item searches will
                 all be important for end users to access the full text
                 of nonfiction books. Since the study found browsing to
                 be the most popular method for selecting a given book
                 and for finding specific information, electronic
                 information systems should allow rapid scanning and

                 a nineteenth-century polymath who initially studied

                 interests in fields as diverse as philosophy, political
                 economy, and mechanical computing. While attempting to
                 realize a machine for calculating and printing
                 error-free mathematical tables, he visited factories to
                 learn metalworking techniques, invented a system of
                 mechanical notation to represent the states of the
                 machine, and devised a method for correct typesetting.
                 As the editor of this series notes, the scope of
                 Babbage's work makes him a difficult subject to
                 understand in our modern age of specialized

                 based on binary images fails when very small characters
                 are analyzed. Size invariance is achieved in two ways.
                 A coarse scaling is determined by the Laplacian
                 pyramid. Taking the appropriate level, the variation of
                 size is within a factor of two. Complete size
                 invariance is achieved by the specific choice of the
                 features themselves, which are weighed distributions of
                 directions and direction changes. These features are
                 also comparatively invariant to different fonts but
                 quite specific to the basic structure of a character.",

                 disadvantages are different, an appropriate synthesis
                 seemed desirable in order to retain the positive as
                 well as to avoid the negative properties. We describe
                 the concept of a `bridge' between these approaches and
                 its realization by a computer program. The results we
                 obtained show that the chosen direction of linkage is
                 very promising. Based upon them, indications for

                 algorithm that is easy to implement and assures the
                 correct filling has been developed for the FGA. The FGA
                 has dedicated hardware that rasterizes a B{\'e}zier
                 curve at an average rate of 200 ns\slash dot by
                 sequentially dividing the curve. It also has a digital
                 differential analyzer for generating lines and arcs.
                 Using these hardwares it can generate Japanese kanji
                 characters at an average rate of 4000 characters/s. The
                 chip was fabricated with 1.2-\$mu@m double-metal-layer
                 CMOS technology, and operation at 20 MHz has been

                 secrets that allow computer users to turn their
                 printers into high-performance typesetting machines.
                 PostScript is device-independent, which means it will
                 work on any host computer, including all PC clones.
                 LaserWriter works beautifully with any of these
                 machines. PostScript even includes a free secret and
                 automatic two-host network that does not require
                 AppleTalk or any fancy cables. Getting PostScript
                 communications up and running the first time can be
                 extremely frustrating. Many communications programs
                 will not change their parameters in real-time. Tricks
                 discussed in this article include pseudocompiling and
                 proc caching. Learning PostScript thoroughly will open
                 your eyes to some amazing possbilities, including
                 book-on-demand publishing with just a simple 300-dpi
                 PostScript printer. By tuning your PostScript
                 techniques, you can turn this machine into a
                 high-performance machine without further investment in

                 photoscript Arabic text is introduced. The
                 distinguishing feature of such text is that it is
                 written cursively. This imposes an additional
                 requirement of isolating each character or set of
                 overlapping characters before recognition. The proposed
                 system is composed of three interleaved phases. The
                 segmentation phase attempts to produce an initial set
                 of characters from the connected text according to a
                 set of predefined rules. The output is then passed to a
                 preliminary classification phase that attempts to label
                 the unknown characters into one of ten possible classes
                 according to a set of rules that acquire their
                 parameter values through learning. The last phase
                 contains a more elaborate set of rules that recognize
                 characters within each class. This recognition phase is
                 designed to allow errors during segmentation and\slash
                 or classification to be rectified through an adaptive
                 recognition technique. The system has been implemented
                 and tested on several fonts with a recognition rate of

                 electrode print head. To print at 40 dots\slash mm

                 Model H-H2 by Hogg and Hubermann have been successfully
                 applied to recognize 26 English capital letters, each
                 with six font representations. These two models are
                 very similar, but Model H-H2 has the capability for
                 modification of the basins of attraction during the
                 training phase, whereas Model H-H1 does not. This
                 appears to be a desirable feature for a neural network.
                 It is shown in this work that this is indeed true. In
                 either model, it is difficult to find a single set of
                 parameters for one network or memory that can
                 distinguish all of the characters. Therefore, a cascade
                 of memories is utilized. Thus, in the training phase, a
                 decision tree is built by cascading the memory matrices
                 that represent the models. That is successive layers of
                 refinement in selection of basins of attraction are
                 used to generate output patterns unique to each input
                 pattern. In the recognition phase, the subject
                 characters are recognized by searching in the tree.
                 Model parameters such as memory array size, S${}_{min}$
                 S${}_{max}$, and M${}_{min}$ M${}_{max}$ were varied to
                 elucidate the models' behavior. It is shown that there
                 exist parameter values for both models to achieve a
                 100\% recognition rate when all six fonts are used both
                 as the training and the recognition set. Model H-H2
                 significantly outperformed Model H-H1 in terms of
                 recognition rate, use of memory space, and learning
                 speed when all six fonts were used as the training
                 set.",

                 range of 1:0.7 to 1:0.9. The empirical literature,
                 however, fails to provide unequivocal support for that
                 requirement. In designing CRT displays there is a
                 complex interaction among several parameters, including
                 character aspect ratio and character height. The
                 present study compared a font with a character aspect
                 ratio within the range allowed by ANSI\slash HFS
                 100-1988 to a font with a character aspect ratio

                 designed to enable new users of desktop publishing
                 technologies to produce typeset documents which
                 approach or match commercial quality standards.
                 ``Typesetting--A Tutorial for the Desktop Publisher''
                 is a computer assisted instructional (CAI) program that
                 provides students with an understanding of the
                 traditional language of type while developing
                 familiarity with the rules of page layout and design.
                 The design and development of the programmed tutorial
                 is grounded on three assumptions: (1) the main focus of
                 the CAI course must be on enabling operators with
                 non-specialized skills to learn the fundamentals of
                 typesetting; (2) new desktop publishing personnel
                 productivity can be dramatically increased, and
                 learning curves reduced, by a computerized course in
                 which learners control their own pace while learning
                 the elements, principles, and language of typesetting;
                 and (3) operators must know when, how, and why to
                 utilize the tools that are available to them, thus the
                 concepts surrounding document production must be
                 familiar to them. Results of administration of the CAI
                 course indicated a high level of student interest in
                 CAI as a medium of instruction. The flexibility of the
                 user interface provided an impetus for student
                 exploration. Excitement with the tools for learning and
                 the stimulation to interact and play with the media
                 were key factors in the general success of the learning
                 event. The ability of individual students to guide
                 themselves and manipulate their private learning
                 environments were challenges to which participants
                 responded strongly. (14 references) (DB)",

                 into the realm of the requirements of high-performance
                 scanners. The sub-arc-second accuracy of the rotational
                 axis of scanners is generally accomplished by using
                 custom-designed gas bearings instead of the
                 less-expensive ball bearings. Subject to design, ball
                 bearings are typically rated to achieve accuracies
                 ranging from 20 to 5 arc sec. The less-expensive and
                 replaceable commercially available ball bearings can
                 effectively satisfy this industry's requirement if a
                 passive optical-feedback design feature is included in
                 a scanner's beam-deflecting head. This feedback, which
                 is embodied in a given scanner desensitizes the

                 that are better than those of standard desktop
                 packages. There are a few things {\TeX} can do that
                 couldn't be practically done with desktop software.
                 There is a new {\TeX} implementation, {\TeX}tures,
                 which moves {\TeX} a little closer to the desktop
                 mainstream. It holds out the hope that {\TeX} may yet
                 have the potential to become as easy to use as other
                 desktop packages. The author discusses the innovations
                 built in to {\TeX}, its strengths and weaknesses, and
                 its uses. (0 Refs.)",

                 present research was to examine certain variables that
                 are associated with legibility, namely font type, font
                 weight, point size, and point size contrast between the
                 signal word and the main body of the warning. A sample
                 of undergraduate students and elderly people rated 24
                 Ultra Tide detergent labels for their likelihood to
                 read the warning, the saliency of the warning, and
                 readability of the warning. The results indicated that
                 participants were more likely to read the warning in
                 Helvetica type than in Times or Goudy. Times was more
                 likely to be read than Goudy. Bold type was more likely
                 to be read than Roman type. There was a greater
                 likelihood of reading the warning when the main body
                 was in 10 point size as compared to 8 point size. A 2
                 point size difference between the signal word and the
                 main body of the warning produced a greater likelihood
                 of reading the warning over a 4 point size difference.
                 One possibility for this result is that the 4 point
                 difference minimizes the importance of the main body of
                 the warning, therefore making only the signal word

                 be `paint a portrait of George Bush in the style of
                 Vincent van Gogh.' In these tasks, a low dimensional
                 representation ('George Bush' and `style of van Gogh')
                 is expanded into a (nonunique) output of extremely high
                 dimension, for instance represented by color, line,
                 shading, etc. We designed a connectionist network for
                 generalization of production in such a way --- to
                 generate letterforms in a new font given just a few
                 exemplars from that font. During learning, our network
                 constructs distributed internal representations of
                 different fonts and letters, even though each training
                 instance had both font characteristics and letter
                 characteristics. Separate hidden representations for
                 `letter' and `font' were necessary for success of the
                 network. The integration of information from font and
                 letter representations had to be at a proper,
                 intermediate level of abstraction. The limitations of
                 the network can be attributed, in part, to limited
                 training corpus, and lack of translation and scale

                 keywords in a scanned image. Word bounding boxes of
                 potential keywords are extracted from the image using a
                 morphology-based preprocessor. Feature vectors based on
                 the external shape and internal structure of the word
                 are computed over vertical columns of pixels in a word
                 bounding box. For each user-specified keyword, an HMM
                 is created by concatenating appropriate
                 context-dependent character HMMs. Non-keywords are
                 modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent
                 sub-character models. Keyword spotting is performed
                 using a Viterbi search through the HMM network created
                 by connecting the keyword and non-keyword HMMs in
                 parallel. Applications of word-image spotting include

                 character shapes given as outlines. The obvious
                 scan-conversion process does not produce acceptable
                 results unless important features such as stem widths
                 are carefully controlled during the scan-conversion
                 process. This paper describes a method for
                 automatically extracting the necessary feature
                 information and generating high-quality bitmaps without
                 resorting to hand editing. Almost all of the work is
                 done in a preprocessing step, the result of which is an
                 intermediate form that can be quickly converted into
                 bitmaps once the font size and device resolution are
                 known. A heuristically defined system of linear
                 equations describes how the ideal outlines should be
                 distorted in order to produce the best possible results
                 when scan converted in a straightforward manner. The
                 Lovasz basis reduction algorithm then reduces the
                 system of equations to a form that makes it easy to
                 find an approximate solution subject to the constraint
                 that some variables must be integers. The heuristic

  abstract =     "Character placement in digital typography is commonly
                 defined in terms of a set of parameters (font metrics)
                 that specify the relative locations of the local
                 coordinate systems of adjacent characters in a line of
                 text. The primary font metrics for horizontal letter
                 spacing are the character set widths and sidebearings
                 and the character pair spacing adjustments (kerning
                 terms). A typical parameter for vertical alignment is
                 the character depth below baseline. This paper
                 discusses the problem of determining font metrics from
                 measurements on images of typeset text and develops
                 least-squares procedures for font metric estimation.
                 When it is known that kerning is not present,
                 sidebearing estimation involves solving a set of linear
                 equations, called the sidebearing normal equations,
                 More generally, simultaneous sidebearing and kerning
                 term estimation involves an iterative procedure in
                 which a modified set of sidebearing normal equations is
                 solved during each iteration. Character depth estimates
                 are obtained by solving a set of baseline normal
                 equations. In a preliminary evaluation of the proposed
                 procedures on scanned text images in three fonts the
                 root-mean-square set width estimation error was about
                 0.2 pixel. A novel application of font metric
                 estimation to text image editing is discussed.",

                 sheet transformation and its use as a tool in an
                 interactive font design environment. The designer works
                 with graph-paper-like orthogonal grids and applies the
                 rubber sheet transformation to the gridspace to obtain
                 new shapes. Further, he or she may subsequently work on
                 the transformed gridspace to fine-tune the shapes. A
                 computationally efficient deformation mapping technique
                 for use in such an interactive design environment has
                 been presented. An important feature is that the order
                 of the high-level outline definitions of the deformed
                 shape is the same as that of the original design.The
                 shape deformation takes place in three stages. In the
                 first stage, the original 2D shape is mapped onto a
                 user definable doubly-curved surface. Next the surface
                 is affinely transformed, once again under the control
                 of the user. In the last stage the transformed 3D shape
                 is projected onto a plane to get the deformed shape. We
                 discuss this deformation technique, and a refinement of
                 this technique, where the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are
                 handled independently. This technique has been

                 enabling the transfer of existing fonts from paper to
                 machine. Within this environment a comprehensive set of
                 interactive tools are available to the type font
                 designer for typeface design. Vinyas is based on a
                 powerful font design methodology, viz, the pen stroke
                 method of specifying shapes. With minimal interaction,
                 the designer can describe his forms, edit them,
                 visualize them singly or in combination, and then
                 create a full dictionary of letterforms for use. Unlike

                 technical problems not encountered in other languages
                 such as cursiveness, overriding and overlapping of
                 characters, multiple shapes per character and the
                 presence of vowels above and below the characters. The
                 proposed approach relies on the fact that the process
                 of connecting Arabic characters to produce cursive
                 writing tends to form a fictitious baseline. During
                 preprocessing, contour analysis provides both component
                 isolation and baseline location. In the feature
                 extraction phase, the words are processed from right to
                 left to generate a sequence of labels. Each label is
                 one of a predetermined codebook that represents all
                 possible bit distribution with respect to the baseline.
                 At a certain position, which depends on the label
                 context, a segmentation decision is taken. During
                 training, a model is generated for each character. This
                 model describes the probability of the occurrence of
                 the labels at each vertical position. During
                 recognition, the probability of the label observation
                 sequence is computed and accumulated. The system has
                 been tested on different typewritten, typeset fonts and

                 of local typeface homogeneity to improve the accuracy
                 of a character classifier. Given a polyfont classifier
                 which is capable of recognizing any of 100 typefaces
                 moderately well, our method allows it to specialize
                 itself automatically to the single --- but otherwise
                 unknown --- typeface it is reading. Essentially, the
                 classifier retrains itself after examining some of the
                 images, guided at first by the preset classification
                 boundaries of the given classifier, and later by the
                 behavior of the retrained classifier. Experimental
                 trials on 6.4 M pseudo-randomly distorted images show
                 that the method improves on 95 of the 100 typefaces. It
                 reduces the error rate by a factor of 2.5, averaged
                 over 100 typefaces, when applied to an alphabet of 80
                 ASCII characters printed at ten point and digitized at
                 300 pixels\slash inch. This self-correcting method

                 research on jobbing printing in Iceland and Sweden, the

                 subjected to deskilling, and he stresses that the

                 realised. He concludes that gender, firm size, and

                 to explain the diversity in the typesetting process. It
                 is of theoretical interest to study whether similar
                 processes are present in Iceland and Sweden as well.
                 The article focuses on the development of typesetting
                 in jobbing printing in Iceland and Sweden. Particular
                 attention will be given to the transition to
                 filmsetting and its impact on employment, work

                 be given to the development of other printing processes

                 digital images of machine-printed text into their ASCII
                 equivalent is information about fonts. This paper
                 presents an algorithm for identifying the font in which
                 a document is printed. The algorithm matches word-level
                 information gathered from the document image to fonts
                 in an image database. This method is more robust in the
                 presence of noise than font recognition algorithms that
                 use character-level information. Clusters of frequent
                 function words (such as the, of, and, a, and to) are
                 constructed from an input document image. The clusters
                 are then matched to a database of function words
                 derived from document images, and the document that
                 matches best provides the identification of the input
                 font. This technique utilizes the context from many
                 words in an input document to overcome noise.
                 Experimental results are presented that show
                 near-perfect recognition of fonts, even in noisy

                 partition the bounding frame of the character bitmap
                 into a fixed number of rectangles, to define some
                 properties of those rectangles, and to establish
                 connectivity relations between the rectangles. Hamming
                 distance and vector optimization are used for
                 classification. Good results in recognition of high
                 quality data (400 dpi) in three fonts (Courier,
                 Helvetica, and New Times Roman) and eight sizes (from 8
                 to 24 points) were reported in a previous paper. These
                 findings are confirmed in this paper by an experiment
                 showing that, for the same number of bits, BCA features
                 increase the rate of recognition twice with respect to
                 features obtained by simple decimation. However, the
                 actual method is limited by the fact that the number of
                 referent templates increases with the number of fonts
                 to be recognized. The purpose of this paper is to
                 remove this limitation. The main part of the paper
                 discusses the properties of the Hamming distance and
                 how they can be used in the BCA algorithm to improve
                 the efficiency of classification. The last section

  abstract =     "This paper reports the performance of several neural
                 network models on the problem of multi-font character
                 recognition. The networks are trained on machine
                 generated, upper-case English letters in selected
                 fonts. The task is to recognize the same letters in
                 different fonts. The results presented here were
                 produced by back-propagation networks, radial basis
                 networks and a new hybrid algorithm which is a
                 combination of the two. These results are compared to
                 those of the Hogg-Hubermann model as well as to those
                 of nearest neighbor and maximum likelihood classifiers.
                 The effects of varying the number of nodes in the
                 hidden layer, the initial conditions, and the number of
                 iterations in a back-propagation network were studied.
                 The experimental results indicate that the number of
                 nodes is an important factor in the recognition rate
                 and that over-training is a significant problem.
                 Different initial conditions also had a measurable
                 effect on performance. The radial basis experiments
                 used different numbers of centers and differing
                 techniques for selecting the means and standard
                 deviations. The best results were obtained with one
                 center per training vector in which the standard
                 deviation for each center was set to the same small
                 number. Finally, a new hybrid technique is discussed in
                 which a radial basis network is used to determine a
                 starting point for a back-propagation network. The
                 back-propagation network refines the radial basis means
                 and standard deviations which are replaced in the
                 radial basis network and used for another iteration.
                 All three networks out-performed the Hogg-Hubermann
                 network as well as the maximum likelihood
                 classifiers.",

                 is a major hindrance to widespread use of document
                 image processing (DIP) systems. Although current DIP
                 systems store document images in a compressed form,
                 there is much room for improvement. In this paper, a
                 nearly-lossless document image compression method is
                 investigated which preserves the relevant information
                 of a document. The proposed approach is based on the
                 segmentation of a document image into different blocks
                 that are classified into one of several block classes
                 and compressed by a block-class-specific data
                 compression method. Whereas image and graphics blocks
                 are compressed using standard image compression
                 methods, text blocks are fed into a text and font
                 recognition module and converted into their textual
                 representation. Finally, text blocks are compressed by
                 encoding their textual representation and enough
                 formatting information to be able to render them as
                 faithfully as possible to the original document.
                 Preliminary results show that (1) the achievable
                 compression ratios compare favorably with standard
                 document image compression methods for all document
                 images tested and (2) the quality of the decompressed

                 editing, fast retrieval, and other file manipulations
                 through the use of a computer. The recognition stage of
                 an OCR process is made difficult by added noise, image
                 distortion, and the various character typefaces, sizes,
                 and fonts that a document may have. In this study a
                 neural network approach is introduced to perform high
                 accuracy recognition on multi-size and multi-font
                 characters; a novel centroid-dithering training process
                 with a low noise-sensitivity normalization procedure is
                 used to achieve high accuracy results. The study
                 consists of two parts. The first part focuses on single
                 size and single font characters, and a two-layered
                 neural network is trained to recognize the full set of
                 94 ASCII character images in 12-pt Courier font. The
                 second part trades accuracy for additional font and
                 size capability, and a larger two-layered neural
                 network is trained to recognize the full set of 94
                 ASCII character images for all point sizes from 8 to 32
                 and for 12 commonly used fonts. The performance of

  abstract =     "Oriental characters (such as Chinese, Korean, and
                 Japanese characters) are composed of several strokes,
                 and the shape of each stroke is determined by a brush
                 sweep. In the paper, a new representation scheme is
                 proposed for the design of stroke-structured fonts.
                 This approach (called a structured composition of
                 stroke elements) reflects the characteristics of
                 oriental characters; each character is constructed as a
                 set of strokes, and each stroke is represented by
                 primitive features called stroke elements. Since the
                 construction of an exact brush sweep is computationally
                 quite expensive, we suggest a simple approximation
                 method. The outlines of stroke pens are used to
                 represent the starting, ending, and bending of a
                 stroke. The positions of seed pens are interpolated to
                 generate the skeleton curve of a stroke trajectory. The
                 outline of each stroke is generated automatically from
                 the stroke elements. The boundary of each character is
                 constructed by merging these stroke outlines. This
                 approach has various advantages: the font design
                 becomes much simpler, the necessary storage space is
                 greatly reduced, and the font variation becomes much
                 more flexible.",

                 component in the performance analysis of pattern
                 matching systems. In the past three years, the results
                 of numerous excellent and rigorous studies of OCR
                 system typeset-character accuracy (henceforth OCR
                 accuracy) have been published, encouraging performance
                 comparisons between a variety of OCR products and
                 technologies. These published figures are important;
                 OCR vendor advertisements in the popular trade
                 magazines lead readers to believe that published OCR
                 accuracy figures effect market share in the lucrative
                 OCR market. Curiously, a detailed review of many of
                 these OCR error occurrence counting results reveals
                 that they are not reproducible as published and they
                 are not strictly comparable due to larger variances in
                 the counts than would be expected by the sampling
                 variance. Naturally, since OCR accuracy is based on a
                 ratio of the number of OCR errors over the size of the
                 text searched for errors, imprecise OCR error
                 accounting leads to similar imprecision in OCR
                 accuracy. Some published papers use informal,
                 non-automatic, or intuitively correct OCR error
                 accounting. Still other published results present OCR
                 error accounting methods based on string matching
                 algorithms such as dynamic programming using
                 Levenshtein (edit) distance but omit critical
                 implementation details (such as the existence of
                 suspect markers in the OCR generated output or the
                 weights used in the dynamic programming minimization
                 procedure). The problem with not specifically revealing
                 the accounting method is that the number of errors
                 found by different methods are significantly different.
                 This paper identifies the basic accounting methods used
                 to measure OCR errors in typeset text and offers an
                 evaluation and comparison of the various accounting

                 demand for developing an automatic Chinese font design
                 system. Then, we show that the structure of a Chinese
                 character can be represented by a structured character
                 description. The scheme for designing a character is
                 presented in details. Our discussion includes stroke
                 definition, building up components, and balancing the
                 appearance of a character. A number of factors are
                 considered in designing and harmonizing a character
                 which includes component spacing, complexity,
                 blackness, visual centre, centre of gravity, and
                 attractive force. A prototype font design system is
                 being built according to this component-based approach.
                 Samples are given to show how a Chinese character can
                 be constructed using the system. Finally, future
                 research direction is recommended for further

                 This knowledge comes in the form of mechanically
                 typeset books and journals going back more than 100
                 years. Besides these older sources, there are a great

                 of mathematical content (or any other useful

                 matches with formulas in a table of integrals. This

  abstract =     "Printed mathematics has a number of features which
                 distinguish it from conventional text. These include
                 structure in two dimensions (fractions, exponents,
                 limits), frequent font changes, symbols with variable
                 shape (quotient bars), and substantially differing
                 notational conventions from source to source. When
                 compounded with more generic problems such as noise and
                 merged or broken characters, printed mathematics offers
                 a challenging arena for recognition. Our project was
                 initially driven by the goal of scanning and parsing
                 some 5,000 pages of elaborate mathematics (tables of
                 definite integrals). While our prototype system
                 demonstrates success on translating noise-free typeset
                 equations into Lisp expressions appropriate for further
                 processing, a more semantic top-down approach appears
                 necessary for higher levels of performance. Such an
                 approach may benefit the incorporation of these
                 programs into a more general document processing
                 viewpoint. We intend to release to the public our
                 somewhat refined prototypes as utility programs in the
                 hope that they will be of general use in the
                 construction of custom OCR packages. These utilities
                 are quite fast even as originally prototyped in Lisp,
                 where they may be of particular interest to those
                 working on `intelligent' optical processing. Some
                 routines have been re-written in C++ as well.
                 Additional programs providing formula recognition and
                 parsing also form a part of this system. It is
                 important however to realize that distinct conflicting
                 grammars are needed to cover variations in contemporary
                 and historical typesetting, and thus a single simple
                 solution is not possible.",

                 project is a library of primary journal articles in
                 chemistry. Any library has an inside and an outside; in
                 this article we describe the inside of the library and
                 the methods for building the system and accumulating
                 the database. A later article will describe the outside
                 (user experiences). Among electronic-library projects,
                 the CORE project is unusual in that it has both ASCII
                 derived from typesetting and image data for all its
                 pages, and among experimental electronic-library
                 projects, it is unusually large. We describe here (a)
                 the processes of scanning and analyzing about 400,000
                 pages of primary journal material, (b) the conversion
                 of a similar amount of textual database material, (c)
                 the linking of these two data sources, and (d) the
