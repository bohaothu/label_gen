  abstract = {Interaction with mobile devices that are intended for everyday use
	is challenging since such systems are continuously optimized towards
	small outlines. Watches are a particularly critical as display size,
	processing capabilities, and weight are tightly constraint. This
	work presents a watch device with an integrated gesture recognition
	interface. We report the resource-optimized implementation of our
	algorithmic solution on the watch and demonstrate that the recognition
	approach is feasible for such constraint devoices. The system is
	wearable during everyday activities and was evaluated with eight
	users to complete questionnaires through intuitive one-hand movements.
	We developed a procedure to spot and classify input gestures from
	continuous acceleration data acquired by the watch. The recognition
	procedure is based on hidden Markov models~(HMM) and was fully implemented
	on a watch. The algorithm achieved an average recall of 79\% at 93\%
	precision in recognizing the relevant gestures. The watch implementation
	of continuous gesture spotting showed a delay below 3\,ms for feature
	computation, Viterbi path processing, and final classification at
	less than 4\,KB memory usage.},
