abstract={Although the ethics of social science research has not enjoyed as much scholarly attention as the ethics of biomedical research, social scientists continue to debate the relevance of research ethics and ethics review to social science research. Like social scientists, biomedical scientists have also objected to ethical review of biomedical research, and much has been gained from the ensuing debates. This paper reviews much of this recent debate, and proposes the application of a framework developed by Emanuel, E., Wendler, D., Killen, J., & Grady, C. (2004). What makes clinical research in developing countries ethical? The benchmarks of ethical research. Journal of Infectious Diseases, 189, 930-937 to social science research as a response to that debate. We argue, however, that social scientists are generally inadequately trained in research ethics and may still espouse a dangerous view, common amongst behavioural scientists in the 1950s, that ethical concerns reflect a kind of methodological or scientific naivet√©. We provide grounds for arguing, further, that social science research, with a few clear exceptions, should be rigorously ethically reviewed, and that research ethics committees have an obligation to be competent in the appropriate review of social science research, including qualitative research.}
