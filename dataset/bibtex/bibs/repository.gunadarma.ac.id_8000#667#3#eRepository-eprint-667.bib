        abstract = {Resource allocation is a core and important function of every workflow management system. Resource allocation consists of two
main parts namely; matchmaking and brokering that in normal cases are combined as a single functional unit. However in an
integrated mobile environment, where the resources such as mobile workforces are combinations of human workers and mobile
devices, matchmaking and brokering can no longer be coupled. In such environments, the accuracy of resource allocation is
expected to become quite low due to frequent disconnection, mobility of resources and human factors. In addition, resource
allocation must be fair towards human resources. An accurate and fair resource allocation in mobile environments, on the other
hand can not be attained without using an independent brokerage system. To guaranty the accuracy and fairness, the desired mobile
workforce brokerage system (MWBS) must act based on real-time environmental information as well as the history of the system
when an allocation is required. In this paper an architectural model for a fair and accurate multi-agent MWBS is proposed based on
CBR-BDI agent architecture and Active Shared-Data Space coordination mode}
