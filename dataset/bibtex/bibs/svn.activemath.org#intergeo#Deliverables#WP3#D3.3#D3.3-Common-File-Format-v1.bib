	Abstract = {This specification defines the Mathematical Markup
		 Language, or MathML. MathML is an XML application for
		 describing mathematical notation and capturing both its
		 structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
		 mathematics to be served, received, and processed on
		 the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this
		 functionality for text. This specification of the
		 markup language MathML is intended primarily for a
		 readership consisting of those who will be developing
		 or implementing renderers or editors using it, or
		 software that will communicate using MathML as a
		 protocol for input or output. It is not a User's Guide
		 but rather a reference document. MathML can be used to
		 encode both mathematical notation and mathematical
		 content. About thirty-five of the MathML tags describe
		 abstract notational structures, while another about one
		 hundred and seventy provide a way of unambiguously
		 specifying the intended meaning of an expression.
		 Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and
		 presentation elements interact, and how MathML
		 renderers might be implemented and should interact with
		 browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of
		 special characters used for mathematics, their handling
		 in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their
		 relation to fonts. While MathML is human-readable, in
		 all but the simplest cases, authors use equation
		 editors, conversion programs, and other specialized
		 software tools to generate MathML. Several versions of
		 such MathML tools exist, and more, both freely
		 available software and commercial products, are under
		 development.}}
