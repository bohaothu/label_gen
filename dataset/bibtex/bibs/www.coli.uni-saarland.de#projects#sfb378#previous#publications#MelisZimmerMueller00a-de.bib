 abstract={The integration of constraint solvers into proof planning has pushed
 the problem solving horizon. Proof planning benefits from the
 general functionalities of a constraint solver such as consistency
 checks, constraint inference, as well as the search for
 instantiations. However, off-the-shelf constraint solvers need to
 be extended in order to be be integrated appropriately: In
 particular, for correctness, the context of constraints and
 Eigenvariable-conditions have to be taken into account. Moreover,
 symbolic and numeric constraint inference are combined. This
 paper discusses the extensions to constraint solving for proof
 planning, namely the combination of symbolic and numeric inference,
 first-class constraints, and context trees. We also describe the
 implementation of these extensions in the constraint solver $\mathcal{coSIE}$.},
