  abstract	= {This document contains lecture notes of an introductory
		  course on Kolmogorov complexity. They cover basic notions
		  of algorithmic information theory: Kolmogorov complexity
		  (plain, conditional, prefix), notion of randomness
		  (Martin-Lof randomness, Mises-Church randomness),
		  Solomonoff universal a priori probability and their
		  properties (symmetry of information, connection between a
		  priori probability and prefix complexity, criterion of
		  randomness in terms of complexity) and applications
		  (incompressibility method in computational complexity
		  theory, incompleteness theorems). }
