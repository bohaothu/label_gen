		 The SELinux example policy is intended as an example
		 from which administrators customize to create a policy
		 for their site's security goals, but the complexity of
		 the model and size of the policy make this quite
		 complex. Our aim is to provide an access control model
		 to express site security goals and resolve them against
		 the SELinux policy. Ultimately, we aim to define a
		 minimal trusted computing base (TCB) that satisfies
		 Clark-Wilson integrity, by first testing for the more
		 restrictive Biba integrity policy and resolving
		 conflicts using Clark-Wilson semantics. Our policy
		 analysis tool, Gokyo, implements the following
		 approach: (1) it represents the SELinux example policy
		 and our integrity goals; (2) it identifies conflicts
		 between them; (3) it estimates the resolutions to these
		 conflicts; and (4) provides information for deciding
		 upon a resolution. Using Gokyo, we derive a proposal
		 for a minimal TCB for SELinux includes 30 subject
		 types, and we identify the work remaining to ensure
		 that TCB is integrity-protected. Our analysis is
		 performed on the SELinux example policy for Linux
