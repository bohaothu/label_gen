                          abstract = {A general technique combining model checking and abstraction is presented that allows property based analysis of systems consisting of an arbitrary number of featured components. We show how parameterised systems can be specified in a guarded command form with constraints placed on the variables which occur in guards. We prove that results that hold for a small number of components can be shown to scale up. We then show how featured systems can be specified in a similar way, by relaxing the constraints on the guards. The main result is a generalisation theorem for featured systems which we apply to two well known examples.},keywords = {Model checking, abstraction, verification, induction, parameterised systems,  features},note = {To appear},Publisher =
