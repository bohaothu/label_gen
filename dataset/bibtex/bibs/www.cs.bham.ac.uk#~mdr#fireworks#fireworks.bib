  abstract =     "In this paper, we focus on a refinement method for an
                 object oriented algebraic formalism, called
                 ETOILE-specifications. \'Etoile-specifications extend
                 algebraic specification techniques to deal with
                 concurrent (active) object systems. The dynamic
                 behavior of object systems rely on implicit states used
                 as modifiers of semantics of functionalities (or {\em
                 methods}). Although most people affirm that objects
                 preserve the ``good properties'' of modularity, we show
                 that the global correctness of a system cannot be
                 established from the local correctness of each object.
                 This is due to the concurrency between objects. To
                 circumvent this non modular behavior of objects, we
                 propose a refinement theory (abstract implementation)
                 which allows to retrieve incrementality to establish
                 correctness. We prove that usual results concerning
                 reuse of implementations are extended to
                 ETOILE-specifications.",

  abstract =     "In dynamic testing, a program is flagged incorrect if
                 it fails for a test set. But how far can a successful
                 program be considered as correct? We give a definition
                 of program correctness with respect to a specification
                 which is adequate to dynamic testing. Similarly to the
                 field of abstract implementation, in order to declare a
                 program as correct, it suffices that its behavior
                 fulfills the specification requirements. An
                 intermediate semantic level between the program and the
                 specification, the oracle framework, is introduced in
                 order to interpret observable results of dynamic
                 experiments on the program. This allows to give
                 algebraic semantics to the program. Program correctness
                 is then defined by some adequacy criterion between the
                 specification semantics and the program semantics. For
                 some specifications, there exist exhaustive test sets
                 (the success of which means program correctness), for
                 some other specifications, there only exist
                 ``complete'' (but not exhaustive) test sets.",

                 justifying the correctness of specifications and
                 proofs. Albert II is a formal specification language
                 for capturing functional requirements inherent to
                 real-time, distributed systems. Targeted to
                 requirements engineering activities, Albert II exhibits
                 a high expressiveness through a large range of
                 constructs. Their interactions being however very
                 intricate, these constructs may hamper the reasoning
                 capabilities. Formal reasoning is nevertheless still
                 possible because the language is grounded on a
                 real-time core logic. We motivate our approach to the
                 construction of a formal verification system for this

                 mathematical rigour Albert has been endowed with a
                 formal semantics. Compositionality is one of our
                 primary target. The models of the atomic components are
                 first individually built and then composed to yield the
                 semantic model of the full specification. We define an
                 intermediate language, Albert-kernel, retaining all the
                 important concepts of Albert. With this language the
                 main concepts of Albert (agent decomposition, action,
                 information and perception) have a direct
                 correspondence. We provide formal semantics for
                 Albert-kernel. An axiomatisation of the semantics in
                 terms of set theory and timed state sequence structures
                 could be used as a basis for semantic reasoning tools
                 since they usually use a less expressive logic into

                 offers features that are easy to implement but awkward

                 according to our method guarantees a certain level of
                 confidence into the correctness of the system under
                 test, as a function of two parameters. One is an
                 estimate of the reliability, and the other is an
                 estimate of the risk that the vendor takes when (s)he
                 notifies this reliability percentage to the client.
                 These results are based on the theory of ``formula
                 testing'' developed in the article. We also present a
                 first prototype of a tool which assists test case
                 generation according to this theory. Lastly, we
                 illustrate our method on a small formal
                 specification.",

  abstract =     "Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) is a
                 formal language for performance modelling based on
                 process algebra. It has previously been shown that
                 using the process algebra apparatus compact performance
                 models can be derived which retain the essential
                 behavioural characteristics of the modelled system.
                 However no efficient algorithm for this derivation was
                 given. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm
                 which recognises and takes advantage of symmetries
                 within the model and avoids unnecessary computation.
                 The algorithm is illustrated by a multiprocessor
                 example. Although it is much more efficient than the
                 previously proposed techniques the algorithm is subject
                 to some limitations. In particular it will not always
                 achieve the best possible aggregation. This case is
                 also illustrated by an example, and we discuss when
                 this limitation is likely to have an impact on
                 performance analysis.",

                 defines a class of {\em timed\/} $\omega$-languages,
                 whose letters have real-numbered time stamps. Two
                 popular ways of specifying timing constraints rely on
                 the use of clocks, and on the use of time bounds for
                 temporal operators. However, temporal logics with
                 clocks or time bounds have undecidable satisfiability
                 problems, and finite automata with clocks (so-called
                 {\em timed automata\/}) are not closed under
                 complement. Therefore, two fully decidable restrictions
                 of these formalisms have been proposed. In the first
                 case, clocks are restricted to {\em event clocks},
                 which measure distances to immediately preceding or
                 succeeding events only. In the second case, time bounds
                 are restricted to {\em nonsingular intervals}, which
                 cannot specify the exact punctuality of events. We show
                 that the resulting classes of timed $\omega$-languages
                 are robust, and we explain their relationship.",

  abstract =     "Due to practical limitations in software and hardware,
                 data type implementations are always bounded. Such
                 limitations are a frequent source of faults which are
                 difficult to find out. As soon as boundaries are
                 clearly identified in a specification, functional
                 testing should be able to address any boundary fault.
                 We propose to enrich a data type specification
                 formalism, namely algebraic specifications, allowing a
                 natural description of data type boundaries. This
                 enhancement allows us to adapt the existing testing
                 theory, the method and the tool, initially dedicated to
                 functional testing from unbounded data type
                 specifications. Several examples of test data selection
                 with the LOFT tool, from two bounded data type
                 specifications will illustrate the benefit of our
                 approach: an assisted test selection process, formally
                 defined in a functional testing theory, allowing
                 adequate coverage of both data types bounds and the
                 definition domains of the specified operations.",

  abstract =     "\emph{Feature-oriented specification} addresses the
                 problem of how to add new functionality to a system in
                 a systematic way. A \emph{feature} is a unit of
                 functionality that can be added to an existing system.
                 Sometimes however, combinations of features produce
                 unexpected results. This phenomenon has become known as
                 \emph{feature interaction}. Features and feature
                 interactions can be found in any system that is
                 enhanced with new or optional functionality.
                 Feature-oriented specification addresses three central
                 questions: \begin{itemize} \item how to specify
                 features for a system, \item how to add features to the
                 system, and \item how to detect interactions among
                 features. \end{itemize} The method proposed here is to
                 extend specification languages with constructs for
                 defining features, so-called \emph{feature constructs}.
                 Each feature construct is complemented by a notion of
                 \emph{feature integration}: a method for adding a
                 feature definition to the specification of a system.
                 Feature integration gives semantics to a feature
                 construct. This thesis details feature constructs for
                 three specification languages, \SMV, \Promela and \CSP,
                 and demonstrates their use in examples and case
                 studies. For \SMV and \CSP, formal semantics of the
                 feature constructs are developed, too. All three
                 languages investigated are model checking languages,
                 and we investigate the use of model checking to detect
                 feature interactions.",

  abstract =     "A feature is an increment of functionality that can be
                 added to an existing system. Many features override the
                 default behaviour of the system, and can lead to
                 unexpected situations. Adding several features to a
                 system is very likely to introduce inconsistencies
                 among their functionality, even if each feature works
                 correctly in isolation. To facilitate the development
                 of features and the detection of inconsistencies
                 between features, using model checking, we extend
                 Promela with a \emph{Feature Construct}. This construct
                 allows us to define changes to a given Promela program
                 in a clearly structured and intuitive way. The features
                 thus defined are then automatically integrated into the
                 Promela description of the base system by means of a
                 preprocessor. The developer need not (and should not)
                 alter the original code except through the feature
                 integration process.",

                 features, and use it to provide a plug-and-play

                 approach to the feature interaction problem has the
                 following characteristics: (a) features are treated as
                 first-class objects during the development phase; (b) a
                 method for integrating a feature into a system
                 description is described. It allows features to
                 override existing behaviour of the system being
                 developed; (c) a prototype tool has been developed for
                 performing the integration; (d) our approach allows
                 interactions between features to be witnessed. In
                 principle, our approach is quite general and need not
                 be tied to any particular system description language.
                 In this paper, however, we develop the approach in the
                 context of the SMV model checking system. We describe

                 Clock automata, the state variant of the Event Clock
                 automata of Alur et al. Unlike timed automata, they are
                 complementable and thus language inclusion becomes
                 decidable. SC automata and SC logic are less expressive
                 than timed automata and MITL but seem expressive enough
                 in practice. A procedure to translate each SC formula
                 into a SC automaton is presented. The main contribution

                 simplified and more classical variant of a temporal
                 logic that deals with specification evolution. It is a

                 part of performance modelling over recent years.
                 Because of the advantages of compositionality and
                 flexibility they are increasingly being used to model
                 larger and more complex systems. Therefore tools which
                 support the evaluation of models expressed using
                 stochastic process algebra must be able to utilise the
                 full range of decomposition and solution techniques
                 available. In this paper we study a class of models
                 which do not give rise to a product form solution but
                 can nevertheless be decomposed into their components
                 without loss of generality. We also exemplify the use
                 of the Markovian process algebra PEPA with the spectral
                 expansion technique which enables a class of PEPA
                 models with infinite state space to be solved
                 numerically.",

  abstract =     "The advantages of using stochastic process algebra to
                 specify performance models are well-documented. There
                 remains, however, a reluctance in some quarters to use
                 process algebras; this is particularly the case amongst
                 queueing theorists. This paper demonstrates the use of
                 a Markovian process algebra to represent a wide range
                 of queueing models. Moreover, it shows that the most
                 common interactive behaviours found in queueing systems
                 can be modelled simply in a Markovian process algebra,
                 and discusses how such specifications can lead to an
                 automated numerical solution method. An additional
                 objective of this work is to specify queueing models in
                 a form which facilitates efficient solution techniques.
                 It is intended that characterising the syntactic forms
                 within the Markovian process algebra which give rise to
                 these efficient solution methods will subsequently
                 allow the methods to be applied to a much wider range
                 of models specified in the process algebra.",
