    We describe a model for creating word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase
    alignments between documents and their human written abstracts.  Such
    alignments are critical for the development of statistical
    summarization systems that can be trained on large corpora of
    document/abstract pairs.  Our model, which is based on a novel
    Phrase-Based HMM, outperforms both the Cut \& Paste alignment model
    \cite{jing:cl} and models developed in the context of machine
    translation \cite{brownetal93}.

  tagline = {We present a model called the phrase-based HMM (see under unpublished work below) for producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and abstracts. This is in some sense my seminal accomplishment in summarization, and one of the pieces of work I am currently most proud of. I have also made available the <a href="HandAlign/">annotation software and guide</a>. The slides from an extended version of the talk are available in <a href="talks/04-pbhmm/04-pbhmm-extended.sxi">OpenOffice</a> format, or for view <a href="talks/04-pbhmm/04-pbhmm-extended.html">in your browser</a> (warning: animations don't work in the HTML version, which makes some slides impossible to read).},
