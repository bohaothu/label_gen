        abstract = {This paper discusses the capabilities of human intelligent behaviors, based on the definitions of intelligent, that would have been the
basis for defining the characters of intelligent to be used in artificial intelligence. A large number of definitions of intelligence have
been proposed by researchers as an effort to interpret the concept of intelligent, corresponding to their views and their respective
fields. However, this paper deals only with the definitions of artificial intelligence researchers as to gain the focus and to allow an
appropriate discussion. We gather 18 definitions and 2 discourses on intelligent behaviors particularly from scholars and
philosophers in this area of study. We conduct a hermeneutic analysis with the aim of examining the behaviors or characters of
intelligent and eventually identifying the common characters that reflect the concept of intelligent. The analysis indicates that there
are 6 characters ? planning, inventing, reasoning, learning, adapting and acting ? commonly associated with intelligence. Further in
this paper, we will show that these characters are the core characters or behaviors for intelligent and artificial intelligence. Our
finding would also help in the development of a framework that could be considered of interoperable with pragmatic framework for
machine intelligence.}
