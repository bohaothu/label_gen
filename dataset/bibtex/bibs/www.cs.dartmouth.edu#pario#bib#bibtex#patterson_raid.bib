  comment = {Make a good case for the upcoming I/O crisis, compare single large
  expensive disks (SLED) with small cheap disks. Outline five levels of RAID
  the give different reliabilities, costs, and performances. Block-interleaved
  with a single check disk (level 4) or with check blocks interspersed (level
  5) seem to give best performance for supercomputer I/O or database I/O or
  both. Note: the TR by the same name (UCB/CSD 87/391) is essentially
  identical.}
