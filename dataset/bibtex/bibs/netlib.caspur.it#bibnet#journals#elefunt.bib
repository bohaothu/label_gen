%%% A delimited macro \toenglish ... \endtoenglish is NECESSARY here.
%%% The more conventional undelimited form \toenglish{...} has braces
%%% that prevent BibTeX's downcasing operation, and the alternate form
%%% {\toenglish{...}} is considered a `special character' by BibTeX,
%%% and all of {...} gets downcased.  We avoid the name \english to
%%% prevent conflicts with language options in packages like Babel.
%%%
%%% To suppress output of English translations of non-English titles,
%%% use
%%%     "\def \toenglish #1\endtoenglish{\unskip}"
%%% instead.

%%% Alternative Cyrillic definitions are supplied in the event that

                 by Wilkinson, of assuming independent rounding errors
                 in each arithmetic operation. Models constructed on
                 this assumption are more tractable than would be the
                 case under more realistic assumptions. There are
                 identified two easily tested conditions on programs
                 which guarantee that error analyses are relatively
                 insensitive to the particular graph model employed. The
                 development has the additional benefit of sometimes
                 providing an elementary proof that one program is

                 COTAN, LOG, LOG10, EXP, POWER, SQRT, ATAN, ASIN, ACOS,
                 ATAN2, and CABS, in scalar (28 functions) and vector
                 (22 functions) mode. They have been implemented as part
                 of the new VS FORTRAN library recently announced along
                 with the IBM 3090 Vector Facility. These algorithms are
                 essentially table-based algorithms. An important
                 feature of these algorithms is that they produce
                 bitwise-identical results on scalar and vector
                 System\slash 370 machines. Of these, for five functions
                 the computed value result is always the correctly
                 rounded value of the infinite-precision result. For the
                 rest of the functions, the value returned is one of the
                 two floating-point neighbors bordering the
                 infinite-precision result, which implies exact results
                 if they are machine-representable. For the five
                 correctly rounded elementary functions, scalar and
                 vector algorithms are designed independently to
                 optimize performance in each case.",

                 available. The numerator of the percentage is a
                 weighted sum of the times required to carry out
                 different kinds of operations, where the weights are
                 the numbers of operations of each kind to be performed.
                 Since different kinds of operations have different mean
                 times, this sum has a skewed distribution.\par

                 Based on the Central Limit Theorem, the normal
                 distribution is the most widely used approximation to
                 the distribution of a weighted sum of random variables.
                 However, this approximation is not very good if the sum
                 has a skewed distribution.\par

                 In a separate paper [1], the author derived an
                 alternative approximation based on the first four
                 moments of the sum. In the present paper, he applies
                 this approximation to the operating theater problem by
                 estimating the moments of the times of the different
                 kinds of operations. The paper also contains a Monte
                 Carlo comparison of the normal approximation with the
                 proposed approximation for four underlying
                 distributions of the sum.",

                 the function as well as the base of the number system

                 certain number of correct digits of the function value.

                 Center for the elementary mathematical library using
                 the IEEE standard for binary floating point arithmetic
                 are described. The algorithms are based on the
                 ``accurate tables method.'' This methodology achieves
                 high performance and produces very accurate results. It
                 overcomes one of the main problems encountered in
                 elementary mathematical functions computations:
                 achieving last bit accuracy. The results obtained are
                 correctly rounded for almost all argument values.
                 \par

                 Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use
                 ``nonstandard tables,'' which are different from the
                 natural tables of equally spaced points in which the
                 rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In
                 order to achieve a small error we use the following
                 idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in
                 such a way that the table value (or tables values in
                 case we need several tables) will be very close to
                 numbers which can be exactly represented by the
                 computer (much closer than the usual double precision
                 representation). Thus we were able to control the error
                 introduced by the computer representation of real
                 numbers and extended the accuracy without actually
                 using extended precision arithmetic.",

                 intervals can be extended in a fuzzy-set approach,
                 distinguishing between more or less plausible values.
                 The simultaneous use of relatively wide intervals

                 narrower intervals covering only the most likely ones,

  abstract =     "The author describes two Fortran utilities for
                 multiprecision computation. The first is a package of
                 Fortran subroutines that perform a variety of
                 arithmetic operations and transcendental functions on
                 floating point numbers of arbitrarily high precision.
                 This package is in some cases over 200 times faster
                 than that of certain other packages that have been
                 developed for this purpose. The second utility is a
                 translator program, which facilitates the conversion of
                 ordinary Fortran programs to use this package. By means
                 of source directives (special comments) in the original
                 Fortran program, the user declares the precision level
                 and specifies which variables in each subprogram are to
                 be treated as multiprecision. The translator program
                 reads this source program and outputs a program with
                 the appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls. This
                 translator supports multiprecision integer, real, and
                 complex datatypes. The required array space for
                 multiprecision data types is automatically allocated.
                 In the evaluation of computational expressions, all of
                 the usual conventions for operator precedence and mixed
                 mode operations are upheld. Furthermore, most of the
                 Fortran-77 intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP
                 are supported and produce true multiprecision values.",

  abstract =     "Many computers provide accurate and reliable scalar
                 arithmetic for floating point numbers. An accurate
                 definition of the four elementary floating-point
                 operations +, -, *, / is given in the IEEE standards
                 for floating-point arithmetic and was well established
                 long before. An increasing number of computers
                 (especially PC's and workstations) feature IEEE
                 arithmetic. In many numerical algorithms, however,
                 compound operations such as the summation of a sequence
                 of numbers or the dot product of two vectors are highly
                 common. A simulation of these compound operations by
                 means of elementary floating-point operations leads to
                 accumulation of rounding errors and may suffer from
                 catastrophic cancellation of leading digits. Existing
                 standards for floating-point arithmetic do not improve
                 this situation. The goal of the proposal is to define
                 vector operations in a manner consistent with the
                 elementary scalar arithmetic operations. The rounding
                 modes and accuracy requirements as well as the data
                 formats of the operands and results of the vector
                 operations described in the proposal are chosen to be

                 1570-1579, 1993) introduced fast methods for numerical
                 evaluation of elementary functions based on table
                 lookup. They are called ATA (add/table-lookup/add) and
                 ATA-M (add/table-lookup/add and multiply) methods for
                 single- and double-precision calculations respectively.
                 In this paper, an improvement to these methods that
                 shrinks the size of the table by a factor of about 3/16
                 is presented. Another method called the `split parallel
                 multiplication method', which is characterized by
                 simpler table lookup than ATA-M and by split and
                 parallel use of double-precision floating point
                 circuitry, is also introduced, These new methods fit on
                 to integrated circuits of a size comparable with
                 commercially available floating-point accelerators.
                 Methods for accelerating double-precision division,

  abstract =     "This paper presents hardware designs that produce
                 exactly rounded results for the functions of
                 reciprocal, square-root, 2/sup x/, and log/sub 2/(x).
                 These designs use polynomial approximation in which the
                 terms in the approximation are generated in parallel,
                 and then summed by using a multi-operand adder. To
                 reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the
                 input interval is partitioned into subintervals of
                 equal size, and different coefficients are used for
                 each subinterval. The coefficients used in the
                 approximation are initially determined based on the
                 Chebyshev series approximation. They are then adjusted
                 to obtain exactly rounded results for all inputs.
                 Hardware designs are presented, and delay and area
                 comparisons are made based on the degree of the
                 approximating polynomial and the accuracy of the final
                 result. For single-precision floating point numbers, a
                 design that produces exactly rounded results for all
                 four functions has an estimated delay of 80 ns and a
                 total chip area of 98 mm/sup 2/ in a 1.0-micron CMOS
                 technology. Allowing the results to have a maximum
                 error of one unit in the last place reduces the
                 computational delay by 5\% to 30\% and the area
                 requirements by 33\% to 77\%.",

  abstract =     "One of the most spectacular development in computer
                 technology is the growth in memory density and speed.
                 It is with this development in mind that we intend to
                 tackle the old problem of computing the elementary
                 functions. Since the dawn of computing, the fast and
                 accurate computation of the elementary functions has
                 been a constant concern of numerical computing. It now
                 seems possible to use tables of sizes in the range of
                 megabits to aid in such computation. To this end, in
                 this paper, we propose a method called ATA-M (Add-Table
                 Lookup-Add with Multiplication) for evaluating
                 polynomials with the aid of tables. When applied to the
                 elementary functions, we obtained a set of algorithms
                 which computes the reciprocal, square root,
                 exponential, sine, cosine, logarithm, are tangent and
                 the hyperbolic functions in about 3 to 4 double
                 precision floating point multiplication time and
                 utilizing about 2 Mbyte of tables.",

                 vital role in scientific computations. Yet due to their
                 inherent nature, they are a considerable computing task
                 by themselves. Not surprisingly, since the dawn of
                 computing, the goal of speeding up elementary function
                 computation has been pursued. This paper describes new
                 hardware based algorithms for the computation of the
                 common elementary functions, namely division,
                 logarithm, reciprocal square root, arc tangent, sine
                 and cosine. These algorithms exploit microscopic
                 parallelism using specialized hardware with heavy use
                 of truncation based on detailed accuracy analysis. The
                 contribution of this work lies in the fact that these
                 algorithms are very fast and yet are accurate. If we
                 let the time to perform an IEEE Standard 754 double
                 precision floating point multiplication be tau /sub */,

                 tau /sub */, and 6.5 tau /sub */, for division,
                 logarithm, square root, exponential, are tangent and
                 complex exponential (sine and cosine) respectively. The
                 trade-off is the need for tables and some specialized
                 hardware. The total amount of tables required, however,
                 is less than 128 Kbytes. We discuss the hardware,

                 we introduce the S-3000 and, using six benchmarks we
                 designed, evaluate a member of this series of
                 supercomputer, the top of the range S-3800, against its

                 determine in what areas the S-3800 is an improvement
                 over its predecessor. The suite of benchmarks include
                 kernels for random number generation, elementary
                 function computation, FFT, dense matrix operations,
                 SOR, and list vector (scatter\slash gather) operations.
                 The use of small-to medium-sized kernels, as opposed to
                 large application benchmarks, help to better understand
                 the behavior of the machine. Our findings support the

                 corresponding truncation in signed-binary (SB)

                 exploited and applied to the development of a pair of

                 then translated into algorithm suitable for two-level
                 logic implementation. Finally, the resulting algorithms

  abstract =     "Today's floating point implementations of elementary
                 transcendental functions are usually very accurate.
                 However, with few exceptions, the actual accuracy is
                 not known. In the present paper we describe a rigorous,
                 accurate, fast and portable implementation of the
                 elementary standard functions based on some existing
                 approximate standard functions. The scheme is outlined
                 for IEEE 754, but not difficult to adapt to other
                 floating point formats. A Matlab implementation is
                 available on the net. Accuracy of the proposed
                 algorithms can be rigorously estimated. As an example
                 we prove that the relative accuracy of the exponential
                 function is better than 2.07 eps in a slightly reduced
                 argument range (eps denoting the relative rounding
                 error unit). Otherwise, extensive computational tests
                 suggest for all elementary functions and all suitable
                 arguments an accuracy better than about 3 eps.",

                 staircase function and the radix-$4$ implementation. As
                 in similar algorithms for division and square root, the
                 results are obtained correctly rounded in a
                 straightforward manner (in contrast to existing
                 methods to compute the reciprocal square
                 root). Although, apparently, a single selection
                 function can only be used for $j \geq 2$ (the selection
                 constants are different for $j = 0$, $j = 1$, and $j
                 \geq 2$), we show that it is possible to use a single
                 selection function for all iterations. We perform a
                 rough comparison with existing methods and we conclude
                 that our implementation is a low hardware complexity
                 solution with moderate latency, especially for exactly
                 rounded results. We also extend the unit to support
                 division and square root with the same selection
                 function and with slight modifications in the
                 initialization of the reciprocal square root unit.",

                 architect. Many conflicting requirements vie for
                 consideration during the design of a new computer
                 architecture. These include instruction word size,
                 number of registers, the set of operations, arithmetic
                 precisions supported, and memory access. Some of the
                 trade-offs during the design phase will be
                 discussed.\par

                 One of the objectives of the original Itanium design
                 was to accelerate quad precision arithmetic. The talk

                 involving quad precision numbers, intermediate results,
                 holding 128 bits, provide 15 guard bits during

                 are important in several applications. For the
                 operations, we present algorithms that combine a
                 digit-by-digit module and one iteration of a
                 quadratic-convergence approximation. The latter is
                 implemented by a digit-recurrence, which uses the
                 digits produced by the digit-by-digit part. In this
                 way, both parts execute in an overlapped manner, so
                 that the total number of cycles is about half the
                 number that would be required by the digit-by-digit
                 part alone. Because of the approximation, correct
                 rounding of the result cannot be obtained directly in
                 all cases; we propose a variable-time implementation
                 that produces the correctly rounded result with a small
                 average overhead. Radix-4 implementations are described
                 and have been synthesized. They achieve the same cycle
                 time as the standard digit-by-digit implementation,
                 resulting in a speed-up of about 2 and, because of the
                 approximation part, the area factor is also about 2. We
                 also show a combined implementation for both operations
                 that has essentially the same complexity as that for

                 developed by Ziv at IBM. This library showed that the

                 rounding could be made negligible. However, the

                 second-degree polynomial (using a specialized squaring
                 unit, redundant arithmetic, and multioperand addition).
                 The execution times and area costs of an architecture
                 implementing our method are estimated, showing the
                 achievement of the fast execution times of linear
                 approximation methods and the reduced area requirements
                 of other second-degree interpolation algorithms.
                 Moreover, the use of an enhanced minimax approximation
                 which, through an iterative process, takes into account
                 the effect of rounding the polynomial coefficients to a
                 finite size allows for a further reduction in the size
                 of the look-up tables to be used, making our method
                 very suitable for the implementation of an elementary
                 function generator in state-of-the-art DSPs or graphics
                 processing units (GPUs).",

                 correct rounding as often as possible. This method
                 requires an expensive pre-computation of the values
                 taken by the function or by several related functions
                 at some distinguished points. Our improvements of Gal's
                 method are two-fold: on the one hand we describe what
                 is the arguably best set of distinguished values and
                 how it improves the efficiency and accuracy of the
                 function implementation, and on the other hand we give
                 an algorithm which drastically decreases the cost of
                 the pre-computation. These improvements are related to
                 the worst cases for the correct rounding of
                 mathematical functions and to the algorithms for
                 finding them. We demonstrate how the whole method can
                 be turned into practice for $2^x$ and $\sin x$ for $x

                 correct rounding of a mathematical function of one
                 variable. We first reduce this problem to the real
                 small value problem---i.e., for polynomials with real
                 coefficients. Then, we show that this second problem
                 can be solved efficiently by extending Coppersmith's
                 work on the integer small value problem---for
                 polynomials with integer coefficients---using lattice
                 reduction. For floating-point numbers with a mantissa
                 less than $N$ and a polynomial approximation of degree
                 $d$, our algorithm finds all worst cases at distance

                 using truncated multipliers and squarers. Initial
                 coefficient values are found using a Chebyshev series

                 simulation to minimize the maximum absolute error of
                 the interpolator output. This technique is suitable for
                 any function and any precision up to 24-bits (IEEE
                 single precision). Designs for linear and quadratic
                 interpolators that implement the reciprocal function,
                 $f(x) = 1/x,$ are presented and analyzed as an example.
