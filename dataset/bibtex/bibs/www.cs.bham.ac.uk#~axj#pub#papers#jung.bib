  theorem for Boolean algebras to distributive lattices. In modern
  terminology, the representing topological spaces are
  zero-dimensional stably compact, but typically not Hausdorff. In
  1970, Hilary Priestley realised that Stone's topology could be
  enriched to yield order-disconnected compact ordered spaces.

  In the present paper, we generalise Priestley duality to a
  representation theorem for strong proximity lattices. For these a
  ``Stone-type'' duality was given in 1995 in joint work between
  Philipp S\"underhauf and the second author, which established a
  close link between these algebraic structures and the class of all
  stably compact spaces.  The feature which distinguishes the present
  work from this duality is that the proximity relation of strong
  proximity lattices is ``preserved'' in the dual, where it manifests
  itself as a form of ``apartness.'' This suggests a link with
  constructive mathematics which in this paper we
  can only hint at.  Apartness seems particularly attractive in view
  of potential applications of the theory in areas of semantics where
  continuous phenomena play a role; there, it is the distinctness
  between different states which is observable, not equality.

  The idea of separating states is also taken up in our discussion of
  possible morphisms for which the representation theorem extends to
  an equivalence of categories.}

  subsets of a bisober space that are compact in one and closed in the
  other topology. This is in analogy to the celebrated Hofmann-Mislove
  theorem for sober spaces. We link the characterisation to Taylor's
  and Escard{\'o}'s reading of the Hofmann-Mislove theorem as continuous
  quantification over a subspace. As an application, we define locally
  compact d-frames and show that these are always spatial.}
