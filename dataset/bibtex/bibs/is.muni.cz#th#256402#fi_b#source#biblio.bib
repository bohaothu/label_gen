This paper is intended to introduce researchers to the model."

After examining current general formal models with respect to their suitability for description of component-based systems, we propose a new verification-oriented model, Component-Interaction automata, and discuss its features. The model is designed to preserve all the interaction properties to provide a rich base for further verification, and allows the system behaviour to be configurable according to the architecture description (bindings among components) and other specifics (type of communication used in the synchronization of components)."

In our approach, we employ parallel LTL-like model checking to handle the size of the model. We present the results of the actual application of the technique to the verification of a complex model of a~real system created within the CoCoME Modelling Contest. In this case study, we check the validity of the model and the correctness of the system via checking various temporal properties. We concentrate on the component-specific properties, like local deadlocks of components, and correctness of given use-case scenarios.",

In contrast to strong bisimulation, for branching bisimulation there are only tools available that work on an explicit state space representation. In this work, we present for the first time a symbolic approach for branching bisimulation that uses BDDs as basic data structure and that is based on the concept of signature refinement. First experimental results for problem instances derived from process algebraic system descriptions show the feasibility and the robustness of our approach},
