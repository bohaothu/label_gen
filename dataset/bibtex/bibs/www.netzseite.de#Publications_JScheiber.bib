abstract = {Typically, screening collections of pharmaceutical companies contain more than a million compounds today. However, for certain high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns, constraints posed by the assay throughput and/or the reagent costs make it impractical to screen the entire deck. Therefore, it is desirable to effectively screen subsets of the collection based on a hypothesis or a diversity selection. How to select compound subsets is a subject of ongoing debate. The authors present an approach based on extended connectivity fingerprints to carry out diversity selection on a per plate basis (instead of a per compound basis). HTS data from 35 Novartis screens spanning 5 target classes were investigated to assess the performance of this approach. The analysis shows that selecting a fingerprint-diverse subset of 250K compounds, representing 20% of the screening deck, would have achieved significantly higher hit rates for 86% of the screens. This measure also outperforms the Murcko scaffold-based plate selection described previously, where only 49% of the screens showed similar improvements. Strikingly, the 2-fold improvement in average hit rates observed for 3 of 5 target classes in the data set indicates a target bias of the plate (and thus compound) selection method. Even though the diverse subset selection lacks any target hypothesis, its application shows significantly better results for some targets-namely, G-protein-coupled receptors, proteases, and protein-protein interactions-but not for kinase and pathway screens. The synthetic origin of the compounds in the diverse subset appears to influence the screening hit rates. Natural products were the most diverse compound class, with significantly higher hit rates compared to the compounds from the traditional synthetic and combinatorial libraries. These results offer empirical guidelines for plate-based diversity selection to enhance hit rates, based on target class and the library type being screened.},

abstract = {The elucidation of drug targets is important both to optimize desired compound action and to understand drug side-effects. In this study, we created statistical models which link chemical substructures of ligands to protein domains in a probabilistic manner and employ the model to triage the results of affinity chromatography experiments. By annotating targets with their InterPro domains, general rules of ligand-protein domain associations were derived and successfully employed to predict protein targets outside the scope of the training set. This methodology was then tested on a proteomics affinity chromatography data set containing 699 compounds. The domain prediction model correctly detected 31.6% of the experimental targets at a specificity of 46.8%. This is striking since 86% of the predicted targets are not part of them (but share InterPro domains with them), and thus could not have been predicted by conventional target prediction approaches. Target predictions improve drastically when significance (FDR) scores for target pulldowns are employed, emphasizing their importance for eliminating artifacts. Filament proteins (such as actin and tubulin) are detected to be 'frequent hitters' in proteomics experiments and their presence in pulldowns is not supported by the target predictions. On the other hand, membrane-bound receptors such as serotonin and dopamine receptors are noticeably absent in the affinity chromatography sets, although their presence would be expected from the predicted targets of compounds. While this can partly be explained by the experimental setup, we suggest the computational methods employed here as a complementary step of identifying protein targets of small molecules. Affinity chromatography results for gefitinib are discussed in detail and while two out of the three kinases with the highest affinity to gefitinib in biochemical assays are detected by affinity chromatography, also the possible involvement of NSF as a target for modulating cancer progressions via beta-arrestin can be proposed by this method.},

abstract = {Different molecular descriptors capture different aspects of molecular structures, but this effect has not yet been quantified systematically on a large scale. In this work, we calculate the similarity of 37 descriptors by repeatedly selecting query compounds and ranking the rest of the database. Euclidean distances between the rank-ordering of different descriptors are calculated to determine descriptor (as opposed to compound) similarity, followed by PCA for visualization. Four broad descriptor classes are identified, which are circular fingerprints; circular fingerprints considering counts; path-based and keyed fingerprints; and pharmacophoric descriptors. Descriptor behavior is much more defined by those four classes than the particular parametrization. Using counts instead of the presence/absence of fingerprints significantly changes descriptor behavior, which is crucial for performance of topological autocorrelation vectors, but not circular fingerprints. Four-point pharmacophores (piDAPH4) surprisingly lead to much higher retrieval rates than three-point pharmacophores (28.21% vs 19.15%) but still similar rank-ordering of compounds (retrieval of similar actives). Looking into individual rankings, circular fingerprints seem more appropriate than path-based fingerprints if complex ring systems or branching patterns are present; count-based fingerprints could be more suitable in databases with a large number of repeated subunits (amide bonds, sugar rings, terpenes). Information-based selection of diverse fingerprints for consensus scoring (ECFP4/TGD fingerprints) led only to marginal improvement over single fingerprint results. While it seems to be nontrivial to exploit orthogonal descriptor behavior to improve retrieval rates in consensus virtual screening, those descriptors still each retrieve different actives which corroborates the strategy of employing diverse descriptors individually in prospective virtual screening settings.},

abstract = {We present a novel generic method to better understand the divergent activities of molecules that often occur in orthogonal assays. The newly developed simple prediction of activity differences (SPREAD) method directly aims to model and understand the differences compounds exhibit when tested in two or more assays. By transforming the activity values from the assays into meta-categories (specifically defined for datasets under scrutiny), statistical models can be trained directly on the qualitative differences between assays. This contributes heavily toward a tangible understanding of molecular assay selectivity. Although ensembles of models could be used alternatively to predict compounds that score highly in one assay and low in another, the advantage of the SPREAD approach is that the chemical features influencing assay differences are parsed out immediately as a consequence of training the model on the coincident assay differences. By training the model that describes the difference between two or more assays, molecular substructures that are responsible for assay selectivity can be parsed out. The method was validated by using four challenging datasets. Copyright © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 2: 115-122, 2009},

abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) is a well-established hit-finding approach used in the pharmaceutical industry. In this article, recent experience at Novartis with respect to factors influencing the success of HTS campaigns is discussed. An inherent measure of HTS quality could be defined by the assay Z and Z' factors, the number of hits and their biological potencies; however, such measures of quality do not always correlate with the advancement of hits to the later stages of drug discovery. Also, for many target classes, such as kinases, it is easy to identify hits, but, as a result of selectivity, intellectual property and other issues, the projects do not result in lead declarations. In this article, HTS success is defined as the fraction of HTS campaigns that advance into the later stages of drug discovery, and the major influencing factors are examined. Interestingly, screening compounds in individual wells or in mixtures did not have a major impact on the HTS success and, equally interesting, there was no difference in the progression rates of biochemical and cell-based assays. Particular target types, assay technologies, structure-activity relationships and powder availability had a much greater impact on success as defined above. In addition, significant mutual dependencies can be observed - while one assay format works well with one target type, this situation might be completely reversed for a combination of the same readout technology with a different target type. The results and opinions presented here should be regarded as groundwork, and a plethora of factors that influence the fate of a project, such as biophysical measurements, chemical attractiveness of the hits, strategic reasons and safety pharmacology, are not covered here. Nonetheless, it is hoped that this information will be used industry-wide to improve success rates in terms of hits progressing into exploratory chemistry and beyond. The support that can be obtained from new in silico approaches to phase transitions are also described, along with the gaps they are designed to fill.},

The compounds were shown to be pseudo-irreversible dual-mode inhibitors: the intermediate esterified enzyme resulting from nucleophilic ring opening was hydrolyzed and yielded amino alcohols as transition-state-mimetic reversible inhibitors. The results of docking studies with the ring-closed aziridine forms of the inhibitors suggest binding modes mainly dominated by hydrophobic interactions with the S1, S1', S2, and S2' subsites of the protease, and docking studies with the processed amino alcohol forms predict additional hydrogen bonds of the new hydroxy group to the active site Asp residues. C. albicans growth assays showed the compounds to decrease SAP2-dependent growth while not affecting SAP2-independent growth.},

The ability of VFL to identify compounds of nanomolar potency based on micromolar fragment binding data was tested on 75 target classes from the WOMBAT database and succeeded in 57 cases. Further, the method was demonstrated for seven drug targets from in-house screening programs that performed both FBS of 8800 fragments and screens of the full library. VFL captured between 28% and 67% of the hits (IC 50 < 10microM) in the top 5% of the ranked library for four of the targets (enrichment between 5-fold and 13-fold). Our findings lead us to conclude that proper coverage of chemical space by the fragment library is crucial for the VFL methodology to be successful in prioritizing HTS libraries from fragment-based screening data.},

Thus, the aim of many treatment regimens is to support this system either by means of muscarinic agonists or by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the latter being able to increase the concentration of acetylcholine. However, both pharmacological groups of drugs can only help in the beginning of the progressive disease. The finding that the occupation of the peripheral anionic site of AChE is able to stop the formation of the amyloid plaque led to the development of bivalent ligands that occupy both the active and the peripheral site. This dual action might be more beneficial for treatment of Alzheimer s disease than simple inhibition of the acetylcholine hydrolysis. Thus, the new bivalent ligands are the focus of this review.},

abstract = {Preclinical Safety Pharmacology (PSP) attempts to anticipate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during early phases of drug discovery by testing compounds in simple, in vitro binding assays (that is, preclinical profiling). The selection of PSP targets is based largely on circumstantial evidence of their contribution to known clinical ADRs, inferred from findings in clinical trials, animal experiments, and molecular studies going back more than forty years. In this work we explore PSP chemical space and its relevance for the prediction of adverse drug reactions. Firstly, in silico (computational) Bayesian models for 70 PSP-related targets were built, which are able to detect 93% of the ligands binding at IC(50) < or = 10 microM at an overall correct classification rate of about 94%. Secondly, employing the World Drug Index (WDI), a model for adverse drug reactions was built directly based on normalized side-effect annotations in the WDI, which does not require any underlying functional knowledge. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to predict adverse drug reactions across hundreds of categories from chemical structure alone. On average 90% of the adverse drug reactions observed with known, clinically used compounds were detected, an overall correct classification rate of 92%. Drugs withdrawn from the market (Rapacuronium, Suprofen) were tested in the model and their predicted ADRs align well with known ADRs. The analysis was repeated for acetylsalicylic acid and Benperidol which are still on the market. Importantly, features of the models are interpretable and back-projectable to chemical structure, raising the possibility of rationally engineering out adverse effects. By combining PSP and ADR models new hypotheses linking targets and adverse effects can be proposed and examples for the opioid mu and the muscarinic M2 receptors, as well as for cyclooxygenase-1 are presented. It is hoped that the generation of predictive models for adverse drug reactions is able to help support early SAR to accelerate drug discovery and decrease late stage attrition in drug discovery projects. In addition, models such as the ones presented here can be used for compound profiling in all development stages.},

Thus, careful triaging and prioritization of the primary hit list can save time and money by identifying potential false positives before incurring the expense of followup. Of particular concern are cell-based reporter gene assays (RGAs) where the number of hits may be prohibitively high to be scrutinized manually for weeding out erroneous data. Based on statistical models built from chemical structures of 650 000 compounds tested in RGAs, we created "frequent hitter" models that make it possible to prioritize potential false positives. Furthermore, we followed up the frequent hitter evaluation with chemical structure based in silico target predictions to hypothesize a mechanism for the observed "off target" response. It was observed that the predicted cellular targets for the frequent hitters were known to be associated with undesirable effects such as cytotoxicity. More specifically, the most frequently predicted targets relate to apoptosis and cell differentiation, including kinases, topoisomerases, and protein phosphatases. The mechanism-based frequent hitter hypothesis was tested using 160 additional druglike compounds predicted by the model to be nonspecific actives in RGAs. This validation was successful (showing a 50% hit rate compared to a normal hit rate as low as 2%), and it demonstrates the power of computational models toward understanding complex relations between chemical structure and biological function.},

abstract = {The use of capillary electrophoresis (CE) modified with cyclodextrin (CD) for the separation of stereoisomers of peptides is well established. To increase the solubility of beta-CD, urea is often added to the buffer which may influence the complexation of a CD with a guest molecule. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of urea on the complexation between dipeptides and beta-CD using Ala-Phe and Ala-Tyr as model compounds. For this purpose three different analytical methods were employed: capillary electrophoresis (CE), 1H-NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Electropherograms of the peptide enantiomers were different in the presence and absence of urea. For example, at pH 2.5 in the absence of urea the enantiomers of Ala-Tyr are not separated in contrast to the use of buffers containing urea. Applying ldquocomplexation-induced chemical shift (CICS)rdquo in NMR spectroscopy and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY) revealed differences in the complexation of the peptide enantiomers by beta-CD in the absence and presence of urea suggesting the stabilization of the complex through the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine. MD simulations for different complexes were carried out with consideration of both water and urea molecules in solution. Simulations were performed for 1 ns. In conclusion, NMR spectroscopy and MD methods help to understand the structure of peptide-CD complexes and the separation and migration behavior in CE. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {Cyclodextrins (CDs) are often used to separate the enantiomers of chiral drugs by HPLC, GC, and capillary electrophoresis (CE). For dipeptides containing one aromatic amino acid, a reversal of the migration order is observed in CE upon increasing the pH value of the background electrolyte from 2.5 to 3.5. In order to understand the mechanism of chiral recognition of this phenomenon, NMR experiments, namely complexation-induced chemical shifts (CICS) and ROESY, were performed. Comparing the CICSs obtained for the pairs Diac-beta-CD/Ala-Phe and HDAS-beta-CD/Ala-Phe and Diac-beta-CD/Ala-Tyr and HDAS-beta-CD/Ala-Tyr revealed very small changes, thereby indicating a rather weak interaction of the respective guest molecules with their host. The CICS for beta-CD and HS-beta-CD confirmed an inclusion of the aromatic moiety into the CD cavity. It is shown that, at pH 2.5, the D,D-enantiomer of Ala-Tyr immerses deeper into the cavity of beta-cyclodextrin than the L,L-enantiomer, and this was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, at pH 3.5 the immersion is shallower, as shown by the 1H and ROESY NMR findings and confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulations. The immersion depths of the dipeptides were calculated by defining a plane in the cavity to gain information about the different behaviour of the studied chemical species. The employed procedure is easily generalised to other host-guest complexes and is expected to improve data evaluation in other cases, too. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
