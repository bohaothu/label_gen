%X In their seminal 1983 book 'The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction',
Card, Newell and Moran (ACM Fellows and Turing Award winners) introduced 'the
model human information-processor'. This model equipped interface designers
with strong theoretical tools to predict human interface performance without
the demands of implementation and evaluation.
   In the quarter century since then, human-computer interaction research has
been extremely successful in transitioning research ideas to commercial
deployment, yet interface design remains something of an art that is dependent
on time-consuming iterations of design, implement, and evaluate. Theoretical
models of human performance are rarely used despite their potential.
   In this presentation I will describe several of our recent projects seeking
to improve the efficiency of everyday activities in computer use, including
scrolling, text messaging, window switching, and navigating through menu and
file structures. The overriding theme, however, is on using theoretical human
performance models to inform design, explain and predict performance, and to
generalise results obtained. Ultimately, the objective is to give all computer
science graduates the equivalent of a 'Big O' complexity theory for user
interfaces that allows them to design with assurance.

%X Thin-client computing may be a solution to such problems as providing
sophisticated applications on devices with low computational power, or
providing reasonable access to digital artifacts whose distribution the
copyright owner still wishes to protect. However, certain application domains
have tight constraints around user interface response times, and the network
aspect of thin-client computing may cause issues in this regard. We have
conducted an experiment to identify how various delays added to mobile games
affect players' performance and perceptions of the gameplay. By studying the
effects of these delays, we aim to identify time-based performance parameters
within which our future thin-client computing systems should work if they are
to support all application domains.

%X Commenting on a student's computer program with red pen ink annotations is
not possible with current software and paper program 'listings' are a relic of
a bygone era. Yet ink annotations are the easiest way to provide rich feedback
to the student. We have developed and evaluated Penmarked as a software
solution to this problem. It supports free-form ink annotations and,
importantly, associated marking tasks of gathering and returning assignments
and recording grades. The evaluation against paper and digital marking systems
showed it to be faster and more effective. From a wider perspective Penmarked
demonstrates the intricacies of providing totally paperless environment.

%X Successful information search requires a joint effort from both syntactic
matching provided by current search engines and semantic matching performed by
human users. Word-based syntactic matching schemes work well for tasks such as
homepage finding or fact finding, but they are less effective in supporting
exploratory search tasks such as learning and investigation. One way to
overcome this limitation of syntactic matching is to capture the search
journeys of other users with semantically related queries, and use them as a
roadmap to guide exploratory search.
   This paper presents our investigation on the utilization of query semantics
derived from query logs, to 1) increase the diversity of a search result; and
2) devise new interfaces that display a search result to support exploratory
search. We conducted a user study to evaluate our initial interface prototypes.
The evaluation shows that, with the interface that explicitly supports their
task, subjects acquire more knowledge and are more confident about their task
completeness. The differences between subjects' preferences suggest that we may
need to provide a range of interfaces that can not only support users' search
tasks, but also suit their personal styles.

%X Software to display DNA sequences is a crucial tool for bioinformatics
research. This study examined techniques for navigating large DNA sequences via
panning and zooming. This involved surveying the navigation facilities of
current bioinformatics applications and performing a heuristic analysis on the
most common interface controls found. Several prototypes for sequence
navigation via panning and zooming were then developed and usability trials
carried out, getting users to perform common sequence navigation tasks using
the prototypes. The "Connected View" design was found to be most usable for
panning while the zooming results were less clear. The outcomes of this type of
research can help improve bioinformatics applications so that will be more
usable by the target research users.

%X Models play an important part in the decision-making process. However, due
to uncertainty in a model's input variables, making decisions involves a degree
of risk. We have developed two visualization prototypes for exploring the
influence of uncertainty in the values of the input variables on the risk
associated with the decision-making. The first prototype is the interactive
tornado diagram, which is considered as an extension to the static tornado
diagram. The second prototype is the Uncertainty Influence Explorer
(UIExplorer). This paper presents and discusses the results of an experiment
conducted to assess the efficacy of these prototypes and compare their ability
to help people answer meaningful questions related to the risk associated with
decision-making. The results show that participants using UIExplorer performed
better in terms of accuracy and time taken to complete the questions. Also,
they found it easier to use and had higher confidence in the decisions being
made.

%X We present iAnnotate, a tool that provides multi-user digital ink annotation
on standard web pages within a commercial browser. The annotation can be saved,
retrieved and shared with others via a URL. In addition multiple users'
annotations can be displayed on the same page. We describe our design goals and
the technical challenges. While realizing annotation on web documents is
difficult because of the dynamic nature of the documents and the security
constraints of web browsers, our user evaluation suggests that fully realized
digital ink annotation tools would be very valuable.

%X The design and animation of digital 3D models is an essential task for many
applications in science, engineering, education, medicine and arts. In many
instances only an approximate representation is required and a simple and
intuitive modelling and animation process, suitable for untrained users, is
more important than realism and extensive features. Sketch-based modelling has
been shown to be a suitable interface because the underlying pen-and-paper
metaphor is intuitive and effective.
   In this paper we present LifeSketch, a framework for sketched-based
modelling and animation. Three-dimensional models are created with a variation
of the popular "Teddy" algorithm. The models are analysed and skeletons with
joints are extracted fully automatically. The surface mesh is bound to the
curved skeletons using skinning techniques and the resulting model can be
animated using skeletal animation methods.
   The results of our evaluation and user study suggest that modelling and
animation tasks are considerable more efficient than with traditional tools.
The learning curve is very flat and a half page document was sufficient to
familiarise users with the tools functionality. Users were satisfied with the
automatically extracted joints, but some users struggled selecting the
appropriate rotation axes and angles for animating the resulting 3D objects. A
more intuitive, preferable automatic or sketch-based approach for animations is
needed. Overall users were satisfied with the modelling capabilities of the
tool, found most of its functionality natural and intuitive, and they enjoyed
using it.

%X TableMouse is a cursor manipulation device designed specifically for
multiple users interacting on large tabletop surface. TableMouse tracks
position, height, orientation, button state, and unique identification. It is
designed using infrared light emitting diodes and computer vision to perform
device tracking and identification. This paper explores the functional design
of such a device. Insights into the inherent features enabled by this
functionality -- out of arms reach interaction, collaborative interaction --
are described. The architecture, vision analysis process, and issues to
consider are described. Finally two example applications utilising the
TableMouse are described.

%X Empirical work on appropriate layout aesthetics for graph drawing algorithms
has concentrated on the interpretation of existing graph drawings. A more
recent experiment has considered layout aesthetics from the point of view of
users moving nodes in an existing graph drawing so as to create a desirable
layout. The project reported here extends this research further, by asking
participants to use sketching software to draw graphs based on adjacency lists,
and to then lay them out -- removing any bias caused by an initial
configuration. We find, in common with many other studies, that removing edge
crossings is the most significant aesthetic, but also discover that aligning
nodes and edges to an underlying grid is important, especially to male
participants who have Computer Science experience. We observe that the
aesthetics favoured by participants during creation of a graph drawing are
often not evident in the final product.

%X This paper examines literature concerning the design of culture into
websites and in particular indigenous websites. The intention is to identify
design requirements as the first phase of building an indigenous website for
the Wollotuka Institute located in the Awabakal nation and situated at the
University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. The aim of the project is to produce a
website that best reflects the identity, needs and culture of the local
Wollotuka community. Wollotuka supports a broad range of indigenous programs
incorporating administrative, academic and research activities and provides
support and development services for indigenous staff and students.
Unfortunately many existing frameworks and indeed Western conceptions about
what knowledge is and how it should be captured, organised and presented do not
necessarily meet the culture of the intended indigenous users. The work
described in this paper focuses on the many issues of concern when attempting
to design a website that is specific for a local cultural community such as
Wollotuka. We review previous work in cultural design and discuss some generic
issues related to the representation and capture of indigenous knowledge. This
review provides us with some general considerations and more specific
guidelines for culture-specific design. Of particular interest is that
narrative and object are conceptualised as a duality in knowledge
representations found in Australian Indigenous culture. We also examine issues
of design process and use our findings to support the choice of a user-centric
design method, where we localise the design, through an iterative, prototyping
process.
