abstract = {Kramer’s nonlinear principal components analysis
(NLPCA) neural networks are feedforward autoassociative networks
with five layers. The third layer has fewer nodes than
the input or output layers. This paper proposes a geometric
interpretation for Kramer’s method by showing that NLPCA
fits a lower-dimensional curve or surface through the training
data. The first three layers project observations onto the curve
or surface giving scores. The last three layers define the curve
or surface. The first three layers are a continuous function,
which we show has several implications: NLPCA “projections”
are suboptimal producing larger approximation error, NLPCA
is unable to model curves and surfaces that intersect themselves,
and NLPCA cannot parameterize curves with parameterizations
having discontinuous jumps. We establish results on the
identification of score values and discuss their implications on
interpreting score values. We discuss the relationship between
NLPCA and principal curves and surfaces, another nonlinear
feature extraction method.},
