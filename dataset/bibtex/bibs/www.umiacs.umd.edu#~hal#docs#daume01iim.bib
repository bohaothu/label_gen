    Most current IR research is focused on specific technologies, such
    as filtering, classification, entity extraction, question
    answering, etc. There is relatively little research on merging
    multiple technologies into sophisticated applications, due in part
    to the high cost of integrating independently-developed text
    processing modules.  In this paper, we present the Integrated
    Information Management (IIM) architecture for component-based
    development of IR applications.  The IIM architecture is general
    enough to model different types of IR tasks, beyond indexing and
    retrieval.
