                 chief symptoms are staircasing along edges and objects
                 that pop on and off in time. The method for reducing
                 these symptoms is to filter the image before sampling

                 the pixel is presented as a depth-ordered list of
                 polygons then the average visible intensity can be

  abstract =     "A proposal is made for the definition of `tools',
                 high-level graphics input functions based on the six
                 primitive input classes Clock, Pick, Button, Key,
                 Valuator and Locator. Tools are defined in terms of
                 input expressions, the operands of which are themselves
                 tools, the definition of which may be nested inside
                 this tool. Input expressions are written much like
                 production rules in phrase structure grammars.
                 Determining whether a tool is `satisfied' can be done
                 most advantageously by an input expression parser. Tool
                 definitions may occur in-line or stored in a library.
                 They are activated by a `create' primitive, which
                 creates an instance of the tool and causes the input
                 expression to be made active. Using this approach to
                 higher-level input primitives, a programmer does not
                 have to think about graphics input in terms of awaiting
                 events, interrupts and the like.",

                 data files and rapid computation speeds demanded by

                 presented of a hardware and software configuration for
                 a microcomputer based graphics system developed in
                 response to a need in the sewing industry for a low
                 cost pattern digitizer. A basic graphics package was
                 written which renders both text and vectors on the
                 storage terminal. Around this core, and application
                 program was organized which permits an operator to log
                 piercing point coordinate data from a scaled drawing.
                 Output is then committed to paper tape for permanent
                 storage and PROM for control of the sewing machine.
                 Additional features allow for graphical editing of
                 patterns, display of stored pattern ``programs'' from
                 PROM or paper tape, and merging of new and\slash or old

                 polygons where each polygon has a positive real number

                 (IPIN) is being designed and developed by the Defense
                 Mapping Agency Aerospace Center to meet database
                 demands for terrain elevation information. IPIN is a
                 network of computers and instrumentation dedicated to
                 digitizing and editing photo-source terrain data.
                 Editing procedures are required because of digitizing
                 errors inherent in the data-collection process. Some of
                 these errors are random; other are systematic and
                 predictable. The procedure of interest involves
                 smoothing raw data that have been collected by the
                 operator of an analytical stereoplotter. When
                 digitizing geomorphic features from aerial
                 stereophotographs, the double-line drain (DLD) presents
                 special problems. The digitizing of an DLD (a
                 relatively broad river or stream) requires specifying
                 triples (x,y,z) (latitude, longitude, elevation) at

                 latitude and longitude values. The elevation values,

                 necessary to digitize a large number of existing base
                 maps. One way of replacing the error-prone and very
                 time-consuming manual digitization by an automatic
                 method is scanning the map and extracting the linework
                 from the resulting binary matrix. A sufficiently fast
                 and economic scan-to-line-conversion algorithm has to
                 be developed for the line extraction. The algorithm
                 presented operates with a skeletonization technique
                 which is further developed from known line thinning
                 methods, so that the scan lines are now skeletonized in
                 a single pass and that only a small number of scan
                 lines has to be held in core storage. The result of
                 this process is equivalent to a multi-pass
                 skeletonization which utilizes a quasi-parallel line
                 thinning in four partitions of the binary matrix for
                 each pass. The data produced by the extraction
                 algorithms following the skeletonization have two
                 important advantages over data produced by manual
                 digitization: First, the nodes corresponding to the
                 line end points are exactly determined and, second, the

                 stored texture information that is replicated on a
                 surface within an image. The purpose is to give the

                 The tile is stored and accessed at several different

  abstract =     "A syntactic model for the computer generation of
                 textures is proposed. A texture pattern is composed of
                 fixed-sized windows as subpatterns. Each window is
                 represented by a tree of which each node corresponds to
                 a pixel in the window. A pattern primitive is the label
                 representing the gray level of each pixel. A tree
                 grammar is then used to characterize the windowed
                 texture pattern. Distortion or noise in the texture
                 pattern can be considered by using stochastic tree
                 grammars. A procedure for the inference of tree
                 grammars from texture patterns is proposed.

                 geometric design has concentrated on the problems of
                 representing so-called sculptured surfaces. There has
                 recently been much interest in systems which can handle
                 typical mechanical components by a volume modelling
                 approach. This study is concerned with the possibility
                 of combining the two approaches and discusses the
                 issues raised. A solution in terms of applying
                 smoothing operators to a geometric coarse structure is
                 proposed, with the added benefits of detecting and
                 successfully handling anomalous regions in surfaces and

                 the graphics in a conceptually parallel fashion without
                 the complexity of a more general parallel mechanism.
                 Each entity on the display screen can be independently
                 programmed to move, turn, change size, color or shape
                 and to interact with other entities. The scheme
                 presented begins with the notion of a quantum of time,
                 or tick, within which there are no ordering constraints
                 on events. Each entity or actor decides what it must do
                 upon the next tick. Ticks are a powerful means of
                 controlling parallel processes but are usually at too
                 low a conceptual level for user convenience.
                 Higher-level operations built upon the tick mechanism
                 are presented, most notably the ability to instruct any
                 entity or group of entities to gradually change or move
                 at a rate that is itself changeable by the same
                 operation. To illustrate these ideas a simple celestial
                 mechanics simulation is presented. Upon each tick the
                 velocities and positions of the objects are updated by
                 the gravitational and propulsive forces acting upon

                 image, contains better refraction formula than Whitted
                 Simple transparency algorithms which assume a linear
                 transparency over an entire surface are the type most
                 often employed to produce computer synthesized images
                 of transparent objects with curved surfaces. Although
                 most of the images created with these algorithms do
                 give the impression of transparency, they usually do
                 not look realistic. One of the most serious problems is
                 that the intensity of the light that is transmitted
                 through the objects is generally not proportional to
                 the amount of material through which it must pass.
                 Another problem is that the image seen behind the
                 objects is not distorted as would naturally occur when
                 the light is refracted as it passes through a material
                 of different density. \\ Use of a non-linear
                 transparency algorithm can provide a great improvement
                 in the realism of an image at a small additional cost.
                 Making the transparency proportional to the normal to
                 the surface causes it to decrease towards the edges of
                 the surface where the path of the light through the
                 object is longer. The observer, through the picture
                 plane and through each transparent object until an
                 opaque surface is intersected. Since the direction of
                 the ray would change as each material of differing
                 optical density was entered, the hidden surface
                 calculations required would be very time consuming.
                 However, if a few assumptions are made about the
                 geometry of each object and about the conditions under
                 which they are viewed, a much simpler algorithm can be
                 used to approximate the refractive effect. This method
                 proceeds in a back to front order, mapping the current
                 background image onto the next surface, until all
                 surfaces have been considered.",

  annote =       "hierarchical bounding boxes, used to speed up ray
                 tracing and other algorithms \\ Hierarchical
                 representations of 3-dimensional objects are both time
                 and space efficient. They typically consist of trees
                 whose branches represent bounding volumes and whose
                 terminal nodes represent primitive object elements
                 (usually polygons). This paper describes a method
                 whereby the object space is represented entirely by a
                 hierarchical data structure consisting of bounding
                 volumes, with no other form of representation. This
                 homogeneity allows the visible surface rendering to be
                 performed simply and efficiently. \\ The bounding
                 volumes selected for this algorithm are parallelepipeds
                 oriented to minimize their sizes. With this
                 representation, any surface can be rendered since in
                 the limit the bounding volumes make up a point
                 representation of the object. The advantage is that the
                 visibility calculations consist only of a search
                 through the data structure to determine the
                 correspondence between terminal level bounding volumes
                 and the current pixel. For ray tracing algorithms, this
                 means that a simplified operation will produce the
                 point of intersection of each ray with the bounding
                 volumes. \\ Memory requirements are minimized by
                 expanding or fetching lower levels of the hierarchy
                 only when required. Because the viewing process has a
                 single operation and primitive type, the software and
                 hardware chosen to implement the search can be highly
                 optimized for very fast execution.",

                 basis, and discusses the computational requirements and
                 new capabilities. illumination by wave fronts, rather
                 than light rays \\ A continuing trend in computer
                 representation of three dimensional synthetic scenes is
                 the ever more accurate modelling of complex
                 illumination effects. Such effects provide cues
                 necessary for a convincing illusion of reality. The
                 best current methods simulate multiple specular
                 reflections and refractions, but handle at most one
                 scattering bounce per light ray. They cannot accurately
                 simulate diffuse light sources, nor indirect lighting
                 via scattering media, without prohibitive increases in
                 the already very large computing costs. \\ Conventional
                 methods depend implicitly on a {\em particle} model;
                 light propagates in straight and conceptually
                 infinitely thin rays. This paper argues that a {\em
                 wave} model has important computational advantages for
                 the complex situations. In this approach, light is
                 represented by wave fronts which are stored as two
                 dimensional arrays of complex numbers. \\ The
                 propagation of such a front can be simulated by a
                 linear transform. Several advantages accrue.
                 Propagations in a direction orthogonal to the plane of
                 a front are convolutions which can be done by FFT in
                 $O(n \log n)$ time rather than the $n^{2}$ time for a
                 similar operation using rays. A typical speedup is
                 about 10,000. The wavelength of the illumination sets a
                 resolution limit which prevents unnecessary computation
                 of elements smaller than will be visible. The generated
                 wavefronts contain multiplicities of views of the
                 scene, which can be individually extracted by passing
                 them through different simulated lenses. Lastly the
                 wavefront calculations are ideally suited for
                 implementation on available array processors, which
                 provide more cost effective calculation for this task
                 than general purpose computers. \\ The wave method
                 eliminates the aliasing problem; the wavefronts are
                 inherently spatially filtered, but substitutes
                 diffraction effects and depth of focus limitations in
                 its stead.",

                 described, in which ocean waves and islands are
                 rendered by different but related algorithms. The
                 algorithms are based on analytic formulas involving
                 arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and
                 square roots, and are organized for a vectorizing
                 compiler on a Cray 1, a ``supercomputer'' with a vector
                 pipeline architecture. Height field methods are used,

                 rays to the ocean, where they are reflected.

                 technique of accessing and organizing information via
                 its graphical representation in an organized spatial
                 framework. We describe an operational prototype system
                 that exceeds the capabilities of other spatial data
                 management systems in two ways: (1) the graphical
                 presentation of data is tailored to the user's
                 identity, task, and database query; and (2) the system
                 has the capacity for large databases. These
                 capabilities are possible because the system
                 dynamically generates its graphics environment. Our
                 technique for dynamically generating the graphics
                 environment relies on modeling of user context,
                 semantic modeling of the underlying database, and
                 direct use of knowledge about design layout and the
                 utility of pictures. We briefly describe our current
                 research efforts to extend this knowledge-based

                 describes an algorithm that uses ray tracing techniques

                 intersection algorithm is developed which uses ideas

                 for finding the intersection of a ray and a patch
                 without subdivision. The algorithm may use complex
                 coordinates for the ($u$,$v$)-parameters of the
                 patches. The choice of these coordinates makes the
                 computations more uniform, so that there are fewer
                 special cases to be considered. In particular, the
                 appearance and disappearance of silhouette edges can be
                 handled quite naturally. The uniformity of these
                 techniques may be suitable for implementation on either

                 present new algorithms for efficient ray tracing of
                 three procedurally defined objects: fractal surfaces,
                 prisms, and surfaces of revolution. The fractal surface
                 algorithm performs recursive subdivision adaptively.
                 Subsurfaces which cannot intersect a given ray are
                 culled from further consideration. The prism algorithm
                 transforms the three-dimensional ray-surface
                 intersection problem into a two-dimensional ray-curve
                 intersection problem, which is solved by the method of
                 strip trees. The surface-of-revolution algorithm
                 transforms the three-dimensional ray-surface
                 intersection problem into a two-dimensional curve-curve
                 intersection problem, which again is solved by strip
                 trees. \\ Kajiya presents good solid methods for ray

                 to ray trace surfaces of revolution. Makes good use of

                 debugging, monitoring and documenting programs. Incense

                 in actual programs. The desired displays can be
                 specified by the programmer or a default can be used.
                 The default displays provided by Incense present the
                 standard form for literals of the basic types, the
                 actual names for scalar types, stacked boxes for
                 records and arrays, and curved lines with arrowheads
                 for pointers. In addition to displaying data
                 structures, Incense also allows the user to select,
                 move, erase and redimension the resulting displays.

                 these mechanisms are a referential framework for

                 object descriptions and a computational model of the

                 object descriptions in near-real time. One system
                 creates graphical displays of information that resides

                 Heckbert and Hanrahan present an elegant image space
                 algorithm for rendering objects composed of polygonal
                 facets. It utilizes image coherence and generates a
                 final picture consisting of polygons. \\ Ray tracing
                 has produced some of the most realistic computer
                 generated pictures to date. They contain surface
                 texturing, local shading, shadows, reflections, and
                 refractions. The major disadvantage of ray tracing
                 results from its point-sampling approach. Because
                 calculation proceeds {\em ab initio} at each pixel it
                 is very CPU intensive and may contain noticeable
                 aliasing artifacts. It is difficult to take advantage
                 of spatial coherence because the shapes of reflections
                 and refractions from curved surfaces are so complex.
                 \\
                 In this paper we describe an algorithm that utilizes
                 the spatial coherence of polygonal environments by
                 combining features of both image and object space
                 hidden surface algorithms. Instead of tracing
                 infinitesimally thin rays of light, we sweep areas
                 through a scene to form ``beams.'' This technique works
                 particularly well for polygonal models since for this
                 case the reflections are linear transformation, and
                 refractions are often approximately so. \\ The
                 recursive beam tracer begins by sweeping the projection
                 plane through the scene. Beam-surface intersections are
                 computed using two-dimensional polygonal set operations
                 and an occlusion algorithm similar to the
                 Weiler-Atherton hidden surface algorithm. For each
                 beam-polygon intersection the beam is fragmented and
                 new beams created for the reflected and transmitted
                 swath of light. These sub-beams are redirected with a
                 4x4 matrix transformation and recursively traced. This
                 beam tree is an object space representation of the
                 entire picture.",

                 array of processors, they divide space into blocks and
                 assign processors to these blocks. They use message
                 passing between processors to move boundaries when a
                 processor is overloaded. An interesting feature is that
                 when the system is overloaded, rays get dropped, so
                 image quality is reduced. The system has some fault
                 tolerance built in. \\ An algorithm for computing ray

                 touch-sensitive input devices. The technology level
                 described in the paper has probably advanced
                 considerably since 1985, though. Main advantages noted:
                 * No mechanical intermediate device (direct hand
                 contact) * the tracking symbol ``stays put'' once
                 placed --- you don't have to worry about ``bumping the
                 mouse'' * No mechanical / kinesthetic restrictions on
                 the ability to indicate more than one point at once. *
                 Low profile, allowing easy integration into desktops /
                 other equipment * one piece construction --- dirt
                 doesn't get in the cracks * no moving parts ---
                 reliable Perhaps the biggest combined plus is that they
                 can save screen real estate, and in combination with a
                 physical template, can be operated by the user while
                 attention is focused on the screen. One general comment
                 is that it is preferable to implement valuators that
                 sense *change* in position as opposed to *absolute*
                 position. The chief difficulty is probably that there
                 is no direct physical or visual feedback (e.g., when
                 positioning a valuator) provided by the tablet

                 general, and extend the set of ``ray-traceable''
                 surfaces suitable for use in geometric modeling. We
                 intersect a ray \underline{$l$} = \underline{$a$}$t$ +
                 \underline{$b$}, $t > 0$ with a parametric surface
                 \underline{$x$} = \underline{$f$}$(u,v)$, and with
                 implicit surfaces $f(x,y,z) = 0$. A smooth surface is
                 treated as a deformation of a flat sheet; the
                 intersection problem is converted to a new coordinate
                 system in which the surfaces are flat, and the rays are
                 bent. We develop methods for providing good initial
                 estimates of the parametric intersection values, and a
                 ``closeness criterion,'' to reduce computation. These
                 same criteria help substitute a set of simpler surfaces
                 for the more complex surface. The parametric method
                 produces the intersection values of $u, v,$ and $t$.
                 These are suitable for shading calculations and for
                 mapping textures onto the surface; they can also
                 produce the local coordinate frame values, suitable for
                 anisotropic lighting models.",

                 introduced for faster image synthesis with more
                 physical fidelity. The paraxial approximation theory
                 for efficiently tracing a pencil of rays is described
                 and analysis of its errors is conducted to insure the
                 accuracy required for pencil tracing. The paraxial
                 approximation is formulated from a 4x4 matrix (a system
                 matrix) that provides the basis for pencil tracing and
                 a variety of ray tracing techniques, such as beam
                 tracing, ray tracing with cones, ray-object
                 intersection tolerance, and a lighting model for
                 reflection and refraction. In the error analysis,
                 functions that estimate approximation errors and
                 determine a constraint on the spread angle of a pencil
                 are given. \\ The theory results in the following fast
                 ray tracing algorithms; ray tracing using a system
                 matrix, ray interpolation, and extended `beam tracing'
                 using a `generalized perspective transform.' Some
                 experiments are described to show their advantages. A
                 lighting model is also developed to calculate the

                 calculations by means of 5-dimensional space
                 subdivision. Collections of rays originating from a
                 common $3$D rectangular volume and directed through a
                 $2$D solid angle are represented as hypercubes in
                 5-space. A 5D volume bounding the space of rays is
                 dynamically subdivided into hypercubes, each linked to
                 a set of objects which are candidates for intersection.
                 Rays are classified into unique hypercubes and checked
                 for intersection with the associated candidate object
                 set. We compare several techniques for object extent
                 testing, including boxes, spheres, plane-sets, and
                 convex poyhedra. In addition, we examine optimizations

                 culling. Results indicate that this algorithm

                 Parametric and implicit surfaces, and boolean
                 combinations of these, are first tessellated into
                 triangles. The resulting triangles from many such
                 surfaces are organized into a hierarchy of lists and
                 $3$D grids, allowing efficient calculation of ray/model
                 intersections. \\ The technique has been used to ray
                 trace models containing billions of triangles and
                 surfaces never before traced. The organizing scheme
                 developed is also independently useful for efficiently

                 techniques, represented by radiosity and ray tracing,
                 respectively, are discussed. View-dependent techniques
                 are found to have disadvantages for calculating the
                 specular component of illumination and view-independent
                 techniques for the diffuse component. Based on these
                 observations a methodology is presented for simulating
                 global illumination within complex environments using a
                 two-pass approach. The first pass is view-independent
                 and is based on the hemi-cube radiosity algorithm, with
                 extensions to include the diffuse reflection and
                 transmission. The second pass is view-dependent and is
                 based on an alternative to distributed ray tracing in
                 which a z-buffer algorithm is used to sample
                 intensities contributing to the specularly reflected or
                 transmitted intensity.",

                 technique computes the indirect contributions to
                 illuminance at locations chosen by the rendering
                 process. The indirect illuminance values are averaged
                 over surfaces and used in place of a constant
                 ``ambient'' term. Illuminance calculations are made
                 only for those areas participating in the selected
                 view, and the results are stored so that subsequent
                 views can reuse common values. The density of the
                 calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant
                 accuracy, permitting less populated portions of the
                 scene to be computed quickly. Successive reflections
                 use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the
                 process and provides a natural limit to recursion. The
                 technique can also diffuse transmission and

                 and z rotations. 2. Overlapping sliders: Uses
                 vertical/horizontal mouse movement to control x and y
                 rotations, while circular movement means z rotation. 3.
                 Continuous XY + Z: 4. Virtual Sphere: Chen's user study
                 indicated that the Virtual Sphere technique achieved
                 the best results. He also compared the Virtual Sphere
                 with a similar technique developed by Evans et al.
                 [Evans 81]; no significant difference was found in mean
                 time to complete simple or complex rotations, but users
                 preferred the Virtual Sphere controller. The paper

  annote =       "info on efficiently ray tracing height fields \\ In
                 standard fractal terrain models based on fractional
                 Brownian motion the statistical character of the
                 surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new
                 approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height
                 fields is presented which, in contrast to previous
                 techniques, features locally independent control of the
                 frequencies composing the surface, and thus local
                 control of fractal dimension and other statistical
                 characteristics. The new technique, termed {\em noise
                 synthesis}, is intermediate in difficulty of
                 implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision
                 and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic
                 subdivision, and does not suffer the drawbacks of
                 creases or periodicity. Varying the local crossover
                 scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension
                 with altitude or other functions yields more realistic
                 first approximations to eroded landscapes. A simple
                 physical erosion model is then suggested which
                 simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to
                 create global stream/valley networks and talus slopes.
                 Finally, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for general
                 height fields, of which most fractal terrains are a
                 subset, is presented.",

                 spatial and temporal data describing the acoustical
                 behavior of performance halls, but typically the
                 analytical results are difficult to assimilate and
                 compare. By using computer graphics to display the
                 multi-dimensional data, substantially greater amounts
                 of information than that conveyed by standard
                 techniques can be communicated to the designer. This
                 allows designs of different acoustical spaces to be
                 tested, evaluated, and compared. \\ An example
                 comparing the acoustical behavior of three different
                 concert halls demonstrates these techniques and allows
                 for the simultaneous assimilation of much of the
                 information necessary to evaluate the acoustical nature
                 of a space. The use of three-dimensional images, color,
                 animation and abstract representation allows for the
                 comprehension of the complex results of a scientific
                 simulation. Specifically, the simultaneous display of
                 particular icons familiar to the discipline enabled the
                 simultaneous presentation of up to twelve parameters.
                 \\ From a more general point of view, the procedures
                 demonstrate how computer graphics can be utilized for
                 the portrayal of multi-dimensional time dependent data.
                 The visualization techniques are potentially useful for
                 the display of three-dimensional vector fields in many
                 scientific and design applications.",

                 algorithm \\ We model phenomena intermediate between
                 shape and texture by using space-filling applicative
                 functions to modulate density. The model is essentially
                 an extension of procedural solid texture synthesis, but
                 evaluated throughout a volumetric region instead of
                 only at surfaces. \\ We have been able to obtain
                 visually realistic representations of such
                 shape+texture ({\em hypertexture}) phenomena as hair,
                 fur, fire, glass, fluid flow and erosion effects. We
                 show how this is done, first by describing a set of
                 base level functions to provide basic texture and
                 control capabilities, then by combining these to
                 synthesize various phenomena. \\ Hypertexture exists
                 within an intermediate region between object and
                 non-object. We introduce a notion of {\em generalized
                 boolean shape operators} to combine shapes having such
                 a region. \\ Rendering is accomplished by {\em ray
                 marching} from the eye point through the volume to
                 accumulate opacity along each ray. We have implemented
                 our hypertexture rendering algorithms on a traditional
                 serial computer, a distributed network of computers and
                 a coarse-grain MIMD computer. Extensions to the
                 rendering technique incorporating refraction and

                 the samples by ray tracing, and image reconstruction
                 from the samples. Adaptive control of the sample

                 level'' resolution. \\ A three-stage process of
                 interpolating, filtering, and resampling is used to
                 reconstruct a regular grid of display pixels. This

                 implicit surfaces. The algorithm is guaranteed to
                 numerically find the nearest intersection of the
                 surface with a ray, and is guaranteed not to miss fine
                 features of the surface. It does not require fine
                 tuning or human choice of interactive parameters.
                 Instead, it requires two upper bounds: ``L'' that
                 limits the net rate of change of the implicit surface
                 function $f(x,y,z)$ and ``G'' that limits the rate of
                 change of the gradient. An implicit surface with these
                 rate limits is referred to as an ``LG-implicit

                 an implicit surface have typically been guaranteed to

                 The construction and refinement of a computer graphics
                 scene is unacceptably slow when using ray tracing. We
                 introduce a new technique to speed up the generation of
                 successive ray traced images when the geometry of the
                 scene remains constant and only the light source
                 intensities and the surface properties need to be
                 adjusted. When the scene is first traced, an expression
                 parameterized in the color of all lights and the
                 surface property coefficients of all objects is
                 calculated and stored for each pixel. Redisplaying a
                 scene with a new set of lights and colors then consists
                 of substituting values for the corresponding parameters
                 and re-evaluating the expressions for the pixels. This
                 parameter updating and redisplay takes only a few
                 seconds, as compared to the many minutes or hours
                 required to ray trace the entire scene again, but it
                 uses much more memory and disk space. With suitable
                 expression sharing, however, these storage needs can be
                 reduced to an acceptable level.",

                 presented. Previously, the progressive radiosity
                 approach has depended on the use of the hemi-cube

                 is described in which ray tracing is used to perform
                 the numerical integration of the form-factor equation.
                 The approach is tailored to provide good, approximate
                 results for a low number of rays, while still providing
                 a smooth continuum of increasing accuracy for higher

                 {\em reflection operators}, and we demonstrate the
                 advantages of a two-pass method. A generalization of
                 this system introduced by Wallace {\em et al}.\ at
                 Siggraph '87 to integrate diffuse as well as specular
                 reflection is presented. It is based on the calculation
                 of {\em extended form-factors}, which allows arbitrary
                 geometries to be used in the scene description, as well
                 as refraction effects. We also present a new sampling
                 method for the calculation of form-factors, which is an
                 alternative to the {\em hemi-cube} technique introduced
                 by Cohen and Greenberg for radiosity calculations. This
                 method is particularly well suited to the extended
                 form-factors calculation. The problem of interactive
                 display of the picture being created is also addressed
                 by using hardware-assisted projections and image

                 in perspective view. A ``jack'' is used for visual
                 feedback of the kite (Polhemus tracker) position (in 6
                 DoF). The keyboard is used for approval, mode change,
                 menus, and vernier motion. The Glove/kite is used for
                 orientation and pick/valuator input. The kite can also
                 be used separately from the glove. Some glove gestures
                 can be used as commands. A mouse is used for menu
                 control and $3$D input (as a triad mouse). The mouse
                 and glove can be used in combination (the mouse rotates
                 the world while the glove moves an object). User
                 controlled gravity facilitates selection of a point or

                 previous paper.] \\ In this paper, we report a scanline
                 based {\em REST-frame} rendering method that provides a
                 faster alternative to the original ray-tracing based
                 {\em REST-frame} implementation. This new method
                 operates in the spirit of the classical Z-buffer in
                 computer graphics and the inter-inertial frames
                 point-mapping method investigated in physics in the
                 early 1960's, and determines the visibility of points
                 in spacetime by their spatial {\em and} temporal
                 visibility. Specifically, all spacetime event points
                 that are {\em potentially} visible from the viewpoint
                 at the imaging time are geometrically projected in
                 three dimensional ($3$D) space to the image plane pixel
                 buffer. Multiple points with a same pixel affiliation
                 are sorted by their {\em time distance} from the
                 imaging time, and the most recent spacetime points is
                 displayed. \\ Motion blur in real world images caused
                 by the noRfinitesimal exposure time of image-taking can
                 be simulated by {\em ``Stochastic T-Buffer''}, which
                 perturbs the {\em time component} of the scan-converted
                 spacetime events that are potentially visible. The
                 classical A-Buffer technique that models translucency
                 also can be adapted easily in T-Buffer. The limitation
                 of T-Buffer is its inability to model specular
                 reflection and refraction in optics, which our original
                 {\em REST-frame} implementation simulates completely.",

                 Boltzmann equation which has been widely studied in
                 physics and nuclear engineering. Consequently, many of
                 the powerful techniques which have been developed in
                 these fields can be applied to problems in image
                 synthesis. In this paper we adapt several statistical
                 techniques commonly used in neutron transport to
                 stachastic ray tracing and, more generally, to Monte
                 Carlo solution of the rendering equation. First, we
                 describe a technique known as {\em Russian roulette}
                 which can be used to terminate the recursive tracing of
                 rays without introducing statistical bias. We also
                 examine the practice of creating ray trees in classical
                 ray tracing in the light of a well-known technique in
                 particle transport known as {\em splitting}. We show
                 that neither ray trees nor paths as described in
                 [Kaj86] constitute an optimal sampling plan in
                 themselves and that a hybrid may be more efficient.",

                 interaction into diffuse plus specular, we compute the
                 specular component on the fly, as in ray tracing, and
                 store the diffuse component (the radiosity) for
                 later-reuse, similar to a radiosity algorithm.
                 Radiosities are stored in {\em adaptive radiosity
                 textures (rexes)} that record the pattern of light and
                 shadow on every diffuse surface in the scene. They
                 adaptively subdivide themselves to the appropriate
                 level of detail for the picture being made, resolving
                 sharp shadow edges automatically. \\ We use a
                 three-pass, bidirectional ray tracing algorithm that
                 traces rays from both the lights and the eye. The
                 ``size pass'' records visibility information on diffuse
                 surfaces; the ``light pass'' progressively traces rays
                 from lights and bright surfaces to deposit photons on
                 diffuse surfaces to construct the radiosity textures;
                 and the ``eye pass'' traces rays from the eye,
                 collecting light from diffuse surfaces to make a

                 joint'') displays for molecular docking. Interesting as
                 an example of how to develop a system for real users.
                 Haptic displays are of limited application, but when
                 they are applicable, a performance increase of
                 approximately 2x is measured over pure visual stimuli.
                 Some interesting results on $3$D/6D manipulation: *
                 Users of an imperfect-perception visual system tend to
                 decompose three-dimensional positioning tasks into
                 several separate subtasks, each of lower dimensionality
                 * Even in real space, subjects usually decompose 6D
                 docking tasks into $3$D positionings alternating with
                 $3$D rotations. More than $2$D motions are rarely

                 shadowing and light scattering, are both rendered and

                 visualization to CAD. A technique of representing this
                 kind of data, the Sticks representation scheme, is
                 proposed here with the aim of allowing an efficient
                 representation and rendering of voxel data on
                 low-capability workstations. This data model is based
                 on a $3$D extension of the well-known run-length
                 encoding methods. It requires $O(kn^{2})$ memory cells
                 to represent $O(n^{3})$ volumetric data and produces a
                 degree of data compression greater than that of the
                 octree model. Rendering a frontal orthographic
                 projection of a Sticks-represented volume is a very
                 simple task and requires only a partial scan of the
                 data. A ray tracing algorithm is presented for the
                 synthesis of gradient-shaded parallel projections; the
                 proposed algorithm exploits the data compression to
                 drastically reduce the complexity of rendering.",

                 feasible in rendering volume data. First, a method is
                 presented for efficient slice-by-slice processing of
                 volume data, allowing high resolution data sets by
                 eliminating typical memory constraints. Second, an
                 adaptive ``ray splitting'' approach is described which
                 ensures that the entire volume is sampled within
                 user-specified limits. Additionally, we present results
                 using distributed ray tracing to achieve depth of field
                 effects.",

                 and set designs in the preliminary planning phase. New
                 computer graphics techniques, which provide the set and
                 lighting designer the opportunity to evaluate, test,
                 and control opera designs prior to the construction of
                 full scale systems are presented. These techniques -
                 light source input, simulation of directional lighting,
                 modeling of scenic projection systems, and full
                 three-dimensional simulation --- show the potential for
                 the use of computer graphics in theater design. \\ The
                 light source input component consists of a program for
                 assigning light source attributes with a set of theater
                 lighting icons. This module allows a designer to
                 specify light source characteristics in a way familiar
                 to the discipline and to make preliminary evaluations
                 of the lighting conditions. \\ An extended progressive
                 radiosity method is introduced to simulate the
                 directional lighting characteristics which are
                 specified by the input program. \\ A new projection
                 approach is presented to simulate the optical effects
                 of scenic projectors. In addition, a solution to the
                 distortion problem produced by angular projections is
                 described. \\ The above components are integrated to
                 produce full three-dimensional simulations of the

                 environments is user-intensive and requires significant
                 knowledge of the method. As a result, few end-users
                 such as architects and designers use it. The output of
                 most commercial modeling packages must be substantially
                 ``cleaned-up'' to satisfy the geometrical and
                 topological criteria imposed by radiosity solution
                 algorithms. Furthermore, the mesh used as the basis of
                 the radiosity computation must meet several additional
                 requirements for the solution to be accurate. \\ A set
                 of geometrical and topological requirements is
                 formalized that when satisfied yields an accurate
                 radiosity solution. A series of algorithms is
                 introduced that automatically processes raw model
                 databases to meet these requirements. Thus, the
                 end-user can concentrate on the design rather than on
                 the details of the radiosity solution process. These
                 algorithms are generally independent of the radiosity
                 solution technique used, and thus apply to all mesh

                 architectural models is many more than can be rendered
                 at interactive frame rates. However, due to occlusion
                 by opaque surfaces (e.g. walls), only a small fraction
                 of a typical model is visible from most viewpoints. \\
                 We describe a method of visibility preprocessing that
                 is efficient and effective for axis-aligned or axial
                 architectural models. A model is subdivided into
                 rectangular cells whose boundaries coincide with major
                 opaque surfaces. Non-opaque portals identified on cell
                 boundaries, and used to form an adjacency graph
                 connecting the cells of the subdivision. Next, the
                 cell-to-cell visibility is computed for each cell of
                 the subdivision, by linking pairs of cells between
                 which unobstructed sightlines exist. \\ During an
                 interactive walkthrough phase, an observer with a known
                 position and view cone moves through the model. At each
                 frame, the cell containing the observer is identified,
                 and the contents of potentially visible cells are
                 retrieved from storage. The set of potentially visible
                 cells is further reduced by culling it against the
                 observer's view cone, producing the eye-to-cell
                 visibility. The contents of the remaining visible cells
                 are then sent to a graphics pipeline for hidden-surface
                 removal and rendering. \\ Tests on moderately complex
                 2-D and 3-D axial models reveal substantially reduced

                 models and the associated need to find ways of reducing
                 evaluation time has led to the use of two methods for
                 simplifying the spectral data needed for an exact
                 solution. The first method, where spectral data is
                 sampled at a number of discrete points, has been
                 intensively investigated and bounds for the error are
                 known. Unfortunately, the second method, where spectral
                 data is replaced with tristimulus values (such as RGB
                 values), is very little understood even though it is
                 widely used. In this paper we examine the error
                 incurred by the use of this method by investigating the
                 problem of approximating the tristimulus coordinated of
                 light reflected from a surface from those of the source
                 and the surface. A variation on a well known and widely
                 used approximation is presented. This variation uses
                 the XYZ primaries which have unique properties that
                 yield straightforward analytical bounds for the
                 approximation error. This analysis is important because
                 it gives a sound mathematical footing to the widely
                 used method of trichromatic approximation. The error
                 bounds will give some insights into the factors that
                 affect accuracy and will indicate why this method often
                 works quite well in practice.",

                 statistically biased. This bias is dependent upon the
                 image function being sampled as well as the strategy

                 aliasing noise are clearly visible. At supersampling

                 accurate images. The method combines the existing

                 Carlo path tracing and light ray tracing. The method
                 does not place any limitation on surface properties

                 Carlo path tracing with a radiosity preprocess and an
                 interruptible radiosity solution are introduced. The

                 diffuse reflection by a surface. The reflected light

                 algorithm for illuminating scenes containing large
                 polygonal patches. The algorithm constructs a
                 hierarchical representation of the form factor matrix
                 by adaptively subdividing patches into subpatches
                 according to a user-supplied error bound. The algorithm
                 guarantees that all form factors are calculated to the
                 same precision, removing many common image artifacts
                 due to in accurate form factors. More importantly, the
                 algorithm decomposes the form factor matrix into at
                 most O(n) blocks (where n is the number of elements).
                 Previous radiosity algorithms represented the
                 element-to-element transport interactions with n2 form
                 factors. Visibility algorithms are given that work well
                 with this approach. Standard techniques for shooting
                 and gathering can be used with the hierarchical
                 representation to solve for equilibrium radiosities,
                 but we also discuss using a brightness-weighted error
                 criteria, in conjunction with multigridding, to even
                 more rapidly progressively refine the image.",

                 algorithms solve the collision detection problem for

                 which the visible details are not much smaller than the

                 such that it achieves given tasks (e.g., throwing a
                 ball into a basket) and performs the tasks in a
                 realistic fashion (e.g., gracefully, and following
                 physical laws such as gravity) has been an elusive goal
                 for computer animators. The {\em spacetime
                 constraints\/} paradigm has been shown to be a valuable
                 approach to this problem, but it suffers from
                 computational complexity growth as creatures and tasks
                 approach those one would like to animate. The
                 complexity is shown to be, in part, due to the choice
                 of finite basis with which to represent the
                 trajectories of the generalized degrees of freedom.
                 This paper describes new features to the spacetime

                 minimizing the number of discrete variables. In
                 addition the wavelet basis is shown to lead to better

                 natural ecosystems with minimal input from the
                 animator. The realistic appearance, movement, and

                 animal holistically as an autonomous agent situated in
                 its physical world. To demonstrate the approach, we

                 incorporation of texture maps into a hierarchical
                 Galerkin radiosity algorithm. This extension of the
                 standard algorithm allows the use of textures to
                 describe complex reflectance and emittance patterns
                 over surfaces, increasing the realism and complexity of
                 radiosity images. Previous approaches to the inclusion
                 of textures have either averaged the texture to yield a
                 single color for the radiosity computations, or
                 exhaustively generated detail elements---possibly as
                 many as one per texture pixel. The former does not
                 capture important lighting effects due to textures,
                 while the latter is too expensive computationally to be
                 practical. To handle texture maps requires a detailed
                 analysis of the underlying operator equation. In
                 particular we decompose the radiosity equation into two
                 steps: (i) the computation of irradiance on a surface
                 from the radiosities on other surfaces, and (ii) the
                 application of the reflectance operator [rho] to
                 compute radiosities from irradiances. We then describe
                 an algorithm that maintains hierarchical
                 representations of both radiosities and textures. The
                 numerical error involved in using these approximations
                 is quantifiable and a time/error tradeoff is possible.
                 The resulting algorithm allows texture maps to be used
                 in radiosity computations with very little overhead.",

                 rendering with an algorithm that guarantees that each
                 pixel of the output image is within a user-specified
                 error tolerance of the filtered underlying continuous
                 image. As before, we use an object-space octree to cull
                 hidden geometry rapidly. However, instead of using an
                 image-space depth pyramid to test visibility of
                 collections of pixel samples, we use a quadtree data
                 structure to test visibility throughout image-space
                 regions. When regions are too complex, we use quadtree
                 subdivision to simplify the geometry as in Warnock's

                 the convolution integral appropriately with interval

                 posteriori\/} bounds and estimates for local and total
                 errors in radiosity solutions. The ability to obtain
                 bounds and estimates for the total error is crucial fro
                 reliably judging the acceptability of a solution.
                 Realistic estimates of the local error improve the
                 efficiency of adaptive radiosity algorithms, such as
                 hierarchical radiosity, by indicating where adaptive
                 refinement is necessary. First, we describe a
                 hierarchical radiosity algorithm that computes
                 conservative lower and upper bounds on the exact
                 radiosity function, as well as on the approximate
                 solution. These bounds account for the propagation of
                 errors due to interreflections, and provide a
                 conservative upper bound on the error. We also describe
                 a non-conservative version of the same algorithm that
                 is capable of computing tighter bounds, from which more
                 realistic error estimates can be obtained. Finally, we
                 derive an expression for the effect of a particular
                 interaction on the total error. This yields a new
                 error-driven refinement strategy for hierarchical
                 radiosity, which is shown to be superior to
                 brightness-weighted refinement.",

                 distinct category. Errors arise from three sources:
                 inaccuracies in the boundary data, discretization, and
                 computation. Boundary data consists of surface
                 geometry, reflectance functions, and emission
                 functions, all of which may be perturbed by errors in
                 measurement or simulation, or by simplifications made
                 for computational efficiency. Discretization error is
                 introduced by replacing the continuous radiative
                 transfer equation with a finite-dimensional linear
                 system, usually by means of boundary elements and a
                 corresponding projection method. Finally, computational
                 errors perturb the finite-dimensional linear system

                 idealized $2$D deformation model defined by an

                 stroke replacement and efficiency for interactive use

                 stylish picture creation is illustrated with various

                 dither technique for digital halftoning. It is based on
                 the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer
                 dispersed-dot dither array. Discrete rotation has the
                 effect of rotating and splitting a significant part of
                 the frequency impulses present in Bayer's halftone
                 arrays into many low-amplitude distributed impulses.
                 The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither
                 method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts
                 than the horizontal and vertical components present in
                 most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges
                 produced by rotated dither, texture changes at
                 consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error
                 diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods,
                 thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its
                 semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated
                 dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone
                 reproduction behavior on printers having a significant
                 dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition
                 capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms.
                 Besides their use in black and white printing, rotated
                 dither halftoning techniques have also been

  abstract =     "Monte Carlo techniques for image synthesis are simple
                 and powerful, but they are prone to noise from
                 inadequate sampling. This paper describes a class of
                 non-linear filters that remove sampling noise in
                 synthetic images without removing salient features.
                 This is achieved by spreading real input sample values
                 into the output image via variable-width filter
                 kernels, rather than gathering samples into each output
                 pixel via a constant-width kernel. The technique is
                 nonlinear because kernel widths are based on sample
                 magnitudes, and this local redistribution of values
                 cannot generally be mapped to a linear function.
                 Nevertheless, the technique preserves energy because
                 the kernels are normalized, and all input samples have
                 the same average influence on the output. To
                 demonstrate its effectiveness, the new filtering method
                 is applied to two rendering techniques. The first is a
                 Monte Carlo path tracing technique with the conflicting
                 goals of keeping pixel variance below a specified limit
                 and finishing in a finite amount of time; this
                 application shows how the filter may be used to ``clean
                 up'' areas where it is not practical to sample
                 adequately. The second is a hybrid deterministic and
                 Monte Carlo ray-tracing program; this application shows
                 how the filter can be effective even when the pixel
                 variance is not known.",

                 spreadsheets. Cells in our spreadsheet contain
                 graphical objects such as images, volumes, or movies.
                 Cells may also contain widgets such as buttons,
                 sliders, or curve editors. Objects are displayed in
                 miniature inside each cell. Formulas for cells are
                 written in a general-purpose programming language (Tcl)
                 augmented with operators for array manipulation, image
                 processing, and rendering. Compared to flow chart
                 visualization systems, spreadsheets are more
                 expressive, morescalable, and easier to program.
                 Compared to conventional numerical spreadsheets,
                 spreadsheets for images pose several unique design
                 problems: larger formulas, longer computation times,
                 and more complicated intercelldependencies. In response
                 to these problems, we have extended the spreadsheet
                 paradigm in three ways: formulas can display their
                 results anywhere in the spreadsheet, cells can be
                 selectively disabled, and multiple cells can be edited
                 at once. We discuss these extensions and their
                 implications, and we also point out some unexpected
                 uses for our spreadsheets: as a visual database
                 browser, as a graphical user interface builder, as a

                 demands on computer graphics hardware, yet few graphics
                 systems are designed specifically for virtural reality.
                 An address recalculation pipeline is a graphics display
                 controller specifically designed for use with head
                 mounted virtual reality systems, it performs
                 orientation viewport mapping after rendering which
                 means the users head orientation does not need to be
                 known accurately until less than a microsecond before
                 the first pixel of an update frame is actually sent to
                 the head mounted display device. As a result the user
                 perceived latency to head rotations is minimal. Using
                 such a controller with image composition it is possible
                 to render different objects within the world at
                 different rate, thus it is possible to concentrate the
                 available rendering power on the sections of the scene
                 that change the most. The concentration of rendering
                 power is known as priority rendering. Reductions of one
                 order of magnitude in the number of objects rendered
                 for an entire scene have been observed when using
                 priority rendering. When non interactive background
                 scenes which are rendered with a high quality rendering
                 algorithm such as ray tracing are added to the world,

  abstract =     "The use of double-buffered displays, in which the
                 previous image is displayed until the next image is
                 complete, can impair the interactivity of systems that
                 require tight coupling between the human user and the
                 computer. We are experimenting with an alternate
                 rendering strategy that computes each pixel based on
                 the most recent input (i.e., view and object positions)
                 and immediately updates the pixel on the display. We
                 avoid the image tearing normally associated with
                 single-buffered displays by randomizing the order in
                 which pixels are updated. The resulting image sequences
                 give the impression of moving continuously, with a
                 rough approximation of motion blur, rather than jerking
                 between discrete positions. We have demonstrated the
                 effectiveness of this {\em frameless rendering\/}
                 method with a simulation that shows conventional
                 double-buffering side-by-side with frameless rendering.
                 Both methods are allowed the same computation budget,
                 but the double-buffered display only updates after all
                 pixels are computed while the frameless rendering
                 display updates pixels as they are computed. The
                 frameless rendering display exhibits fluid motion while
                 the double-buffered display jumps from frame to frame.
                 The randomized sampling inherent in frameless rendering
                 means that we cannot take advantage of image and object
                 coherence properties that are important to current
                 polygon renderers, but for renderers based on tracing
                 independent rays the added cost is small.",

                 outlines of moving, natural objects in a video-camera
                 input stream to be tracked live, at full video-rate.
                 Previous systems have been available to do this for
                 specially illuminated objects or for naturally
                 illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have
                 been able to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in
                 some cases from live video, but following only
                 centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole
                 curves. The system described here can track accurately
                 the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects
                 at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles,
                 fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a
                 desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore.
                 The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in
                 deformable models, B-splines curve representation and
                 control theory. This paper shows how such a facility
                 can be used to turn parts of the body---for instance,
                 hands and lips---into input devices. Rigid motion of a
                 hand can be used as a $3$D mouse with non-rigid
                 gestures signalling a button press or the ``lifting''
                 of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips
                 can be tracked independently and used as inputs, for
                 example to animate a computer-generated face.",

                 virtual $3$D objects on the real world. This technology
                 has the potential to enhance a user's perception and
                 interaction with the real world. However, many
                 Augmented Reality applications will not be accepted
                 until we can accurately register virtual objects with
                 their real counterparts. In previous systems, such
                 registration was achieved only from a limited range of
                 viewpoints, when the user kept his head still. This
                 paper offers improved registration in two areas. First,
                 our system demonstrates accurate static registration
                 across a wide variety of viewing angles and positions.
                 An optoelectronic tracker provides the required range
                 and accuracy. Three calibration steps determine the
                 viewing parameters. Second, dynamic errors that occur
                 when the user moves his head are reduced by predicting
                 future head locations. Inertial sensors mounted on the
                 HMD aid head-motion prediction. Accurate determination
                 of prediction distances requires low-overhead operating
                 systems and eliminating unpredictable sources of
                 latency. On average, prediction with inertial sensors
                 produces errors 2-3 times lower than prediction without
                 inertial sensors and 5-10 times lower than using no
                 prediction at all. Future steps that may further
                 improve registration are outlined.",

  abstract =     "Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in
                 computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering
                 techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For
                 several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model
                 can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the
                 body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian
                 surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a
                 rough surface increases as the viewing direction
                 approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a
                 comprehensive model is developed that predicts body
                 reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled
                 as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that
                 such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the
                 foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the
                 model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric
                 phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and
                 interreflections between facets. Several experiments
                 have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse
                 surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All
                 these surface demonstrate significant deviation from
                 Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements
                 obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance
                 predicted by the model.",

                 for digitizing the shape of three-dimensional objects.
                 Because most objects self occlude, no single range
                 image suffices to describe the entire object. We
                 present a method for combining a collection of range
                 images into a single polygonal mesh that completely
                 describes an object to the extent that it is visible
                 from the outside. The steps in our method are: (1)
                 align the meshes with each other using a modified
                 iterated closest-point algorithm, (2) zipper together
                 adjacent meshes to form a continuous surface that
                 correctly captures the topology of the object, and (3)
                 compute local weighted averages of surface positions on
                 all meshes to form a consensus surface geometry. Our
                 system differs from previous approaches in that it is
                 incremental; scans are acquired and combined one at a
                 time. This approach allows us to acquire and combine
                 large numbers of scans with minimal storage overhead.
                 Our largest models contain up to 360,000 triangles. All
                 the steps needed to digitize an object that requires up
                 to 10 range scans can be performed using our system
                 with five minutes of user interaction and a few hours
                 of compute time. We show two models created using our
                 method with range data from a commercial rangefinder

                 polyhedral source of uniform brightness is given by a
                 well-known analytic formula. In this paper we derive
                 the corresponding analytic expression for the {\em
                 irradiance Jacobian\/}, the derivative of the vector
                 representation of irradiance. Although the result is
                 elementary for unoccluded sources, within penumbrae the
                 irradiance Jacobian must incorporate more information
                 about blockers than either the irradiance or vector
                 irradiance. The expression presented here holds for any
                 number of polyhedral blockers and requires only a minor
                 extension of standard polygon clipping to evaluate. To
                 illustrate its use, three related applications are

                 iso-meshing. Isolux contours are curves of constant

                 a predictor-corrector method based on the irradiance

                 suspensions. For these effects, the intensity and
                 direction of incident light to particles plays an
                 important role, and it is difficult to calculate them
                 in conventional ray-tracing because light refracts when
                 passing through waves. Therefore, the pre-processing
                 tracing from light sources is necessary. The method
                 proposed here can effectively calculate optical
                 effects, shaft of light, caustics, and color of the
                 water without such pre-processing by using a scanline

                 IRIS Performer, a toolkit for visual simulation,
                 virtual reality, and other real-time $3$D graphics
                 applications. The principal design goal is to allow
                 application developers to more easily obtain maximal
                 performance from $3$D graphics workstations which
                 feature multiple CPUs and support an immediate-mode
                 rendering library. To this end, the toolkit combines a
                 low-level library for high-performance rendering with a
                 high-level library that implements pipelined, parallel
                 traversals of a hierarchical scene graph. While
                 discussing the toolkit architecture, the paper
                 illuminates and addresses performance issues
                 fundamental to immediate-mode graphics and
                 coarse-grained, pipelined multiprocessing. Graphics
                 optimizations focus on efficient data transfer to the
                 graphics subsystem, reduction of mode settings, and
                 restricting state inheritance. The toolkit's
                 multiprocessing features solve the problems of how to
                 partition work among multiple processes, how to
                 synchronize these processes, and how to manage data in
                 a pipelined, multiprocessing environment. The paper
                 also discusses support for intersection detection,
                 fixed-frame rates, run-time profiling and special
                 effects such as geometric morphing.",

                 radiosity by clustering objects. Previous approaches
                 constructed effective hierarchies by subdividing
                 surfaces, but could not exploit a hierarchical grouping
                 on existing surfaces. This limitation resulted in an
                 excessive number of initial links in complex
                 environments. Initial linking is potentially the most
                 expensive portion of hierarchical radiosity algorithms,
                 and constrains the complexity of the environments that
                 can be simulated. The clustering algorithm presented
                 here operates by estimating energy transfer between
                 collections of objects while maintaining reliable error
                 bounds on each transfer. Two methods of bounding the
                 transfers are employed with different tradeoffs between
                 accuracy and time. In contrast with the {\em O\/}({\em
                 s\/}2) time and space complexity of the initial linking
                 in previous hierarchical radiosity algorithms, the new

                 s\/}) and {\em O\/}({\em s\/}) for both time and space.
                 Using these methods we have obtained speedups of two

                 for polygonal environments much larger than can be
                 stored in main memory. The solution is stored in and
                 retrieved from a database as the computation proceeds.
                 Our system is based on two ideas: the use of visibility
                 oracles to find source and blocker surfaces potentially
                 visible to a receiving surface; and the use of
                 hierarchical techniques to represent interactions
                 between large surfaces efficiently, and to represent
                 the computed radiosity solution compactly. Visibility
                 information allows the environment to be {\em
                 partitioned\/} into subsets, each containing all the
                 information necessary to transfer light to a cluster of
                 receiving polygons. Since the largest subset needed for
                 any particular cluster is much smaller than the total
                 size of the environment, these subset computations can
                 be performed in much less memory than can classical or
                 hierarchical radiosity. The computation is then {\em
                 ordered\/} for further efficiency. Careful ordering of
                 energy transfers minimizes the number of database reads
                 and writes. We report results from large solutions of
                 unfurnished and furnished buildings, and show that our

                 an intermediate but distorted image, and a $2$D warp to
                 form an undistorted final image. We extend this class
                 of algorithms in three ways. First, we describe a new
                 object-order rendering algorithm based on the
                 factorization that is significantly faster than
                 published algorithms with minimal loss of image
                 quality. Shear-warp factorizations have the property
                 that rows of voxels in the volume are aligned with rows
                 of pixels in the intermediate image. We use this fact
                 to construct a scanline-based algorithm that traverses
                 the volume and the intermediate image in synchrony,
                 taking advantage of the spatial coherence present in
                 both. We use spatial data structures based on
                 run-length encoding for both the volume and the
                 intermediate image. Our implementation running on an
                 SGI Indigo workstation renders a 2563 voxel medical
                 data set in one second. Our second extension is a
                 shear-warp factorization for perspective viewing
                 transformations, and we show how our rendering
                 algorithm can support this extension. Third, we
                 introduce a data structure for encoding spatial
                 coherence in unclassified volumes (i.e. scalar fields
                 with no precomputed opacity). When combined with our
                 shear-warp rendering algorithm this data structure
                 allows us to classify and render a 2563 voxel volume in
                 three seconds. The method extends to support mixed
                 volumes and geometry and is parallelizable.",

                 system tailored to the demands of lighting design and
                 architecture. The simulation uses a light-backwards
                 ray-tracing method with extensions to efficiently solve
                 the rendering equation under most conditions. This
                 includes specular, diffuse and directional-diffuse
                 reflection and transmission in any combination to any
                 level in any environment, including complicated, curved
                 geometries. The simulation blends deterministic and
                 stochastic ray-tracing techniques to achieve the best
                 balance between speed and accuracy in its local and
                 global illumination methods. Some of the more
                 interesting techniques are outlined, with references to
                 more detailed descriptions elsewhere. Finally, examples

  abstract =     "Virtual Reality is a new and rapidly developing
                 technology. As a technological extension to computer
                 graphics, and in fact the computer in general, VR is a
                 medium --- a means of communication. Like any medium,
                 the use or `reading' of VR has to be learned. That is,
                 the user becomes literate with the medium. Often, we
                 tend to think of literacy in terms of whether one can
                 read or write words on a page. However, that is just
                 literacy of one medium (the written word). There are
                 many forms of communication, and each has specific
                 issues of literacy, as well as general issues that
                 pervade all media. As a new medium, the `language' of
                 VR is still in its infancy, therefore, the study of VR
                 literacy must look both at the content receiver and the
                 content creator. Like film, Virtual Reality is a medium
                 that does not require much knowledge of the viewer
                 beyond general life experiences. We are able to see and
                 hear the content more or less as we do in day to day
                 living. Because of this, it might be taken for granted
                 that the viewer is literate in the medium. This is not
                 necessarily so. He or she may be able to follow the
                 action, but may be missing the underlying message and
                 cues contained in the content. Much like learning to
                 read and write, gaining literacy in this new medium
                 requires effort on the part of the receiver. This paper
                 will address those issues with which VR participants
                 and developers must be concerned.",

                 building-blocks (widgets) provided in a user interface
                 toolkit. Templates specify how to break down complex

                 graphical components (widgets) to be used for
                 displaying each piece, and specify their layout.
                 Complex interfaces are constructed by recursively
                 applying templates, thus constructing a tree of widgets
                 to display a complex application object. The
                 template-based method is more general than the

                 specify dynamic displays for application data that

                 and encapsulated in the form of design rules. The basic
                 approach the authors take is embedding a top-down

                 organizing the information, selecting appropriate
                 interface object classes and their attributes, and
                 placing selected interface objects in a dialog box or a
                 menu in a meaningful, logical, and consistent manner.

                 been developed in attempts to provide the required
                 flexibility in applications: user interface management
                 systems (UIMS) and toolkits UIMS separate the
                 application and its interface. Back end computations
                 are separated from dialog control and style. Style,
                 however, is often treated in a single interface layer.
                 Toolkits separate style from the application. Dialog
                 control remains in the back end while the
                 implementation of interaction techniques is hidden in a
                 code library. ITS is a four layer architecture with
                 separate tools for back end computation, dialog
                 control, rule-based interface style, and the
                 implementation of graphic primitives used in the style.
                 Recent work has focused particularly on the rule layer.
                 The authors begin by reviewing previous work in UIMS
                 and toolkits. Then they show how the rule layer in ITS

                 and a semantically rich token language. The objects

                 primitive objects using token templates. The user
                 interface and application are controlled by token
                 streams that are emitted in response to user actions.

                 for computer applications. The core of each of these
                 design tools takes as input a specification of the
                 functionality and information that the application is
                 to present to the user and produces as output an
                 interface specified in terms of some toolkit of
                 interface techniques. Although there are a number of
                 sets of guidelines for effective interface designs,
                 they are all inadequate for a completely automated
                 interface design system. The most obvious inadequacy is
                 in the area of aesthetic decisions; most sets of
                 interface guidelines either lack guidelines for
                 determining the specific visual appearances and
                 organization of an interface, or else such guidelines
                 are too vague to be used automatically. Decisions about
                 what aspects of the application to emphasize and what
                 aspects to obscure are also poorly specified. Such
                 decisions are implicit in any interface design, but
                 guidelines for making them are vague at best, and often
                 absent altogether. The MAID system addresses some of

                 of the application tasks. Special emphasis is given to
                 the physical characteristics of input devices and the
                 pragmatics of their use. The methodology is
                 incorporated in a software environment named Toto which
                 includes knowledge acquired from a variety of
                 disciplines such as: semiotics, ergonomics, and
                 industrial design. Toto also incorporates a set of
                 interactive tools for modifying the knowledge and for
                 supporting the selection of natural interaction
                 techniques. A two phased design process (matching
                 followed by sequencing) is embedded in the Toto rule
                 base. Examples of the use of Toto tools are provided to
                 illustrate the design process. (17 Refs.)",
