		  described in the spi calculus and analysed with the
		  emerging flora of tools already available for $\pi$. The
		  translation also entails a more detailed operational
		  understanding of spi since high level constructs like
		  encryption are encoded in a well known lower level. The
		  formal correctness proof is nontrivial and interesting in
		  its own; so called context bisimulations and new techniques

  abstract	= {Starting from the seminal work of Volpano and Smith, there
		  has been growing evidence that type systems may be used to
		  enforce confidentiality of programs through
		  non-interference. However, most type systems operate on
		  high-level languages and calculi, and low-level languages
		  have not received much attention in studies of secure
		  information flow. Therefore, we introduce an information
		  flow type system for a low-level language featuring jumps
		  and calls, and show that the type system enforces
		  termination-insensitive non-interference.

		  Furthermore, information flow type systems for low-level
		  languages should appropriately relate to their counterparts
		  for high-level languages. Therefore, we introduce a
		  compiler from a high-level imperative programming language
		  to our low-level language, and show that the compiler
		  preserves information flow types.}

  abstract	= {Non-interference is a high-level security property that
		  guarantees the absence of illicit information leakages
		  through executing programs. More precisely,
		  non-interference for a program assumes a separation between
		  secret inputs and public inputs on the one hand, and secret
		  outputs and public outputs on the other hand, and requires
		  that the value of public outputs does not depend on the
		  value of secret inputs.

		  A common means to enforce non-interference is to use an
		  information flow type system. However, such type systems
		  are inherently imprecise, and reject many secure programs,
		  even for simple programming languages. The purpose of this
		  paper is to investigate logical formulations of
		  non-interference that allow a more precise analysis of
		  programs. It appears that such formulations are often sound
		  and complete, and also amenable to interactive or automated
		  verification techniques, such as theorem-proving or
		  model-checking.

		  We illustrate the applicability of our method in several
		  scenarii, including a simple imperative language, a
		  non-deterministic language, and finally a language with
		  shared mutable data structures.}

		  This is the first work, to our knowledge, that provides a

		  termination proofs use techniques from term rewriting
		  systems.

		  We show the usefulness of the type systems on some

		  functions, the protocol for encoding separate choice in
		  terms of parallel composition, a symbol table implemented
		  as a dynamic chain of cells. }

		  are one of the key problems of many communicating
		  applications, most process algebras fail to take this
		  aspect of mobile and concurrent systems into account. In
		  order to study this problem, we introduce the Controlled
		  pi-calculus, an extension of the pi-calculus with a notion
		  of recovery of unused resources with an explicit
		  (parametrized) garbage-collection and dead-process
		  elimination. We discuss the definition of
		  garbage-collection and dead-process elimination for
		  concurrent, communicating applications, and provide a
		  type-based technique for statically proving resource
		  bounds. Selected examples are presented and show the
		  potential of the Controlled pi-calculus.},
