  abstract = {{T}his study addresses the potential for and the quantification of dissolution of marine calcium carbonate ({C}a{CO}3) sediments occurring on century timescales in response to the invasion of anthropogenic {CO}2. {I}t presents results obtained with the global biogeochemical model {PISCES} interactively coupled to a global sediment model. {T}he latter represents the principal reactions involved in early diagenesis of biogenic opal, {C}a{CO}3, and organic matter. {T}he model reproduces observed distributions of core top {C}a{CO}3 content and bottom water carbonate chemistry ( e. g., [{CO}32-]). {S}tarting from the climatological state, a model experiment is carried out according to the standard {CMIP} scenario of atmospheric p{CO}(2) increasing at a rate of 1% per year from 286 to 1144 ppm over a 140 year time period. {T}he invasion of anthropogenic {CO}2 results in a strong decrease in bottom water [{CO}32-] reaching -100 mu {M} in areas of deep water formation in the {N}orth {A}tlantic and mode and intermediate water formation in the {S}outhern {H}emisphere. {T}he concomitant decrease in calcite saturation state of bottom waters drives the dissolution of {C}a{CO}3. {T}he absolute {C}a{CO}3 content averaged over the top first centimeter decreases by up to 6%, while the change in advection calculated at the base of the bioturbated layer (10 cm) is indicative of net erosion. {T}he predicted changes in bottom water chemistry are discussed in terms of their potential impact on benthic communities.},
