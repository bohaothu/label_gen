has been recognized as a task requiring great effort in a
variety of science and engineering fields. In particular, such
data usually places considerable demands on run-time memory
space. In this paper, we present an effective {3D} compression
scheme for interactive visualization of very large volume data,
that exploits the power of wavelet theory. In designing our
method, we have compromised between two important factors: high
compression ratio and fast run-time random access ability. Our
experimental results on the Visual Human data sets show that our
method achieves fairly good compression ratios. In addition, it
minimizes the overhead caused during run-time reconstruction of
voxel values. This {3D} compression scheme will be useful in
developing many interactive visualization systems for huge
volume data, especially when they are based on personal
computers or workstations with limited memory. },

airplanes rarely leave jet trails in the sky, and most runners

model of ground surfaces that can be deformed by the impact of
rigid body models of animated characters. To demonstrate the
algorithms, we show footprints made by a runner in sand, mud,
and snow as well as bicycle tire tracks, a bicycle crash, and a
falling runner. The shapes of the footprints in the three
surfaces are quite different, but the effects were controlled
through only five essentially independent parameters. To assess
the realism of the resulting motion, we compare the simulated
footprints to human footprints in sand. },

rendering three-dimensional objects using nonphotorealistic
cues, by applying Q-maps. Q-maps are three-dimensional textures
that make marks on objects, and thus provide visual cues for
shape, shade, and texture. Q-maps adapt to light intensity,
typically by making more marks in darker areas. Q-maps can
produce images with a very wide range of visual styles (e.g.
half tone shading, and pen-and-ink colour wash). The primary
contribution is that these styles reside in a single parametric
space. Importantly this space includes photorealism as a style,
which is therefore regarded as a special case of
nonphotorealistic image rendering in general. We illustrate our
explanation of Q-mapping using examples from scientific
visualisation and computer graphics - and provide a gallery of
images to show the versatility of the approach. },

Distribution Functions, a three point formulation of the

efficient. Aupperle et al. proposed a hierarchical three point
algorithm to compute global illumination in the presence of
glossy reflection. We present in this paper some improvements we

subdivision criterion, etc. Then we will show how our new method

polygonization technique for tessellating implicit surface
patches. An implicit surface patch is defined as an implicit
surface bounded by its intersections with a set of clipping
surfaces and which lies within an enclosing tetrahedron. To
obtain the polygonization of an implicit surface patch, the
tetrahedron containing the patch is adaptively subdivided into
smaller tetrahedra according to the criteria introduced in the
paper. The result is a set of tetrahedra each containing a facet
approximating the surface. The intersections between the facets
and the clipping surfaces are used to locate the surface patch
boundary. Ambiguous results in generating the facets for highly
curved surfaces or surfaces with singular points are also
addressed. The result of the polygonization is a set of
triangular facets that can be used for visualization and
numerical analysis. The proposed method is also suitable for
locating the intersection of two implicit surfaces. },

of multiple segment lines (i.e., lines with more than one

In software implementation for scan-conversion and antialiasing
of randomly generated lines, this method is on average more than
6 times faster than Gupta's antialiasing line algorithm.
Compared with other line scan-conversion methods, the method may
choose pixels which are not the closest to the line (i.e., error
pixels). Here the paper demonstrates that the visual effect is
acceptable in most applications with the error pixels. },

can be used to &quot;reverse&quot; a subdivision rule, how this reversal
is related to wavelets, how this relationship can provide a
multilevel representation, and how the
decomposition/reconstruction process can be carried out in
linear time and space through the use of a matrix
factorization.\\Some insights that this work brings forth are
that the inner product used in a multiresolution analysis
influences the support of a wavelet, that wavelets can be
constructed by straightforward matrix observations, and that
matrix partitioning and factorization can provide alternatives
to inverses or duals for building efficient decomposition and
reconstruction processes. We illustrate our findings using an
example curve, grey-scale image, and tensor-product surface. },

interaction. In this paper we discuss Metis, a toolkit we have
been developing based on such a software architecture, which can
be used for building interactive immersive virtual reality
systems with computationally intensive components. The Metis
toolkit defines an application programming interface on the
simulator side, which communicates via a network with a
standalone viewer program that handles all immersive display and
interactivity. Network bandwidth and interaction latency are
minimized, by use of a constraint network on the viewer side
that declaratively defines much of dynamic and interactive
behavior of the application. },

introduction of deformations based on space warping and Boolean

such systems. We propose a further enhancement which will extend
the range of models that can be easily and intuitively defined
with a skeletal implicit surface system. We describe a
hierarchical method which allows arbitrary compositions of
models that make use of blending, warping and Boolean
operations. We call this structure the BlobTree. Blending and
space warping are treated in the same way as union, difference

of the BlobTree is described along with two rendering
algorithms; a polygonizer and a ray tracer. We present some
examples of interesting models which can be made easily using

Texture direction and scale are adapted to the external

accuracy of tone reproduction are varied across the image using
the error diffusion process. We halftone images of {3D} scenes by
using the geometry, position, and illumination information to
control the halftoning texture. Thus, the texture provides

scene, independent of whatever discretisation, and discrete
mutual information as the complexity of a discretised scene.
Mutual information can be understood as the degree of
correlation or dependence between all the points or patches of a
scene. Thus, low complexity corresponds to low correlation and
vice versa. Experiments illustrating that the best mesh of a
given scene among a number of alternatives corresponds to the
one with the highest discrete mutual information, indicate the
feasibility of the approach. Unlike continuous mutual
information, which is very cheap to compute, the computation of
discrete mutual information can however be quite demanding. We
will develop cheap complexity measure estimates and derive
practical algorithms from this framework in future work. },

method to solve the rendering equation, using a stochastic
iterational scheme where the transport operator is selected
randomly in each iteration. The requirements of convergence are
given for the general case. To demonstrate the basic idea, a
very simple, continuous random transport operator is examined,
which gives back the light tracing algorithm incorporating
Russian roulette. Then, a new mixed continuous and
finite-element based iteration method is proposed, which uses
ray-bundles to transfer the radiance in a single random
direction. The resulting algorithm is fast, it provides initial
results in seconds and accurate solutions in minutes and does
not suffer from the error accumulation problem and the high
memory demand of other finite-element and hierarchical
approaches. },

methods is increasing, generating realistic models is now
becoming a limiting factor. In this paper we present a new
technique to enhance already existing geometry models of real
world objects with textures reconstructed from a sparse set of
unregistered still photographs. The aim of the proposed
technique is the generation of nearly photo-realistic models of
arbitrarily shaped objects with minimal effort. In our approach,
we require neither a prior calibration of the camera nor a high
precision of the user's interaction. Two main problems have to
be addressed of which the first is the recovery of the unknown
positions and parameters of the camera. An initial estimate of
the orientation is calculated from interactively selected point
correspondences. Subsequently, the unknown parameters are
accurately calculated by minimising a blend of objective
functions in a {3D-2D} projective registration approach. The key
point of the proposed method of registration is a novel
filtering approach which utilises the spatial information
provided by the geometry model. Second, the individual images
have to be combined yielding a set of consistent texture maps.
We present a robust method to recover the texture from the
photographs thereby preserving high spatial frequencies and
eliminating artifacts, particularly specular highlights. Parts
of the object not seen in any of the photographs are
interpolated in the textured model. Results are shown for three
complex example objects with different materials and numerous
self-occlusions. },

gestural interfaces is a common method for interacting with
virtual environments on a habitual and natural basis. The
motion-based gesture recognition presented here uses Fuzzy Logic

process. This new interaction paradigm greatly increases the
Virtual Table's suitability for design tasks. Traditional {CAD}

the use of augmented coordinates for inverse dynamics of closed

manipulation of complex assemblies while maintaining
kinematically admissible configurations though linkage and joint
limit constraints. Furthermore, design variables such as link
length can be treated as free variables and optimized to meet
design criteria such as assembly dexterity. Assemblies with
flexible bodies fit naturally within this framework. Thus, the
contribution of this paper is the advancement of techniques in
augmented coordinates for the kinematic and force feedback
interaction with virtual mechanical assembly design optimization

environments has addressed the development of new rendering
technologies or interaction techniques. As the technology
matures and becomes adopted in a wider range of applications,
there is, however, a need to better understand how this
technology can be accommodated in software engineering practice.
A particular challenge presented by virtual environments is the
complexity of the interaction that is supported, and sometimes
necessary, for a particular task. Methods such as finite-state
automata which are used to represent and design dialogue
components for more conventional interfaces, e.g. using direct
manipulation within a desktop model, do not seem to capture
adequately the style of interaction that is afforded by richer
input devices and graphical models. In this paper, we suggest
that virtual environments are, fundamentally, what are known as
&quot;hybrid&quot; systems. Building on this insight, we demonstrate how
techniques developed for modelling hybrid systems can be used to
represent and understand virtual interaction in a way that can
be used in the specification and design phases of software
development, and which have the potential to support prototyping
and analysis of virtual interfaces. },

auxiliary data structures. To perform interactive proximity

of spatial and temporal coherence. Based on the proposed
algorithms, we have developed a system called {IMMPACT} and used
it for interaction with a {CAD} model of a power plant consisting
of over 15 million triangles. We are able to perform a number of

cells. If the mesh is &quot;well-behaved&quot; (acyclic and convex), then
the {MPVO} method of Williams provides a very fast sorting
algorithm; however, this method only computes an approximate
ordering in general datasets, resulting in visual artifacts when
rendered. A recent method of Silva et al. removed the assumption
that the mesh is convex, by means of a sweep algorithm used in
conjunction with the {MPVO} method; their algorithm is
substantially faster than previous exact methods for general
meshes.\\In this paper we propose a new technique, which we call
BSP-XMPVO, which is based on a fast and simple way of using
binary space partitions on the boundary elements of the mesh to
augment the ordering produced by {MPVO}. Our results are shown to
be orders of magnitude better than previous exact methods of
