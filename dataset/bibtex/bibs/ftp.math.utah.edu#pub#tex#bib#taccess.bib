                 evaluation studies for systems that generate animations
                 of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, and
                 techniques for evaluating natural language generation
                 of written texts are not easily adapted to ASL. When
                 conducting user-based evaluations, several cultural and
                 linguistic characteristics of members of the American
                 Deaf community must be taken into account so as to
                 ensure the accuracy of evaluations involving these
                 users. This article describes an implementation and
                 user-based evaluation (by native ASL signers) of a
                 prototype ASL natural language generation system that
                 produces sentences containing classifier predicates,
                 which are frequent and complex spatial phenomena that
                 previous ASL generators have not produced. Native
                 signers preferred the system's output to Signed English
                 animations -- scoring it higher in grammaticality,
                 understandability, and naturalness of movement. They
                 were also more successful at a comprehension task after
                 viewing the system's classifier predicate animations.",

  abstract =     "Prior research shows that people with motor
                 impairments face considerable challenges when using
                 conventional mice and trackballs. One challenge is
                 positioning the mouse cursor within confined target
                 areas; another is executing a precise click without
                 slipping. These problems can make mouse pointing in
                 graphical user interfaces very difficult for some
                 people. This article explores goal crossing as an
                 alternative strategy for more accessible target
                 acquisition. In goal crossing, targets are boundaries
                 that are simply crossed by the mouse cursor. Thus, goal
                 crossing avoids the two aforementioned problems. To
                 date, however, researchers have not examined the
                 feasibility of goal crossing for people with motor
                 difficulties. We therefore present a study comparing
                 area pointing and goal crossing. Our performance
                 results indicate that although Fitts' throughput for
                 able-bodied users is higher for area pointing than for
                 goal crossing (4.72 vs. 3.61 bits/s), the opposite is
                 true for users with motor impairments (2.34 vs. 2.88
                 bits/s). However, error rates are higher for goal
                 crossing than for area pointing under a strict
                 definition of crossing errors (6.23\% vs. 1.94\%). We
                 also present path analyses and an examination of
                 submovement velocity, acceleration, and jerk (the
                 change in acceleration over time). These results show
                 marked differences between crossing and pointing and
                 almost categorically favor crossing. An important
                 finding is that crossing reduces jerk for both
                 participant groups, indicating more fluid, stable
                 motion. To help realize the potential of goal crossing
                 for computer access, we offer design concepts for
                 crossing widgets that address the occlusion problem,
                 which occurs when one crossing goal obscures another in
                 persistent mouse-cursor interfaces. This work provides
                 the motivation and initial steps for further
                 exploration of goal crossing on the desktop, and may
                 help researchers and designers to radically reshape
                 user interfaces to provide accessible goal crossing,
                 thereby lowering barriers to access.",

                 Our project used a streamlined process with three
                 phases: (1) a rapid participatory design and
                 development phase with two speech-language pathologists
                 acting as representative users, (2) an informal

                 computer application, as well as to compose messages to
                 be read out through speech synthesis. The system
                 consists of a virtual keyboard comprising a set of
                 keypads that allow for the entering of characters or
                 full words by a single-switch selection process. It
                 also includes a sophisticated word prediction component
                 which dynamically calculates the most appropriate words
                 for a given context. This component is auto-adaptive,
                 that is, it learns with every text the user enters. It
                 thus adapts its predictions to the user's language and
                 the current topic of communication as well. So far, the
                 system works for French, German and English. Earlier

  abstract =     "{\em Editors' comments:\/} ``Computers and People with
                 Disabilities'' is a reprint of an article originally
                 published in {\em Communications of the ACM\/} in 1992.
                 In this article, Glinert and York issued a
                 ``call-to-arms'' for research and development on
                 technologies for people with disabilities.
                 Specifically, they highlighted that human-computer
                 interfaces at the time generally failed to take into
                 account the needs of disabled users. Their challenge
                 was to change computing culture to address this need.
                 Their article remains timely today in its consideration
                 of government, industry, and private foundations
                 working with researchers to achieve accessible
                 technology. With the recent launch of {\em Transactions
                 on Accessible Computing}, this seems an appropriate
                 time to consider progress in the field since, as well
                 as current research trends.\par

                 The reprinting of this article is followed by four
                 commentaries by leaders in accessibility research. Each
                 was cited in the 1992 article and each now gives their
                 view on how the field has progressed since that time.
                 In their commentaries, some themes emerge and new
                 technologies are discussed. In short, their
                 commentaries point to both a great deal of progress and
                 a lack of progress. All four of the commentators note
                 areas where computing continues to present barriers
                 rather than assist users with
                 disabilities.\par

                 Alistair Edwards sets the stage with a look back at
                 interfaces and input technologies popular in 1992, with
                 attention paid to access problems related to graphical
                 user interfaces (GUIs) that have consumed much research
                 energy since 1992. Alan Newell highlights disability
                 concerns that were not given large research
                 consideration in 1992, but which have now become
                 significant due, in large part, to changes in global
                 demographics. Specifically, he brings visibility to
                 research on older adults and cognitively disabled
                 users.\par

                 A number of advances in technology and methodology
                 since 1992 are discussed by the commentators. The
                 ubiquity of computing and its critical adoption in the
                 world today are highlighted. The commentators reflect,
                 for example, on technologies produced by research for
                 disabled users that have now impacted mainstream
                 offerings on standards for accessibility that have
                 emerged worldwide and their impact and on assistive
                 technologies that have been developed. Critically, the
                 proliferation of the World Wide Web was not foreseen in
                 1992 and its use by people with disabilities is
                 discussed. Gregg Vanderheiden considers the opportunity
                 afforded by the Web to provide widespread availability
                 of accessible software.\par

                 Glinert and York discussed the need for design for
                 disability. While research relevant to users with
                 disabilities is gaining momentum, the commentators
                 indicate that users with disabilities still struggle
                 with much of today's IT. The commentators note current
                 trends toward designs that take into account disabled
                 users. Notably, Richard Ladner ends his commentary by
                 mentioning the issue of empowerment. Users with
                 disabilities have moved beyond simply needing the
                 protections of regulation that were emerging in 1992,
                 to being active participants in designing solutions to
                 allow full participation in the current social,
                 political, and economic environments.\par

                 Together, these articles provide a great deal of food
                 for thought on technology advances and new
                 considerations of accessible technology. Has the change
                 in computing culture envisioned by Glinert and York
                 taken hold?\par

                 and York [1992] article ``Computers and People with
                 Disabilities.'' Comparing the world of assistive
                 technology as it was in 1992 and as it now appears is
                 instructive in terms of the things which have changed
                 --- and those which have not. The technology has
                 certainly developed. This applies both to the
                 mainstream and to the assistive technology which aims
                 to make the mainstream accessible. So, in 1992, the GUI
                 was a threat to visually impaired computer users; now
                 there are powerful screen readers available. Yet what
                 does not appear to have changed much is the fact that
                 assistive technologies continue to lag behind the
                 mainstream, constantly having to ``catch up.'' Also,
                 while there has been some increase in awareness of the
                 need for accessibility, there is still scope for that

  abstract =     "Much has changed since 1992 when the original CACM
                 article by Ephraim Glinert and Bryant York was
                 published. In the early 1990's, accessibility was
                 mostly an add-on, with only Apple computers having
                 built-in access. Computers were playing an increasingly
                 important role in education and employment, but had not
                 yet completely integrated themselves into all aspects
                 of life as completely as they have today. The World
                 Wide Web as we know it had not yet been born. Today
                 there are accessibility features built directly into
                 every major operating system, and one OS even includes
                 a built-in screen reader. Assistive technologies are
                 more numerous and capable. And awareness of the
                 importance of access is much higher. However, some
                 things have not changed. Assistive technologies lag
                 behind mainstream technologies in both compatibility
                 and functionality. Effective assistive technologies are
                 often beyond the financial reach of those who need
                 them. Effective assistive technologies are not
                 available in many countries and many languages, even
                 though technology is reaching into education,
                 employment, and daily living of more countries and more
                 people in each country every year. In moving forward we
                 need to build on what we have achieved and explore new
                 concepts, such as a {\em common technical core,
                 ubiquitous accessibility, micro-assistive technology},
                 and {\em free public accessibility}. Cooperative and
                 collaborative approaches also need to be explored if we
                 are to have any hope of catching up and keeping up with
                 the ever-accelerating mainstream information and
                 communication technologies.",

                 dynamic information to blind or visually impaired users
                 through computers. This article examines the potential
                 of haptic and auditory trajectory playback as a method
                 of teaching shapes and gestures to visually impaired
                 people. Two studies are described which test the
                 success of teaching simple shapes. The first study
                 examines haptic trajectory playback alone, played
                 through a force-feedback device, and compares
                 performance of visually impaired users with sighted
                 users. It demonstrates that the task is significantly
                 harder for visually impaired users. The second study
                 builds on these results, combining force-feedback with
                 audio to teach visually impaired users to recreate
                 shapes. The results suggest that users performed
                 significantly better when presented with multimodal
                 haptic and audio playback of the shape, rather than
                 haptic only. Finally, an initial test of these ideas in

  abstract =     "For some people with motor disabilities and speech
                 disorders, the only way to communicate and to have some
                 control over their environment is through the use of a
                 controlled scanning system operated by a single switch.
                 The main problem with these systems is that the
                 communication process tends to be exceedingly slow,
                 since the system must scan through the available
                 choices one at a time until the desired message is
                 reached. One way of raising the speed of message
                 selection is to optimize the elementary scanning delay
                 in real time so that it allows the user to make
                 selections as quickly as possible without making too
                 many errors. With this objective in mind, this article
                 presents a method for optimizing the scanning delay,
                 which is based on an analysis of the data recorded in
                 ``log files'' while applying the EDiTH system [Digital
                 Teleaction Environment for People with Disabilities].
                 This analysis makes it possible to develop a
                 human-machine interaction model specific to the study,
                 and then to establish an adaptive algorithm for the
                 calculation of the scanning delay. The results obtained
                 with imposed scenarios and then in ecological
                 situations provides a confirmation that our algorithms
                 are effective in dynamically adapting a scan speed. The
                 main advantage offered by the procedure proposed is
                 that it works on timing information alone and thus does
                 not require any knowledge of the scanning device
                 itself. This allows it to work with any scanning
                 device.",

                 keystrokes required to form a message in a letter-based
                 AAC system. It has been questioned, however, whether
                 such savings translate into an enhanced communication
                 rate due to the additional overhead (e.g., shifting of
                 focus and repeated scanning of a prediction list)
                 required in using such a system. Our hypothesis is that
                 word prediction has high potential for enhancing AAC
                 communication rate, but the amount is dependent in a
                 complex way on the accuracy of the predictions. Due to
                 significant user interface variations in AAC systems
                 and the potential bias of prior word prediction
                 experience on existing devices, this hypothesis is

                 speed communication rate (an advanced system gave a
                 58.6\% improvement), and that a more accurate word
                 prediction system can raise the communication rate
                 higher than is explained by the additional accuracy of
                 the system alone due to better utilization (93.6\%

                 individuals still struggle with pen-based interaction.
                 In a previous baseline study, we examined the types of
                 difficulties younger and older adults encounter when
                 using pen-based input. The research reported in this
                 article seeks to address one of these errors, namely,
                 missing just below. This error occurs in a menu
                 selection task when a user's selection pattern is
                 downwardly shifted, such that the top edge of the menu
                 item below the target is selected relatively often,
                 while the corresponding top edge of the target itself
                 is seldom selected. We developed two approaches for
                 addressing missing just below errors: reassigning
                 selections along the top edge and deactivating them. In
                 a laboratory evaluation, only the deactivated edge
                 approach showed promise overall. Further analysis of
                 our data revealed that individual differences played a
                 large role in our results and identified a new source
                 of selection difficulty. Specifically, we observed two
                 error-prone groups of users: the low hitters, who, like
                 participants in the baseline study, made missing just
                 below errors, and the high hitters, who, in contrast,
                 had difficulty with errors on the item above. All but
                 one of the older participants fell into one of these
                 error-prone groups, reinforcing that older users do
                 need better support for selecting menu items with a
                 pen. Preliminary analysis of the performance data
                 suggests both of our approaches were beneficial for the
                 low hitters, but that additional techniques are needed
                 to meet the needs of the high hitters and to address
                 the challenge of supporting both groups in a single

                 training strategy using video modeling in conjunction
                 with other instructional methods to enhance learning.
                 Cognitive as well as socio-motivational aspects will be

                 error-free training. Younger and older participants

                 found for the training condition. Analysis of knowledge

                 gain access to adaptable, modular, multilingual, cheap
                 and sustainable Augmentative and Alternative
                 Communication (AAC) products, we propose the use of the
                 ITHACA framework. It is a software environment for
                 building component-based AAC applications, grounded on
                 the Design for All principles and a hybrid--- {\em
                 community\/} and {\em commercial\/} ---Open Source
                 development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the
                 vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We
                 introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product
                 design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to
                 search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA
                 provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable
                 Open Source code for building AAC software components.
                 It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together
                 sophisticated applications using the available on the
                 Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial
                 software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use
                 AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products
                 which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces
                 that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA
                 architecture and the proposed fusion of past and
                 current approaches, trends and technologies are
                 explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by
                 implementing a family of AAC products, based on
                 interchangeable components. Several ready to use
                 ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards,
                 Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting,
                 emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four
                 complete communication aids addressing different user
                 cases have been developed. This demonstration showed
                 good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and
                 substantial improvement of the end users' communication
                 skills. Developers' experience on working in ITHACA's
                 Open Source projects was also positively evaluated.
                 More importantly, the potential contribution of the

                 model combination to the AAC community emerged.",

                 been used for nontraditional assistive technology

                 generally targeted for users with severe motor

                 65+) support in their daily lives, but older adults
                 often find such devices difficult to learn and use. One
                 potential design approach to improve the learnability
                 of mobile devices is a Multi-Layered (ML) interface,
                 where novice users start with a reduced-functionality
                 interface layer that only allows them to perform basic
                 tasks, before progressing to a more complex interface
                 layer when they are comfortable. We studied the effects
                 of a ML interface on older adults' performance in
                 learning tasks on a mobile device. We conducted a
                 controlled experiment with 16 older (ages 65--81) and
                 16 younger participants (age 21--36), who performed
                 tasks on either a 2-layer or a nonlayered (control)
                 address book application, implemented on a commercial
                 smart phone. We found that the ML interface's
                 Reduced-Functionality layer, compared to the control's
                 Full-Functionality layer, better helped users to master
                 a set of basic tasks and to retain that ability 30
                 minutes later. When users transitioned from the
                 Reduced-Functionality to the Full-Functionality
                 interface layer, their performance on the previously
                 learned tasks was negatively affected, but no negative
                 impact was found on learning new, advanced tasks.
                 Overall, the ML interface provided greater benefit for
                 older participants than for younger participants in
                 terms of task completion time during initial learning,
                 perceived complexity, and preference. We discuss how
                 the ML interface approach is suitable for improving the
                 learnability of mobile applications, particularly for
                 older adults.",

  abstract =     "Motion-capture recordings of sign language are used in
                 research on automatic recognition of sign language or
                 generation of sign language animations, which have
                 accessibility applications for deaf users with low
                 levels of written-language literacy. Motion-capture
                 gloves are used to record the wearer's handshape.
                 Unfortunately, they require a time-consuming and
                 inexact calibration process each time they are worn.
                 This article describes the design and evaluation of a
                 new calibration protocol for motion-capture gloves,
                 which is designed to make the process more efficient
                 and to be accessible for participants who are deaf and
                 use American Sign Language (ASL). The protocol was
                 evaluated experimentally; deaf ASL signers wore the
                 gloves, were calibrated (using the new protocol and
                 using a calibration routine provided by the glove
                 manufacturer), and were asked to perform sequences of
                 ASL handshapes. Five native ASL signers rated the
                 correctness and understandability of the collected
                 handshape data. In an additional evaluation, ASL
                 signers were asked to perform ASL stories while wearing
                 the gloves and a motion-capture bodysuit (in some cases
                 our new calibration protocol was used, in other cases,
                 the standard protocol). Later, twelve native ASL
                 signers watched animations produced from this
                 motion-capture data and answered comprehension
                 questions about the stories. In both evaluation
                 studies, the new protocol received significantly higher
                 scores than the standard calibration. The protocol has
                 been made freely available online, and it includes
                 directions for the researcher, images and videos of how
                 participants move their hands during the process, and
                 directions for participants (as ASL videos and English
                 text).",

  abstract =     "Hands-free speech-based technology can be a useful
                 alternative for individuals that find traditional input
                 devices, such as keyboard and mouse, difficult to use.
                 Various speech-based navigation techniques have been
                 examined, and several are available in commercial
                 software applications. Among these alternatives,
                 grid-based navigation has demonstrated both potential
                 and limitations. In this article, we discuss an
                 empirical study that assessed the efficacy of two
                 enhancements to grid-based navigation: magnification
                 and fine-tuning. The magnification capability enlarges
                 the selected region when it becomes sufficiently small,
                 making it easier to see the target and cursor. The
                 fine-tuning capability allows users to move the cursor
                 short distances to position the cursor over the target.
                 The study involved one group of participants with
                 physical disabilities, an age-matched group of
                 participants without disabilities, and a third group
                 that included young adults without disabilities. The
                 results confirm that both magnification and fine-tuning
                 significantly improved the participants' performance
                 when selecting targets, especially small targets.
                 Providing either, or both, of the proposed enhancements
                 substantially reduced the gaps in performance due to
                 disability and age. The results will inform the design
                 of speech-based target selection mechanism, allowing
                 users to select targets faster while making fewer
                 errors.",
