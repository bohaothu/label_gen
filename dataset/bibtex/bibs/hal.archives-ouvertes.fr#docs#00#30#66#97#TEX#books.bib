Its explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations research in particular but also to its increasing application in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of communication networks, for instance. 


The primary aim of this book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject, suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal. Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated, and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty - are provided to help the reader master the techniques and reinforce their grasp of the material.


A second objective is to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a number of interesting and challenging open problems are highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on the first few sections of selected chapters.},

Secondly, a review of basic spread spectrum techniques are presented which are used in CDMA systems including direct sequence, frequency-hopping and time-hopping approaches. The basic concept of CDMA is presented, followed by the four basic principles of CDMA systems that impact their performance: interference averaging, universal frequency reuse, soft handoff, and statistical multiplexing. The focus of the discussion will then shift to applications. The most common application of CDMA currently is cellular systems. A detailed discussion on cellular voice systems based on CDMA, specifically IS-95, is presented. The capacity of such systems will be examined as well as performance enhancement techniques such as coding and spatial filtering. Also discussed are Third Generation CDMA cellular systems and how they differ from Second Generation systems. A second application of CDMA that is covered is spread spectrum packet radio networks. Finally, there is an examination of multi-user detection and interference cancellation and how such techniques impact CDMA networks.

   Publisher = {Springer},
   Abstract = {Network flow optimization analyzes optimization problems on networks; hence, network optimization is reflected in many application fields including transportation, telecommunication, computer networking, financial planning, logistics and supply chain management, energy systems, etc. However, to date, most network optimization problems that have been studied are static network optimization problems. But "real world networks" are time-varying in essence, and therefore any flow within a network must take a certain amount of time to traverse an arc. Moreover, the parameters of "real world networks" may change over time. Problems such as how to plan and control the transmission of flow becomes very important, because waiting at a node, or traveling along a particular arc with different speed, may allow one to catch the best timing along the path; thus, achieving the objective and changing the decision making process. It should be noted that there are a host of decision making problems in practice that should be formulated as optimization models on time-varying networks.


The express purpose of TIME-VARYING NETWORK OPTIMIZATION is to describe, in a unified and self-contained manner, a series of models, propositions, and algorithms developed in recent years on time-varying networks. References and discussions on relevant problems and studies that have appeared in the literature are integrated in the book. The book consists of eight chapters, in which the following problems are formulated and examined: (1) the shortest path problem, (2) minimum-spanning tree problem, (3) maximum flow problem, (4) minimum cost flow problem, (5) maximum capacity path problem, (6) quickest path problem, (7) multi-criteria problem, and (8) the generalized flow problem. The time-varying traveling salesman problem and the Chinese postman problem are presented in a chapter together with the time-varying generalized problem. While these topics will be described all within the framework of time-varying networks, our plan is to make each chapter relatively self-contained so that each can be read separately.


The book will be useful for researchers, practitioners, graduate students and senior undergraduates, as a unified reference and textbook on time-varying network optimization. While the book describes the structure of the algorithms, the authors also have developed the software that implements the algorithms. This software can be made available for academic study purposes upon request.},

   Abstract = {The convergence of IT, telecommunications, and media is bringing about a revolution in the way information is collected, stored and accessed. There are three principal reasons why this is happening reducing cost, increasing quality, and increasing bandwidth. Moore s Law results in ever-decreasing costs of processing, storage, and transmission. Digital information preserves content accuracy (e.g. digital television) in a way other systems do not. High bandwidth transmission from one place to another on the planet is now possible. Information is ubiquitous and globally accessible, and can be held and accessed just as easily on a global network as on a local personal computer or in a local library. Devices are increasingly intelligent and are network-ready. User interfaces are becoming more adaptable and flexible, and can be tailored to particular application domains. Digital intelligence is becoming seamless and invisible, enabling more attention to be paid to the content and the user s interaction with it. This revolution is having effects on the development and organisation of information and artefact repositories such as libraries, museums, and exhibitions, and the way in which physical and digital aspects are mediated to users. The changes that digital convergence is bringing about are substantial and are also likely to be long-lasting.

Radio frequency components and circuits form the backbone of today's mobile and satellite communications networks. Consequently, both practicing and aspiring industry professionals need to be able to solve ever more complex problems of RF design.
Blending theoretical rigor with a wealth of practical expertise, Practical RF System Design addresses a variety of complex, real-world problems that system engineers are likely to encounter in today's burgeoning communications industry with solutions that are not easily available in the existing literature. The author, an expert in the field of RF module and system design, provides powerful techniques for analyzing real RF systems, with emphasis on some that are currently not well understood. Combining theoretical results and models with examples, he challenges readers to address such practical issues as:
* How standing wave ratio affects system gain
* How noise on a local oscillator will affect receiver noise figure and desensitization
* How to determine the dynamic range of a cascade from module specifications
* How phase noise affects system performance and where it comes from
* How intermodulation products (IMs) predictably change with signal amplitude, and why they sometimes change differently
An essential resource for today's RF system engineers, the text covers important topics in the areas of system noise and nonlinearity, frequency conversion, and phase noise. Along with a wealth of practical examples using MATLAB(r) and Excel, spreadsheets are available for download from an FTP Web site to help readers apply the methods outlined in this important resource.},

Motivational examples illustrate the use of multicriteria optimization in practice. Numerous illustrations and exercises as well as an extensive bibliography are provided.

   Abstract = {Frequency spectrum is a limited and valuable resource for wireless communications. A good example can be observed among network operators in Europe for the prices to pay for UMTS-frequency bands. Therefore, the first goal when designing future wireless communication systems (e.g. 4G - fourth generation) has to be the increase in spectral efficiency. The development in digital communications in the past years has enabled efficient modulation and coding techniques for robust and spectral efficient data, speech, audio and video transmission. These are the multi-carrier modulation (e.g. OFDM) and the spread spectrum technique (e.g. DS-CDMA), where OFDM was chosen for broadcast applications (DVB, DAB) as well as for broadband wireless indoor standards (ETSI HIPERLAN-II, IEEE-802.11) and the DS-CDMA was selected in mobile communications (IS-95, third generation mobile radio systems world wide, UMTS/IMT 2000).
Since 1993 various combinations of multi-carrier (MC) modulation and the spread spectrum (SS) technique have been introduced and the field of MC-SS communications has become an independent and important research topic with increasing activities. New application fields have been proposed such as high rate cellular mobile, high rate wireless indoor and LMDS. It has been shown that MC-SS offers the high spectral efficiency, robustness and flexibility that is required for the next generation systems. Meanwhile, different alternative hybrid schemes such as OFDM/OFDMA, MC-TDMA, etc. have been deeply analysed and adopted in different international standards (ETSI-BRAN, IEEE-802 & MMAC). 
Multi-Carrier & Spread-Spectrum: Analysis of Hybrid Air Interfaces draws together all of the above mentioned hybrid schemes therefore providing a greatly needed resource for system engineers, telecommunication designers and researchers in order to enable them to develop, build and deploy several schemes based on MC-transmission for the next generation systems (which will be an integration of broadband multimedia services covering both 4G mobile and fixed wireless systems).

As the cross over between nature and engineering has always been fruitful, Cooperation in Wireless Networks: Principles and Applications advocates the use of cooperative strategies in the field of wireless communications. 

Whether to cooperate or act autonomously, i.e., in a more selfish manner, has to be decided by each wireless terminal individually. Following the rule "The real egoistic behavior is to cooperate", mutual aid among terminals will be applied if and only if it is beneficial for all group members. 

Cooperation in Wireless Networks: Principles and Applications covers the underlying principles of cooperative techniques as well as several applications demonstrating the use of such techniques in practical systems. The work is written in a collaborative manner by several authors from Asia, America, and Europe. Twenty chapters introduce and discuss in detail the main cooperative strategies for the whole communication protocol stack from the application layer down to the physical layer. Furthermore power saving strategies, security, hardware realization, and user scenarios for cooperative communication systems are introduced and discussed. The book also summarizes the strength of cooperation for upcoming generation of wireless communication systems, clearly motivating the use of cooperative techniques and pointing out that cooperation will become one of the key technologies enabling 4G and beyond.

   Abstract = {In the Age of Enlightenment the German philosopher Immanuel Kant encouraged people to use their own mind as the basis for reasoning instead of following dogmatic religious rules - Sapere aude! (dare to know!) - Today wireless communication networks are increasingly becoming aware of the conditions of its their component parts and surrounding environment. Cognition, a continuous process involving sensing, reasoning, understanding and reacting, can be applied to wireless networks in order to adapt the system to the highly dynamic wireless ecosystem. The ultimate goals are to enhance the efficiency in the use of radio resources as well as to improve both link and network performance. This book presents a detailed overview of a rapidly emerging topic in modern communications: cognitive wireless networks. The key aspects of cognitive and cooperative principles in wireless networks are discussed in this book. Furthermore, Cognitive Wireless Networks advocates the concept of breaking up the cellular communication architecture by introducing cooperative strategies among wireless devices. Cognitive wireless networking is the key to success in handling the upcoming dynamic network configurations and exploiting this cross-over to the fullest extent.


As wireless networks become pervasive, highly populated and increasingly complex, the essential preconditions for exploiting rich interactions among mobile devices are better fulfilled. Today, these trends are giving rise to new communications paradigms making use of cooperation and cognition as the main underlying principles. Cognition, together with its complementary principle cooperation, confer to the wireless networks some degree of consciousness or understanding about their own existence, such as internal structure, capabilities, relationships to the outside world, limitations, current use of radio resources and many more. Current wireless networks are aware of their surrounding environment to a very limited extent, but in future wireless networks this capability will be highly developed, as a consequence of exploiting jointly cooperative and cognitive principles. Especially for cooperative wireless networks, where the communication scenario is highly dynamic, the mobile devices need to adapt their capabilities in a flexible manner, taking advantage of cognitive principles.},

   Title = {OFDM and MC-CDMA for Broadband Multi-User Communications, WLANs and Broadcasting},
   Publisher = {Wiley-IEEE Press},
   Abstract = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a method of digital modulation in which a signal is split into several narrowband channels at different frequencies. 

CDMA is a form of multiplexing, which allows numerous signals to occupy a single transmission channel, optimising the use of available bandwidth.  Multiplexing is sending multiple signals or streams of information on a carrier at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal and then recovering the separate signals at the receiving end. 

Multi-Carrier (MC) CDMA is a combined technique of Direct Sequence (DS) CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDM techniques.  It applies spreading sequences in the frequency domain.  

Wireless communications has witnessed a tremendous growth during the past decade and further spectacular enabling technology advances are expected in an effort to render ubiquitous wireless connectivity a reality.  

This technical in-depth book is unique in its detailed exposure of OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and MC-CDMA.  A further attraction of the joint treatment of these topics is that it allows the reader to view their design trade-offs in a comparative context. 

Divided into three main parts: 

Part I provides a detailed exposure of OFDM designed for employment in various applications 

Part II is another design alternative applicable in the context of OFDM systems where the channel quality fluctuations observed are averaged out with the aid of frequency-domain spreading codes, which leads to the concept of MC-CDMA 

Part III discusses how to employ multiple antennas at the base station for the sake of supporting multiple users in the uplink 
Portrays the entire body of knowledge currently available on OFDM 
Provides the first complete treatment of OFDM, MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output)-OFDM and MC-CDMA 
Considers the benefits of channel coding and space time coding in the context of various application examples and features numerous complete system design examples 
Converts the lessons of Shannon's information theory into design principles applicable to practical wireless systems 
Combines the benefits of a textbook with a research monograph where the depth of discussions progressively increase throughout the book 

This all-encompassing self-contained treatment will appeal to researchers, postgraduate students and academics, practising research and development engineers working for wireless communications and computer networking companies and senior undergraduate students and technical managers.},

Wireless mesh networks consist of mesh clients and mesh routers, where the mesh routers form a wireless infrastructure/backbone and interwork with the wired networks to provide multihop wireless Internet connectivity to the mesh clients. Wireless mesh networking has emerged as one of the most promising concept for self-organizing and auto-configurable wireless networking to provide adaptive and flexible wireless Internet connectivity to mobile users. This concept can be used for different wireless access technologies such as IEEE 802.11, 802.15, 802.16-based WLAN, WPAN, and WMAN technologies. Potential application scenarios for wireless mesh networks include access and backhaul support for cellular networks, home networks, enterprise networks, community networks, and intelligent transport system networks. Development of wireless mesh networking technology has to deal with challenging architecture and protocol design issues, and there is an increasing interest on this technology among the researchers in both academia and industry. There are many on-going research projects in different universities and industrial research labs. Also, many startup companies are building mesh networking platforms based on off-the-shelf wireless access technologies and developing demanding applications and services. This book provides a unified view of the state-of-the-art achievements in the area of wireless mesh networking technology.

The contributed articles from the leading experts in this field cover both the theoretical concepts (e.g., information-theoretic analysis) and system-level implementation issues. The topics include information-theoretic analysis of wireless mesh networks, challenges and issues in designing architectures and protocols for wireless mesh networks, medium access control and routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, cross-layer performance analysis and optimization in wireless mesh networks, multimedia over wireless mesh, trust and security in wireless mesh networks, cooperation and incentive techniques, reconfigurable and cognitive radio for wireless mesh networks, MIMO wireless mesh networks, wireless mesh test-beds and hardware prototypes, and applications and services. The book starts with the essential background on the basic concepts and architectures of wireless mesh networking (through one/two survey articles), and then it presents advanced level materials in a step-by-step fashion so that the readers can follow the book easily. The rich set of references in each of the articles are invaluable to the researchers.

   Abstract = {Multi-antenna techniques are widely considered to be the most promising avenue for significantly increasing the bandwidth efficiency of wireless data transmission systems. In so called MIMO (multiple input multiple output) systems, multiple antennas are deployed both at the transmitter and the receiver. In MISO (multiple input single output) systems, the receiver has only one antenna, and the multiple transmit antennas are used for transmit diversity. The key aspects of multiple antenna transceiver techniques for evolving 3G systems and beyond are presented. MIMO and MISO (transmit diversity) techniques are explained in a common setting. In particular, the book covers linear processing transmit diversity methods with and without side information at the transmitter (feedback), including the current transmit diversity concepts in the WCDMA standards, as well as promising MIMO concepts, crucial for future high data rate systems. As an example, MIMO and MISO aspects of 3GPP HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) will be considered. Furthermore, examples of high throughput, low complexity space-time codes will be provided, when signalling without side information (open loop concepts). The theory of linear space-time block codes will be developed, and optimal non-orthogonal high throughput codes will be constructed, both for MIMO and MISO systems. Performance may be further improved by feedback from receiver to transmitter. The corresponding closed loop modes in the current 3GPP specifications will be discussed, along with their extensions for more than two transmit antennas. In addition, feedback signalling for MIMO channels will be addressed. Optimal quantisation methods of the feedback messages will be discussed. Finally, hybrid schemes are constructed, where the amount of feedback is reduced using partly open, partly closed loop signalling.

Topics include historical perspective, channel impairments, amplitude constraints and the characteristics of popular optoelectronic components. A variety of wireless optical channel topologies are presented along with a survey and analysis of present day signalling techniques employed for these channels. The author provides a unifying framework for signalling design which allows the channel constraints to be represented geometrically and permits the use of modem design principles from electrical channels. Modulation schemes are designed using the formalism of lattice codes and a design process for signalling sets is specified. 

The use of multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) wireless optical channels to improve the spectral efficiency of links is explored. The basic spatio-temporal modem design problem is specified and a spatial multiplexing gain is quantified. New spatial discrete multitone modulation is proposed and the unique features are discussed. Based on measurements on an experimental prototype, a channel model is formulated and a realizable spatio-temporal coding scheme is simulated to quantify performance gains. 

This volume is organized for professional and academic readers engaged in modem design for wireless optical intensity channels. Significant background material is presented on both the properties as well as on fundamental communications principles. Wireless Optical Communication Systems can be used by physicists and experimentalists as an introduction to signalling design as well as communication systems designers.},

   Title = {Acoustic MIMO Signal Processing},
   Publisher = {Springer},
   Abstract = {Telecommunication systems and human-machine interfaces start employing multiple microphones and loudspeakers in order to make conversations and interactions more lifelike, hence more efficient. This development gives rise to a variety of acoustic signal processing problems under multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios, encompassing distant speech acquisition, sound source localization and tracking, echo and noise control, source separation and speech dereverberation, and many others. 

Acoustic MIMO Signal Processing is divided into two major parts - the theoretical and the practical. The authors begin by introducing an acoustic MIMO paradigm, establishing the fundamental of the field, and linking acoustic MIMO signal processing with the concepts of classical signal processing and communication theories in terms of system identification, equalization, and adaptive algorithms. In the second part of the book, a novel and penetrating analysis of aforementioned acoustic applications is carried out in the paradigm to reinforce the fundamental concepts of acoustic MIMO signal processing.


Acoustic MIMO Signal Processing is a timely and important professional reference for researchers and practitioners from universities and a wide range of industries. It is also an excellent text for graduate students who are interested in this exciting field.},

This has happened in spite of new technology, innovative methods and tools, and different management methods. Why does this happen? Why cant the situation be better? One reason is that many think of each IT effort as unique. In reality many IT projects are very similar at a high, strategic level. Where they differ is in the people and exact eventsthe detail. If you read the literature or have been in information systems or IT for some time, you have seen the same reasons for failure and the same problems and issues recur again and again. 

In this book IT Management experts Ben Lientz and Lee Larssen show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects and provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this books readers can significantly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success. Benefits of using this approach:

Issues are identified earliergiving more time for solution and action.
Issues are resolved more consistently since the approach tracks on their repetition.
You get an early warning of problems in IT workbefore the budget or schedule fall apart.
Management tends to have more realistic expectations with an awareness of issues.
Users and managers have greater confidence in IT due to the improved handling of issues.
Since the number of issues tends to stabilize in an organization, the IT organization and management get better at detecting, preventing, and dealing with issues over timecumulative improvement.
Giving attention to issues make users more realistic in their requests and acts to deter requirement changes and scope creep.

* Full of checklists and methods that can be used in day to day Project Management work in real companies
* Easy to read style and book organization allows the reader to jump into the book right at the point they need

   Abstract = {Client/Server architecture was first proposed in the late 1980s as an alternative to conventional mainframe systems. Mainframe processing quickly becomes a bottleneck in any information system, but client/server models shift the processing burden to the client computer. Through workload sharing, client/server systems can improve overall efficiency while reducing budgets.
Companies are again searching for ways to improve their processing power without further investment in new hardware and software. Many client computers are idle most of the time, and have unused disk space. The next logical step is to maximise the resources of these computers, and the peer-to-peer (P2P) model is the answer. 
A new and simple peer-to-peer model will be introduced in this book. In it:
Readers will be taught to install peer-to-peer systems which can then manage and distribute the processing power of any number of clients.
The size of network can range from two to over a million computers. 
The software necessary to implement peer-to-peer systems quickly can be downloaded from the books website at www.springer.com/1-84628-381-7/ The deployment of web technologies will enable individuals and organisations of all sizes to use computers across a network as though it were a single supercomputer to solve complex problems, and after reading this book, readers will be able to install a peer-to-peer system of any size.},

   Publisher = {Wiley-Interscience},
   Abstract = {Cognitive networks can dynamically adapt their operational parameters in response to user needs or changing environmental conditions. They can learn from these adaptations and exploit knowledge to make future decisions. 

Cognitive networks are the future, and they are needed simply because they enable users to focus on things other than configuring and managing networks. Without cognitive networks, the pervasive computing vision calls for every consumer to be a network technician. The applications of cognitive networks enable the vision of pervasive computing, seamless mobility, ad-hoc networks, and dynamic spectrum allocation, among others. 


In detail, the authors describe the main features of cognitive networks clearly indicating that cognitive network design can be applied to any type of network, being fixed or wireless. They explain why cognitive networks promise better protection against security attacks and network intruders and how such networks will benefit the service operator as well as the consumer. 

Cognitive Networks 
Explores the state-of-the-art in cognitive networks, compiling a roadmap to future research.  
Covers the topic of cognitive radio including semantic aspects. 
Presents hot topics such as biologically-inspired networking, autonomic networking, and adaptive networking. 
Introduces the applications of machine learning and distributed reasoning to cognitive networks.   
Addresses cross-layer design and optimization. 
Discusses security and intrusion detection in cognitive networks. 

Cognitive Networks is essential reading for advanced students, researchers, as well as practitioners interested in cognitive & wireless networks, pervasive computing, distributed learning, seamless mobility, and self-governed networks.

   Publisher = {Springer},
   Abstract = {More and more, software systems involve autonomous and distributed software components that have to execute and interact in open and dynamic environments, such as in pervasive, autonomous, and mobile applications. The requirements with respect to dynamics, openness, scalability, and decentralization call for new approaches to software design and development, capable of supporting spontaneous configuration, tolerating partial failures, or arranging adaptive reorganization of the whole system. Inspired by the behaviour of complex natural systems, scientists and engineers have started to adjust their mechanisms and techniques for self-organization and adaption to changing environments. In line with these considerations, Mamei and Zambonelli propose an interaction model inspired by the way masses and particles in our universe move and self-organize according to contextual information represented by gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The key idea is to have the components actions driven by computational force fields, generated by the components themselves or by some infrastructures, and propagated across the environment. Together with its supporting middleware infrastructure available with additional information under http://www.agentgroup.unimore.it this model can serve as the basis for a general purpose and widely applicable approach for the design and development of adaptive distributed applications.},

More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations. While it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.},

But how much of WiMAX's touted potential is merely hype? Now that several pre-WiMAX networks have been deployed, what are the operators saying about QoS and ROI? How and when will device manufacturers integrate WiMAX into their products? What is the business case for using WiMAX rather than any number of other established wireless alternatives? WiMAX: Taking Wireless to the MAX examines the evolution of wireless, broadband, and the wireless broadband landscape with exhaustive coverage of technological advances and evolving topologies. It sets the tone for the journey towards untouched wireless heights - WiMAX. The author builds a complete understanding of Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) Technologies, elaborating on past developments, present needs and uses, and future trends and markets. He lays out a road map to the future and articulates present and future applications and models of BWA with focus on WiMAX.

   Abstract = {Topology control is fundamental to solving scalability and capacity problems in large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.  

Forthcoming wireless multi-hop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks will allow network nodes to control the communication topology by choosing their transmitting ranges. Briefly, topology control (TC) is the art of co-ordinating nodes’ decisions regarding their transmitting ranges, to generate a network with the desired features.  Building an optimized network topology helps surpass the prevalent scalability and capacity problems. 

Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks makes the case for topology control and provides an exhaustive coverage of TC techniques in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, considering both stationary networks, to which most of the existing solutions are tailored, and mobile networks. The author introduces a new taxonomy of topology control and gives a full explication of the applications and challenges of this important topic. 

Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks: 
Defines topology control and explains its necessity, considering both stationary and mobile networks. 
Describes the most representative TC protocols and their performance. 
Covers the critical transmitting range for stationary and mobile networks, topology optimization problems such as energy efficiency, and distributed topology control. 
Discusses implementation and ‘open issues’, including realistic models and the effect of multi-hop data traffic. 
Presents a case study on routing protocol design, to demonstrate how TC can ease the design of cooperative routing protocols. 

This invaluable text will provide graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Physics, researchers in the field of ad hoc networking, and professionals in wireless telecoms as well as networking system developers with a single reference resource on topology control.},

   Publisher = {Cisco Press},
   Abstract = {Information security practices have evolved from Internet perimeter protection to an in-depth defense model in which multiple countermeasures are layered throughout the infrastructure to address vulnerabilities and attacks. This is necessary due to increased attack frequency, diverse attack sophistication, and the rapid nature of attack velocity–all blurring the boundaries between the network and perimeter.


End-to-End Network Security is designed to counter the new generation of complex threats. Adopting this robust security strategy defends against highly sophisticated attacks that can occur at multiple locations in your network. The ultimate goal is to deploy a set of security capabilities that together create an intelligent, self-defending network that identifies attacks as they occur, generates alerts as appropriate, and then automatically responds.


End-to-End Network Security provides you with a comprehensive look at the mechanisms to counter threats to each part of your network. The book starts with a review of network security technologies then covers the six-step methodology for incident response and best practices from proactive security frameworks. Later chapters cover wireless network security, IP telephony security, data center security, and IPv6 security. Finally, several case studies representing small, medium, and large enterprises provide detailed example configurations and implementation strategies of best practices learned in earlier chapters.


Adopting the techniques and strategies outlined in this book enables you to prevent day-zero attacks, improve your overall security posture, build strong policies, and deploy intelligent, self-defending networks.


“Within these pages, you will find many practical tools, both process related and technology related, that you can draw on to improve your risk mitigation strategies.”

   Title = {Advances in Pervasive Computing and Networking},
   Publisher = {Springer},
   Abstract = {Pervasive Computing and Networking aim at providing ubiquitous, ever-present, adaptable, smart, enveloping and immersive environments in which computing components and humans can interact regardless of the location. The combination of an abundance of computational power of the processors and the communication bandwidth provided by the wireless and mobile networking everywhere and all the time makes such environments within the reach of current technology. Yet, to realize the full potential of such environments, many technical and economical challenges needs to be overcome. These challenges and the perspective on the seminal directions of the research in this area were the subject of the Workshop for Pervasive Computing and Networking at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA. This book presents chapters based on presentations made at the workshop by leaders in the field. The scope of Advances in Pervasive Computing and Networking ranges from fundamental theory of pervasive computing and networking to crucial challenges and emerging applications.

Such seminal topics as a scalable, self-organizing technology for sensor networks, the fundamental relationship between the achievable capacity and delay in mobile wireless networks, the role of self-optimization in sensor networks or similarities and differences between computer networks and their biological counterparts are the subject of the first group of chapters.

The next group of chapters covers communication issues, such as cooperative communication in mobile, wireless and sensor networks, methods for maximizing aggregate throughput in 802.11 mesh networks with a physical carrier, and self-configuring location discovery systems for smart environments. The book closes with chapters focusing on sensor network emerging applications such as smart and safe buildings, a design for a distributed transmitter for reachback based on radar signals sensing and two-radio multi-channel clustering.},

   Publisher = {Elsevier Science},
   Abstract = {Since the 1970's, there has been a great deal of research effort spent on studying 
chaotic systems and the properties of the chaotic signals generated. Characterized by their wideband, impulse-like autocorrelation and low cross-correlation properties, chaotic signals are useful spread-spectrum signals for carrying digital information. Spectrum spreading has become one of the most popular modulation techniques for high-speed wireless communications. It makes use of signals of very wide bandwidth to carry information at relatively low data rates, and possesses advantages such as low probability of interception, resistance to jamming, multiple-access capability and mitigation to multipath effect, which are particularly important in a wireless scenario. In addition to enjoying the aforementioned benefits, chaotic signals can be generated using simple circuitries, thus lowering the cost of transceivers. 

Early study of chaos-based communication systems was focused on a single-user case. In the past few years, more effort has been put on investigating systems with multiple-access capability, which is a key feature of spread-spectrum communication systems. This book presents a detailed study of some multiple-access schemes used for chaos-based communications, and evaluates their performance. In addition, the effectiveness of the multiuser detection techniques, whose primary objective is to reduce interference between users and hence improve performance, is evaluated in the context of multiple-access digital communication systems.

Traffic in networks connecting such systems is typically characterized by its distribution in time and space. Three approaches can be applied to determine the related network performance: measurement, simulation, and mathematical methods.

Dietmar Tutsch first introduces various network architectures that are widely proposed for parallel and distributed systems as well as for systems-on-chips including multicore processors. Their advantages and drawbacks are compared. Then, he gives an exhaustive survey of the available modeling techniques, including mathematical methods like Markov chains and Petri nets, and simulation methods. The main problems in modeling networks are that models are usually too large to be handled by a computer system, and, due to model complexity, model development is very time consuming. As a solution, the author systematically presents methods for complexity reduction, thus reducing the development time considerably. In addition, he presents a strategy for developing a generator for automatic model derivation. Finally, both simulation and mathematical models are applied to two major examples, a cellular network and a multistage interconnection network.

This monograph mainly targets researchers in network architecture design and performance analysis, both from industry and academia. In addition, graduate students specializing in these areas will find a comprehensive overview of this field.},

   Abstract = {The tendency towards more mobility and flexibility favors wireless networks for future broadband services, especially in local area and residential networks. Two major challenges in developing such high data-rate wireless networks are the channel distortion caused by multipath propagation and the limitations on bandwidth usage. In this book, novel transmission techniques are proposed that achieve multi-path mitigation, through orthogonal frequency-domain processing, in combination with a high bandwidth efficiency, through space division multiple access (SDMA). By exploiting the parallelism in the data-model and the frequency-selectivity of the propagation channel, high-performance non-linear detection algorithms with modest complexity requirements are obtained. In addition to discussing these core detection algorithms, this book pays special attention to the real-world problems encountered when integrating these into a complete system. Most notably, an optimal multi-user channel estimator and a combined pre- and post-synchronization approach are presented. Furthermore, complexity reduction is a recurring theme throughout the book. It has been addressed on several levels in the system design and encompasses network architecture, algorithmic and implementation architecture optimizations. Finally, an extended version of the recently finalized HIPERLAN-II standard is presented, which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed techniques and assesses their joint performance.

   Abstract = {The capacity of wireless data communications is lagging behind demands due to unsatisfactory performance of the existing wireless networks, such as low data rates, low spectral efficiency and low quality of service.
Space-time coding is an effective transmit diversity technique to combat fading in wireless communications.

Space-time codes are a highly bandwidth-efficient approach to signalling within wireless communication that takes advantage of the spatial dimension by transmitting a number of data streams using multiple co-located antennas. There are various approaches to the coding structures, including space-time trellis coded modulation, space-time turbo codes and also layered architectures. The central issue in all these various coding structures is the exploitation of multipath effects in order to achieve very high spectral efficiencies.
The spectral efficiencies of traditional wireless systems range between 1-5bps/sec/Hz but by using space-time techniques spectral efficiencies of 20-40bps/sec/Hz have been possible. Hence, space-time coding enables an increase in capacity by an order of magnitude. This is the main reason why space-time codes have been included in the standards for the third generation wireless communication systems and ultimately why Space-time Coding will be in great demand by individuals within industry and academia.

The comprehensive understanding of space-time coding is essential in the implementation of 3G, and as the only title currently available, Space-Time Coding will be the standard text for Researchers, telecommunication engineers and network planners, academics and undergraduate/postgraduate students, telecommunications managers and consultants.},

Electronic tagging can be divided into technologies that have a power source (active tags), and those that are powered by the tag interrogation signal (passive tags); the focus here is on passive tags. An overview of the principles of the technology divides passive tags into devices that use either near field or far field coupling to communicate with a tag reader. The strengths and weaknesses of the approaches are considered, along with the standards that have been put in place by ISO and EPCGlobal to promote interoperability and the ubiquitous adoption of the technology. A section of the lecture has been dedicated to the principles of reading co-located tags, as this represents a significant challenge for a technology that may one day be able to automatically identify all of the items in your shopping cart in a just few seconds. In fact, RFID applications are already quite extensive and this lecture classifies the primary uses. Some variants of modern RFID can also be integrated with sensors enabling the technology to be extended to measure parameters in the local environment, such as temperature & pressure. The uses and applications of RFID sensors are further described and classified. Later we examine important lessons surrounding the deployment of RFID for the Wal-Mart and the Metro AG store experiences, along with deployments in some more exploratory settings. Extensions of RFID that make use of read/write memory integrated with the tag are also discussed, in particular looking at novel near term opportunities. Privacy and social implications surrounding the use of RFID inspire recurring debates whenever there is discussion of large scale deployment; we examine the pros and cons of the issues and approaches for mitigating the problems. Finally, the remaining challenges of RFID are considered and we look to the future possibilities for the technology.},

   Title = {Resource Allocation in Multiuser Multicarrier Wireless Systems},
   Publisher = {Springer},
   Abstract = {Many algorithms have already been proposed in the past to solve the problem of allocating resources in a multi-user multicarrier wireless system. Due to the difficulty of the problem, most of the previous work in this area has focused on developing suboptimal heuristics without performance guarantees. 


Resource Allocation in Multiuser Multicarrier Wireless Systems proposes a unified algorithmic framework based on dual optimization techniques that have complexities that are linear in the number of subcarriers and users, and that achieve negligible optimality gaps in standards-based numerical simulations. Adaptive algorithms based on stochastic approximation techniques are also proposed, which are shown to achieve similar performance with even much lower complexity.
