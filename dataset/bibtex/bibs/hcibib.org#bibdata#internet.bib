%X Information access is at the core of Google's mission -- to make the world's
information universally accessible and useful. That's why in addition to
crawling, indexing and ranking billions of websites, images, videos and other
content, we also work to make that content available in all languages and in
accessible formats.
   We want to make information available to everyone, and that includes people
with disabilities, such as blindness, visual impairment, color deficiency,
deafness, hearing loss and limited dexterity. We've found that providing
alternative access modes like keyboard shortcuts, captions, high-contrast views
and text-to-speech technology helps everyone, not just people with
disabilities. For example, keyboard shortcuts help power users get things done
more quickly without using a mouse, speech-to-text technology enables people to
skim and search audio content, and custom product themes give people more
opportunities to personalize.

Summary
%X My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer. For seven years
this number has followed me around, has intruded in my most private data, and
has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals. This number
assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a
little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable.
The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random
accident. There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it, some pattern
governing its appearances. Either there really is something unusual about the
number or else I am suffering from delusions of persecution.
   I shall begin my case history by telling you about some experiments that
tested how accurately people can assign numbers to the magnitudes of various
aspects of a stimulus. In the traditional language of psychology these would be
called experiments in absolute judgment. Historical accident, however, has
decreed that they should have another name. We now call them experiments on the
capacity of people to transmit information. Since these experiments would not
have been done without the appearance of information theory on the
psychological scene, and since the results are analyzed in terms of the
concepts of information theory, I shall have to preface my discussion with a
few remarks about this theory.

be found in Greek mythology. Intelligent artifacts appear in literature since
then, with real (and fraudulent) mechanical devices actually demonstrating
behaviour with some degree of intelligence. After modern computers became
available following World War II, it has become possible to create programs
that perform difficult intellectual tasks. Even more importantly, general
purpose methods and tools have been created that allow similar tasks to be
performed.

%X PsychNology Journal (ISSN 1720-7525) is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary
on-line journal publishing contributions on the relationship between humans and
technology.
   The journal is committed to provide visibility to a wide spectrum of work on
this topic and offers the added value of an on-line journal in terms of its
format, which can be other than black-and-white still images and texts, and
freshness, in comparison with the long period of time required to publish on a
regular paper journal. As a free, on-line journal it joins the efforts toward
accessibility of scientific content encouraged by various international
associations (e.g. the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the
Sciences and Humanities), at the same time warranting quality via a regular
review process. To support this initiative, make available Your work on the
Internet and cite on-line publications.

content collections. 
   The base technology developed under Informedia-I combines speech, image and
natural language understanding to automatically transcribe, segment and index
linear video for intelligent search and image retrieval. Informedia-II seeks to
improve the dynamic extraction, summarization, visualization, and presentation
of distributed video, automatically producing "collages" and
"auto-documentaries" that summarize documents from text, images, audio and
video into one single abstraction.

%X The author describes two international standards for the representation of
the names of languages.  The first (ISO-639-[1]) published in 1988 provides
two-letter codes for 136 languages and was produced primarily to meet the
terminological needs.  The second (ISO 639-2) appeared in late 1998 and
includes three-letter codes for 460 languages.
%X This list addresses terminological needs but also for bibliographic
applications. For this reason, 639-2 is covered in detail.  Its features are
explained, and principles and policies used for development of this code list
are presented.  Additionally, the author describes the governance mechanism
established to maintain ISO 639-[1] and ISO 638-2.  Also presented is a brief
summary regarding a project in progress to provide codes for names of scripts
and when completed to result in publication of ISO 15924.  The paper concludes
that " the emergence of an international standard for language codes and of the
developing international standard for script codes is a major contribution to
Universal Bibliographic Control as these code lists enable of important
information regarding the nature of publications represented by records to be
communicated and shared unambiguously, efficiently, and internationally."

graphic icons and controls in addition to text. The user of the computer
utilizes a pointing device, like a mouse, to manipulate these icons and
controls. This is considerably different from the command line interface (CLI)
in which the user types a series of text commands to the computer.

completeness and quality to perform the current activity. Tools and
technologies help so that we spend less time with burdensome and error prone
actions of information management (such as filing). We then have more time to
make creative, intelligent use of the information at hand in order to get
things done

%X The classic problem of information retrieval, simply put, is to help people
find the relatively small number of things they are looking for (books,
articles, web pages, CDs, etc.) from a very large set of possibilities. This
classic problem has been studied in many variations and has been addressed
through a rich diversity of information retrieval tools and techniques.
%X A follow-on problem also exists which has received relatively less study:
Once found, how are things organized for re-access and re-use later on? What
can be done to avoid the need to repeat the process by which the information
was found in the first place? (If, indeed, it is possible to repeat this
process.) We refer to this as the problem of Keeping Found Things FoundTM or
KFTF.

%X Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of
recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these
guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with
disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss,
learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech
disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these
guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in
general.

	Guideline 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.
		Provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same
		function or purpose as auditory or visual content.
	Guideline 2. Don't rely on color alone.
		Ensure that text and graphics are understandable when viewed without color.
	Guideline 3. Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.
		Mark up documents with the proper structural elements.
		Control presentation with style sheets rather than with presentation elements and attributes.
	Guideline 4. Clarify natural language usage

	Guideline 5. Create tables that transform gracefully.
		Ensure that tables have necessary markup to be transformed by
		accessible browsers and other user agents.
	Guideline 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully.
		Ensure that pages are accessible even when newer technologies
		are not supported or are turned off.
	Guideline 7. Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes.
		Ensure that moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating objects
		or pages may be paused or stopped.
	Guideline 8. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.
		Ensure that the user interface follows principles of accessible design:
		device-independent access to functionality, keyboard operability, self-voicing, etc.
	Guideline 9. Design for device-independence.
		Use features that enable activation of page elements via a variety of input devices.
	Guideline 10. Use interim solutions.
		Use interim accessibility solutions so that assistive technologies
		and older browsers will operate correctly.
	Guideline 11. Use W3C technologies and guidelines.
		Use W3C technologies (according to specification) and follow accessibility guidelines.
		Where it is not possible to use a W3C technology, or doing so results in material that
		does not transform gracefully, provide an alternative version of the content that is accessible.
	Guideline 12. Provide context and orientation information.
		Provide context and orientation information to help users understand complex pages or elements.
	Guideline 13. Provide clear navigation mechanisms.
		Provide clear and consistent navigation mechanisms -- orientation information, navigation bars,
		a site map, etc. -- to increase the likelihood that a person will find what they are looking for at a site.
	Guideline 14. Ensure that documents are clear and simple.
		Ensure that documents are clear and simple so they may be more easily understood.

technology will not be economically feasible for the average home. Also the
scientists readily admit that the computer will require not yet invented
technology to actually work, but 50 years from now scientific progress is
expected to solve these problems. With teletype interface and the Fortran
language, the computer will be easy to use.

%X Computers in Human Behavior is a scholarly journal dedicated to examining
the use of computers from a psychological perspective. Original theoretical
works, research reports, literature reviews, software reviews, book reviews and
announcements are published. The journal addresses both the use of computers in
psychology, psychiatry and related disciplines as well as the psychological
impact of computer use on individuals, groups and society. The former category
includes articles exploring the use of computers for professional practice,
training, research and theory development. The latter category includes
articles dealing with the psychological effects of computers on phenomena such
as human development, learning, cognition, personality, and social
interactions. The journal addresses human interactions with computers, not
computers per se. The computer is discussed only as a medium through which
human behaviors are shaped and expressed. The primary message of most articles
involves information about human behavior. Therefore, professionals with an
interest in the psychological aspects of computer use, but with limited
knowledge of computers, will find this journal of interest.

this over lunch with Carl Gutwin, and having nothing better to do later on,
borrowed some facilities from the relatively unsuspecting Garry Beirne and

the Internet and how it may impact the library's role, including:
 * The use of social networking, social media, commercial and library services

 * How and what users and librarians share on the Web and their attitudes toward
   related privacy issues

4	Don't use colour as the sole way to get your message across.
5	Don't fall into the "news site trap".  Avoid drowning your content in ads.
6	Use real content in your prototypes.
7	Restrain yourself: Avoid creativity for creativity's sake.
8	If your search doesn't work, remove it.
9	Be professional: typos, alignment errors and dated content undermine credibility.
10	Many relationships exist. Some of them are useful.

%X Web sites, just like buildings, can be designed to meet the needs of all
people, including those with disabilities. Unfortunately, many (if not most)
current web pages and web-based resources contain major access barriers. This
site aspires to be a clearinghouse for studies involving the collection of
accessibility data pertaining to web sites and online resources in education,
particularly in higher education.
%X Such studies and their findings are important for several reasons:
 (1) They provide institutions with a realistic picture about the accessibility
     of their web sites.
 (2) They supply advocates for a barrier-free online environment with data by
     which to further their cause.
 (3) They enable librarians contemplating the purchase of online resources to
     make better informed procurement decisions.
 (4) To vendors of online products, they identify product features that need
     improvement.
 (5) By providing models for online accessibility research they are likely to
     stimulate further research in this area.
The audience for this resource guide include producers of online resources,
including web designers; college and university instructors, administrators,
and policy makers; distance educators; librarians; and disability
professionals.

%X The most valuable asset of a successful design team is the information they
have about their users. When teams have the right information, the job of
designing a powerful, intuitive, easy-to-use interface becomes tremendously
easier. When they don't, every little design decision becomes a struggle.
   While techniques, such as focus groups, usability tests, and surveys, can
lead to valuable insights, the most powerful tool in the toolbox is the 'field
study'. Field studies get the team immersed in the environment of their users
and allow them to observe critical details for which there is no other way of
discovering.

%X The Web must reverse the traditional direction of marketing, and although
once a viable paradigm permission marketing is no longer sufficient.  Instead
of a company generating messages when it wants to reach its customers, with
request marketing, the company sends only messages that users ask for. Request
marketing is especially suited to the mobile Internet, where intrusive messages
are ultra aggravating.

for alternative browsers to present that meaning in ways that are optimized for
the abilities of individual users and thus facilitate the use of the Web by

%W http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/ui_breakthroughcomma.html
%X Want to know what I think the next UI breakthroughs will be? Here is one:
Command line languages. Did you think they were dead? Forever vanguished by
graphical user interfaces? Think again. Search engines have added command
structures, and now these have migrated to the desktop. The new command line
interfaces still have a way to go. They have appeared serendipitously, as
system developers slowly expanded the capabilities of search tools. But now it
is time to recognize them for what they are -- and for how much better they
could become. Command line interfaces. Once that was all we had. Then they
disappeared, replaced by what we thought was a great advance: GUIs. GUIs were
-- and still are -- valuable, but they fail to scale to the demands of today's
systems. So now command line interfaces are back again, hiding under the name
of search. Now you see them, now you don't. Now you see them again. And they
will get better and better with time: mark my words, that is my prediction for
the future of interfaces.

challenges to the field of human-computer interaction, for if the computer is
everywhere, then everything is within our domain of study.
   It is time to consider where the next application areas might be. As I look
to the future, I see numerous domains of concern, but with three large,
overriding issues:
 * The ever-increasing complexity of everyday things
 * The ever-increasing burden of security, authentication, and identification
 * The ever-increasing use of automation

advantage of the richness of the tactile world combined with the power of
computer-based simulations. TUIs give physical form to digital information,
employing physical artifacts both as representations and controls for
computational media. They lend themselves well to collaboration around
intelligent tables, or what we call tabletop interaction. The t2i Lab at
Chalmers TH is a group of researchers and talented students pushing the edge of
interactive technology. We do this primarily by constructing TUIs and tabletop,

%T How to Create a UX Design Library
%A Curtis, Nathan
%D 2010-09-14
%W http://www.uie.com/articles/design_library
%X A design library is a collection of guidelines &amp; standards that describe
a design system and maybe template assets to go with it. Creating a library for
an experience of any scale is no trivial matter. It's not like you open up a
code editor, chop things up, throw a ZIP file to some marketer and say, "Here
you go. Enjoy!" You've got to have a plan.
   So, let's assume you've done due diligence: your design system is stable and
mature, and you've answered all the right questions to justify the effort. You
are ready to get started.
   What is the process? The process of creating a library involves many
different activities across four sequential phases:
 * Analyze: understanding what it is, how it fits into your process, and what
   it'll contain 
 * Assemble: building it, including documentation, template assets, and how
   you'll publish them 
 * Adopt: communicating and getting everyone onboard 
 * Adapt: administering &amp; evolving it over time, through successive releases
Once you've broken down the plan into four chunks, it's easier to zero
conversation in on specifics: individual activities that may be obvious
(documenting guidelines) and what's not (oh, yeah, you're right, I need a
communications plan!).

%T Five Indispensable Skills for UX Mastery
%A Spool, Jared M.
%D 2010-08-03
%W http://www.uie.com/articles/indispensable_skills
%X For practicing User Experience Designers, one of the most important laws
isn't Fitts's Law, which helps us understand how to design interactive
elements. Nor is it Hick's Law, which describes how long people take to make
decisions.
   It's Sturgeon's Law, which tells us that 99% of everything is crap. It's
easy to produce a poor quality result -- anyone without the critical skills is
capable of it and there are a ton of those people floating around.
   Yet if we want to be really excellent at what we do, what are those
essential skills? What should we be practicing to become a master?
   This is exactly the question we set out to answer as we studied the work of
the master UX professional. These masters were folks from all different
disciplines within the UX world-interaction design, information architecture,
user research, copywriting, and visual design. While they produced different
deliverables and end products, it was clear that each of the masters we talked
to had built their mastery upon some common skills -- skills that turn out to
be indispensable when they're trying to produce excellent results.

%W http://www.uie.com/articles/why_sketching
%X It seemed the conference room got brighter, as if, for the team staring at
the whiteboard, light bulbs just went on. There was a collective sense of
"Ohhh, I get it now."
   It was the culmination of a very confusing discussion, where everyone
thought they knew what they were talking about, but, as it turns out, nobody
was on the same page. In a moment of frustration, one junior team member -- a
designer -- stepped up to the whiteboard and declared, "This is what I think
we're talking about."
   Turns out the junior designer got it wrong. Yet his design spurred the
idea's progenitor to rush to the board, grab the pen, and quickly correct the
mistakes.
   That's when the group sighed their collective "ohhh" and the room lit up.
The shift had happened. Up until now, they were talking about WHAT they were
trying to do. Now, they could talk about HOW they would do it.
   The WHAT was now on the whiteboard -- and in everybody's head. For the first
time, it was the same WHAT everywhere

%X The PETRA Conference brings together different types of technology to
address an important social and healthcare issue: as the world's population
ages, there is growing interest in solutions for the in- home care of the
elderly as well as for the care of people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and
other disabilities or traumas. PETRA (which means "stone" in Greek) reflects
the needs of the domestic environment, or "Oikos" as it was known in ancient
Greece, but from a technological perspective. People's living environments are
particularly important in an increasingly crowded and complex world where the
need for inclusiveness and connectivity with the rest of the world is key.
PETRA addresses the fact that, as people grow older, they will increasingly
rely on technology to be able to stay in their homes.

%K hci-sites:articles

%X Recessions are a harrowing experience for everyone. Organizations turn their
inspection goggles on every project, looking for ways to cut costs and extract
more value. "Is this project doing what we need, right now?" becomes the
mantra, as everything comes under review.
   In design, it's no different. Inevitably, great design is about producing
both long and short term value for the organization. Something that is well
designed not only delights the users but shows up positively on the income
statement.
   We've been looking closely at the practices of some great organizations and
one of the common threads we see is how well they match their design goals to
the priorities of the business. This is especially important in tight economic
times, when the organizations are looking to cut anything that doesn't show
immediate value. The best teams have put this practice into place.

%W http://www.uie.com/articles/managethetasks/
%X For years, we've known about the importance of completing tasks. Not the
items on your to-do list -- the users' tasks.
   What we found in our research over the last 10 years is that practically
every measure of users' performance correlates strongly with the users
completing their task. Users who achieve their objective believe the web site
looks more professional, rate it as more fun, tell us it runs faster, and are
more satisfied with the site. There's no doubt: if you want users to love your
site, make sure they complete their tasks.
   Yet, even though we know task completion is important, many teams don't have
a strategy for it. They adopt a "launch and leave" approach to their sites,
moving on to the next project once they've pushed something out the door.

%X In this article, I tell a story about a client who found a way to
dramatically increase their e-commerce site's revenues with a couple of simple
changes. While the story is interesting, the story-behind-the-story is just as
interesting.
   The client had hired us because they were concerned about checkout-process
abandonment. Their analytics were showing a 13% drop off in sales, which, based
on the average value of the abandoned shopping carts, was worth about $1.2
million a year in additional revenue.
   Checkout-process abandonment is common in e-commerce sites and something
that you can easily detect with your site's usage logs. You just look at the
number of people who get to the first screen and then the number of people who
actually complete the transaction. Everyone who doesn't make it is an
abandonment.
   When the team contacted us, they'd already pretty much decided what the
problem was and how they were going to fix it, even though they had never
watched any shoppers make purchases. And they were dead wrong. Not only was
their fix not going to help, our research showed that it was going to increase
abandonment.

Appendix F: Comparative Timeline
%X The practice of using a social network to establish and enhance
relationships based on some common ground -- shared interests, related skills,
or a common geographic location -- is as old as human societies, but social
networking has flourished due to the ease of connecting on the Web. This OCLC
membership report explores this web of social participation and cooperation on
the Internet and how it may impact the library's role, including:
 * The use of social networking, social media, commercial and library services
   on the Web
 * How and what users and librarians share on the Web and their attitudes toward
   related privacy issues
 * Opinions on privacy online
 * Libraries' current and future roles in social networking
The report is based on a survey (by Harris Interactive on behalf of OCLC) of
the general public from six countries -- Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the
United Kingdom and the United States -- and of library directors from the U.S.
The research provides insights into the values and social-networking habits of
library users.

%X In 2008, OCLC conducted focus groups, administered a pop-up survey on
www.WorldCat.org (OCLC's freely available end user interface on the Web) and
conducted a Web-based survey of librarians worldwide.
   The Online Catalogs report presents findings from these research efforts.
The findings indicate, among other things, that although library catalogs are
often thought of as discovery tools, the catalog's delivery-related information
is just as important to end users.
   In addition, the report presents findings on:
 * The metadata elements that are most important to end users in determining if
   an item will meet his or her needs
 * The enhancements end users would like to see made in online library catalogs
   to assist them in consistently identifying appropriate materials
 * The enhancements librarians would recommend for online library catalogs to
   better assist them in their work
The findings indicate, among other things, that although library catalogs are
often thought of as discovery tools, the catalog's delivery-related information
is just as important to end users.

Summary
References
%X As of May 2008, there were 40.04 million unique users accessing the mobile
Internet at least once a month (Nielsen, 2008). This number increased by 73%
over a period of two years (i.e., 2006-2008). As the prevalence of PDA and
other smart devices with Internet connectivity increase, so does the need for
attention to the usability of these devices.
   Much of the body of Web usability literature has been done on computing in a
stationary environment. And although much of the existing research applies to
the mobile Web, some principles need to be altered to address the unique
problems associated with this form of Web access.

%X Eye tracking technology has been used many areas including visual systems,
cognitive linguistics, and product design. Newer technology is easier to use
and less invasive. Older equipment was head-mounted and more modern equipment
looks just like a monitor.
   Eye tracking is a useful tool for web design. It can show what areas of a
page are grabbing a user's attention and areas that are being ignored. Eye
tracking is useful in showing how a user searches for information.

%X Color blindness is the inability to perceive differences between some of the
colors that non-colored impaired users can distinguish (Wikipedia). Color
blindness affects about five to eight percent of males (approximately 10.5
million) and less than one percent of females. There are two major types of
color blindness: those who have difficulty between red and green, and those who
have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow.

Summary
References
%X There is some evidence to suggest that Web users are becoming more skeptical
of the information they find online. Many Web sites contain incorrect or
misleading information (Fogg, et al., 1999) [1] and some are pure hoaxes. As a
result, designers face increasing pressure to enhance the credibility of their
Web sites.
   According to Dictionary.com, credibility is defined as believability or
trustworthy. Tseng &amp; Fogg (1999) found that in their research believability
is a good synonym for credibility [2]. The academic literature on credibility
dates back to the 1950s and has to do with the fields of psychology and
communication. Scholars tend to agree that credibility is a perceived quality
and has two key components: trustworthiness and expertise.

%X Online trust is important whether you are trying to distribute information
or initiating online business transactions. Users decide whether they are going
to 'buy' your information (i.e., content) or your goods and services.
E-commerce relationships depend on trust and lack of trust has been identified
as one of the most formidable barriers in building online relationships.

new challenges, like directing users to their localized content. The Art of the
Global Gateway is your guide to the best practices in multilingual navigation. 
   A global gateway is the initial point of contact between your web site and
the world -- it is, in effect, a web user's first impression. To truly welcome
visitors to your web site, you'll need a welcoming global gateway.

%X Years ago, we came across the work of Noriaka Kano, a Japanese expert in
customer satisfaction and quality management. In studying his writing, we
learned about a model he created in the 1980s, known as the Kano Model.
   This model predicted the reaction of users as the key elements of Flickr's
personalized homepage propagated to other web sites. It predicted why users
were initially delighted and why the delight faded over time.
   We find the Kano Model to be an indispensable tool for designers. Let's take
the model apart, so we can understand why it's so useful.

%X This tip sheet offers research-based guidelines that can help you create
websites that work well for older adults, the fastest-growing group of Internet
users. Besides sending and receiving email, older adults search the web for
health, financial, and religious or spiritual information. They also use the
Internet to shop, play games, perform genealogy searches, and book travel. As
the baby boomers age, the number of older adults using the Internet will
continue to grow, and web designers will increasingly be called on to tailor
websites to this population.

%X Abstract information refers to information that a user can't directly obtain
just by visualizing the spatial information of objects in a 3D virtual
environment (3DVE). This thesis first reviews the state of the art on
interactive 3DVEs development, abstract information visualization techniques
and the evaluation of interactive 3DVEs. Then, this thesis presents a
conceptual model, reusable toolkit and usability evaluation methodology for
comparing the usability of different abstract information visualization
techniques. In order to control the navigation skill variable, the design of a
constrained navigation approach for teleporting the user from one user context
to another is proposed. Finally, this thesis presents case studies for
validating the proposed conceptual model, toolkit and usability evaluation
methodology by performing usability testing experiments. The contributions of
this thesis are a conceptual model, reusable toolkit and usability evaluation
methodology for measuring and comparing the usability of abstract information
visualization techniques in interactive 3DVEs.
