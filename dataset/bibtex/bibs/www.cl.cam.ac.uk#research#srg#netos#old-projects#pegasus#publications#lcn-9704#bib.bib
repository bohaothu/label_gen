For many years, people at SRC have been advocating (and using) concurrency 
mechanisms centred around the use of lightweight threads with "mutexes" 
and "condition variables".  These have been widely adopted, most 
recently as the basis for the Posix threads standard.  We've implemented 
mutexes and condition variables in a wide variety of situations: 
with simple coroutine-based emulations within a single-threaded Unix 
(TM) process, in microcoded implementations on uni-processors such 
the Alto, and on true multi-processors such as the Firefly.  Most 
recently, we implemented them in user processes on Windows NT (TM).  
Windows NT provides kernel-based threads, and its own set of synchronization 
primitives.  The mismatch between NT's primitives and ours is subtle: 
everyone I know who has tried to implement condition variables on 
top of Windows NT has got it wrong the first time (including myself).  
In the talk, I will describe the two sets of primitives (ours and 
NT's); I'll tempt you with some incorrect implementations; and I'll 
lead you through the design and evaluation of some correct ones. }

  abstract = 	 "The Synthesis distributed operating system combines
		  efficient kernel calls with a high-level, orthogonal
		  interface. The key concept is the use of a code
		  synthesizer in the kernel to generate specialised
		  (thus short and fast) kernel routines for specific
		  situations. We have three methods of synthesizing
		  code: Factoring Invariants to bypass redundant
		  computations; Collapsing Layers to eliminate
		  unnecessary procedure calls and context switches;
		  and Executable Data Structures to shorten data
		  structure traversal time. Applying these methods,
		  the kernel call synthesized to read /dev/mem takes
		  about 15 microseconds on a 68020 machine. A simple
		  model of computation called a synthetic machine
		  supports parallel and distribvuted processing. The
		  interface to synthetic machine consists of six
		  operations on four types of objects. This
		  combination of a high-level interface with the code
		  synthesizer avoids the traditional trade-off in
		  operating systems between powerful interfaces and
		  efficient implementations."
