Subj:	Identification of Oscillatoriales

Other people on the network have expressed interest in my request recently
on good sources of identification of Oscillatoriales, and demanded that I
inform them of the outcome. I am, therefore, posting in netwide.
There are a series of papers in Archiv. Fur Hydrobiologies (Algological
Studies that deal specifically with the revisions in cyanobacteria
identification.
1.Anagnostidis, K. & Komarek, J. 1988. Modern approach to the
classification system of cyanophytes. 3. Oscillatorialies. Archiv.
Hydrobio. Suppl. 80, 1-4 (Algological studies 50-53). 327-472.
2. Komarek, J. & Anagnostidis, K. 1989. Modern approach to the
classification system of cyanophytes. 4-Nostocales. Arch. Hydrobiol.
Suppl. 82,3 (Algological Studies 56). 247-345.
3. Anagnostidies, K. & Komarek, J. 1990. Mosern approach to the
classification system of cyanophytes. 5-Stigonematales. Algological
Studies 59: 1-73.
 
I have only the above 3 series. I dont know when the other series (1,2)
were published. These probably dealt with the remaining groups
e.g.Chroococcales.
 
In the course of my request, I discover that these works were consolidated
i.e. published into books. There are a series of publications from Balogh
Scientific Books on the groups which appeared to be the consolidated form.
All the series are in Algological Studies (Archiv. Fur Hydrobiologie. The
prices (as at now) are as follows:
1. Suppl. 71, 38/39 - Introduction (1985): $158 (US)
2. Suppl. 73, 43 - Chroococcales (1986): $125 (US)
3. Suppl. 80, 50/53 - Oscillatorialies (1988): $235 (US)
4. Suppl. 82, 3 - Nostocales (1989): $115 (US)
5. Suppl. 86, 59 : (1990): $90.00
It can cost fortune to possess all of them. I understand publishers NEVER
offer DEEP DISCOUNTS like "Buy 2 books in a series, and get a third in the
same series for e.g. half price, one-thrid price or free" So one has to
face it head long.
Those who want to purchase can contact Pamela to detailed info.
I hope this helps.
