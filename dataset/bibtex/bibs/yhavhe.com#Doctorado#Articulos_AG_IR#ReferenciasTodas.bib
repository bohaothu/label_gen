	abstract = {The aim of the paper is to describe the information retrieval model which retrieves information from text documents in natural language by neural networks. This model comes from the linguistic and conceptual approach for the analysis of text documents. The neural network model accepts the structure of conceptual, lingvistic
oriented model, where the problem of document database creation and document indexing for keyword determining is solved. Query entering uses the same mechanisms as document formalization for example document database creating method. Proposed structure of neural network model loses the problem of document retrieval on the base of user
question. However, learning algorithms and neural network invariancy is used by usage of neural networks, it is possible to decrease the complexity of language analysis algorithm computatation.},

	abstract = {Boosting and bagging are two techniques for improving the perfor-mance of learning algorithms. Both techniques have been successfully used in machine learning to improve the performance of classification algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks. In this paper, we focus on the use of feedforward back propagation neural networks for time series classification problems. We apply boosting and bagging with neural networks as base classifiers, as well as support vector machines and logistic regression models, to binary prediction problems with financial time series data. For boosting, we use a modified boosting algorithm that does not require a weak learner as the base classifier. A comparison of our results suggest that our boosting and bagging techniques greatly outperform support vector machines and logistic regression models for this problem. The results also show that our 1 techniques can reduce the prediction variance. Furthermore, we eval-uate our model on several stocks and indices using a trading strategy, and we are able to obtain very significant return on investment than the market growth rate. 1},
