 abstract = {n this paper a modified decision tree algorithm for anomaly detection is presented. During the tree building process, densities for the outlier class are used directly in the split point determination algorithm. No artificial counter-examples have to be sampled from the unknown class, which yields to more precise decision boundaries and a deterministic classification result. Furthermore, the prior of the outlier class can be used to adjust the sensitivity of the anomaly detector. The proposed method combines the advantages of classification trees with the benefit of a more accurate representation of the outliers. For evaluation, we compare our approach with other state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on four standard data sets including the KDD-Cup 99. The results show that the proposed method performs as well as more complex approaches and is even superior on three out of four data sets.},

 abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are today the most destabilizing factor in the global internet and there is a strong need for sophisticated solutions. We introduce a formal statistical framework and derive a Bayes optimal packet classifier from it. Our proposed practical algorithm "Adaptive History-Based IP Filtering" (AHIF) mitigates DDoS attacks near the victim and outperforms existing methods by at least 32% in terms of collateral damage. Furthermore, it adjusts to the strength of an ongoing attack and ensures availability of the attacked server. In contrast to other adaptive solutions, firewall rulesets used to resist an attack can be precalculated before an attack takes place. This ensures an immediate response in a DDoS emergency. For evaluation, simulated DDoS attacks and two real-world user traffic datasets are used.},

 abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mitigation systems usually generate a list of filter rules in order to block malicious traffic. In contrast to this binary decision we suggest to use traffic shaping whereas the bandwidth limit is defined by the probability of a source to be a legal user. As a proof of concept, we implemented a simple high performance Linux kernel module nf-HiShape which is able to shape thousands of source IP addresses at different bandwidth limits even under high packet rates. Our shaping algorithm is comparable to Random Early Detection (RED) applied on every single source IP range. The evaluation shows, that our kernel module can handle up to 50,000 IP ranges at nearly constant throughput whereas Linux tc already decreases throughput at about 200 ranges.},

 abstract = {In machine learning, picking the optimal classifier for a given problem is a challenging task. A recent research field called meta-learning automates this procedure by using a meta-classifier in order to predict the best classifier for a given dataset. Using regression techniques, even a ranking of preferred learning algorithms can be determined. However, all methods are based on a prior extraction of meta-features from datasets. Landmarking is a recent method of computing meta-features, which uses the accuracies of some simple classifiers as characteristics of a dataset. Considered as the first meta-learning step in RapidMiner, a new operator called landmarking has been developed. Evaluations based on 90 datasets, mainly from the UCI repository, show that the landmarking features from the proposed operator are useful for predicting classifiers' accuracies based on regression.},

 abstract = {This paper outlines some key software components developed in the Pattern Recognition Engineering (PaREn) project. The goal of the PaREn project was to create the methods and tools necessary allowing non-experts to use, train, test, and deploy pattern recognition and machine learning modules in real-world software systems. A major effort in the PaREn project was therefore automating parameter optimization, model selection, machine learning system construction, and supporting rapid testing, validation, and on-line adaptivity. To deliver our technologies as open source, we chose RapidMiner as the software platform. Therefore, major software components developed in PaREn are provided as RapidMiner extensions. The expected benefits are a far wider usage of pattern recognition and machine learning methods, leading to both better quality of the decisions and behaviors of software systems, as well as lower development costs.},

 abstract = {Besides the classification performance, the training time is a second important factor that affects the suitability of a classification algorithm regarding an unknown dataset. An algorithm with a slightly lower accuracy is maybe preferred if its training time is significantly lower. Additionally, an estimation of the required training time of a pattern recognition task is very useful if the result has to be available in a certain amount of time. Meta-learning is often used to predict the suitability or performance of classifiers using different learning schemes and features. Especially landmarking features have been used very successfully in the past. The accuracy of simple learners are used to predict the performance of a more sophisticated algorithm. In this work, we investigate the quantitative prediction of the training time for several target classifiers. Different sets of meta-features are evaluated according to their suitability of predicting actual run-times of a parameter optimization by a grid search. Additionally, we adapted the concept of landmarking to time prediction. Instead of their accuracy, the run-time of simple learners are used as feature values. We evaluated the approach on real world datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and StatLib. The run-time of five different classification algorithms are predicted and evaluated using two different performance measures. The promising results show that the approach is able to reasonably predict the training time including a parameter optimization. Furthermore, different sets of meta-features seem to be necessary for different target algorithms in order to achieve the highest prediction performances.},

 abstract = {Source IP addresses are often used as a major feature for user modeling in computer networks. Particularly in the field of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection and mitigation traffic models make extensive use of source IP addresses for detecting anomalies. Typically the real IP address distribution is strongly undersampled due to a small amount of observations. Density estimation overcomes this shortage by taking advantage of IP neighborhood relations. In many cases simple models are implicitly used or chosen intuitively as a network based heuristic. In this paper we review and formalize existing models including a hierarchical clustering approach first. In addition, we present a modified k-means clustering algorithm for source IP density estimation as well as a statistical motivated smoothing approach using the Nadaraya-Watson kernel-weighted average. For performance evaluation we apply all methods on a 90 days real world dataset consisting of 1.3 million different source IP addresses and try to predict the users of the following next 10 days. ROC curves and an example DDoS mitigation scenario show that there is no uniformly better approach: k-means performs best when a high detection rate is needed whereas statistical smoothing works better for low false alarm rate requirements like the DDoS mitigation scenario.},
