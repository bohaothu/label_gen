        Abstract = {We consider the computer network as a complex, interacting system and present a novel approach to representing anomalous events that occur within the network. This approach is essentially a form of intelligent data reduction that facilitates scalable monitoring of large systems. Specifically, we develop macrostate descriptions of complex networked systems in situations where exact microstate parameters of each element in the system preclude global understanding from first principles. This aids in identifying violations of network policy such as network attacks and misconfigurations. This approach has been verified in several environments. Example responses from network attacks simulated in the laboratory including those contained in the DARPA Lincoln Lab IDS test data as well as from operational network traffic are presented. These results suggest that our approach presents a unique perspective on anomalies in computer network traffic.},

  abstract = {When the probability of measuring a particular value of some quantity varies inversely as a power of that value, the quantity is said to follow a power law, also known variously as Zipf's law or the Pareto distribution. Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

 abstract = {While the evolution of biological networks can be modeled sensefully as a series of mutation and selection, evolution of other networks such as the social network in a city or the network of streets in a country is not determined by selection since there is no alternative network with which these singular networks have to compete. Nonetheless, these singular networks do evolve due to dynamic changes of vertices and edges. In this article we present a formal, analyzable framework for the evolution of singular networks. We show that the careful design of adaptation rules can lead to the emergence of network topologies with satisfying performance in polynomial time while other adaptation rules yield exponential runtime. We further show by example how the framework could be applied to some ad-hoc communication scenarios.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are very efficient tools to find a near-optimum solution in many cases. Until now they have been mostly used to find results but in this article we argue that evolutionary algorithms can also be used to simulate the evolution of complex systems. We model complex systems as networks in which agents are connected by edges if they interact with each other. It is known that many networks of this kind exhibit stable properties despite the dynamic processes they are subject to. We show here how evolutionary processes on complex systems can be modeled with a new kind of evolutionary algorithm which we have presented in [8]. We will show that some evolutionary processes within this framework yield networks with stable properties in reasonable time. An understanding of what kind of evolutionary processes will produce what kind of network properties in what time is vital to transfer evolutionary processes to technical ad-hoc networks in order to improve their flexibility and stability in quickly changing environments.},

Moreover, the collateral damage caused by infections can cripple the entire Internet. While harmful, such behaviors have historically been short-lived. We assert the future holds much more caustic malware. Attacks based on mutation and covert propagation are likely to be ultimately more damaging and long lasting. This assertion is supported by observations of natural systems, where similarly behaving parasites represent by far the most successful class of living creatures. This talk considers a parasite for the Internet, providing biological metaphors for its behavior and demonstrating the structure of pathogens. Through simulation, we show that even with low infection rates, a mutating pathogen will eventually infect an entire community. We posit the inevitability of such parasites, and consider ways that they can be mitigated.}

The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

  abstract={Motivated by the empirical analysis of the air transportation system, we define a network model that includes geographical attributes along with topological and weight (traffic) properties. The introduction of geographical attributes is made by constraining the network in real space. Interestingly, the inclusion of geometrical features induces non-trivial correlations between the weights, the connectivity pattern and the actual spatial distances of vertices. The model also recovers the emergence of anomalous fluctuations in the betweenness-degree correlation function as first observed by Guimer\`{a} and Amaral (2004 Eur. Phys. J. B 38 381). The presented results suggest that the interplay between weight dynamics and spatial constraints is a key ingredient in order to understand the formation of real-world weighted networks. },

In this framework, the in-degree ($k_{in}$) and the sum of incoming link weights ($v$) of an investor correspond to the number of assets held (\textit{portfolio diversification}) and to the invested wealth (\textit{portfolio volume}), respectively. An empirical analysis of three different real markets reveals that the distributions of both $k_{in}$ and $v$ display power-law tails with exponents $\gamma$ and $\alpha$. Moreover, we find that $k_{in}$ scales as a power-law function of $v$ with an exponent $\beta$. Remarkably, despite the values of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ differ across the three markets, they are always governed by the scaling relation $\beta=(1-\alpha)/(1-\gamma)$. We show that these empirical findings can be reproduced by a recent model relating the emergence of scale-free networks to an underlying Paretian distribution of ``hidden'' vertex properties. },

In this paper, we propose a new weighted evolving network model. Numerical simulations indicate that this network model yields three power-law distributions for the node degrees, connection weights and node strengths, respectively. Particularly, some other properties of the distributions, such as the droop-head and heavy-tail effects, can also be reflected by this model.},

In particular, we will review and develop further an auxiliary diffusive process on weighted networks that represents a powerful concept and tool for studying network (community) structures. The working principle of the method is the observation that the relaxation of the diffusive process toward the stationary state is non-local and fastest in the highly connected regions of the network. This can be used to acquire non-trivial information about the structure of clustered and non-clustered networks.}

Also, simulation results are consistent with theoretical predictions.

A virtue of the model is that its dynamics can be mapped onto those of a zero-range process with many species of interacting particles---an exactly solvable model of particles hopping between the sites of a lattice. This mapping, which is described in detail, guides the analysis of the steady state of the network model and leads to theoretical predictions for the conditions under which the different types of condensation may be observed. A further advantage of the mapping is that, by exploiting what is known about exactly solvable generalizations of the zero-range process, one can infer a number of generalizations of the network model and dynamics which remain exactly solvable.},

  year = {2006},
  month = {March},
  abstract = {In real networks complex topological features are often associated with a diversity of interactions as measured by the weights of the links. Moreover, spatial constraints may as well play an important role, resulting in a complex interplay between topology, weight, and geography. In order to study the vulnerability of such networks to intentional attacks, these attributes must be therefore considered along with the topological quantities. In order to tackle this issue, we consider the case of the world-wide airport network, which is a weighted heterogeneous network whose evolution and structure are influenced by traffic and geographical constraints. We first characterize relevant topological and weighted centrality measures and then use these quantities as selection criteria for the removal of vertices. We consider different attack strategies and different measures of the damage achieved in the network. The analysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are capable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at very low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight and traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of complex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key features in the finding and development of defensive strategies.},

  abstract = {A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections. Here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.},
