				Safe flocking in Euclidean spaces is a well-studied and difficult coordination problem. Motivated by real-world deployment of multi-agent systems, this paper studies one-dimensional safe flocking, where agents are afflicted by 
				actuator faults. An actuator fault is a new type of failure that causes an affected agent to be stuck moving with an arbitrary velocity. In this setting, first, a self-stabilizing solution for the problem is presented. This 
				relies on a failure detector for actuator faults. Next, it is shown that certain actuator faults cannot be detected, while others may require $O(N)$ time for detection. Finally, a simple failure detector that achieves the latter 
				bound is presented. Several simulation results are presented for illustrating the effects of failures on the progress towards flocking.},

			         Towards this end, we study the problem of distributed traffic control in a partitioned plane where the movement of all entities (vehicles) within each partition (or cell) is controlled by a single process.
			         We present a distributed traffic control protocol that guarantees minimum separation between vehicles at all times, even when some cell-processes fail by crashing.
			         Once failures cease, the protocol is guaranteed to stabilize and the packets with feasible paths to the target cell make progress towards it.
			         The algorithm relies on two general principles: local geographical routing, and temporary blocking for maintenance of safety.
				 Our proofs use mostly assertional reasoning and may serve as a template for analyzing other distributed traffic control protocols.
				 We also present simulation results which provide estimates of throughput as a function of velocity, safety separation, and path complexity.
				 Further, we present simulation results to estimate throughput as a function of failure and recovery rates.},

	abstract	=	{Fault-tolerance in distributed computing systems has been investigated extensively in the literature and has a rich history and detailed theory.
				 This thesis studies fault-tolerance for distributed cyber-physical systems (DCPS), where distributed computation is combined with dynamics of physical processes.
				 Due to their interaction with the physical world, DCPS may suffer from failures that are qualitatively different from the types of failures studied in distributed computing.
				 Failures of the components of DCPS which interact with the physical processes---such as actuators and sensors---must be considered. Failures in the cyber domain may interact with failures of sensors and actuators in adverse ways.

				 This thesis takes a first step in analyzing fault-tolerance in DCPS through the presentation of two case studies.
				 In each case study, the DCPS are modeled as distributed algorithms executed by a set of agents, where each agent acts independently based on information obtained from its communication neighbors and agents may suffer from various failures.
				 The first case study is a distributed traffic control problem, where agents control regions of roadway to move vehicles toward a destination, in spite of some agents' computers crashing permanently.
				 The second case study is a distributed flocking problem, where agents form a flock, or a roughly equally spaced distribution in one dimension, and move towards a destination, in spite of some agents' actuators becoming stuck at some value.

				 Each algorithm incorporates self-stabilization in order to solve the problem in spite of failures.
				 The traffic algorithm uses a local signaling mechanism to guarantee safety and a self-stabilizing routing protocol to guarantee progress.
				 The flocking algorithm uses a failure detector combined with an additional control strategy to ensure safety and progress.},
