@Book{ gareyJohnson:intract,
	abstract = "{This book's introduction features a humorous story of a man with a line of people behind him, who explains to his boss, ``I can't find an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people.'' This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems, namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice.<p> The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; <I>Computers and Intractability</I> does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems. (There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.) <I>Computers and Intractability</I> also contains a list of more than 300 problems--most of which are known to be NP-complete--with comments and references.}",
