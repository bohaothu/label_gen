        Some useful research on a distinctive type of bicycle facility. I
        still have mixed feelings on this design, although I can definitely
        imagine situations where it would be useful. The two major positive
        points are: it legitimizes cyclists taking the lane; improves distance
        between bicycles and door zone on streets where bicycles could not
        be otherwise accommodated. These are both major design achievements;
        I've spent some time thinking about these exact problems, and
        haven't come up with anything nearly as effective as this.
        
        However, I'm worried that this could be used as an
        excuse to not build bicycle lanes. A properly designed
        bicycle lane and parking zone should leave a buffer between parking
        and cyclists, and is more inviting on busy streets than a shared
        lane could be. Furthermore, a bicycle lane gives cyclists a real
        speed advantage in congested traffic: their lane might be empty
        while vehicle lanes are bumper-to-bumper.

        The report shows that these
        markings encourage drivers to give bikes more clearance when
        passing, and gives bicycles the comfort margin needed to get them
        out of the dooring zone. Unfortunately, they don't address the
        issue of pavement markings to encourage parked cars to stay close
        to the curb, which is also an important part of the story.

        Interesting data, but hard to draw many conclusions. The regression
        model's pooling of data is very dodgy... the 1982--1992 data points
        and 1992--1997 likely have correlated error terms. I imagine the
        data has issues, too---I'm wary of urban density figures,
        particularly when they don't define them carefully and had to
        analyse every area in the United States.
        
        There are interesting insights, though, particularly regarding Hawaii,

        adequate infrastructure... but includes ``high level-of-service

        Interesting. This is one of the first thorough, scientific attempts
        at understanding cycling accidents that I've seen. The sampling
        methodology is always tricky, and their approach here is certainly
        not perfect. I would have liked to see questions about the type of
        facility where falls/collisions happened in their survey---this
        seems like vital information. The actual dataset also has its
        problems: only a small fraction of total exposure was on paths or
        sidewalks (6\%). Additionally, the study area only contains a small
        amount of path facilities (74km), and from what I know of Toronto
        paths, most were built quite a long time ago and are very poorly
        designed and maintained. Many sections of the Martin Goodman
        waterfront trail were horrific when I rode it to work in 1999, and
        there are some really dodgy sections in the Don Valley system.

        But otherwise, the study methodology is fairly sound, and the
        authors are suitably conservative in their conclusions. I don't
        fully understand their weighting system, but I'll reread that at
        some point.

        Overall, I'd be very hesitant to condemn paths or sidewalks on the
        basis of a study like this. Sidewalks definitely have problems, but
        this study really only shows that badly designed/maintained paths
        are unsafe---not a surprise, really. And it says nothing at all
        about the ``bicycle segregation'' debate, despite popular citations
        on Wikipedia for that purpose.

        Some good notes on the airline industry, which is often ignored in
        analyses of sustainable transportation. Leisure travel is a major
        and growing part of the airline business. Airlines are often in a
        privileged position in terms of taxes, and have few incentives to
        reduce externalities.
        
        ``When thinking about measures to achieve
        sustainable transport, there are some (like pricing) that are
        common to all futures. Such measures need to be implemented now,
        even though their impacts might be slow in the initial stages. For
        example, the UK government has increased the costs of driving
        through raising fuel duty by at least 5 per cent in real terms
        each year. In the transport sector, this is the main policy
        being pursued to meet the Kyoto reduction targets for CO2
        emissions. Over the past six years, this has increased the
        price of a litre of fuel from 45 pence to 85 pence (1994-2000),
        of which 70 pence is tax and duty. The escalator has been removed
        (2000) after pressure from industry and other interests,
        particularly those in rural areas.''

        The risk perception and behavior of elderly pedestrians and
        cyclists in cities in Denmark have been revealed by means of a
        questionnaire administered to both elderly people aged 70 and
        above and a control group aged 40--49, and interviews with some
        of the elderly respondents. The elderly appreciate pedestrian
        crossings, signalized intersections and cycle paths
        significantly more than the control group does. To a larger
        extent they feel that it is dangerous to cross the road where
        these facilities are missing. Furthermore, the elderly
        pedestrians find the presence of a sidewalk very important on
        their route whereas the control group more often chooses the
        fastest route. Differences within the group of elderly
        respondents can be related to differences in health and
        physical abilities rather that to differences in age.
        Generally, the elderly road users state a more cautious
        behavior in specific traffic situations than the control group.
        Thus, a significantly higher proportion of the elderly than the
        control group choose to walk up to a pedestrian crossing if
        they can see one and stop the bicycle before turning left, and
        a significantly lower proportion of the elderly choose to cross
        at a red light, ride on the sidewalk and ride in the opposite
        direction on the cycle path.

        The fundamental dilemma in attempts to make urban development less
        dependent upon mobility by car is the inability of alternatives
        to match the quality of accessibility provided by private
        motorized transport. Failure to recognize this means that
        bringing about environmentally more sustainable urban mobility
        patterns is only possible at economic, social, and political
        costs that are unacceptable in most societies. In this paper we
        identify and discuss ways out of this dilemma, in the form of
        solutions that pursue the goal of increasing both
        sustainability and accessibility. We start by contending that
        what people ask is not a generic mobility, but rather
        opportunities to participate in spatially disjointed
        activities. Accordingly, accessibility should be defined as the
        amount and the diversity of 'spatial opportunities' that can be
        reached within a certain amount of time. Solutions to the
        accessibility - sustainability dilemma building upon this
        perspective (that is, planning concepts, policy measures) have
        been the object of recent research at the Universiteit van
        Amsterdam and are discussed and we look for, and find, evidence
        of the feasibility of these solutions in the actual trends in
        the Amsterdam urban region. Some policy implications of the
        findings are discussed.

        They define accessibility as the ``amount of `spatial opportunities'
        that can be reached within a certain amount of time,'' an idea that
        matches my intuition. They base this on three assumptions about
        human behaviour: (a) For the most part people travel not just for
        the sake of it, but in order to participate in spatially disjointed
        activities (for example, living, working, shopping, visiting in
        different places); (b) People want to have a choice among as large
        a number and as diverse a range of activities as possible; (c)
        Travel costs, and particularly travel time rather than travel
        distance, set a limit to these possibilities (in the form of total
        daily travel-time budgets, travel-to-work time budgets, etc.). They
        also aim for a synergy with sustainability, and express their goal
        as ``Developing conditions for as large as possible a share of the
        more environmentally friendly modes in urban mobility, while at the
        same time maintaining, and possible increasing, the amount and the
        diversity of activity places that can be reached within an
        acceptable travel time.'' They note that ``only activities with
        middle to high spatial reach and low intensity of use (for example,
        living, working, or recreating in low densities) are best served by
        the car system''... which would include hiking, I suppose. ``[T]he
        most significant policy dealing with car environments has been the
        regulation of parking allowance, which has proved an invaluable
        tool in managing the accessibility of locations, most notably
        within the municipality of Amsterdam.'' They close with an
        interesting note: they call the transport system the supply of
        mobility, and land-use patterns are the origin of the demand for
        mobility. It's an interesting and relevant labelling.

        I didn't get much new from this paper... but there were some good

        It is interesting to see two authors with economics backgrounds
        write on this subject, and state that highway systems redistribute
        growth rather than create it---not the view that's taken by many
        provincial transportation agencies. That said, American cities are
        generally starting from a higher level of highway provision than
        Canadian cities.

        I remain annoyed by the tendency (everywhere in the literature)
        to discount highways' effect on
        decentralisation. Yes, they are not a sufficient condition for
        decentralising---but they are still a necessary condition! If you
        don't build the highway, the ability to decentralise is extremely
        limited.

        Some interesting discussions on infill development. I found his
        description of centre-city abandonment interesting: ``premature
        write-down of the existing built environment.'' That particular
        economic spin on downtown decay summarizes my intuitive dislike for
        rundown centre city buildings. Consider a Victorian or Edwardian
        storefront in downtown Toronto: these are considered too expensive to
        build today in new neighbourhoods, and yet we let the existing
        stock of (valuable!) buildings decay in many parts of the city.

        Bourne discusses an interesting model from Klaassen and van den
        Burg (over many papers). They characterize urban evolution in four
        stages: 1) urbanization; 2) outmigration; 3) disurbanization; and
        4) reurbanization. It's an interesting breakdown for recent urban
        history, particularly in Canadian cities that are generally in
        phase four now.

        Bourne also discusses the poor information/data available on
        single-lot infill sites in cities, and some strange strategies to
        combat urban decay, like Detroit's empowerment/enterprise zone in
        its centre.

        Reallocating roadspace from general traffic, to improve conditions
        for pedestrians or cyclists or buses or on-street light rail or
        other high-occupancy vehicles, is often predicted to cause
        major traffic problems on neighbouring streets. This
        paper reports on two phases of research, resulting in
        the examination of over 70 case studies of roadspace
        reallocation from eleven countries, and the collation
        of opinions from over 200 transport professionals
        worldwide. The findings suggest that predictions of
        traffic problems are often unnecessarily alarmist, and
        that, given appropriate local circumstances,
        significant reductions in overall traffic levels can
        occur, with people making a far wider range of
        behavioural responses than has traditionally been
        assumed. Follow-up work has also highlighted the
        importance of managing how schemes are perceived by
        the public and reported in the media, with various
        lessons for avoiding problems. Finally, the
        findings highlight that well-designed schemes to
        reallocate roadspace can often contribute to a
        multiplicity of different policy aims and

        There is a critical need for a new paradigm of growth on undeveloped

        without always by-passing commercial centers - a road network that
        reinforces access to walkable neighborhoods and urban town centers
        without cutting them off from local pedestrian movement. A plan for new
        growth areas around Chicago proposes 3 types of major roads to replace
        the standard arterial grid: transit boulevards, throughways, and
        arterials. The transit boulevards combine the capacity of a major
        arterial with the intimacy of local frontage roads and the pedestrian
        orientation that comes with the transit system. Local arterials are
        multi-lane facilities that transition into a couplet of main streets at
        the village centers.

        This paper is the best I've read on the jobs-housing issue, with
        a careful distinction between balance and containment, an
        examination of balance-with-mismatch, and a more careful analysis
        of the impacts on VMT and mode split.

        One finding that interested me: balance was not correlated
        with a substantial change in VMT, but containment was (and was also
        correlated with higher levels of walking). Another interesting
        conclusion: imbalance is a planning failure, not a market failure,
        since it usually happens in jobs-surplus areas where residents
        apply political pressure (read: NIMBYism) to fight any
        market-driven changes to the residential stock.

        I liked the description of jobs-housing balance as the potential for
        self-containment. I see the actual level of self-containment to be
        a function of two variables: jobs-housing balance, and travel
        times. Jobs-housing balance allows a city to easily respond to
        congestion or degraded travel times, by giving workers the option
        of moving closer to their jobs.

        Claims that roadway investments spur new travel, known as induced

        thwarted road development in the United States. Past studies
        point to a significant induced demand effect. This research
        employs a path model to causally sort out the links between
        freeway investments and traffic increases, using data for 24
        California freeway projects across 15 years. Traffic increases
        are explained in terms of both faster travel speeds and land
        use shifts that occur in response to adding freeway lanes.
        While the path model confirms the presence of induced travel in
        both the short and longer run, estimated elasticities are lower
        than those of earlier studies.  This research also reveals
        significant ``induced growth'' and ``induced investment''
        effects---real estate development gravitates to improved
        freeways, and traffic increases spawn road investments over
        time. Travel-forecasting models are needed that account for

        A good study looking at the factors influencing cycling and
        walking. The perspective is Cervero's usual framework, the three Ds:
        density, diversity and design. All three are found to have significant
        influences on bicycle usage, with the residential end being
        slightly more important. Of the urban form variables, the presence
        of neighbourhood retail is found to be the strongest predictor of
        walking.

        From an evaluation standpoint, I wish these authors would
        standardize/normalize the coefficients of their models! After
        limiting to statistically significant variables, normalization
        would allow me to compare the relative influence of each
        variable on bicycle usage. It would also be extremely useful to
        include the mean and standard deviation of all input variables, to
        allow some rough comparisons to other study areas. If the input
        data has low variance (e.g., a uniformly low-density suburb),
        meaningful patterns could be missed.

        Finally, the bicycle model seems pretty shoddy---the rho-squared
        value is only 0.13! Since it only considers factors at origin and
        destination, I imagine it's missing a massive amount of valuable
        data, like the topography, safety and quality of the route itself.

        The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along
        three principal dimensions -- density, diversity, and design.
        This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ``3Ds''
        affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San
        Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use
        records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories,
        and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the
        built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per
        household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor
        analysis is used to linearly combine variables in the density
        and design dimensions of the built environment. The research
        finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented
        designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto
        travel in statistically significant ways, though their
        influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between
        variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures
        of travel demand are generally in the .06 to .18 range,
        expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert
        the strongest influence on personal business trips.
        Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, was most
        strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while
        a factor capturing ``walking quality'' was only moderately
        related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in
        neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted
        commercial parking were nonetheless found to average
        significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on
        single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this
        research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of
        the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate,
        though certainly not inconsequential. Thus is supports the
        contention of new urbanists and others that creating more
        compact, diverse, and pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, in
        combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.

        A comparison of trends 1980--1990 in Southern California and the

        the data from the Netherlands didn't really bear out their thesis:
        trips were generally getting quicker and both cycling and transit
        mode share were rising, despite growing auto ownership. They did
        make an interesting distinction between different forms of
        polycentric development: an ``archipelago'' with nodes in an urban
        sea (Los Angeles) versus ``spheres of interest'' where primary
        nodes have secondary nodes in their sphere (or orbit), and
        essentially partition the region (Netherlands).

        This Monitor first updates energy matters discussed in previous
        Monitors. The updating concludes that reducing transport fuel
        use should be the overriding goal of Canada's transport
        policies, more important than reducing greenhouse gas
        emissions, and perhaps a better strategy for making progress
        towards sustainable transport.

        This issue then discusses three of the many ways in which
        transport fuel use could be dramatically reduced. The first
        would allow short-term gains. It is to make more efficient use
        of trucks on the road. The second would have its main impacts
        in the medium term. It is to achieve major reductions in fuel
        use by new personal vehicles. The third is for the longer term.
        It is to secure much greater use of tethered vehicles (which
        get their energy from a rail or wire rather than from
        an on-board source such as a gasoline tank, a hydrogen
        storage device or a battery).

        A good overview of the full breadth of equity issues in
        transportation planning. A few distinctive points: 1) access to
        health care is often ignored. 2) Residential dispersal is a valid
        solution to spatial mismatch, but transportation is usually touted
        as the politically easier solution instead. My thoughts: in some ways,
        providing
        subsidised transit connections for reverse commutes is a subsidy to
        suburbanising businesses, giving them access to low-wage employees
        at a low-cost location. Without that access, they might choose to
        locate closer to low-wage workers. 3) In addition to poor/rich
        urban/suburban, short trip/long trip cross-subsidies, there are also
        peak/off-peak trip cross-subsidies: off-peak travellers (e.g.,
        low income midnight shift workers, part-time workers) do not
        require the expensive ``peaked'' service of the regular workday.
        (To be fair, late night service is also often heavily subsidised.)
        4) The rationale for federal/state funding of transit projects in
        suburban areas, despite inefficiency: suburbs pay a substantial chunk
        of taxes, and need to see some returns. If the funds didn't go
        through a federal level, this might not be an issue: cities could
        fund their own transit projects... 5) The environmental justice
        discussion is interesting, particularly the details of the various
        Bus Riders' Unions. 6) Rich drivers generate more pollution than
        poor drivers, both from longer trips and from lower fuel
        efficiency.

        Interesting ideas:
            
        C10 (New types of designs for bus stops) describes
        some interesting ways of designing bus stops to reduce conflicts
        with cyclists. In one of the options, the bicycle lane is against
        the curb, but the bus does not pull into the curb to let passengers off.
        Instead, it stops in its lane, and passengers walk across the bicycle
        lane. To help them, zebra crossings are marked across the bicycle lane
        at the bus doors. I think this design is only needed because buses in
        Denmark are not allowed to pull up to the curb when there is a bicycle
        lane. C17a-b (Two-way bicycle traffic in one-way streets in Belgium and
        the Netherlands) gives some interesting background on the effectiveness
        of this desirable tactic in those countries, and includes some useful
        signs used there. C18 (two-way traffic on cycle tracks) makes the
        interesting point that two-way tracks can be good solutions when there
        are many T juntions on one side of the street, but few on the other
        (e.g., next to rail tracks or water).

        The crossings section is excellent: all of C19--C32 are worth
        reading. These ideas are first-rate, and few of them have been
        adopted in North America, from what I've seen. These are some of
        the biggest issues that I have with current design on this
        continent. I liked their use of the term ``cycle crossing'' 
        where the bike lane/path is marked through an intersection.

        The parking section (C33--C38) isn't too revolutionary. There are a
        few interesting details of free public bicycle programmes, and
        company bicycle programmes in C40--C42. The rest of the policy
        section (C39--C44) was unexciting, and likewise for the education
        section (C45--C52).

        The organisation section had some interesting ideas. C53 discusses
        bicycles on public transport (mainly commuter rail routes) in
        Copenhagen. C56 (``BikeBusters'') describes a programme where committed
        car drivers were given a free bike, free bus tickets for a year, and
        asked to fill in trip diaries and track their weight and cholesterol. 
        Others describe bike-to-school programmes, bicycle courier
        companies, and priority snow cleaning.

        Some surveys indicate that providing bicycle lanes and paths may
        encourage more people to commute by bicycle. The presence of a
        striped lane or separated path can increase a cyclist's
        perception of safety. With growing concerns over traffic
        congestion and vehicle pollution, public policy makers are
        increasingly promoting bicycling as an alternative for
        commuting and other utilitarian trip purposes. State and local
        spending on bicycle facilities has increased significantly over
        the past decade. Previous studies have linked higher levels of
        bicycle commuting to various demographic and geographic
        variables. At least one analysis showed that cities with higher
        levels of bicycle infrastructure (lanes and paths) witnessed
        higher levels of bicycle commuting. Research was conducted that
        affirms that finding by analyzing data from 43 large cities
        across the United States. This cross-sectional analysis
        improves on previous research by including a larger sample of
        cities, not including predominantly college towns, and using
        consistent data from the Bureau of the Census 2000 Supplemental
        Survey. Although the analysis has limitations, it does support
        the assertion that new bicycle lanes in large cities will be
        used by commuters.

        Promotion of more and safer bicycle traffic produces healthier road
        users and helps to create better towns. Collection of Cycle
        Concepts presents some ideas on how to increase the use of
        bicycles and how to prevent bicycle accidents.

        The growth in car traffic is creating environmental problems
        and congestion. Compared to other countries in Europe traffic
        problems in Denmark are still modest. An important explanation
        for this is the development in the course of the last century
        of a robust bicycle culture. Today, one trip out of five in
        Denmark is by bicycle.

        The future role of the bicycle must also be strong in order to create a
        sustainable society. It is important to develop and infrastructure that
        permits the optimal exploitation of the bicycle's qualities and
        possibilities.

        A larger share of the short trips in towns can take place by
        bicycle. The car is often indispensable on longer trips. The
        bicycle can not be alone.  Intermodality is important. The right
        balance of good roads and paths for pedestrians, cyclists and
        motorists can create better towns without losing the interaction
        between modes of transport.

        The bicycle can more often be used as feeder traffic for coach,
        bus, train and plane on longer trips. This calls for safe an
        functional access roads and terminals with good
        possibilities for interchanges.

        Not only road administrations, but also companies, institutions,
        schools associations ets, must contribute to changing our attitudes
        to transport and making it more acceptable to cycle. The
        individual advantages are big. Half an hour's cycling daily
        increases our mean life expectancy by 1--2 years and gives
        better quality of life, both physically and mentally.

        There are many measures that can be taken to improve cyclist
        safety. In spite of this, the accident risk for Danish cyclists has
        not changed over the past 25 years. It is necessary to approach the
        problem more systematically and introduce proposed solutions and
        places and among target groups where they will have the greatest
        impact.

        The main challenge is promoting more and safer bicycle traffic is
        the need to implement a wide range of measures simultaneously. I
        therefore invite the reader to consider the many ideas contained in
        Collection of Cycle Concepts---and be inspired of those ideas,
        which apply to local conditions.

        This is probably the best bicycle planning guide I've run into so
        far. Throroughly recommended for anyone interested in these issues,
        and for anyone already involved in bicycle planning or advocacy.

        Some of the good stuff: route sweeping, every 2--8 weeks, plus extra
        autumn service to deal with leaves and a special service for
        weekends to deal with broken glass near nightlife zones (p.~123);
        ``cycle crossings,'' where pavement markings are extended through
        an intersection to reduce conflicts with turning motor vehicles
        (p.~89); advanced stop lines; cute advertisements (p.~37); signage
        (pp.~102-105); effect of distance on mode choice (p.~46);
        discussion of the need for small shops (p.~46); graph showing how
        age affects cycling speed and distance (p.~12); wheel ramp on
        stairs (p.~95); bike parking maps (p.~108), with symbols for
        covered/uncovered and number of spaces.

        Interesting, with some good statistics. The author shows that if
        transportation and housing costs are combined, total spending
        amounts to 47--57\% of income across almost all of the United States.
        The split between transport and housing varies dramatically, of course,

        building an auto-dependent region; you're just choosing a different

        After a quick read, my main criticism regards their choice of
        neighbourhood variables. I am not convinced that they are capturing
        ``walkability'' in their coarse residential sprawl index or
        ``mixed-use'' index. While these two variables are intended to
        capture density and diversity (ignoring design), they ignore the
        work environment and probably do a poor job of measuring the
        residential environment. They also tried using the Smart Growth America
        sprawl index, but this index is not local enough to capture
        the necessary neighbourhood-scale effects.

        Additionally, I have to wonder about their sample---how many
        walkable environments were actually sampled? In the US, an
        unstratified sampling strategy would not include many walkable
        locations.

        Finally, I have to wonder about time lags: their model only
        captures a change in BMI in the year following a move (when a
        change in sprawl/mixed use is observed). What about subsequent years?

        That said, these weaknesses are present in many other papers in the
        literature, and they do bring some interesting perspectives and
        methodology to the table. The inclusion of occupation variables
        associated with strength and strenuousness was a valuable addition
        to modelling in this area. I'd need to read the paper more closely
        before I'd be prepared to defend my complaints, really.

        An excellent summary and rebuttal of the critiques of New Urbanism,
        with a very solid bibliography thrown in for good measure.

        Good quotes:
        
        ``Neoclassical economics is presented as a neutral methodology,
        when it actually prescribes a political theory favouring individual
        self-interest and consumerism over public-spirited behaviour and
        deliberative political choices.''

        ``[...] New Urbanism will not abolish traffic congestion. But all
        congestion is not equal. San Francisco and Paris have congestion,
        but the streets are alive, the quality of life is high, and
        alternatives to driving are plentiful. As many New Urbanists have
        pointed out, the worst-case scenario is really congestion in the
        suburbs, where the landscape is openly hostile to pedestrians and
        transit service is minimal.''

        ``Andr\'{e}s Duany has trenchantly argued that it makes no sense to
        throw away all of our town-planning traditions in the vain hope
        that a few architectural masterpieces will result. This has
        produced `an appalling win-loss ratio', with hundreds of disasters
        littering the landscape for every masterpiece produced.''

        A good counterpoint to Gordon \& Richardson's article. My one
        regret with this article: because the author tries to stick to
        a clearly defensible urban form, and because he tries to avoid seeming
        ``hopelessly European or Canadian,'' his definition of a
        ``compact'' urban form is actually quite low-density and sprawling
        by any other nation's standards. He advocates a density of about 4
        units per acre, which is below the level required to support even
        one bus every half hour.

        findings are compared to previous studies to demonstrate how
        policies and practices have evolved as the field has matured.
        The jurisdictions were surveyed regarding traffic calming
        program staffing, budgets, controversies and litigation.
        Process issues such as project initiation,
        prioritization/resource allocation, public approval, road user
        needs and technical issues such as street eligibility were also

        greater reliance on private financing of construction, more public
        involvement in planning through neighborhood traffic
        committees, limited expansion of eligibility beyond local

        I was surprised by the tiny amount of money devoted to traffic
        calming in the jurisdictions they surveyed: only \$80,000 total in

        public works department fund. They note that most projects are
        resident-initiated, rather than being identified by staff. Most
        cities prioritize projects using reasonable criteria: speed,
        volume, collisions, proximity to schools/hospitals/parks, ped/bike
        volumes, density, street width, and sidewalks are sometimes used.

        Planning faces the predicament that as recommendations become
        bolder possibilities for implementation deteriorate. This is
        imputed to society's transition from a Fordist and modern to a
        post-Fordist and postmodern era. On the one hand, postmodern
        values account for more public participation and heightened
        environmental sensitivity, which translate into proposals for
        alternative forms of urban development. On the other hand, the
        implementation of these proposals is impaired by reduced public
        sector resources as a result of the economic instability
        associated with post-Fordism. Another impediment is the
        difficulty to achieve sufficient support for planning
        objectives in the postmodern context. This context is marked by
        a fragmentation of values, attachment to the existing built
        environment, and suspicion between social groups. The empirical
        focus is on Toronto's bold metropolitan planning proposals.
        Most recent planning documents call for reurbanization efforts,
        a compact urban form, and reduced reliance on the car. In this
        paper I cast doubts, however, on the eventual actualization of
        these proposals by highlighting weaknesses in the present
        and anticipated implementation context. These are tied to
        factors that are specific to Toronto, but also to a greater
        extent to the post-Fordist and postmodern environment.

        A few interesting ideas. He argues that the postmodern attachment of
        value to public participation and plural views could undermine
        processes aimed at changing suburban form to better accommodate
        plurality. He suggests that NIMBYism arises from suspicion
        between factions in a fractured society, and this will in turn
        hinder changes to existing urban form (infill, etc.) and favour
        greenfield development where such arguments can be avoided. In the
        light of his arguments, I find policies such as urban growth
        boundaries more appealing: they prevent greenfield alternatives and
        force NIMBYism to be confronted directly. Toronto already seems to
        be headed in this direction, as social housing projects are
        increasingly recognised as necessary and located in all wards, instead
        of being fought off by all wards.

        political, economic and value environment. After drawing lessons
        from the lack of success of attempts at altering urban development
        over the last thirty years, the article proposes two smart growth
        strategies. To maintain their implementation potential and capacity
        to modify urbanization trends, the strategies avoid clashes with
        entrenched preference patterns and powerful interest groups. The
        first strategy consists in an expansion of the high-density
        transit-oriented compact urban realm into the ambient low-density
        car-dependent dispersed realm. The second strategy involves the
        creation of mixed-use high-density corridors, hospitable to transit
        use and walking, within newly urbanized areas.

        The solutions he presents are not new at all, but the political

        The paper compares density patterns of the three largest Canadian
        metropolitan regions with those of a sample of 12 U.S. urban areas
        with comparable populations. It verifies if such patterns support
        claims of Canadian urban distinctiveness prevalent within this
        country's research literature. Findings indicate that regional
        differences among U.S. cities are as important as cross-national
        distinctions. Measures of centrality and overall density place
        observed Canadian metrpolitan areas within the same category as
        older U.S. East Coast metropolitan areas. Inter-city comparisons of
        historically and geographically defined zones suggest a period of
        cross-national convergence before World War II, when the inner city
        was developed, followed by a period of divergence from the 1940s to
        the 1970s, when the inner suburb was built. The development of the
        outer suburb, which began in the early 1970s, marks a return to
        cross-national convergence. These results question the continued
        relevance of the literature on the distinctiveness of Canadian
        urbanization.

        Very interesting. They find that Canadian cities, as a group, do
        stand out from American cities---they are denser overall (than
        American cities of comparable size), and denser in their cores and
        inner suburbs. In the outer suburbs, however, densities are
        indistinguishable from American cities. Beyond that, however,
        Canadian cities have much smaller exurban regions than their
        American counterparts. They fit a cubic polynomial
        to the density/distance-from-CBD graph, and don't find Canadian
        cities to be as distinctive in that measure; I'm not sure how solid
        their analysis there is, though (haven't read it closely enough). 
        Generally, the Canadian cities are distinctive as a group, since
        all of the major Canadian cities are dense, but are generally
        similar to northeastern American cities. The U.S. just has a wider
        variety of cities. ``Our work does not so much refute the
        perspective espoused by the Canadian urban specificity literature
        as situate it historically and geographically. According to zonal
        findings and events that have marked the evolution of cities in the
        two countries, most of the noted cross-national differences can be
        linked to the period that ran from the end of World War II to the
        1970s.'' Overall, I don't think their results justify the final
        sentence of their abstract (repeated in their introduction); I
        think Canadian cities are quite distinctive. In particular, they
        don't discuss exurban trends very much, although these are a very
        significant part of American city development today: the Canadian
        cities have only 18 percent of their population in exurban areas,
        while the American cities are clustered closer to 30 percent, with
        some as high as 50 percent (Atlanta, Boston).

        Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and
        around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and
        aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated
        empirically at the individual level.
        Objective

        To evaluate the relationship between the built environment
        around each participant's place of residence and self-reported
        travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index
        (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity
        classifications.

        Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked,
        age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived
        through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta,
        Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential
        density, and street connectivity were developed within a
        1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of
        residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban
        form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related
        activity when adjusting for sociodemographic covariates.
        Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity.
        The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was
        conducted in 2004.

        Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMI>=30
        kg/m^2), with each quartile increase being associated
        with a 12.2\% reduction in the likelihood of obesity across
        gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per
        day was associated with a 6\% increase in the likelihood of
        obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day
        was associated with a 4.8\% reduction in the likelihood of
        obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly
        associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships
        among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were
        stronger among white than black cohorts.

        Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are
        important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity,
        yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and
        weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to
        increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time
        in a car can be effective as health interventions.

        A very useful addition to the debates on urban form. I'm a fan of
        anything bring active transportation into the debate, rather than
        just trying to reduce SOV trips. I'm curious about why they
        found land-use mix and walking distance to be statistically
        independent influences on obesity. Their speculation that it may
        be related to nutrition (and so-called ``food deserts'') is an
        interesting idea.

        Findings from an empirical analysis to test the impacts of land-use
        mix, population density, and employment density on the use of the
        single-occupant vehicle (SOV), transit and walking for both work
        trips and shopping trips are presented. The hypothetical
        relationships tested focused on whether there is a relationship
        between urban form and modal choice, whether this relationship
        exists when controlling for non-urban form factors, whether this
        relationship is linear or nonlinear, and whether a stronger
        relationship exists between modal choice and urban form when they
        are measured at both trip ends as opposed to either the origin or
        the destination. A review of the literature and experiences
        suggested that a fair amount of information is known about the
        impacts of density on mode choice. However, considerable debate
        exists over whether density itself is actually the causal stimulus
        or a surrogate for other factors. To address this issue a data base
        was developed with a comprehensive set of variables for which
        density may be a proxy, for example, demographics and level of
        service. This analysis employed a correlational research design in
        which mode choice was compared among census tracts with differing
        levels of density and mix. Findings from this research indicate
        that density and mix are both related to mode choice, even when
        controlling for non-urban form factors for both work trips and
        shopping trips. Furthermore, the relationship between population
        and employment density and mode choice for SOV, transit and walking
        is nonlinear for both work and shopping trips. Transit usage and
        walking increase as density and land-use mix increase, whereas SOV
        usage declines. The findings from this research suggest that
        measuring urban form at both trip ends provides a greater ability
        to predict travel choices than looking at trip ends separately. The
        findings also suggest that increasing the level of land-use mix at
        the trip origins and destinations is also related to a reduction in
        SOV travel and an increase in transit and walking.

        Solid research, with more convincing methodology than Sch96 (which
        I read at about the same time).

        Overall, the most interesting result of the paper is the
        demonstration of nonlinearity. Figures 2 and 3 of their paper show
        a graph of modal share vs. employment density, and vs. population
        density. These graphs show that major increases in bus/walk modes
        only happen at employment densities greater than 125
        employees/acre (work trips), or 13 residents/acre (shopping trips).
        The implications for policy are obvious: if you aren't going to
        reach those thresholds, you're wasting your time. Also, the
        employment graph shows substantial nonlinearity: between 75 and 125
        employees/acre, there is essentially no change in mode share.

        They also had some predictable results: walking trips were the most
        sensitive to increases in population density; it's worth
        considering densities at both trip ends (i.e., both residential
        population density and employment population density); etc.

        A good discussion of this issue, although it's admittedly not a
        topic I find particularly important.

        One possible reason why suburb-to-suburb commutes may wind up being
        relatively short: ``the relative homogeneity of suburban areas
        (making it easy to locate near one's job, or conversely negating any
        advantage of living far from one's job).''

        In general, I agree with most of the author's conclusions. I don't
        see jobs-housing balance as a central issue in transportation
        planning. I would aim more for diversity: providing a mixture of
        types of jobs and types of housing in every community. Aiming for
        an exact or near-exact balance is futile, as the author argues, but
        I believe that there is nonetheless a need to give people the
        option of locating near their jobs, which may not be provided
        automatically by the market. (See, for example, the absence of
        family-oriented condominiums in downtown Toronto, despite clear
        evidence of a demand after they were built in downtown Vancouver.)

        A very good article, covering the theory, the empirical tests, and
        the methodology involved in measuring land use impacts. Overall, I
        agree with most of the analysis, with the exception of the closing
        tirade against planners who support transit and oppose highway
        expansion.

        I found the discussion of the 1980 beltway study (PayBla80) quite
        interesting---54 U.S. cities, with and without beltway highways, to
        see what the impacts were on central cities. It's a good question
        about regional structure and urban form.

        There is one key difference between the highway studies and the
        transit studies cited: since the studies are American, the highways
        are in areas with no competing modes. As a result, presence/absence
        of a highway is an indication of the presence/absence of access,
        really, since the transit service is almost universally poorer than
        the road access. The transit facilities, by contrast, each
        represent fairly incremental improvements to access to areas that
        are already well-served by highways; furthermore, they are
        competing with highways, while the highway projects listed aren't
        really competing with transit. Finally, many of the transit
        facilities studied sound like examples of poor planning overall.

        Boarnet \& Chalermpong's 2001 study of toll roads in Orange County
        shows an example of a simple highway project providing access to an
        otherwise inaccessible region. If there was a comparable example of
        rail providing access to an empty hinterland (like streetcars at
        the turn of the century), it might make a fair comparison.
        
        For this reason, I'd like to look closer at Haider \& Miller's study
        in Toronto. It's a context where both modes are quite viable: rail
        and highways both attract significant customers. Absence of
        highways does not mean absence of access, since transit can fill that
        void; and vice versa.

        That said, the conclusions the author draws about highway impacts
        and transit impacts are somewhat fair. I would perhaps expand the
        field of impact of rail beyond the narrow corridor she ascribes
        to it---with feeder bus systems, a rail line can have impacts well
        beyond its immediate corridor.

        The one argument I would like to pursue further is the author's
        claim that transit systems should have a decentralising effect 
        similar to highways, since they provide access and allow people to
        access the centre quickly from a distance. From a theoretical
        perspective considering a single rail line, I agree with this;
        however, it ignores two important points: the focussing effect of
        transit, and the accessibility peaks at intersecting facilities.
        Mutually supportive transit+land use involves a concentration of
        activities along the transit corridor, focusing
        origins/destinations within a linear region. Highways do also have
        some focusing effects---hence the higher land values near
        interchanges. However, since the transit feeder mode is usually foot
        rather than car, a transit facility will tend to have a stronger
        focusing effect. This is not a direct argument against
        decentralisation, but it is a partial argument: the transit
        facility may allow radial decentralisation, but it will
        simultaneously encourage circumferential centralisation.

        Finally, when multiple transportation facilities intersect, there
        is a peaking of accessibility, providing a single focal point. This
        can be seen at the intersection of freeways, or the intersection of
        transit lines. It is here that transit can encourage radial
        centralisation: if multiple transit facilities intersect at the
        city centre, the accessibility peak created at that location could
        potentially counter the decentralising effects of the individual
        transit lines. Transit probably has more potential for centralising
        than highways do, since more than two transit facilities can
        intersect in close geographic proximity---or, as in many North
        American city centres, multiple transit facilities and a highway
        could converge on the downtown.

        Some interesting analysis of the politics in this issue. Goodwin notes
        that the
        use of revenue from congestion charging is an essential part of any
        scheme, in which ``the beneficiaries were as visible and influential as
        the motorists who paid it'' even if the only goal is to reduce
        congestion, not to raise revenue. In London's case, the revenue was
        funneled to public transport improvements.
        He also notes the implications for modelling: the traffic
        reduction was at the upper end of the range estimated by models,
        and the revenues from the scheme were hence lower than expected.
        ``This is not particular to road pricing: it is part of a general
        reappraisal of establish transport modelling techniques, which have
        a built-in tendency to underestimate the range and complexity of
        the behaviour response to policy, which in turn causes an
        overestimation of the benefits of infrastructure expansion, and an
        underestimation of the benefits of demand management.'' In a
        footnote, he adds that ``some of the earlier modelling work
        had actually forecast a bigger effect, closer to what happened, but
        this had been progressively revised downwards by the modelling
        teams in order to produce robust, defensible,  conservative
        assessments.''

        Some interesting discussion of the British experience in urban
        planning, drawing from Stone (1973). On the basis of cost, Stone
        recommended settlements of about 250,000 people instead of a huge
        monocentric city. Hall draws comparisons between the British
        experience of heavy land use regulation and the American
        experience, and finds that while British planning restricted land
        supply and raised housing prices, any solution today would require
        massive releases of land in high pressure areas, causing a
        dismemberment of the land use planning system. He discussed
        European sustainable urban development policies (pedestrian zones,
        traffic calming, and road pricing), but argues that by focusing on
        the centre they may be transferring the problem to the suburbs. He
        includes some interesting discussion of late 1990s planning efforts
        in France to provide radial transit to the inner
        suburbs of Paris (ORBITALE) and extensions of the RER system
        (LUTECE). He also discusses the Dutch ABC system (EXTRA).

        I found this article interesting, and it spanned a wide range of
        the debates on ``desirable density.'' I liked the effort to discuss
        net vs. gross density, comparisons of many different measures, the
        relation to declining household size (and hence lower person
        densities), and the relation to transit service. However, I found
        some of the arguments unpersuasive, particularly the argument in
        favour of a density of 30--40 units/net hectare---but perhaps I need
        to read the source study. I quite liked the historical aside of
        ``London vs. the continent'' (Rasmussen 1937) and even the bleeding
        edge of American debate (Jacobs and Appleyard 1987).

        An excellent article investigating the role of attitudes in walking
        and biking. Most importantly, they attempted a quasi-longitudinal
        method. They discussed the feedbacks between the act of walking and
        attitudes about walking, although their method is not sophisticated
        enough to examine those feedbacks.

        Some of the numbers are scary. For the average suburban respondent,
        the minimum distance to any establishment was about 550m, versus
        250m for an urban respondent. The distance to any household
        maintenance establishment (e.g., groceries, drugstore, etc.) was
        800m versus 400m for urban. No wonder no one walks!

        Their cycling model had a surprisingly high R-squared value,
        0.258---most disaggregate cycling models that I've seen are much
        lower. Cervero \& Duncan had about 0.13; Krizek had about 0.22. Mind
        you, this could just be a result of their model structure, which is
        quite unusual.

        Regarding their actual models, I'm mildly concerned by the
        pro-bike/walk and pro-transit attitude variables in their cycling
        model. While the signs are plausible, the variables are fairly
        highly correlated; is it possible that the parameters are therefore
        misestimated? (Mind you, a correlation of 0.3 isn't that high, at
        the end of the day.) More importantly, what is the
        ``alternatives factor''? I'm guessing that it refers to the ``PA
        options'' factor, but it's not clear. Finally, why is a change in
        the ``socializing behaviour'' in the new neighbourhood associated
        with greater cycling? This isn't explored in the paper, but I could
        imagine that it means ``more other people out cycling''---the classic
        ``safety in numbers'' hypothesis from the cycling literature.

        Some very interesting notes regarding immgrants' use of public
        transit. ``We find that recent immigrants are much more likely than
        the Canadian born to use public transit to commute to work, even
        after controlling for age, gender, income, distance to work, and
        distance between place of residence and the city centre. Two
        factors seem to explain this high rate of transit usage. First,
        immigrants tend to use public transit in their commute to work more
        when they are new to Canada (independent of other factors such as
        age and income) but their rate of transit use declines as they
        reside in Canada for longer periods of time. Second, newer cohorts
        of immigrants have higher rates of transit use than earlier
        cohorts, suggesting that they may be different in some ways that
        have not been observed. [...] Projections for future public transit
        needs could take into account that the urban population is not only
        growing, but is also compositionally shifting towards a high-usage
        group.'' They also found some interesting results about immigrants'
        source countries: ``In both Toronto and Montreal, the incidence of
        public transit utilization is highest among immigrants from the
        Carribean, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Africa;
        they are lowest among immigrants from Easy Asia, Europe, West Asia,
        North America and Oceania.'' Results from Vancouver were
        unfortunately very distorted due to the transit strike that took
        place during the 2001 census, especially changing usage patterns in
        Skytrain-serviced areas versus bus-serviced areas. It's worth
        noting that immigrants from all of these source nations were much more
        likely to use transit than the Canadian born, usually by margins of
        at least 50\%.

        2005'' is to promote cycling and walking in Danish cities and at
        the same time to improve traffic safety for cyclists and
        pedestrians as well as for road users in general. Around 4\% of
        car traffic mileage should be transferred to cycling and
        walking before 2005. The traffic safety target of the
        masterplan, in spite of increasing traffic is to reduce the
        number of persons killed and injured by 45\% before the year
        2000 with reference to the year 1988. In 1997, the Danish
        Government published a new national traffic safety strategy
        ``Every accident is one too many''. This strategy pays specific
        attention to the safety of cyclists. Demonstration projects
        co-financed by the government have been initiated to
        demonstrate some examples on how to realize the intentions and
        targets. In addition, new research activities have been
        initiated. In 1997, the Ministry of Transport established a
        Cyclist Forum with the purpose of creating a dialogue among
        local, regional and state level Road Authorities and the
        different players involved or related to planning and safety of
        cycling. In the spring of 1999, the Ministry of Transport is
        going to introduce a new national cycling strategy and the
        Danish Road Directorate will introduce a new handbook for local
        technicians and planners - a Catalogue of Ideas for
        recommendable solutions to promote safe cycling. This paper
        presents the Danish strategy for promoting safe cycling -
        including an overview of the policy, activities and experiences
        so far.

        Some interesting notes about site design. It's a refreshingly
        concrete comparison of urban and suburban neighbourhood design. I
        don't think I'd realised just how sparse some American street
        networks are until I saw the maps of Mariner, Seattle... I can't
        find any Canadian suburb that empty. Not that it makes Canadian
        suburbs any more walkable---our suburban pattern may be dense, but
        it's still extremely disconnected.

        The scale of suburban blocks was also surprising: 300m-400m per
        side, on average, compared to 90m-122m for urban blocks. The rule
        of thumb is that people won't walk more than 400m to a bus
        stop---one block in the suburbs. Not to mention the perceptual
        bleakness of walking forever in these empty spaces...

        I found the comments here about pedestrian traffic to different
        sized commercial centres interesting. They found that in suburban
        neighbourhoods, pedestrians preferred medium-sized centres over
        other sizes. I wonder what the reasons are---perhaps the
        auto-favouring design features around large suburban centres, or
        the barrier caused by their colossal parking lots?

        I really liked the discussions on micro design. While
        many reports talk about illegal jaywalking, they at least note that
        in many suburban areas, the distance between legal crossings is
        usually 400-800m---a huge distance for someone on foot. Is it any
        wonder that people jaywalk? They also noted the problems of fences
        around apartment complexes, schools, and commercial areas---I can't
        count the number of times I've walked the most direct path out of
        a suburban location only to find a fence, and then being forced to
        retrace my steps, walking an extra 500-1000m for no reason
        whatsoever.

        Finally, I liked the idea of a ``latent'' pedestrian market in
        medium-density suburbs, that could be brought out with improved
        design.

        An ongoing topic of interest in urban transportation engineering is
        the impact of changes in road network capacity upon the amount
        of vehicle travel made in the urban area. In many cases the
        debate focuses on the potential increases in vehicle travel
        occurring with increases in road capacity - the phenomenon of
        ``induced demand''. Some studies have also looked at the effects
        of reductions in roadway capacity, and found that in many of
        these cases reductions in vehicle travel occur, generally
        confirming that a relationship exists between roadway capacity
        and vehicle travel.

        This paper provides additional information on this subject, in
        a North American context.

        The City of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada is a thriving major
        urban centre with a population of over 850,000, and a Downtown
        employment of over 100,000. Centre Street Bridge is a major
        road bridge across the Bow River connecting Downtown Calgary to
        the residential area in the north part of the City. The bridge
        carries over 34,000 vehicles per day, with heavy peak period
        flows. In August of 1999 the Centre Street Bridge was closed to
        car and truck traffic for a period of 14 months for major
        repairs.

        A detailed study was undertaken of changes in weekday traffic,
        transit and pedestrian flows changes that took place in weekday
        travel patterns during the closure. This included both analysis
        of observed count data before and during the closure; and an
        interview survey with over 1,300 car users of the Centre Street
        Bridge and the other bridges serving the north side of the
        Downtown.

        This paper summarizes the major findings of this study.
        Particular emphasis is placed on explaining what happened to
        the vehicle trips that used the Bridge before the closure.

        While I'm not pleased with the results they report, I'm not too
        surprised. I imagine some of this can be attributed to the fact
        that it's car-addicted Calgary, but it's still a disappointing
        result: very little mode shift (<10\%). On the upside, the city
        didn't stop working during the bridge closure; drivers just had to
        shift their travel times and routes. This isn't very politically
        acceptable, though; many would feel hard done by if this occurred
        during a Burrard Bridge lane closure.

        Somewhat interesting, mostly due to its rarity: there are very few
        North American studies of pavement colouring. It's a rural context,
        and hence not very applicable in the situations I examine, where a
        bike lane might be coloured adjacent to a parking lane. The most
        curious aspect of the paper is the author's choice to consider
        ``motor vehicle encroaches neighboring vehicle lane when passing
        bike'' as a major variable---it's an issue, but not a major one in

        An interesting essay. Jacobs examines the schools within environmental
        economics, with a fairly critical eye. He discusses five classes:
        A. traditional (status quo); B. neoclassical I: financial incentives
        (tradable quotas); C. neoclassical II: financial incentives (taxes,
        etc.); D. neoclassical III: monetary valuation (cost/benefit analyses);
        and E. property rights. He looks at how they address four
        questions: 1. ethics of environmental objective setting (what level of
        environmental protection should society choose?); 2. institutions
        (how should this level be chosen?); 3. instruments (how should
        this level be achieved?); 4. distribution (how shold costs/benefits
        be distributed within society). He contrasts the environmental
        economists with his own more political school, an
        ``environmental democracy'' based on sustainability principles.
        Generally, he seems to be favourable to B and C, which study only
        instruments; he sees these as tools compatible with environmental
        democracy. He is less kind to D and E, which try to answer question
        2; he argues that they are unlikely to achieve sustainability, due
        to the market's inherent tendency to discount the future. He points
        out many flaws in his own preference (a democratic institution to
        make decisions), but prefers its basis in a public debate of ethics.

        This was a first good discussion of telecommuting that I've seen.
        It went into more detail on the types of work where telecommuting
        might be a reasonable substitute, the possible effects on urban
        form and exurbanisation, and the context of the changing structure
        of work in North America. I found his discussion of Coppack quite
        itneresting, talking about competition for ``natural'' amenities at
        the urban fringe, and the leapfrogging and outwards movement that
        can result when rural/natural amenities are considered valuable.
        His discussion of the growing role of nonroutine activities in the
        workplace was also valuable in a telecommuting context. The
        discussion of Mokhtarian (1991) was also good, reducing some of my
        concerns regarding telecommuting; overall, it seems like it
        produces some benefits, although the impacts aren't likely to be
        enormous; distance is by no meanby no means dead yet.

        big boxes, although they induce quite different travel behaviour.
        Additionally, hard data on the impacts to small independent retail
        is not presented.

        Nonetheless, the description of the strategy and rationale for
        large format stores is interesting, given their importance to
        travel demand.

        The unsustainable nature of current urban transportation and land
        use is well recognized. What is less clear is the prescription
        for how to move towards a more sustainable future, especially
        given the many interest groups involved, the complexity of
        urban systems and the fragmented nature of
        decision-making in most urban regions. It is argued
        that the process of achieving more sustainable
        transportation requires suitable establishment of four
        pillars: effective governance of land use and
        transportation; fair, efficient, stable funding;
        strategic infrastructure investments; and attention to
        neighbourhood design. A review of each pillar identifies key
        issues. The characteristics of an ideal body for governance of
        land use and transportation are considered. Trade-offs are
        identified with: spatial representation; organizational
        structure; democracy; and market philosophy.  Effective
        financing and pricing of urban transportation may be distorted
        because responsibility for infrastructure is separated from
        service provision. Financing mechanisms are categorized
        depending on vehicle use and location. Investment in
        infrastructure for alternative fuel vehicles and intermediate
        semi-rapid transit may be required in many cities. Major
        investment in public transit infrastructure will likely not
        suffice if macro land use and micro neighbourhood designs are
        not supportive of these investments.

        An excellent summary of the dataset collected in their 1999 book,

        still undoubtedly has problems, such as the use of Metro Toronto
        instead of the Greater Toronto Area for the city definition. That
        introduces some massive bias into all references to Toronto, since
        it excludes all of the sprawling suburbs, including Mississauga

        1990).

        While it might not suit their agenda, I would like to see
        housing costs included in the analysis. There is a clear
        relationship between density and greater competition for limited 
        land and housing, and any analysis of regional economic
        competitiveness really has to take housing costs into account.
        Newman and Kenworthy's core argument that land use influences

        explain transit use well? That's just the ``rational actor''

        about the direction of causation---does use of transit change your

        attitude? This paper doesn't yet get to the heart of the problem.

        An interesting study. He makes the useful note that a panel survey
        where some people choose to move is not strictly a random sample;
        there was some underlying reason why those people chose to move, so
        you have a self-selected samples (p. 271). I don't fully buy his
        assumption that movers were in equilibrium with neighbourhood prior
        to moving; it's a major assumption, which he acknowledges and tests
        towards the end of the paper. However, it's still a useful
        experiment: even if the movers were trying to self-select, if the
        move allows them to reduce/increase VMT, it suggests that urban
        form is an enabler for desired travel behaviour, a necessary
        condition for behaviour change.

        A fairly simple study, but with some important discussion and
        results. Most importantly, they examined nonlinear reactions to
        distance for cycling and walking. While this is not a surprising
        result, and would probably emerge from a traditional multinomial
        logit mode choice model (with linear disutility for distance), it
        is still worth exploring. From a policy perspective, the nonlinear
        relationship that emerges can be vital to designing walkable and
        bikable neighbourhoods. After controlling for socioeconomic
        characteristics, they found that only the presence of retail closer
        than 200m was associated with higher odds of walking; the presence
        of retail in the 200m-400m range had no significant impact on the
        odds of walking. This contradicts the received wisdom that people
        are willing to walk up to 400m (1/4 mile) for such trips. It also
        suggests that urban intensification should be focused within a very
        narrow range of retail establishments to be effective, similar to
        the strategy of Toronto's Avenues plan or Vancouver's EcoDensity
        initiative.

        For cycling, they found that only the presence of a path within 
        400m of home was associated with higher odds of biking. Again, more
        distant paths had no significant effect. This is also a lower limit
        than the received wisdom, although not drastically so. I think
        Vancouver's long-range bicycle plan aims for bike routes with a
        spacing of 500m, although they're nowhere close to that yet. It
        does suggest that there could be significant improvements in mode
        share when the spacing improves from the current level (roughly
        1000m) to 500m, which is a bit surprising; I'd sort of thought that
        we'd see diminishing returns with the later routes, but this paper
        suggests that routes that are too far away have no impact on most
        people.

        Finally, Krizek and Johnson mention one important note: the number
        of vehicles/bicycles in a household is a potentially endogenous
        variable, making it dangerous for use in a model. An interesting
        note, and one that's rarely considered in the modelling literature.

        Some interesting thoughts. 1) Their ``compact city'' policy seems to
        have led to a polycentric region, with the edge regions (at the
        boundary of the dense inner city and the car-oriented outer world)
        developing into subcentres. Most of this is due to earlier policies
        of motorway expansion and subcentre promotion. However, public
        transport patronage has risen. 2) Public transport expansion
        has been less effective than changes in urban form. Expansion to
        new developments has not proven feasible, due to chicken-and-egg
        issues. 3) The a,b,c location policy aimed to force employers with
        large numbers of employees/visitors to take class A sites, defined
        as having good public transport facilities running in several
        directions, and with very strict parking place supply. Class B and
        C sites have softer parking regimes and siting requirements. It's a
        national policy. While it has been evaluated as a failure (mostly
        due to application to only 15\% of all locations, since it only
        applies to new developments), it is continuing.

        transparency; replicability; and pragmatic evaluation. Travel

        Transportation and land use research of the past decade has focused
        in large part on the question of whether manipulating land uses in
        the direction of ``smart growth'' alternatives can reduce vehicle
        miles traveled (VMT) or otherwise improve travel behavior. Yet the
        notion of ``manipulating'' land uses implies that the alternative
        is somehow self-organized or market-based. This view appears to
        underestimate the extent to which current planning interventions in
        the United States---largely focused on lowering development
        densities, mandating ample road and parking designs, and separating
        land uses---impose an auto-oriented template on most new
        development. Rather than a market failure, the paucity of ``smart
        growth'' alternatives may be a planning failure---the result of
        municipal regulatory exclusion. This problem definition would shift
        the burden of proof for policy reform, as uncertainty in
        travel-behavior benefits would hardly justify the continuation of
        exclusionary regulations. If municipal regulations in fact
        constrain alternatives to low-density auto-oriented development,
        one would expect developers to perceive unsatisfied market interest
        in such development. This article studies, through a national
        survey (676 respondents), US developers' perceptions of the market
        for pedestrian- and transit-oriented development forms. Overall,
        respondents perceive considerable market interest in alternative
        development forms, but believe that there is inadequate supply of
        such alternatives relative to market demand. Developer-respondents
        attribute this gap between supply and demand principally to local
        government regulation. When asked how the relaxation of these
        regulations would affect their product, majorities of developers
        indicated that such liberalization woud lead them to develop in a
        denser and more mixed-use fashion, particularly in close-in
        suburban locales. Results are interpreted in favor of land-policy
        reform based on the expansion of choice in transportation and land
        use. This view contrasts with a more prevalent approach which
        conditions policy interventions on scientific evidence of
        travel-behavior modification.

        A very interesting read. Litman raises a number of issues
        associated with housing that I hadn't considered---my first
        reaction is to question Vancouver's downtown development patterns.
        Are parking requirements responsible for the tower fad, by making
        townhouse and four-story apartment development uneconomic for
        developers? On interesting bit of trivia: curb cuts reduce
        onstreet parking capacity.  His parking management solutions
        are quite valuable and innovative ideas, and the studies he cites
        in Victoria and Mississauga are useful; I should follow up on all
        of his references. Of the management solutions, the two ideas I
        found novel were: shared parking, where apartments and businesses
        share spaces due to opposite peak demand times - very practical for
        residential downtowns; transportation management associations, where a
        neighbourhood organisation is formed to trade parking in a
        neighbourhood.
        
        I was initially convinced by his
        arguments about reducing developer incentive to create low-income
        housing, but I'm now a little skeptical; figure 12, in particular,
        says to me that in a scenario where 0 parking spaces are required,
        developers will have a huge incentive to produce high income
        housing, since the relative profit difference will be so much
        greater. Of course, this ignores the entire demand side of the
        equation. Overall, I think more analysis is needed to determine the
        real effect on developers.

        Some interesting analysis. It's primarily a critique of another
        paper, ``Great Rail Disasters'' by Randal O'Toole, which I'm not
        familiar with; apparently, the paper condemns rail transit as cost
        ineffective, but its analysis is fundamentally flawed. In the end,
        the flaws boil down to two differences: 1) O'Toole values mobility
        more than accessibility; and 2) he's quite ready to distort
        statistics to make an argument.

        Probably the most interesting part of his analysis is Figure 13,
        showing that ``in Bus Only and Small Rail cities, traffic
        congestion costs tend to increase with city size [...] but Large
        Rail cities do not follow this pattern. They have substantially
        lower congestion costs than comparable size cities. As a result,
        New York and Chicago have about half the per capita congestion
        delay as Los Angeles.''

        Tables 6 and 7 is also very interesting, showing the total subsidy
        to bus and rail systems, and a lower bound on the total benefits
        from each.

        Litman's notes comparing bus rapid transit and rail are interesting,
        particularly his statistic showing that people are more willing to
        stand on rail systems, allowing more passengers per vehicle. His
        notes that rail does not subtract from bus systems are also
        interesting, showing that cities with large and small rail tend to
        spend more per-capita on transit, and hence that rail does not
        necessarily reduce bus system performance. (Although I'm sure there
        are cases where that happens!)

        I still have some questions about one part of his analysis: his
        argument proceeds by defining ``large rail'' cities as those with
        transit mode share of 20\%+ with rail making up more than half of
        the transit trips. He then argues that these cities have lower
        vehicle-miles, higher transit trips, etc., typically due to the land
        use impacts of the rail systems. However, there are elements of a
        circular argument here: it's possible that the causation runs in
        the other direction, and land uses cause higher transit mode share,
        and hence shift certain cities into the large rail category.
        (Personally, I don't believe that's the case---I think that rail
        does cause denser land use. But the argument may need to be
        rephrased to make this unambiguous.)  I need to think about this
        more before I can be certain that there actually is a flaw in his
        reasoning, though. Regardless, I don't think it's a big flaw---it's
        a difficult subject to tackle perfectly, and his analysis is
        generally quite sound.

        Litman includes a reference to the spreadsheet containing his
        calculations! This could be quite useful for learning how this
        analysis is done.

        other makes up less than 14\% of trips. However, it's on the rise:
        they show Beijing rising from 6\% in 1986 to 27\% in 2000 (for

        simulated in the model include individuals, households and
        establishments. The model operates on a ``100\% sample'' (i.e.,
        the entire population) of agents which, in the base
        case, are synthesized from more aggregate data such as census
        tables and which are then evolved over time by the model. A
        range of modelling methods are employed within the modelling
        system to represent individual agents' behaviours, including
        simple state transition models, random utility choice models,
        rule-based ``computational process'' models, and hybrids of these
        approaches. A major emphasis within ILUTE is the development of
        microsimulation models of market demand-supply interactions,
        particularly within the residential and commercial real estate
        markets. In addition, travel demand is modelled explicitly as
        the outcome of a combination of household and individual
        decisions concerning the participation in out-of-home
        activities over the course of a day. Spatial entities in the
        model include buildings, residential dwelling units and
        commercial floorspace, as well as aggregate ``spatial
        containers'' such as traffic zones, census tracts or grid cells.

        Their discussion of spatial representation is interesting, and
        echos (somewhat) my own thoughts on the subject. They have two
        sections: one on residential representation and one on
        representations for firms. I'm curious to see
        how far they've come in the last few months.

        They discuss real estate markets, with zonal average prices. Offers
        can have individual prices, though, overriding zonal averages. It
        seems that this idea would mesh better with building-based spatial
        representation---grid based representation makes it hard to store
        data like ``sale price'' or compute zonal averages.

        I'm a bit baffled by their commercial development model. The
        grid-based approach they used seems to be based on cellular
        automata, using logit models for state transitions. But they don't
        consider adjacency information, which seems like it would be
        essential for firms---who wants floorspace divided into a random
        patchwork? Can you really just rearrange floorspace as needed?

        Their closing paragraphs are encouraging: they really don't want
        zones, anywhere.

        This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the historical evolution
        of personal travel behavior in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) over
        the past 35 years. The analysis indicates that in many respects the
        GTA taken as a whole is similar to other cities within North
        America in terms of increasing auto ownership; increasing
        individual auto-drive trip rates; increasing suburbanization of
        population and employment into areas poorly served by transit;
        increasingly complex travel patterns; and transit, at best, maintaining
        a constant number of trips per capita but losing modal share. The
        analysis also highlights ways in which the GTA, particularly the
        city of Toronto, deviates from the North American ``norm.'' These
        include transit per capita ridership, overall mode splits,
        revenue-cost operating ratios are still extremely high by
        North American standards; the regional commuter rail
        system has been very successful in attracting
        increasing numbers of commuters from outside Toronto
        into the Toronto central area; the continuing strength
        of the Toronto central area has provided a strong,
        viable transit service; and more generally, the relatively
        high density and transit orientation of development
        throughout the city of Toronto is highly supportive of
        transit.

        The project ILUMASS (Integrated Land-Use Modelling and
        Transportation System Simulation) aims at embedding a
        microscopic dynamic simulation model of urban traffic flows
        into a comprehensive model system incorporating both changes of
        land use and the resulting changes in transport demand.

        The land-use component of ILUMASS will be based on the land-use
        parts of an existing urban simulation model, but is to be
        microscopic like the transport parts of ILUMASS.
        Microsimulation modules will include models of demographic
        development, household formation, firm lifecycles, residential
        and non-residential construction, labour mobility on the
        regional labour market and household mobility on the regional
        housing market. These modules will be closely linked with the
        models of daily activity patterns and travel and goods
        movements modelled in the transport parts of ILUMASS developed
        by other partners of the project team. The design of the land
        use model takes into account that the collection of individual
        micro data (i.e. data which because of their micro location can
        be associated with individual buildings or small groups
        of buildings) or the retrieval of individual micro data
        from administrative registers for planning purposes is neither
        possible nor, for privacy reasons, desirable. The land use
        model therefore works with synthetic micro data which can be
        retrieved from generally accessible public data.

        ILUMASS is a group project of institutes of the universities of
        Aachen, Bamberg, Dortmund, Cologne and Wuppertal under the
        co-ordination of the Transport Research Institute of the German
        Aerospace Centre (DLR). Study region for tests and first
        applications of the model is the urban region of Dortmund. The
        common database will be compiled in co-operation with the City
        of Dortmund. After its completion the integrated model is to be
        used for assessing the impacts of potential transport and land
        use policies for the new land use plan of the city.

        The paper will focus on the land-use parts of the ILUMASS
        model. It will present the underlying behavioural theories and
        how they are made operational in the model design, explain how
        the synthetic population is generated, show first model results
        and demonstrate the potential usefulness of the model for the
        planning process.

        Microsimulation modeling is an emerging approach to activity-based

        at each point of time within the simulation, a modeling tool is
        required to estimate the price of each vehicle at any time.

        This disaggregate cross-sectional study uses primary data on the
        cycling behavior of 608 randomly sampled respondents in urbanized King
        County, Washington, and objective parcel-level GIS measures of land use
        and infrastructure conditions. Binary logit model findings provide new
        insights on who bicycles, and on perceived and actual built
        environmental conditions associated with the likelihood of cycling in
        neighborhoods, controlling for socio-demographic variables. A high
        21\% of the respondents report cycling at least once a week in their
        neighborhood, more often for recreation or exercise than for
        transportation. Cycling is more popular among male, younger adults,
        transit users, and those who are physically active and in good health.
        Both perceived and objective environmental conditions contribute to the
        likelihood of cycling. Proximity to trails and the presence of
        agglomerations of offices, clinics/hospitals, and fast food
        restaurants, measured objectively, are significant environmental
        variables. Previously researched correlates of cycling, such as the
        presence of bicycle lanes, traffic speed and volume, slope, block size,
        and the presence of parks, are found insignificant when objectively
        measured. A non-linear relationship is found between the odds of
        cycling and the perception of traffic problems and automobile-oriented
        facilities. Overall, cycling is only moderately associated with the
        neighborhood environment. It appears to be an individual choice that is
        independent from environmental support. This finding likely reflects
        the limited bicycle infrastructure in the sample frame---an
        unfortunate condition found in most US metropolitan regions. Policy and
        intervention programs could increase cycling by improving both actual
        and perceived environmental conditions.

        An interesting take on a classic topic. (See also: MooTho94,
        NewKen96, etc.) I found the discussion of class interesting:
        dispersed development (initially in the form of streetcar suburbs,
        later in the form of auto suburbs) allowed the middle-class to
        achieve something that had previously been reserved for the
        upper-class: income segregation. Prohibition was part of this
        process: dry districts were partly intended to keep out the working
        classes. Streetcars also opened up enough space to allow the
        formation of ethnic neighbourhoods for the first time, which is
        certainly evident in a city like Toronto. The period from 1920--1930
        was the ``point im time, many geographers and planners would agree,
        that intrametropolitan transportation achieved its greatest level
        of efficiency---the burgeoning city truly `worked.' '' Muller cites
        some great studies: Bae78 shows the evolution of land uses along a
        Minneapolis freeway corridor from 1953--1976 as a new `downtown'
        emerged along the freeway.

        An interesting, clearly and calmly written article, but not
        entirely convincing in its central argument. I liked the discussion
        and dissection of sustainability themes (something I haven't read
        too much about), but I find the condemnation of compact cities and
        New Urbanism a little premature. Neuman's criticisms are largely
        legitimate---particularly with regard to the actual New Urbanist
        developments on the ground---and I am quite sympathetic to the goal
        of organic city processes, but I think urban form (and density in
        particular) remains a key component of any future sustainable
        city: a necessary condition, but not sufficient.

        This was the first I read by these authors; this article and their
        1989 book are classic texts in the field.

        It's an ambitious and impressive effort, although I doubt that
        anyone will ever completely believe either their data or their
        results. Nevertheless, the data collection effort is laudable,
        especially when they include information on parking and relative
        speeds. Since reading this, I've improved my stats quite a bit, and
        I'd like to revisit it (or their 1999 followup) and see if I buy
        their results and conclusions. I'd also like to look into the
        econometric models they criticised.

        One choice quote: ``Toronto has a much stronger transit system
        (50?? vehicle miles of service per capita) than do U.S. or
        Australian cities, a feature with its dense land use; its provision
        for automobiles is also much less than that in U.S. and Australian
        cities. The diversity of its transit systems, which include
        commuter rail, subway, modern trams on-street and new LRT on
        separated tracks, electric trolleys, and diesel buses (as well as
        comprehensive cycle ways), provides a powerful comparison to nearby
        Detroit, which has an almost complete commitment to the automobile.
        The per capita gasoline consmuption in Detroit is double that in
        Toronto; transit use is 0.8 percent of total passenger miles in
        Detroit, compared with 16.7 percent in Toronto. However, the
        difference in gasoline consumption in Detroit and Toronto cannot be
        explained simply by the difference in transit use. For example, if
        all of Toronto's transit users transferred to car the per capita
        use of gasoline would increase by 53 gallons, making Toronto's
        usage still 184 gallons per capita lower than that of Detroit. The
        Toronto transit system is part of an overall more energy-efficient
        city, despite Toronto having lower gasoline prices in 1980 and less
        fuel-efficient vehicles than the U.S. Indeed, Toronto is one of the
        few cities in the world with well-developed policies for
        transportation energy conservation based on land use strategies.''

        There is a growing international movement, ``The New Urbanism'',

        Some interesting discussion. This design served as the prototype
        for suburban layouts for quite a while, although the results have
        not met the optimistic expectations laid out here. Many of his
        goals are laudable (walking distance to all amenities, avoid
        forcing children to cross arterials, etc.) while others are not
        (promoting segregation).

        ``It is plain that arterial highways must necessarily run in every
        direction and turn the street system into a network, and that
        residential life must occupy the interstitial spaces.'' This marked
        one of the first times that a neighbourhood was planned inside the
        bounds of a square of ``arterials,'' and that framing proved
        popular, although Jane Jacobs has made strong arguments against it.
        Perry represents Jacobs' antithesis, I think: patriarchal and
        paternalist, aiming to plan and provide for whatever needs he
        considers valid. He calls the regular grid of equal-sized streets
        ``leading nowhere in particular'' while his meandering
        discontinuous street plan is ``leading to places where people
        go.'' It's a deceptively persuasive argument---who would be against
        good design?---but it's ultimately patronising and controlling.

        So... patronising. From the title (``non-commuters'') onwards, the
        author treats walking as an exotic eccentricity: ``While
        fascinating, exotic and possibly romantic, little is known about
        those who ``refuse'' to use the two main modes of travel.'' The

        Bicycling accounted for an average of 1.2\% of work trips in Canada
        in 2001, but with considerable
        variation by province and metropolitan area. In this study, we
        chose six Canadian cities for detailed
        analysis of their cycling trends and policies: Montreal and
        Quebec City in Quebec; Ottawa and
        Toronto in Ontario; and Vancouver and Victoria in British
        Columbia. All of these cities have made
        impressive efforts to encourage more and safer cycling. Most of
        the cities report increases in cycling
        levels over the past two decades but appear to have reached a
        limit due to lack of funding for
        crucially needed cycling infrastructure (bike paths and lanes,
        parking, intersection modifications, etc.).
        In addition, the low-density, car-oriented suburban sprawl
        spreading around most Canadian cities has
        been increasing trip distances, thus making cycling
        decreasingly feasible outside the urban core.
        Finally, Canadian cities and provinces have not imposed any
        significant restrictions on car use or
        imposed increases in taxes, fees, and other charges for car
        use, such as most European cities have
        implemented to discourage driving and increase transit use,
        walking, and cycling. If Canadian cities
        really want to further increase cycling levels, they will have
        to further expand cycling infrastructure,
        curb low-density sprawl, and impose more restrictions and charges
        on car use.

        In spite of their colder climate, Canadians cycle about three times
        more than Americans. The main reasons for this difference are Canada?s
        higher urban densities and mixed-use development, shorter trip
        distances, lower incomes, higher costs of owning, driving and parking a
        car, safer cycling conditions, and more extensive cycling
        infrastructure and training programs. Most of these factors result
        from differences between Canada and the United States in their
        transport and land-use policies, and not from intrinsic differences
        in history, culture or resource availability. That is good news,
        since it suggests the possibility of significantly increasing
        cycling levels in the United States by adopting some of the
        Canadian policies that have so effectively promoted cycling and
        enhanced its safety.

        Very interesting. They perform a regression on some fairly
        aggregate data: provincial and state modal share and statistics.
        They find that precipitation, gasoline price, cycling fatality
        rates and temperature are the major factors determining mode share
        when American and Canadian data are combined, with median work trip
        distance almost as significant.

        Some of the most interesting findings: average length of work trips
        in similar-sized cities are twice as high in the US; cars are
        really quite a bit more expensive in Canada: 33\% of income,
        compared to 18\% in the U.S.

        I'm curious to see their sources for Canadian cycling injury stats;
        while I can see how they estimate total injuries, I can't imagine
        how they convert that to injuries per 100 million kilometres.

        I looked at the results a little more closely, and tried to
        normalize the input variables prior to doing correlation, to give a
        sense of their rank in affecting cycling mode share. (This
        effectively just amounts to multiplying the regression parameter by
        the standard deviation of the variable.) Using this approach, I
        found the parameters to be, from most to least important: 1) gas
        price, 0.30; 2) precipitation, -0.19; 3) work trip distance, -0.10;
        4) temperature, 0.09; 5) fatality rate, -0.09.

        I'd be curious to see a similar analysis done in a purely urban
        Canadian context.

        This book examines the development of Vancouver's unique approach
        to zoning, planning, and urban design from the early 1970s to
        the beginning of the twenty-first century. By the late 1990s,
        Vancouver had established a reputation in North America for its
        planning achievement, especially for its creation of a
        participative, responsive, and design-led approach to urban
        regeneration and redevelopment. This system has other important
        features: an innovative approach to megaproject planning, a
        system of cost and amenity levies on major schemes, a
        participative process to underpin active neighbourhood
        planning, and a sophisticated panoply of design guidelines.
        These systems, processes, and their achievements place
        Vancouver at the forefront of international planning practice.
        The Vancouver Achievement explains the keys to its success, and
        evaluates its approach to planning and design against
        internationally accepted criteria. Generously illustrated with
        over 160 photos and figures, this book - the first
        comprehensive account of contemporary planning and urban design
        practice in any Canadian city - will appeal to academic and
        professional audiences, as well as the general public.

        In a multi-agent transportation simulation, each traveler is
        represented individually. Such simulation consist of at least
        the following modules: - Activity generation. For each traveler
        in the simulation, a complete 24-hour day-plan is generated,
        with each major activity (sleep, eat, work, shop, drink beer),
        their times, and their locations.

        - Modal and route choice. For each traveler in the simulation,
        the mode of transportation and the actual routes are computed.

        - The Traffic simulation itself. In this module, the travelers
        are moved through the system, via the transportation mode they
        have chosen. A reasonably realistic traffic dynamics is
        necessary to include dynamic effects such as queue built-up.

        - Learning and feedback. In order to find solutions which are
        consistent between the modules (congestion is a result of
        plans, but plans are made in anticipation of
        congestion), a standard relaxation technique is used.
        This technique has similarities to day-to-day human learning
        and can also be interpreted that way.

        It is clear that further modules need to be added, such as for
        housing and land use, but also for freight traffic.

        The important point of doing rule-based microscopic simulations
        is that it is possible to experiment with arbitrary behavioral
        rules, going all the way from simple learning heuristics to
        rational agent That is, one is not bound by, e.g., mathematical
        constraints. It is for example possible to construct, for each
        individual agent, a large set of plans (``strategies'') and have
        the agent select between these strategies, based on past
        performance, or construct a new strategy. This allows, for
        example, to evaluate performance according to individual
        preferences. It also allows to have, for each agent, an only
        partial knowledge of the world, which may be different for each
        agent, and may be changed via exploration (``mental maps'').

        Using advanced computational methods, in particular parallel
        computing, it is now possible to do this for large metropolitan
        areas with 10 million inhabitants or more. We are currently
        working on such a simulation of all of Switzerland. Our focus
        is on a computationally efficient implementation of the
        agent-based representation, which means that we in fact
        represent each agent with an individual set of plans as
        explained above. We use a data base to store the agent's
        strategies, then load them into the simulation modules as
        required, and feed back individual performance measures into
        the data base. This approach allows that additional modules can
        be coupled easily, and without destroying computational
        performance.

        Since the above only models day-to-day replanning, we also look
        at within-day replanning, which means that travelers can change
        plans during travel. In particular, we look at efficient
        distributed implementations of this. It turns out that
        computational efficiency is closely related to the real-world
        mechanics of the distributed intelligence inherent in the real
        world system.

        Recent work in the area of comprehensive transportation modeling
        systems in a microsimulation framework, more specifically auto

        was conducted to design and administer a longitudinal survey to

        validate the survey results, and to conduct preliminary
        analysis on those results. An in-depth retrospective telephone
        survey was conducted with the help of a computer aid in
        Toronto, Canada. Simple univariate analyses were conducted on
        the data to determine the relationship between characteristics
        of the household and the occurrence of vehicle transactions,
        the choice of vehicle type, the duration a vehicle is held, and the
        degree of consumer loyalty to different types of vehicles.

        This paper shows that road pricing can be regressive, progressive
        or neutral, and refutes the generalised idea that road pricing is
        always regressive. The potential distributional impacts of a road
        pricing scheme are assessed in three English towns. It is found
        that impacts are town specific and depend on where people live,
        where people work and what mode of transport they use to go to
        work. Initial impacts may be progressive even before any
        compensation scheme for losers is taken into account. When the
        situation before the scheme is implemented is such that majority of
        drivers entering the area where the scheme would operate come from
        households with incomes above the average, it can be expected that,
        once the scheme is implemented, these drivers coming from rich
        households will continue to cross the cordon and will be prepared
        to pay the charge. In such a case the overall effect will be that
        on average, rich people will pay the toll and poor people will not.

%        I have to say that I really doubt some of the conclusions drawn by
%        this paper. He claims that ``[t]he effect of density is so small
%        that even a relatively large-scale shift to urban densities would
%        have a negligible impact on total vehicle travel.''  Intuitively,
%        I completely disagree with this conclusion; it just doesn't make
%        sense to me. However, until I read this paper, I didn't have a good
%        enough understanding of the language used in social sciences
%        statistics to contradict him. Just by looking at his method and
%        formulas, I could see problems, but I needed to learn a bit about
%        the statistical methods he used to really critique the paper's
%        conclusions.
%        
%        On the basis of a little reading in the area, I would
%        suggest two main flaws. First, some of his
%        independent variables are likely highly correlated: density,
%        transit, and central city location. If they are highly correlated
%        (``collinear''), then their t-statistics may be underestimated; in
%        other words, they may be more significant than his results show.
%        (He notes the connection between density and central city location,
%         but I think it'll have more impact than he suggests.)
%        Second, he has probably omitted some important variables, such as
%        the relative cost of driving with respect to transit. His low
%        R-squared values may be a symptom of this omission.  Beyond these
%        major arguments, I see other problems: he uses true/false
%        independent variables instead of continuous variables (e.g.,
%        there either is a transit stop within three blocks or not, rather
%        than using a variable for the distance to the nearest transit stop,
%        or the expected travel+wait time), and he makes conclusions based
%        on some fairly major extrapolations from his data. Also, as Dow92
%        noted, a 50\% increase in population density doesn't have much
%        effect at all. As FraPiv94 noted in a much better study, the
%        relationship between density and modal split is nonlinear.
%        Curiously, Schimek cites that paper but dismisses it since it
%        doesn't control for income. (I think they might actually have
%        controlled for income, but they admittedly didn't mention it.)
%        I'd be curious to revisit this once I've
%        got more experience with the statistical methods used in this
%        type of analysis. I suspect I could estimate the relative
%        significance of the various flaws I've outlined above with a bit
%        more skill and reading.
%
%        I've seen this study cited positively by many authors, usually for
%        the fact of seeing a relationship between density and VMT.  Overall,
%        I'm not convinced that his method really captures the relationship;
%        Todd Litman's web page describing transportation elasticities does
%        a better job. That said, Schimek does raise some valid points:
%        rising incomes could conceivably counteract the effects of
%        increases in density.

        city and regional planning requires well-validated, durable

        In many provinces in Canada, development charges are collected by
        municipal governments to help pay for the capital costs associated
        with urban growth. Hardly anywhere, however, is there an attempt to
        structure development charges so as to achieve planning goals. This
        article examines the disconnect between fiscal and planning goals
        by tracking the evolution of development charge regimes in a
        particular urban region, namely the Greater Toronto Area in
        Ontario, Canada. The authors pose the question: why do so many
        municipalities adopt average cost approaches to calculating
        development charges when it is widely assumed that a marginal cost
        approach is superior from an infrastructure and land-use efficiency
        (i.e., planning) perspective?

        The typical explanations put forward to account for this preference
        are examined and found wanting. A fuller explanation requires an
        understanding of developer-municipal conflict over the principles
        involved in the design of development charges. This leads us to an
        account of the emergence of development charges in Ontario and the
        evolving debate between municipalities and developers over who
        should pay for the infrastructure needed to support growth. This
        story reveals that there has been a gradual shift in municipal
        infrastructure financing practices from a marginal cost or
        ``site-specific'' approach, favoured by developers, to an average
        cost or ``municipal-wide'' approach, favoured by municipalities. In
        the conclusions, a number of factors underlying this evolution are
        identified.

        This article contains an economic analysis of regulatory
        parking policies as a substitute to road pricing. The scope for
        such policies is discussed, after which a simple diagrammatic
        analysis is presented, focusing on the differences between the
        use of parking fees and physical restrictions on parking space
        supply. The former is found to be superior for three reasons:
        an information argument, a temporal efficiency argument and an
        intertemporal efficiency argument. Finally, a spatial parking
        model is developed, showing that it may be possible to overcome
        the difficulty of regulatory parking policies not
        differentiating according to distance driven by specifying the
        appropriate spatial pattern of parking fees, making individuals
        respond to (spatial) parking fee differentials.

        A different take on Los Angeles than I'd heard before. Wachs
        describes a city that was distinct from an early age. Its initial
        trajectory was not so different from Vancouver: a population of
        only 6000 in 1870, linked to the railroad in 1876. But it exploded
        from there, to 50,000 by 1890, up to 320,000 by 1910, and 1.2
        million by 1930---and already 780,000 cars by that date. The city
        motorized extremely early, aided by the California climate and
        local conditions. The immigrants were quite well-to-do, mostly
        born in the USA and raised with American values, and settled in a
        very dispersed pattern well before the arrival of the automobile,
        mostly aided by streetcars.
        The city developed in parallel with communications technology (the
        telephone) and at the height of the City Beautiful movement. Also,
        building heights were constrained by city laws after the 1906 San
        Francisco earthquake. Already by 1924, 48 percent entering the CBD
        came by car. The decisive stroke in favour of automobiles, however,
        was the decision to proceed with an incremental roads and highway
        plan (1924), and the failure to adopt a proposed high-cost transit
        plan (1926).

    Interesting. Waddell gives a nod to Miller's 98 TRCP paper, generally
    agreeing that it's a good description of an ``ideal model.'' Waddell's
    model definitely tries to do a better job than earlier models, but the
    simulation may still be too coarse to achieve its goals. There is no
    modelling of the household, or much modelling of decision-making
    procedures within the household. They use the same one-year timestep as
    Miller, but only a five-year timestep for calculation of the
    transportation network. Their ability to deal with other modes is
    seriously limited - while disaggregation brings the scale down to a
    reasonable level, they don't model automobile ownership, one of the key
    decisions. They note the difficulty of validation against historical
    data; even with a relatively stable period (1980-1994, little job
    or pop changes), there's a fair bit of difference between their model
    and others' models. And of course they can't hope to predict big changes -
    like Weyerhaueser closing a plant. They're also still fairly cellular
    automata based - transition rules instead of behavioural modelling.

        implications of installing ASLs using OSCADY (Optimised Signal

        `before' and `after' video surveys of modified junctions at four
        sites in Guildford, Surrey, and questionnaires to examine the
        attitudes of cyclists. While cyclists generally thought that
        the ASLs were safer and easier to use than unadapted junctions,
        concerns were expressed that some drivers did not comply
        with the new layout. Changes in the length of time
        between green signals or a longer minimum green time
        may be required in some circumstances. At the two sites
        where the number of traffic lanes remained the same
        there was a slight increase in saturation flow, but at
        the two sites where a traffic lane was removed large
        reductions in saturation flow were observed. This

        This paper analyses the evolution of urban form in two North American
        metropolitan regions (Portland and Toronto) and asks how more
        sustainable regional form might come about in the future in these and
        other urban areas. In the past, dominant patterns of urban form have
        emerged in such regions at different historical periods. These
        morphological phases include mid 19th-century grids, streetcar suburb
        grids, garden suburbs, automobile suburbs and New Urbanist
        neighbourhoods (which have only recently made an appearance and may or
        may not become widespread). Judging by the performance of past types of
        urban morphology, five design values appear particularly important for
        more sustainable urban form in the future: compactness, contiguity,
        connectivity, diversity and ecological integration. Although these
        principles were not well supported by 20th-century development,
        contemporary movements such as the New Urbanism and Smart Growth
        re-emphasise them. The example of these two regions indicates that, in
        the absence of new technological, economic or geographical forces,
        public sector institutions and urban social movements represent the
        most likely means to bring about new, more sustainable types of urban
        form.

        than allowing one ``peak'' site for the area. Existing parking

        An economic market approach to urban system modelling is described,
        where all interactions are characterized as exchanges in a market.
        This leads to a natural partition of an integrated urban model
        into submodels based on the category of good or service being
        supplied or demanded, the type of agent making the demand or
        supply, and the time and place of interaction. Actors
        communicate through 6 defined operations on markets, decoupling
        the algorithms representing different behaviour. Agent based
        approaches to simulation are a natural extension of the market
        approach, allowing a transaction based simulation of
        heterogeneous spatial markets with individual agents making
        specific offers in specific places at specific times, and other
        agents accepting those offers at future specific times.
        Incorporating many existing modelling methods into such a
        framework requires a set of average prices by segmenting
        markets by commodity category, space and time, and wrapping the
        modules in interfaces that recast the inputs and ouputs into
        market operations. The paradigm is applied to two existing
        modelling frameworks: the Sacramento MEPLAN model and the
        Oregon statewide TLUMIP model.

        In response to the renewed appreciation of the benefits of
        bicycling to the environment and public health, public
        officials across the nation are working to establish new
        bicycle routes (1). During the past two decades, a number of
        methods have been endorsed for the selection of ``suitable''
        bicycle routes. These methods are limited in that they do not
        explicitly address bicycle safety nor do they reflect urban
        conditions. The purpose of this research was to develop an
        objective bicycle route safety rating model based on injury
        severity. The model development was conducted using a logistic
        transformation of Jersey City's bicycle crash data for the
        period 1997-2000. The resulting model meets a 90\% confidence
        level by using various operational and physical factors
        (traffic volume, lane width, population density, highway
         classification, the presence of vertical grades, one-way
         streets and truck routes) to predict the severity of an injury
        that would result from a motor vehicle crash that occurred at a
        specific location. The modeled rating of the bicycle route's
        safety is defined as the expected value of the predicted injury
        severity. This rating is founded on the premise that safe
        routes produce less severe accidents than unsafe routes. The
        contribution of this research goes beyond the model's
        predictive capacity in comparing the safety of alternative
        routes. The model provides planners with an understanding,
        derived from objective data, of the factors that add to the route's
        safety, the factors that reduce safety and the factors that are
        irrelevant. The model confirms widely held beliefs, as
        evidenced by the findings that highways with steep grades,
        truck routes and poor pavement quality, create an unfavorable
        environment for bicyclists. On the other hand, the model found
        that increased volume and reduced lane width, at least in urban
        areas, actually reduce the likelihood of severe injury.
        Planners are encouraged to follow the lead of experienced
        bicyclists in choosing routes that travel through the urban
        centers as opposed to diverting bicyclists to circuitous routes
        on wide, low volume roads at the periphery of cities.

        The network component of an integrated urban model called IMULATE
        is interfaced with the MOBILE5.C emissions models. IMULATE
        produces estimates of traffic flows and average speeds on each
        link in an urban road network using a user equilibrium
        assignment algorithm. This information is combined with
        speed-dependent emissions factors generated by MOBILE5.C to
        calculate estimates of the three types of emissions on a
        link-by-link basis. The combined models are implemented for the
        Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, metropolitan area. Simulations are
        conducted to illustrate the spatial patterns of emissions in
        the morning peak period and to demonstrate the impact of
        congestion on emissions estimates. The incorporation of
        detailed network performance information yields significant

        An empirical study is presented of the long-range temporal
        transferability properties within a fixed geographic area of
        disaggregate logit models of work trip mode choice. The study
        area is the greater Toronto area, Ontario, Canada. The two
        temporal contexts are 1964 and 1986, with models estimated from
        1964 data being used to predict 1986 travel choices. In
        addition to the very long transfer period (which does not
        appear to have been previously examined), a major
        feature of this study is that a wide variety of model
        specifications, ranging from the simplest possible market share
        model to a complex market segmentation model, are tested to
        investigate the relationship between model specification and
        transferability. Major findings of the study include (a) as in
        most transferability studies, model parameters are not
        temporally stable; (b) pragmatically the transferred models
        provide considerable useful information about application
        context travel behavior; (c) in general, improved model
        specification improves the extent of the model's
        transferability; (d) an important exception to Point c is the
        complex market segment model, which appears to be
        ``overspecified'' and, in the face of changing contextual factors
        during the 22-year period predicts 1986 conditions quite
        poorly; (e) Point c notwithstanding, simple level-of-service
        models perform very well in terms of their spatially aggregate
        predictions (which are often of primary practical importance to
        planners); (f) the models that best fit the estimation
        context (1964) data do not always transfer the best to 1986
        conditions; and (g) ``transfer scaling'', in which modal utility
        constants and scales are updated, can significantly improve
        model transferability.

        An empirical assessment of alternative methods of updating

        from the estimation context within which they were originally
        developed to an application context (which differs from the
        original estimation context geographically or
        temporally, or both) is presented. The case study for
        the empirical tests performed is a long-term temporal transfer
        of work trip logit mode choice models estimated using 1964 data
        for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to represent 1986 work trip
        mode choice in the GTA. Three updating procedures that have
        been previously presented in the literature are
        examined (Bayesian updating, transfer scaling, and
        combined transfer estimation), plus a fourth
        new procedure, joint context estimation. All four
        procedures assume that a ``small'' data set of observed
        travel choices is available for the application
        context, which can be used in the updating procedure.
        The case study results indicate that the latter three
        procedures all possess merit as potential updating
        methods, with the choice among the three depending on
        such items as model specification and application
        context sample size. The results also indicate that if
        the application context sample size exceeds 400 to 500
        observations, then updating may provide little or no
        improvement over simple estimation of an application
        context model, especially if ``full'' model specification
        is supported by the available data.

        Urban areas are very complex and heterogeneous in terms of their
        population composition and activity systems. The transit system,
        modal choices and service levels available to the population also
        varies considerably across space and time. These similarities
        and differences in choices and levels of explanatory variables
        facing individual tripmakers have to be explicitly considered
        in any study of transit behavior. The common practice has been
        to include user attributes, in addition to the system
        characteristics, in the modal utility functions to help capture
        differences in choice behavior across individuals. However, it
        could well be that the mode-choice behavior of a segment of the
        population is fundamentally different from other segments of
        the population. In view of this, some studies have applied
        segmentation schemes to help identify the subgroups of
        presumably different travel responses. Typically, such schemes
        have been based on stratification of the population by a single
        variable, chosen either based on a priori notions or one-way
        cross tabulations. This paper develops analytical procedure
        that simultaneously deals with level of service, socioeconomic
        and spatial factors to determine the relative role each plays
        in determining travel behavior. The procedure is applied to
        data from the Toronto region to illustrate its use.

        The prevailing practice in travel demand modelling is to estimate
        disaggregate models of mode choice with data from the most
        recent cross-sectional travel survey available on an urban area
        for forecasting purposes. Very often, however, most urban areas
        have available data from older cross-sectional surveys,
        which are often entirely ignored in the modelling
        effort. This paper explores the possibility of
        pooling data from two independent cross-sectional
        travel surveys on the same urban area for model
        estimation and forecasting by applying a model
        structure which allows for transfer-bias, referred
        to as the joint context estimation procedure. This
        procedure consists of joint, full information
        maximum likelihood estimation of a related set of
        logit choice models for the contexts which are
        based on the following two assumptions: (1)
        differences in model parameter values between
        contexts are expressible in terms of differences
        in the contexts' alternative-specific constants
        and overall scale of the contexts' utility
        functions; and (2) aside from these differences in
        alternative-specific constants and scales, model
        parameters are common across contexts. An
        empirical case study is presented, involving the
        use of two datasets, gathered 22 years apart (1964
        and 1986) for the Greater Toronto Area
        (GTA), to estimate morning peak period work trip
        mode choice models. The estimated models are
        applied in prediction tests on the 1964, 1986 and
        a third independent data set, the 1991-data, also
        collected in the GTA. The performance of the joint
        context models is compared to that of an
        independent model, estimated on the 1986 data
        only. The results clearly demonstrate that joint
        context estimation dominates the independent
        1986-model in predictive performance. The paper
        concludes by briefly discussing the possible
        roles, which joint context estimation might play
        in the development of improved transferability of
        disaggregate choice models.

         This article reports on a methodological framework undertaken by
         the authors to help the stakeholders in The Partnership of the
         City of NY to understand a group of significant transportation
         capital investment projects and to provide a means to
         discriminate among them. The authors' major objects was to
         inform these stakeholders how to make rational and systematic
         choices based on economic and transportation grounds, in an
         environment where appropriate data is lacking, no
         comprehensive regional transportation plan or objectives are
         defined, and the decision-making environment is highly
         fragmented. After the authors define the problem, they discuss
         details of the analysis, including the methodology used, the
         data sources, and the cost-benefit models. The authors then
         introduce the Goals Achievement Matrix for the selection and
         prioritization of projects. The final selections discuss key
         results and consider specific and general policy implications.
         Out of the sizeable number of large-scale transportation
         investment projects that have been proposed for New York City,
         eight were selected for close scrutiny and assessment. The authors
         briefly discuss the top three: the Fulton Transit Center and
         permanent PATH station, the Penn Station/Farley Post Office,
         and the Number 7 Subway Extension. These projects scored highest
         on both transportation benefits and economic development
         benefits scales.

        'Opting for urbanity' is the main thread running through the Amsterdam
        structure plan currently under preparation. But what is 'urbanity'? How
        is it emerging in a multi-centred region? What spatial planning
        implications does it entail? These questions were at the outset of a
        research study commissioned by the municipality of Amsterdam to the
        Amsterdam study centre for the Metropolitan Environment (AME) and
        summarized in this article. There are two main conclusions. The first
        is that traditional inside out development strategies--accommodating
        the expansion of a single core and its periphery--must be substituted
        by outside in development strategies, seeking to achieve a new synergy
        among different sub-centres and places at the urban-regional level. The
        second is that new sub-centres will have to be developed as real
        centres of urbanity instead of as mono-functional islands, as currently
        still the case. In order to implement these strategies the municipality
        needs to enter coalitions with a variety of public and private actors,
        spanning different spatial scales and policy sectors.

        This report presents a summary of international literature on pedal

        The 1996 British Crime Survey estimated that there were 660,000
        incidences of pedal cycle theft during 1995 in England and Wales,
        of which only 28\% were reported to, and recorded by, the Police. The
        Scottish Crime Survey estimated that there were 26,000 bicycles
        stolen during 1993, representing a rise of 53\% on the 1986 figures.
        A survey of bicycle theft victims was conducted in December 1996
        and January 1997. Topics covered include attitudes towards bicycle
        theft and how theft and the threat of them affect cycling
        behaviour. These are compared with response from a control sample
        of cyclists who have never experienced theft. Results from the
        survey are compared with British Crime Survey findings.

        This paper demonstrates that over the 25-year period, 1971-96, the
        majority of Canadian cities have undergone transition towards an
        increasingly decentralised urban form. The trends, however, are quite
        diverse, pointing to fundamental differences in the respective
        importance of growth in central and outer parts of the metropolitan
        area. On the whole, the relatively high densities observed in Canadian
        central cities, in comparison with US ones, appear to reflect residual
        centralisation rather than continued growth in metropolitan regions'
        innermost parts. Only Vancouver, and to a lesser extent Toronto and
        Victoria, exhibit indisputable evidence of post-1971 central-area
        growth. The predominant trend has been towards suburban-style,
        low-density expansion, albeit with considerable intercity variation
        regarding changes in central-area and suburban density. Findings
        presented here point to previously unidentified trends towards
        recentralisation in a few CMAs and, in about half of the surveyed
        metropolitan areas, densification of suburban tracts.

        This paper uses a formal model to examine the welfare gains from a
        marginal increase in the price of on-street parking. The
        benefits of such a policy are shown to depend on the
        improvement in search externalities in the on-street parking
        market itself, plus effects on other distorted urban transport
        markets, including congested freeway and backroad use,
        mass-transit and off-street parking. The paper makes two further
        contributions. The model is sufficiently general that several
        well-known results from the parking literature emerge as
        special cases. The model is used to review the existing
        literature and highlights findings in separate parts of
        literature. Finally, a numerical simulation model is used to
        investigate the order of magnitude of an optimal urban parking
        fee. In particular, these results confirm the importance of
        taking into accounts effects on other distorted transport
        markets when deciding upon the level of the price for on-street
        parking. The model confirms that while parking pricing reform
        may lead to substantial improvements in parking search times,
        there is little overall impact on road congestion levels.

        Consider the choices available to a shopper driving to a city and
        trying to park downtown. One option, typical to many cities, is
        to follow the signposts to an off-street parking facility,
        which is often privately operated. Another option is to search for
        an on-street spot. If this proves unsuccessful, it is always
        possible to return to the off-street facility. We formalise
        such a setting and examine optimal on-street parking policy in
        the presence of an off-street market. Not surprisingly, the
        amount of socially-wasteful searching behaviour is shown to
        depend on the prices of both the off- and on-street market. If
        the off-street market is run competitively, optimal on-street
        policy reduces to a simple and attractive rule: set the
        on-street price equal to the resource cost of off-street
        parking supply. Other pricing rules result in either excessive
        searching behaviour or excessive off-street investment costs.
        Time restrictions - a common alternative to on-street fees -
        are also shown to be inefficient. In practice, however,
        off-street markets are unlikely to be competitive. We examine the
        case of a single off-street supplier playing as a Stackelberg
        follower to the government regulated on-street market. Based on
        a numerical example (calibrated to London), optimal on-street
        policy is shown to either involve setting a relatively high
        on-street price, such that the monopolist is induced to
        undercut and gain the entire parking demand, or setting a
        relatively low price, while the monopolist maximises profit on
        the residual demand curve. Which strategy is optimal is shown
        to be parameter dependent.

        Consider a shopper or tourist driving downtown and trying to park.
        Two strategies are usually available: either park at a private
        off-street facility or search for a cheaper on-street spot. We
        formalise such a setting and use the model to study optimal
        government regulation of the on-street parking market. It is
        shown that the optimal on-street fee equals the marginal cost
        of off-street supply at the optimal quantity. If the off-street
        market is supplied under constant returns to scale, this
        provides a particular simple operational rule: the price on
        street should match that off street. We also extend the model
        to consider maximum length of stay restrictions and
        non-competitive private supply. A numerical model, calibrated
        to central London, investigates the magnitude of an optimal

        included an extensive literature review, one-on-one discussions

    abstract = {
        Past research suggests that mixed land-uses encourage non-auto
        commuting; however, the evidence remains sketchy. This paper
        explores this question by investigating how the presence of
        retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting
        choices of residents using data from the 1985 American Housing
        Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services
        within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage
        commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling
        for such factors as residential densities and vehicle ownership
        levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1
        mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage
        auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to
        efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The
        presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also
        associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates
        and short commuting distances among residents of a
        mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, residential densities
        exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices
        than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and
        bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, the
        presence or absence of neighborhood shops is a better
        predictor of mode choice than residential densities.

    abstract = {
        Vehicle restricted areas (VRAs) or `pedestrian areas' in town centres
        are sometimes important routes for cyclists. However, cycling is
        prohibited in many VRAs on the grounds of pedestrian comfort and
        safety. TRL studied the behaviour of 2,220 cyclists at sites in
        Cambridge, Hull and Salisbury where cycling is permitted for part
        or all of the day. TRL also interviewed 300 pedestrians and 150
        cyclists at these sites to obtain additional details about
        behaviour and attitudes. The report presents data on cycling
        speeds, dismounting and pedestrian flows and identifies those
        factors that significantly influence cyclist behaviour. It also
        shows which types of cyclists are most likely to ignore cycling
        bans and to cycle fast. The interviews reveal varying levels of
        acceptance by pedestrians of cycling in VRAs, and indicate that
        some injurious incidents occur. Conclusions are presented about how
        the physical layout of the VRA and other factors can affect
        pedestrian safety and comfort. The report does not endorse or
        reject cycling in VRAs, but presents information that may assist
        with appropriate local regulation and design.

        Cycle sales have increased substantially but overall cycle use has not.
        This project investigated the expectations and experiences of new
        cycle owners to see how they might be encouraged to cycle more,
        particularly for utility purposes. 76 adults who did not regularly
        cycle, who were buying a new cycle for themselves, were interviewed
        in cycle shops immediately after their purchase, about their
        planned cycle use and expectations. After one month they completed
        a four-day travel diary. After another month, they were interviewed
        in-depth regarding their cycle use, experiences and attitudes.
        Almost all those who completed the survey were pleased with their
        purchase. The majority cycled at least once a week, some much more
        frequently. Leisure was the main journey purpose but those who
        cycled to work tended to cycle more frequently. Physical effort,
        practical difficulties, the weather and the danger and unpleasantness
        from motor traffic were the main deterrents. One quarter reported
        using their cars less. However, most continued to use cars for the
        majority of journeys, including many under one mile. The report
        concludes that measures are needed to overcome practical barriers
        to greater cycle use, and to make cycling more enjoyable, for both
        new and existing cyclists.

        In this study, self-reported cyclist collision and fall information
        from a mail-back questionnaire was analyzed for a sample of
        2,945 adult cyclists who commute to work/school in Toronto and
        Ottawa. Analysis focused on incident frequencies by month, time
        of day, location, road surface condition, and injury level.
        These results are presented in order to provide a valuable
        complement to other sources of bicycle incident data obtained
        primarily from emergency room hospital records. Only a small
        percentage of collision and fall incidents resulted in a major
        injury and would therefore be found in a bicycle accident
        database compiled from emergency room hospital records.
        Slightly more, 19.2 and 11.7\% of the collisions in Ottawa and
        Toronto, respectively, were reported to police. The results of
        the study found that collisions were more sensitive to
        automobile traffic, whereas falls were more sensitive to the
        prevailing roadway surface conditions. There was a higher
        proportion of falls than collisions during the winter months in
        both cities. However, the severity of injuries from collisions
        and falls were fairly consistent across time periods. Even when
        the severity of collisions and falls were considered for
        different roadway environmental conditions and between roads
        and off-road, no difference was found. This analysis suggests
        that minor collisions and falls should be considered in
        accessing the safety experience of bicyclists.

        In the first three chapters (the only part I've read), there were
        some very interesting discussion of growth management policies,
        equity and racial segregation in the USA.

        One point I found interesting was the discussion of preferences. In
        general, Americans want single-family detached houses, auto-based
        travel, free parking and short travel times. The planning system
        in many ways guarantees the first two: suburbs have extremely high
        minimum standards for housing (low density single-family homes), and
        generally provide generous roads and free parking. The last aspect
        of preferences cannot be guaranteed due to growth and swamping of
        existing roads by new travel, discussed at length in the book.
        This is the aspect I find interesting: the system is inherently
        biased towards one set of preferences (housing) and limits trading
        off housing against travel time---if an individual prefers short
        travel times and is willing to accept ``lower quality'' dense
        housing in return, that option is rarely available. In other words,
        this minimum provision limits choices, a point that Andre Sorensen
        has made repeatedly in his discussions in the course I'm taking.

        Downs notes that one-third of US households did not live in
        single-family homes in 1990, and one-third were renters (presumably
        with substantial overlap). He describes the provision of low-cost
        housing as a ``trickle-down'' process: since cheap new housing is
        prohibited, only degraded older houses are available for those
        who cannot afford the suburban single-family home. This process
        breaks down when ``net housing construciton is lower than net
        household formation''---i.e., periods of rapid growth.

        An empirical study of the temporal transferability properties of
        entropy-type trip-distribution models, applied within a fixed
        geographic region, is presented. Data for the study were drawn
        from three travel surveys conducted in 1964, 1986, and 1996 in
        the Toronto region. Very long transfer periods were examined,
        and a wide variety of model specifications were tested. These
        specifications ranged from the simple proportional flow model
        to an occupationally stratified, doubly constrained entropy
        model, for which spatial separation was measured by highway
        travel time. These models were estimated using data from 1964
        and 1986. The estimated 1964 models were transferred to 1986
        and 1996 to predict the distribution of travel. The 1986 models
        also were transferred to 1996 to predict the distribution of
        travel. Results showed that the travel-time parameter was not
        temporally stable. However, pragmatically, the transferred
        models were found to provide forecasts very comparable to those
        generated by models estimated in the respective application
        contexts. Improved model specification consistently resulted in
        improved precision of the forecasts obtained. In particular,
        stratification of the data by worker occupation category resulted
        in models with the best fit to estimation data, as well as
        forecasts. However, from a decision- oriented perspective, the
        improvement in precision obtained from additional complexity in
        specification did not warrant a recommendation for use of more
        complex models. Thus, the simple, doubly constrained entropy
        model with spatial separation measured by highway travel time
        appears satisfactory for use in practical modeling efforts.

        Surface parking generates multiple externalities. If left to the
        market the supply of parking is likely to be suboptimal. But
        parking requirements ignore most of the externalities. This
        paper suggests that a tax approach may be a more efficient
        method to internalize the externalities associated with parking
        provision, thereby assuring an optimal supply of parking.
        However, in practice it is infeasible to value all
        externalities in monetary terms and to set such a tax. Hence, a
        suboptimal flat surface parking tax is advanced. In addition to
        its contribution to the reduction of externalities from land
        cover, this tax is likely to have several noteworthy positive
        attributes. It is simple to assess. It will provide an
        incentive for intensifying the use of parking. It may also
        increase the attractiveness of providing underground parking
        relative to surface parking, thereby reducing the
        attractiveness of suburban retail centers relative to central
        cities. A discussion of implementation issues suggests that a
        surface parking tax may face relatively low transaction costs.
        These will be largely a function of the use of revenues. Hence,
        the use of revenues should be specified when such a tax is
        proposed.

        Quote: Forni, Colquhoun and Hasen reported in 1997 a study of the use of
        coloured surfacing in road layouts in Europe. They found that
        the colour red is the most commonly used pavement colour for
        road safety in Europe. However, colours including yellow and
        other combination colours have been successfully used to reduce
        speeds and accidents. The study suggested adopting green
        coloured surfacing for schemes that aim to identify sections of
        road for use by certain vehicles such as buses or bicycles.

         Land-use impacts on travel demand and vehicle emissions is
         emerging as a topic of major interest, as several regions
         around the nation struggle to demonstrate conformance with the
         requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).
         The implementation of the CAAA threatens the withholding of
         federal transportation funding from several regions unable to
         demonstrate the ability to meet milestone reductions in
         emissions required by the CAAA. A case study of a network of
         policies emerging in Washington State as part of growth
         management efforts is presented. These policies, when coupled
         with federal clean air (CAAA) and surface transportation
         legislation (ISTEA), provide a framework for the
         implementation of land-use strategies that are associated with
         less vehicular travel and emissions. A review of the land
         development and transportation investment policies espoused in
         newly adopted local comprehensive plans in the Central Puget
         Sound Region of Washington State are presented. This review
         indicates a shift toward planning solutions that could result
         in reduced vehicle emissions if implemented.

        Increases in per capita vehicle usage and associated emissions have

        Health, highlights the increasing level of physical inactivity as a

        subject of considerable debate  in  the  literature.  Findings  have

        approaches, and their critiques are analyzed. While most agree that the
        built environment influences travel, considerable disagreement exists
        over the likely impacts of increased density, mix, and street

        An increasing body of evidence suggests that moderate forms of
        physical activity (such as walking and bicycling), when engaged
        in regularly, can have important beneficial effects on public
        health. This article reviews current public health, planning,
        and urban design research to determine, first, how walking and
        bicycling might be critically important exercise behaviors for
        improving public health, second, how urban form affects the
        frequency of walking and bicycling as a form of physical
        activity, and third, how the public health considerations
        outlined in this article might reorient planners' thinking
        toward the realization of health-promotive environments. The
        current lack of emphasis on the interdependencies between built
        form and overall quality of life, as measured by health,
        safety, and welfare considerations, suggests the need for a
        rethinking of public policy approaches to transportation
        investment and land development.

        A leading cause of air pollution in many urban regions is mobile
        source emissions that are largely attributable to household
        vehicle travel. While household travel patterns have been
        previously related with land use in the literature (Crane, R.,
        1996. Journal of the American Planning Association 62
        (1, Winter); Cervero, R. and Kockelman, C., 1997.
        Transportation Research Part D 2 (3), 199--219), little
        work has been conducted that effectively extends this
        relationship to vehicle emissions. This paper describes a
        methodology for quantifying relationships between land use,
        travel choices, and vehicle emissions within the Seattle,
        Washington region. Our analysis incorporates land use measures of
        density and mix which affect the proximity of trip origins to
        destinations; a measure of connectivity which impacts the
        directness and completeness of pedestrian and motorized
        linkages; vehicle trip generation by operating mode; vehicle
        miles/h of travel and speed; and estimated household vehicle
        emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and
        carbon monoxide. The data used for this project consists of the
        Puget Sound Transportation Panel Travel Survey, the 1990 US
        Census, employment density data from the Washington State
        Employment Security Office, and information on Seattle's
        vehicle fleet mix and climatological attributes provided by the
        Washington State Department of Ecology. Analyses are based on a
        cross-sectional research design in which comparisons are made
        of variations in household travel demand and emissions across
        alternative urban form typologies. Base emission rates from
        MOBILE5a and separate engine start rates are used to calculate
        total vehicle emissions in grams accounting for fleet
        characteristics and other inputs reflecting adopted
        transportation control measures. Emissions per trip are based
        on the network distance of each trip, average travel speed, and
        a multi-stage engine operating mode (cold start, hot start, and
        stabilized) function.

        transport scenarios, and related social and economic impacts.
        Several activity- and utility-based accessibility measures were
        computed to analyse job accessibility by car and public transport
        in the Netherlands for: (1) the (base) year 1995, (2) a Trend, or
        business-as-usual, scenario, representing the continuation of
        (restrictive) Dutch land-use policies and historical land-use
        trends for 1995-2020, (2) a Tolerant scenario, representing a
        land-use scenario, in which consumers' housing preferences
        determine land-use developments for 1995-2020. The scenarios are
        based on calculations using national land-use models and a national
        transport model. The main conclusion arising from this study is
        that the current Dutch practice of evaluating the
        (infrastructure-based) accessibility impacts of (land-use)
        transport projects, plans or scenarios can be improved by
        estimating activity-based accessibility measures, using existing
        land-use and transport data, and/or models.  Activity-based
        accessibility measures are very well able to analyse accessibility
        impacts, satisfactorily incorporate the different components of
        accessibility (i.e. the transport, land-use, temporal and
        individual components) and serve as a useful tool for analysing
        social impacts. Utility-based accessibility measures may provide a
        useful basis for economic evaluations of land-use transport
        scenarios, but further research is necessary to analyse the added
        value to existing evaluation methods.

        This paper is criticized on several grounds. It disregards much
        of the recent work in this area that has empirically estimated
        induced travel relationships. The models specified are
        inappropriate for properly addressing this question, both in
        their use of road expenditure data (based on a misunderstanding
        of how this may relate to traffic growth) and
        specification of a model that does not account for other
        variables that generally have a large effect on traffic growth
        (notably population and income growth). The evidence in the
        literature is summarized and an analysis of UK road expenditure
        data shows that expenditure is not a good measure of actual
        road capacity that is built.

        This project examined the factors that determine how suitable a
        road is for cycling (its level of service for cycling, here
        termed `cyclability'). Using a specially equipped
        instrumented bicycle, 51 cyclists road a 9.2km route and made
        subjective assessments of the `cyclability' of its 11 links.
        The authors then tried to explain the subjective scores in
        terms of objective road and traffic data. These included road
        width, surface quality, traffic flow and speed, passing
        distance, gradient, `lateral conflict', effort and aesthetics.
        This approach has potential applications in the field of cycle
        route planning as it can provide engineers with reassurance
        that certain types of conditions are likely to be deemed
        satisfactory by the majority of cyclists.

    abstract = {
        Proximity to transportation infrastructure (highways and public
        transit) influences residential real estate values. Housing
        values also are influenced by propinquity to a shopping
        facility or a recreational amenity. Spatial autoregressive
        (SAR) models were used to estimate the impact of locational
        elements on the price of residential properties sold during
        1995 in the Greater Toronto Area. A large data set consisting
        of 27,400 freehold sales was used in the study. Moran's I was
        estimated to determine the effects of spatial autocorrelation
        that existed in housing values. SAR models, using a combination
        of locational influences, neighborhood characteristics, and
        structural attributes, explained 83\% variance in housing
        values. Using the ``comparable sales approach,'' a spatiotemporal
        lag variable was estimated for every property in the database.
        This research discovered that SAR models offered a better fit
        than nonspatial models. This study also discovered that in the
        presence of other explanatory variables, locational and
        transportation factors were not strong determinants of housing
        values. On the other hand, the number of washrooms and the
        average household income in a neighborhood were found to be
        significant determinants of housing values. Stepwise regression
        techniques were used to determine reduced spatial hedonic
        models.

        In the chapter I read (#9), there was some mildly interesting
        background, although mostly material I'd seen
        before elsewhere. There's some discussion of Harland Bartholomew,
        the planner who laid out Vancouver's street grid, although he's
        claimed to belong to the same camp as Robert Moses. The most
        interesting part of the chapter was the way he highlighted the
        impossibility of effective land planning in the American regulatory
        system, how that came about, and how it differs from Europe.

        Efforts to improve transportation choices and enhance accessibility
        at the neighborhood level have been hampered by a lack of practical
        planning tools. This paper identifies the factors that contribute
        to accessibility at the neighborhood level and explores different
        ways that planners can evaluate neighborhood accessibility. A gap
        between the data needed to describe important accessibility factors
        and the data readily available to local planning departments points
        to two complementary strategies: a city-wide approach using
        available data and geographic information systems to evaluate
        accessibility for neighborhoods across the city, and a
        neighborhood-specific approach to building a detailed accessibility
        database. Examples of both are presented.

    abstract = {
        Recent work in the area of transportation and land use modeling
        and, more specifically, residential mobility modeling has
        recognized the need for increased experimentation with dynamic
        models. Implicitly, dynamic models require longitudinal data,
        which are time-consuming and expensive to collect. As an
        alternative to panel studies, a retrospective interviewing
        technique to collect data for use in a dynamic model of
        residential mobility is examined. A small retrospective survey
        of households in Toronto, Canada, was conducted using three
        data collection methods: mail, telephone, and telephone with
        mail. Ninety complete observations were obtained. The
        retrospective survey process and the three data collection
        methods are assessed and evaluated. Though not without
        problems, the retrospective survey proved to be a favorable
        alternative to panel studies. The telephone-with-mail survey
        method showed the most potential for use in future data
        collection efforts on the basis of its costs, response rates,
        and quality of data.

        This study presents evidence that households, located in areas of
        the Atlanta Region with moderately high levels of street
        connectivity and compactness, drive and pollute less on a daily
        basis. This analysis employs a rigorous methodology to assess
        the emissions per household on a per trip basis accounting for
        cold start cycles, speed, hot stabilized operation, distance,
        and regional fleet characteristics. Emissions per household are
        cross-sectionally correlated with the land use patterns at the
        place of residence. These findings support the argument that a
        ``nexus'' exists between land use policies implemented through
        local government development regulations and household travel
        behavior (ie mode choice, travel distance, travel time, and
        vehicle emissions). This research provides an initial
        and very critical step that is required to lend credibility to
        the argument that major metropolitan regions should consider
        alternatives to current land and travel intensive development
        patterns to meet future air quality objectives.

        This paper describes the development and testing of a
        microsimulation of the evolution of individual ''business
        establishments'' (BEs) in an economy. The work is part of a
        larger program of research and development of a model of all
        the transportation and land development processes in an entire
        spatial economic system. The simulation uses comparatively
        simple, yet behavioural, rules and probabilistic models, using
        a Monte Carlo process to simulate behaviour from the
        probabilistic models. A BE is described primarily by its
        business transactions - its purchases and sales of standard
        commodity categories, called its ``consumption function'' and
        ``production function'' respectively. Make and Use tables from
        traditional input-output models are used to determine these
        relationships for a particular industry, and individual BEs
        randomly vary around the industry average. Labour, floorspace
        and final demand are included as commodities, to bind the BEs
        to a given built form in a spatial system and to the patterns
        of population. Thus a BE is described in terms of how big it
        is, and its ``technical coefficients'' describing what it
        purchases and sells.

        The market for each commodity type is spatially disaggregated,
        and BEs in a given location can sell or purchase their commodities
        in a variety of different ``exchange zones'' that they are
        willing to ship goods or services from or to. Prices at
        exchange zones are adjusted over time so that, if the system is
        allowed to reach equilibrium, the market for each commodity in
        each exchange will be cleared. The BE's market choice model is
        used to develop measures of the attractiveness of selling or
        purchasing commodities when located in a zone. These measures
        of commodity attractiveness are used with the production
        function and consumption function to determine how attractive a
        location is for a given BE and how well it is performing. A
        BE's growth (positive and negative) and its probability of
        bankruptcy (death) are based on the measure of location
        attractiveness. Relocation pressures are based on the measure
        of location attractiveness, as well as a composite measure of
        the attractiveness of all other zones in the system and the
        (fixed) attractiveness of leaving the model region entirely.
        Relocating BEs vacate floorspace in a particular physical
        location (a ``grid cell'') and then, if necessary, acquire new
        floorspace in a grid cell in a different zone. As a successful
        BE grows it is increasingly likely to split into two separate
        BEs, either as a duplication of function into another location,
        or a separation of business functions into separate locations. In
        addition, entrepreneurial business ideas are set up as ``Proto
        BEs'', which are business ideas that are being evaluated in any
        one year. A ``Proto BE'' that is in an attractive location in one
        year is likely to become an actual BE in the next year. Within
        each zone, the land is represented as ``grid cells'', which are
        finite quantities of land with a particular type and quantity
        of floorspace and a particular building age. The prices for
        each floorspace type in each zone, along with the age, type and
        quantity of floorspace in each grid cell, are used to calculate
        the probability that the land owner will choose to undertake
        development, redevelopment, renovation or demolition in the
        grid cell. The test system is represented using a 10x10 system
        of zones and a network of transport connecting the zones with
        reasonable travel times and costs. This system is used to test
        the role of the various parameters, to determine reasonable
        values for the parameters, how the model behaves when parameter
        values are unreasonable, and how each parameter influences the
        model system. A set of ``policy input'' scenarios are also
        developed, to show how the modelling system can be used to test
        the policy response. These include decreased development costs,
        increased travel costs and changed land-use zoning regulations.

        By incorporating characteristics of the built environment into
        models of travel behavior, much can be said about household
        travel distances, automobile ownership, and mode choice. This
        research investigates the relative significance of a variety of
        measures of urban form, both at trip-makers' home neighborhoods
        and at trip ends. The travel data come from the 1990 San
        Francisco Bay Area Travel Surveys, and the land-use data are
        largely constructed from hectare-level descriptions provided by
        the Association of Bay Area Governments.

        After controlling for demographic characteristics, the measures
        of accessibility, land use mixing, and land use balance proved
        to be highly statistically significant and influential in their
        impact on household vehicle miles traveled (VMT), automobile
        ownership, and mode choice. In contrast, under the majority of
        models (with the important exception of the vehicle-ownership
        models), density's impact was negligible, after
        controlling for accessibility. In many cases, balance, mix, and
        accessibility were found to be more relevant (as measured by
        elasticities) than several household and traveler
        characteristics that often form a basis for travel behavior
        prediction. Moreover, the apparent influence that these
        variables, particularly accessibility, have on travel behavior
        is dramatic.

        If a societal objective is reduced automobile use and
        dependence, while maintaining or improving general
        accessibility levels, these results lend empirical support to
        the promotion of a variety of land-use policies, such as
        regional growth containment, the raising and/or removal of
        density/intensity caps, and the establishment of mixed-use and
        flexible zoning standards throughout urban areas. These results
        also represent a step forward in the inclusion of measures of
        urban form in travel behavior forecasting models; thanks to the
        technology of geographical information systems and the
        increasing availability of detailed land-use data sets, such
        measures can be computed for a multitude of zones at relatively
        low cost.

        Demarcating on-street bicycle facilities is often mentioned as an
        important strategy to encourage increased bicycle safety and
        bicycle travel. However, little if any literature has focused
        on instances where separate on-street bicycle facilities end.
        This paper better understands the severity of such instances
        and corresponding physical characteristics. We identify 30
        discontinuities of on-street bicycle lanes in Minneapolis,
        Minnesota, and collect primary data measuring their physical
        attributes and cyclists' perceptions of the level of comfort
        while cycling through each. Using multi-variate analysis, the
        findings suggest that discontinuities ending on the left
        side of the street, with increased distance of crossing
        intersections, having parking after the
        discontinuities, and wider width of the curb lane are
        statistical elements that contribute to higher levels
        of discomfort. Such analysis is useful in determining
        bicyclists' comfort level where discontinuities exist
        and such methods can be an important part of an overall
        level of service toolkit for planning on-street bicycle
        lanes.

    abstract = {The objective of the EU research project PROPOLIS (Planning
        and Research of Policies for Land Use and Transport for
        Increasing Urban Sustainability) is to assess urban strategies
        and to demonstrate their long-term effect in European cities. To
        reach this goal, a comprehensive framework of methodologies
        including integrated land use, transport and environmental
        modelling as well as indicator, evaluation and presentation systems
        have been developed. Sustainable development is viewed as
        comprising the environmental, socio-cultural and economic
        dimension. About thirty key indicators have been defined to measure
        the three dimensions of sustainability, such as air pollution,
        consumption of natural resources, quality of open space, population
        exposure to air pollution and noise, equity and opportunities and
        economic benefits from transport and land use.

        Indicator values are derived from state-of-the-art urban land use
        and transport models. A number of additional modules, including a
        justice evaluation module, an economic evaluation module and a
        GIS-based raster module, have been developed and integrated to
        provide further indicator values. Both multicriteria and
        cost-benefit analysis methods are used to consistently evaluate the
        impact of the policies. The environmental and social dimensions of
        sustainability are measured using multicriteria analysis for the
        evaluation of the indicators, whereas cost-benefit analysis is used
        for the economic dimension. The modelling and evaluation system is
        currently being implemented in seven European urban
        agglomerations: Bilbao (Spain), Brussels (Belgium),
        Dortmund (Germany), Helsinki (Finland), Inverness (Scotland), Naples
        (Italy) and Vicenza (Italy).

        A large number of policies will be tested with the modelling and
        evaluation system in the seven urban regions. Policies to be
        investigated are land use policies, transport infrastructure
        policies, transport regulation and pricing policies and
        combinations of these. Besides a common policy set for all seven
        urban regions, city-specific local policies will be assessed as
        well. The first part of the paper will introduce the methodology
        and the modelling system developed. The second part will present
        first results of the policy testing and evaluation. The paper will
        conclude with initial conclusions on successful strategies to
        enhance the long-term sustainability of urban regions.

        The primary goal of activity-based models is a fundamental
        examination of the behavioral process that results in revealed
        travel behavior. To reveal this process, a new computer
        program, iCHASE, has been developed to collect data for a study
        of the determinants of travel and activity behavior in
        households. These data are inherently dynamic, since
        respondents record planned activity schedules and then update
        these schedules on a daily basis, fully defined in time and
        space. The resultant data will facilitate the identification of
        fundamental inter-relationships among a comprehensive range of
        revealed travel and activity participation variables, leading
        toward the identification of the critical variables,
        relationships and rules that govern that behavior. It is believed
        that an Internet-based travel survey, particularly one as rich
        in resultant content as iCHASE, will significantly reduce data
        collection costs, improve data quality and quantity and allow
        for continuous data collection.

    abstract = {
        Parking's broad influence over travel in the modern urban setting
        is discussed, including recent changes in urban priorities and
        transport policies created by contemporary concerns for
        environment, energy, and air pollution. Downtown parking issues
        and options are reviewed. They include questions related to how
        parking affects and is affected by many other factors,
        including community development, environemental concerns,
        transportation goals, existing parking facilities and street
        systems, urban and suburban transit stops and the like. The
        impacts of increasing or decreasing automobile access are
        depicted. Three basic city center types are identified and
        described: extensively transit-oriented, intermediate transit
        use, and predominantly automobile oriented.  The basic problems
        posed by commuter parking are covered, as are options for
        dealing with them. Four options for downtown parking and
        transportation policy are presented: trend projection, maintain
        present auto-transit balance, all future growth by transit, and
        reduce the number of automobiles accumulated downtown. Air
        quality considerations are mentioned. Parking supply and demand
        can be adjusted by stabilizing downtown parking supply,
        revising parking rates to encourage short- term use, and
        implementing new zoning policies to limit parking. Each option
        is discussed. Urban parking policies require community
        participation. The groups and concerns involved are reviewed.
        Parking guidelines are suggested for major transit corridors.
        Recommendations are made on issues to be considered in forming
        parking policies and programs in the future.

        This study investigates the relationship between land use and
        shopping tour generation using an activity-based shopping model
        that captures the effects of land use patterns on household
        decisions of shopping tour frequency, tour scheduling and mode
        choice. The model was calibrated using travel data collected in
        three traditional neighborhoods located in the Puget Sound region,
        WA, and shopping travel patterns across seven common household
        structures were analyzed. The results reveal that land use patterns
        have virtually no impact on overall shopping tour frequency.
        However, land use does seem to be associated with decisions about
        the type of shopping tours undertaken. For example, households with
        poorer accessibility tend to make fewer one-stop shopping tours,
        and are more likely to combine shopping trips with other trips to
        form multi-stop shopping tours as a means of compensating for
        locational deficiencies. Finally, we also found that traditional
        neighborhood residents who live closer to the neighborhood
        commercial street, and thus, have greater accessibility, are more
        inclined to use non-auto modes for one-stop shopping tours.

        Recent developments in the area of dynamic household activity
        scheduling require better understanding of the behavioural
        aspects of scheduling processes within households, and, in
        particular, formation and modification of the provisional
        schedule, conflict resolution, and rescheduling processes.  The
        goal of this paper is to identify and examine scheduling
        processes within households using data collected in Quebec City
        using the Computerized Household Activity Scheduling Elicitor
        (CHASE) survey software.  CHASE addresses the problems of
        detailed data collection not only concerning activities and
        travel per se, but also scheduling behaviour processes
        themselves, including dynamic modifications to the schedule
        during its execution phase.  Univariate analysis performed on
        the CHASE data provides insights and correlations between
        household characteristics and the nature of these processes but
        also questions the activity scheduling approach based on
        generic activity type classification rules.

        This paper provides a quantitative analysis and comparison between
        the recent Toronto Activity Panel Survey CHASE (Computerized
        Household Activity Scheduling Elicitor) dataset and a
        previously collected Quebec City CHASE dataset with the focus
        on household agenda formation.

        The CHASE datasets were analyzed in the context of a newly
        developed event-driven time-series based activity scheduling
        framework that explicitly incorporates individuals' agenda
        formation.  The modelling framework, based on McTaggart's
        concept of time, has two levels of agenda abstraction:
        conceptual and perceptual, where the second level of
        abstraction includes provisional sequences of activity
        episodes.  CHASE has been designed to provide detailed
        observation of scheduling processes and agenda formation.  In
        particular it allows one to trace activity schedule evolution
        from the planning phase, through modification phases to the
        execution phase.  An original computer algorithm has been
        applied to the datasets to allow the analyst to visualize the
        development of provisional activity sequences.

    abstract = {
        The time dimension in decision-making and activity scheduling
        models in both conceptual and operational applications is a
        critical issue.  A crude conceptualization of time in current
        models creates a number of problems with representing dynamic
        decision-making processes and limits the potential of existing
        models.  Event-Driven Time-Series Based Dynamic Model of
        Decision Making Processes is a proposition of a modeling
        framework that attempts to simulate the natural way of
        decision-making and scheduling behaviour which transforms
        agent's ideas from their conceptual phase through a provisional
        schedule to eventually executed activity patterns.  It is based
        on concepts of time in philosophy and science of social
        behaviour and psychology.  The Event-Driven Time-Series Based
        Dynamic Model links short-term scheduling with long-term
        planning and lifetime decision-making.  This provides a natural
        link with car ownership or land use models and also provides
        for a dynamic interface with microsimulation models of network
        performance sensitive to short-term fluctuations of traffic
        condition.  The model explicitly utilizes conceptual
        and perceptual time-spaces and exploits non-linearity
        and multidimensionality of decision-making time-space.
        The decision-making agents explicitly recognize a time
        horizon and their decision-making behaviour is driven
        by events.

        Bike-and-ride, or the combined use of bicycle and public transport
        for one trip, is a multimodal alternative for the car. This
        paper discusses the use of bike-and-ride in three countries
        with widely differing bicycle cultures and
        infrastructures: the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.
        The share of the bicycle in access trips is comparable
        to general levels of bicycle ridership in each country,
        but only for train services and other fast modes of
        public transport. Strong similarities are found
        in the characteristics of bike-and-ride trips
        and users, in terms of travel distances, travel
        motives, and the impact of car availability. The
        majority of bike-and-ride users travels between
        2 and 5 km to a public transport stop, with
        longer access distances reported for faster
        modes of public transport. Work and education
        are the main travel motives, with the first
        dominating the faster modes and the second the
        slower modes of public transport. Car
        availability hardly influences the choice for a
        combined use of bicycle and train, but strongly
        affects the levels of bike-and-ride for slower
        modes of transport.

        The number of policy initiatives to promote the use of
        bike-and-ride, or the combined use of bicycle and public transport
        for one trip, has grown considerably over the past decade as part
        of the search for more sustainable transport solutions. This paper
        discusses the experiences with, and impacts of, such initiatives in
        the Netherlands. The Dutch measures to promote bicycle use in
        access trips have been generally successful. A country-wide program
        to upgrade regular and secure bicycle parking at train stations has
        led to an increase in user satisfaction and a growth in bicycles
        parked at stations. Smaller programs to stimulate the combined use
        of bike-and-bus have resulted in an increase in bicycle use, bus
        use, and share of infrequent bus passengers. Bicycle lockers at bus
        stops are hardly used by bus passengers, due in part to the
        dominance of students among bus users as well as the relatively
        high price of lockers in comparison to the value of bicycles used
        for access trips. Measures to promote the use of the bicycle in
        egress trips have met with more varying results. Projects to
        introduce leasing bicycles for egress trips have failed to attract
        passengers, for both train and bus services. In contrast, the
        introduction of flexible rental bicycles at train stations has
        resulted in a small reduction in car use, growth in train trips,
        and growth in bicycle use for non-recurrent trips. The Dutch
        experiences suggest some lessons for promoting bike-and-ride in
        countries and cities with a less well-developed bicycle
        infrastructure.

        This paper looks at the connection between the regulation of
        parking by cities, transit service levels, and travel and parking
        behavior in the United States.  Travel behavior information comes
        from the 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) and
        the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration's 1990 Section
        15 Report. Data on the current state of parking programs in place
        in central business districts of the U.S. is identifed through
        telephone interviews of local officials responsible for parking
        policies from the twenty cities identified in the NPTS.  The travel
        behavior analyses and the data from the parking officials
        interviews were combined with data from the Federal Highway
        Administration's Journey-to-Work data to group cities according to
        their parking policies, transit service, and ridership levels on a
        continuum of ``Transit- Accommodating Cities'' and ``Auto-Accommodating
        Cities''. A key finding is that cities with interventionist parking
        policies, high parking prices and limited supply, frequent transit
        service, and a high probability that travelers will pay to park are
        the most likely to have high transit ridership figures.

         This paper provides an overview of the state of the art of
         microsimulation modeling applied to activity-based travel
         forecasting. The paper defines what is meant by
         microsimulation and discusses why microsimulation might be a
         preferred approach to activity-based forecasting in many
         applications. The issue of synthesizing and updating
         characteristics of the population being simulated is addressed
         in some detail. Examples of various types of microsimulation
         models which have been developed to date are provided,
         including microsimulation models of auto ownership, residential
         mobility, route choice and network performance, as well as
         activity-based travel forecasting models per se. The paper
         concludes with a discussion of research development issues
         associated with the continuing development of operational
         microsimulation models. These include: further evaluation of
         population synthesizing and updating methods; determination of
         appropriate levels of model disaggregation; establishing
         appropriate linkages between model components; examination of
         the statistical properties of microsimulation models; and
         demonstration of the computational feasibility of these very
         computer-intensive modeling systems.

        Some empirical findings are presented on the relationship between
        urban form and work trip commuting efficiency, drawn from the
        analysis of 1986 work trip commuting patterns in the greater
        Toronto area. Work trip commuting efficiency is measured with
        respect to the average number of vehicle kilometers traveled
        (VKT) per worker in a given zone. Preliminary findings include
        VKT per worker increases as one moves away from both the
        central core of the city and from other high-density employment
        centers within the region; job-housing balance, per se, shows
        little impact on commuting VKT; and population density, in and
        of itself, does not explain variations on commuting VKT once
        other urban structure variables have been accounted for.

        The case is presented for a new, coordinated research and
        development (R\&D) program designed to improve significantly
        the operational state of practice in integrated urban modeling.
        First, the authors' view of an ``ideal'' integrated urban
        modeling system is described. If developed, this modeling
        system should be capable of incorporating the best possible
        understanding of transportation and land use interactions and
        of addressing planning and analysis needs. Also discussed
        briefly are current operational modeling capabilities as
        related to the proposed ideal model. Finally, a multiyear R\&D
        program that was designed to move current practice
        significantly toward the operationalization of the ideal model
        is detailed.

        Interesting and useful.

        I find one assumption dubious: the decision to use a car for one part of
        a chain requires its use for the rest of the chain. In a city like
        Toronto where downtown parking is very inconvenient, I might drive
        downtown, park, and then do a long chain of trips on foot before
        returning to the car.

        This paper was presented at the 'Cost-Effective Traffic Operations
        Through Innovation' session. The importance of parking policies
        as complementary policies to an overall urban transportation
        strategy has been acknowledged as a key component in
        influencing both transit use and ridesharing. The main focus of
        this article is the relationship between downtown long-stay
        parking supply and transit use, and the implications of this
        relationship for developing downtown parking policies. Based on
        a survey of Canadian cities, it was determined that peak hour
        transit modal split to downtown areas is inversely proportional
        to the ratio of long-stay parking stalls per downtown employee.
        The analysis indicated that this relationship is highly
        statistically significant for Canadian and American cities. The
        implication of the findings is that the main choice with
        respect to establishing a long-stay parking policy is directly
        linked to the modal split goal.  Thus, policy makers should
        first establish a desirable and achievable modal split goal and
        then establish a long-stay parking strategy which would match
        the supply of long-stay parking with the modal split goal.

        Parking policies can complement an overall urban transportation
        strategy by influencing both transit use and ridesharing. This
        article presents a study of the downtown parking supply and
        transportation policies of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in
        relation to other Canadian cities. The focus of the study is
        the relationship between downtown parking supply and transit
        use. In a study survey, a strong relationship is found between
        peak-period modal split to public transit and the supply of
        downtown parking. Specifically, the proportion of downtown
        commuters using public transportation is inversely proportional
        to the ratio of parking stalls per downtown employee.

        This paper reviews recent research into the demand inducing effects
        of new transportation capacity. We begin with a discussion of
        the basic theoretical background and then review recent
        research both in the UK and the US. Results of this research
        show strong evidence that new transportation capacity induces
        increased travel, both due to short run effects and long run
        changes in land use development patterns. While this topic has
        long been debated amongst transportation planners, the
        fundamental hypothesis and theory has long been apparent in
        studies of transportation economics and planning that evaluated
        different issues (e.g. travel time budgets and urban economic
        development effects). We summarize much of this work
        and relate the theoretical issues to recent empirical research.
        We then proceed to examine recent changes in transportation and
        environmental policy in the US and the UK. The role of the new
        knowledge of induced travel effects would be expected to lead
        to changes in the conduct of transportation and environmental
        policy. Changes in policy and implementation of those policies
        are still occurring and we provide some suggestions on how to
        move forward in these areas.

        Nowadays, many applications need data modeling facilities for the
        description of complex objects with spatial and/or temporal
        facilities. Responses to such requirements may be found in
        Geographic Information Systems (GIS), in some DBMS, or in the
        research literature. However, most of existing models cover
        only partly the requirements (they address either spatial or
        temporal modeling), and most are at the logical level,
        hence not well suited for database design. This paper proposes a
        spatio-temporal modeling approach at the conceptual level,
        called MADS. The proposal stems from the identification of the
        criteria to be met for a conceptual model. It is advocated that
        orthogonality is the key issue for achieving a powerful and
        intuitive conceptual model. Thus, the proposal focuses on
        highlighting similarities in the modeling of space and time,
        which enhance readability and understandability of the model.

        I found their description of Houston interesting. I'd heard a lot
        about Houston's laissez-faire no-zoning policies, but I'd never
        read anything about the details. It sounds like they still suffer
        from the same social exclusion effects as many U.S. residential
        areas, but they use deed restrictions to enforce the exclusion
        instead of zoning laws. The authors give a surprisingly positive
        review to the HOV system overall, quite different from what I'd
        heard about HOV lanes in the present day context. Overall,
        Houston sounds like a depressing place to live or work. The
        complete rejection of land use control and the overwhelming
        dominance of the automobile turn me off. The Washington, D.C. case
        study wasn't very interesting to me, focusing mainly on
        transit-oriented development plans. The Portland section was
        slightly more interesting, again focusing on how land use goals
        are achieved by the agencies involved. The Vancouver section was
        mostly familiar, but did contain some interesting details that were
        new to me. There are some strange comments, though---they
        claim that the ``European and Asian heritage of the region has also
        made the Vancouver community more accepting of transit'' and
        characterise Vancouver as very unique within Canada. That's
        total rubbish---Canadian cities generally have an accepting attitude
        towards transit and a diverse cultural mix, and American cities
        have as much of a ``European heritage'' as Canadian ones. Sure,
        Vancouver is younger---but that should put it in the same boat as
        other young west coast cities, like Seattle. Some of their
        discussion regarding the history of SkyTrain is interesting,
        however, especially the idea that the Expo line was deliberately
        run through empty industrial areas to reduce NIMBY resistance and
        to allow new, denser transit-oriented development. They also note
        that TransLink does not own the land under the SkyTrain, allowing
        existing owners to make good use of the land, building towers
        around the tracks, etc. This is vastly better than the freeway
        model, where the land underneath and nearby is just dead space.
        Interestingly, they note that both Canadian and American government
        agencies put out a Request For Proposals (RFP) for a low-cost site,
        but only Canadian agencies can make location a requirement---i.e.,
        requiring a site on the SkyTrain line.

        I'm a bit dubious about their Ottawa section. They speak in glowing
        terms about many of the details of the system, and it doesn't
        always jibe with my experience when I lived there. Granted, I lived
        in a lousy area (far from the transitway) with a poor commute
        pattern. But there was a huge chunk of underserviced city where I
        lived, and I did see how the policies were working out on the
        ground. However, the policies sound like good ideas, at the least.
        They started with a bizarre statistic to make Ottawa look good:
        ``Passengers per route mile in the first year,'' a statistic
        biased towards bus systems, before development associated with a
        fixed rail system is completed. It's nice that (like Vancouver)
        they officially prioritise transit over road improvements, and that
        they consider it an official service. Their policy of building
        early in suburban areas is also an excellent idea, as is the policy
        of forcing regional shopping centres to be within 5 minutes walk of
        a transit station. (I have to wonder if that applies to big box
        zones, though---they were certainly abundant in the Ottawa area
        when I lived there. The abhorrent South Keys development all
        happened under these policies.) The Transitway design is clever,
        since they left enough room to allow later conversion to a
        rail system. One telling quote: ``These services are adapted to,
        and as a result, help reinforce, the region's suburban landscape.
        In Ottawa-Carleton, it is accepted that low-density living
        environments are preferred by most residents, and that transit
        programs should in no way seek to alter this settlement
        pattern, but rather to serve it.''  To be fair, that pattern
        may be changing now---the condo boom has definitely hit Ottawa.
        I suspect some of these sentences reflect the suburban American
        audience of this report. Ottawa also has taken a serious attitude
        towards directing job growth to transit corridors, in a manner
        similar to the Dutch ABC system. They also route buses through
        subdivision collector roads instead of arterial streets, to make
        for easier pedestrian access and avoiding the fight to access
        buses on arterials. (This may explain some of my confusion with
        the bus system, since I was more accustomed to the Toronto
        approach. It may also explain why buses were often poor choices
        for reaching retail areas, usually located on the arterials. It
        sounds like that was mostly political bad luck, though, not
        design---developers have insisted on siting commercial development
        on the arterials, not the planners' first choice.) Their reduction
        in downtown parking is admirable, with a 15\% reduction from
        1975 to 1984, a period of regression for most cities. They
        don't really comment much on the fact that many Transitway stations
        are built in parkland with no adjacent development, but they do
        note that future stations are being built in advance of development,
        with an aim to integrate better with mixed-use neighbourhoods. They
        claim pessimistically that the high-density transit-oriented
        residential demand had reached saturation point (!!) in Ottawa by
        1993. At the end of the day, they've had difficulty achieving their
        goals, with regional employment share near transit stations
        remaining fairly static from 1986--1991. But they're still far
        ahead of most of North America.

        Cycle tracks can help cyclists to avoid sharing busy roads with
        motor vehicles. One of the main problems with providing them,
        however, is the design of crossings of minor roads. This introduces
        a hazard and cyclists are usually required to give way. Highway
        authorities have been reluctant to give priority to cyclists in
        case drivers fail to observe the priorities and casualties
        occur. This project investigates the safety and effectiveness
        of a variety of cycle track crossing arrangements at minor road
        T-junctions, including crossings with priority for cyclists.
        Five cycle track crossings were monitored using video cameras
        and 223 cyclists using the crossings were interviewed. The
        report draws conclusions about the safety of various designs
        and makes recommendations about cycle track crossing design.

        Spatial analysis and evolution simulation of such complex and
        dynamic systems as modern urban areas could greatly benefit
        from the synergy of methods and techniques that constitute the
        core of the fields of Information Technology and Artificial
        Intelligence. Additionally, if during the decision making
        process, a consistent methodology is applied and assisted by a
        user-friendly interface, premium and pragmatic solution
        strategies can be tested and evaluated.

        In such a framework, this paper presents both a prototype
        Decision Support System and a consorting spatio-temporal
        methodology, for modelling urban growth. Its main focus is on
        the analysis of current trends, the detection of the factors
        that mostly affect the evolution process and the examination of
        user-defined hypotheses regarding future states of the problem
        environment.

        According to the approach, a neural network model is formulated
        for a specific time intervals and each different group of
        spatial units, mainly based to the degree of their
        contiguity and spatial interaction. At this stage,
        fuzzy logic provides a precise image of spatial entities, further
        exploited in a twofold way. First, for the analysis and
        interpretation of up-to-date urban evolution and second, for
        the formulation of a robust spatial simulation model. It should
        be stressed, however, that the neural network model is not
        solely used to define future urban images, but also to evaluate
        the degree of influence that each variable as a significant of
        problem parameter, contributes to the final result. Thus, the
        formulation and the analysis of alternative planning scenarios
        are assisted.

        Both the proposed methodological framework and the prototype
        Decision Support System are utilized during the study of
        Attica, Greece's principal prefecture and the definition of a
        twenty-year forecast. The variables considered and projected
        refer to population data derived from the 1961-1991 censuses
        and building uses aggregated in ten different categories. The
        final results are visualised through thematic maps in a GIS
        environment. Finally, the performance of the methodology is
        evaluated as well as directions for further improvements and
        enhancements are outlined.

        This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use
        component of a partially integrated land use-transportation
        modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use
        model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel
        demand model (TDM), and travel times from the
        traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the
        subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of
        uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage
        over time. A factorized design approach is used to model
        uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate
        growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model,
        as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results
        suggest that while several model inputs may affect model
        outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a
        cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on
        outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that
        uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few
        years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send
        shocks through the urban system. However, the level of
        uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households,
        jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

        Two important transportation goals for most American downtowns are
        to provide sufficient parking spaces to meet the demand of
        motorists and an attractive pedestrian-friendly environment.
        Yet, when planned for separately, these two goals frequently
        contradict each other. This article discusses the
        characteristics, problems, and strategies associated with
        downtown pedestrians and parking and advocates an integrated
        approach wherein the needs of both pedestrians and motorists
        are balanced. The keys to achieving this balance are (1)
        finding appropriate locations for off-street parking facilities
        that do not impede pedestrian flow, and (2) designing parking
        facilities that are sensitive to pedestrians and facilitate
        pedestrian connections.

        By estimating multinomial choice models, this paper examines the
        relationship between travel mode choice and attributes of the
        local physical environment such as topography, sidewalk
        availability, residential density, and the presence of walking
        and cycling paths. Data for student and staff commuters to the
        University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill are used to
        illustrate the relationship between mode choice and the
        objectively measured environmental attributes, while accounting
        for typical modal characteristics such as travel time, access
        time, and out-of-pocket cost. Results suggest that jointly
        the four attributes of the local physical environment
        make significant marginal contributions to explaining
        travel mode choice. In particular, the estimates reveal
        that local topography and sidewalk availability are
        significantly associated with the attractiveness of

        The concepts `accessibility' and `mobility' are central to urban
        and transport planning, and although they are often used
        interchangeably, they convey fundamentally different concepts. For
        example, mobility, especially when excessive, can have a negative
        connotation, whereas accessibility is always seen as making a
        positive contribution to a community. In investigating the
        relationship between mobility and accessibility it emerges that
        planning policies which favour the one, act against the other, and
        the two can be seen as opposites.

        This research investigates the safety implications and practical

        schemes not including a mandatory cycle lane or
        physical segregation) were examined. Video filming and
        interviews with cyclists were used to collect data from the
        sites. The results were supplemented by data supplied by the
        local authority responsible for the schemes; this data included
        vehicle speeds and reported accidents. The schemes appeared to
        operate safely, supporting the wider use of alternative
        contra-flow cycle schemes in the UK. Design advice is proposed
        on how this can be best achieved. Important factors to consider
        when designing contra-flow schemes are motor vehicle flows,
        motor vehicle speeds, delivery vehicles, parking and side roads.

        Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined
        associations between physical environment variables and
        individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs,
        methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical
        activity and health researchers to improve understanding of
        environmental influences on physical activity. In this review,
        neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to
        walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population
        density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood
        comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized
        transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting
        that residents from communities with higher density, greater
        connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of
        walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density,
        poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental
        variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond
        sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport.
        Implications of the transportation literature for physical
        activity and related research are outlined. Future research
        directions are detailed for physical activity research to
        further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical
        environment factors on physical activity and the potential
        interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental
        variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning
        literatures provide a valuable starting point for
        multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to
        physical activity levels in the population.

        In the interests of promoting effective collaboration among the

        transport and to interpret these studies from a health

        the health literature that examine the relation between
        physical environmental variables and leisure-time physical
        activity that have relevance for transportation research. The
        third purpose was to promote more collaboration among

        The important role of transport infrastructure for regional
        development is one of the fundamental principles of regional
        economics. In its most simplified form it implies that regions
        with better access to locations of input materials and markets
        will, ceteris paribus, be more productive, more competitive and
        hence more successful than more remote and isolated regions.
        The paper presents results of the research project
        'Socio-Economic and Spatial Impacts of Trans-European Transport
        Networks (SASI)' undertaken for the European Commission. The
        main goals of the project were to design an interactive and
        transparent modelling system for forecasting the impacts of
        transport infrastructure investments and transport system
        improvements, in particular of the trans-European transport
        networks (TETN), on socio-economic activities and developments
        in Europe, including spatial and temporal distribution, and to
        demonstrate the usability of the modelling system by applying
        it to a number of relevant case studies. The paper will first
        explain the theoretical foundation and internal structure of
        the simulation model developed as well as its input and output.
        The model is a recursive simulation model of regional
        socio-economic development subject to exogenous assumptions
        about the economic and demographic development of the EU as a
        whole and about transport infrastructure investments and
        improvements. The second part of the paper will present the
        results of the application of the model to a set of different
        assumptions on TETN infrastructure investments and their likely
        socio-economic impacts on the European regions in terms of GDP
        per capita, unemployment and accessibility. The model results
        suggest that the development trajectories of all regions are
        rather similar in all scenarios, thus confirming the assumption
        that general socio-economic and technical macro trends are more
        powerful driving forces for regional economies than
        infrastructure improvements. It is also shown that some
        infrastructure scenarios lead to a slightly less polarised
        distribution of accessibility and GDP among regions, however,
        not enough to reverse the general trend towards economic
        polarisation within the European Union. The third part of the
        paper will outline model improvements currently made in the
        follow-up project 'Integrated Appraisal of Spatial Economic and
        Network Effects of Transport Investments and Policies' (IASON).
        The new model will be more comprehensive in theory and more
        disaggregate in terms of regions and economic sectors and will
        include the future member states of the European Union in
        eastern Europe.

        This paper will explore disaggregate approaches to modeling urban
        systems, organizing recent research, approaches, techniques and
        assumptions. As we know, the advantage of disaggregate
        approaches are that they begin with the individual, the finest
        resolution, enabling aggregation without losing valuable
        information. There is no single modeling technique that can
        provide a useful simulation of individual behaviour within the
        urban system. Instead, a variety of approaches must be
        integrated within a macro model. Each has differing
        assumptions, strengths and weaknesses. The paper will establish
        the players, decisions made and outcomes of modeling urban
        systems. Given these categories, a review of current literature
        demonstrates the emerging approaches for different aspects of
        the urban system model, identifies strengths and weaknesses and
        examines underlying assumptions and data collection techniques.

        Urban planners typically set minimum parking requirements to meet
        the peak demand for parking at each land use, without
        considering either the price motorists pay for parking or the
        cost of providing the required parking spaces. By reducing the
        market price of parking, minimum parking requirements provide
        subsidies that inflate parking demand, and this inflated demand
        is then used to set minimum parking requirements. When
        considered as an impact fee, minimum parking requirements can
        increase development costs by more than 10 times the impact
        fees for all other public purposes combined. Eliminating
        minimum parking requirements would reduce the cost of urban
        development, improve urban design, reduce automobile
        dependency, and restrain urban sprawl.

        Free or underpriced curb parking creates a classic commons problem.
        Studies have found that between 8\% and 74\% of cars in congested
        traffic were cruising in search of curb parking, and that the
        average time to find a curb space ranged between 3 and 14 min.
        Cities can eliminate the economic incentive to cruise by
        charging market-clearing prices for curb parking spaces.
        Market-priced curb parking can yield between 5\% and 8\% of the
        total land rent in a city, and in some neighborhoods can yield
        more revenue than the property tax.

        Although many temporal models have been proposed in the literature,
        there is still need for a conceptual model capturing the essential
        semantics of time-varying information that is free of
        implementation concerns. This paper first discusses important
        criteria to be considered when assessing the conceptual
        quality of a temporal model. Then, it presents the main
        temporal features of MADS, a spatio-temporal conceptual model.
        The focus is on identifying issues that are either open or
        controversial, and discussing alternatives, if any. Finally, it
        is shown how the model may be implemented on top of either
        TSQL2 or a traditional, non-temporal data model.

        Cartography is one of the major application areas using
        geographical databases. Whether it is for the business of
        producing paper maps for sale, or whether it is for displaying
        maps on a screen to visualize the result of a query, we need
        computer systems that know how to represent the same
        geographical area at different scales. The concept of
        multiscale database has become popular in the GIS domain as a
        way to enforce consistency between representations and reduce
        the global update load. Scaling, however, is just one of the
        facets that may lead to keeping several representations for the
        same real-world object. Viewpoint and classification are two
        major abstractions in the design process that also generate
        multiple representations. This paper investigates the generic
        issues and solutions to achieve flexible support of multiple
        representation in a GIS database.

        Some excellent insights into the reasons why transit ridership is
        so low in the United States. A particularly interesting note
        regards the historical growth in Europe and the US: European
        cities have experienced relatively little growth during the age of
        the automobile, which goes a long way towards explaining their
        limited suburbanisation. The comparison between Canada and US is
        more apt, since both have experienced similar growth levels during
        the automobile age.

    abstract = {
        The aim of the paper is to examine whether parking restraint
        policies may have impacts on the economic vitality of urban
        centres. Literature from empirical, attitudinal and modelling
        studies is reviewed within a structure based around a conceptual
        framework of parking impacts. The search for relevant material was
        undertaken both for the UK and overseas, but the discussion and
        conclusions were related to the UK context. Original modelling was
        undertaken and is reported here. This review found that as parking
        restraint policies have not been previously implemented with
        consistency or longevity, there is a lack of direct evidence, given
        that land-use impacts typically involve a long-term response.
        Furthermore, different methods of examining impacts have come to
        very different conclusions. Attitudinal evidence suggests that
        there is a high level of sensitivity to parking provision, whereas
        aggregate statistical studies tend to find only a weak
        relationship. The reasons underlying these differences are
        discussed. Land-use/transport models show impacts if there is
        sufficient change in generalized cost, although the spatial
        distribution of impacts, and impacts by household or employment
        disaggregation, vary considerably. Given the inconclusive nature of
        the evidence to date, only tentative policy implications can be
        drawn. Recommendations for further research are outlined, both for
        empirical study and for model enhancements.

        The importance of factors affecting commuter bicyclists' route
        choices was evaluated. Both route-level (e.g., travel time) and
        link-level (e.g., pavement quality) factors are examined.
        Empirical models are estimated using data from a stated
        preference survey conducted via the Internet. The models
        indicate that, for commuter bicyclists, travel time is the most
        important factor in choosing a route. Presence of a bicycle
        facility ( especially a bike lane or separate path), the level
        of automobile traffic, pavement or riding surface quality, and
        presence of a bicycle facility on a bridge are also very
        important determinants. Furthermore, there are policy
        implications of these results for bicycle facility planning.

        This paper is focused on the intersection of two main
        policy 'tracks' followed in the Netherlands for the containment of
        road transport externalities: transport plans at the firm
        level, and regulatory parking policies. In this paper an
        applied modelling approach is taken, and the aim is to identify
        the relative importance of factors that are decisive for the
        viability of an individual firm's parking policies. The
        outcomes of an empirical survey conducted at the corporate
        level of the Free University in Amsterdam are used to discuss
        the social feasibility of regulatory parking policies conducted
        at the firm level (in terms of the employees' attitudes) and
        the effectiveness of such policies. Insight is provided into
        relevant backgrounds and obstacles serving to affect employees'
        commuting behaviour and that are likely to be encountered in
        the formulation of regulatory transport policies at the firm
        level. Moreover, the outcomes of this research may be relevant
        for the evaluation of regulatory parking policies at larger
        spatial scales (for example, neighbourhood parking schemes).
