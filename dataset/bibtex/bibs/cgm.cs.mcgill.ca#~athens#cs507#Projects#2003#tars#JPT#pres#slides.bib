                 and global illumination in order to add new objects to
                 light-based models with correct lighting. The method
                 uses a high dynamic range image-based model of the
                 scene, rather than synthetic light sources, to
                 illuminate the new objects. To compute the
                 illumination, the scene is considered as three
                 components: the distant scene, the local scene, and the
                 synthetic objects. The distant scene is assumed to be
                 photometrically unaffected by the objects, obviating
                 the need for reflectance model information. The local
                 scene is endowed with estimated reflectance model
                 information so that it can catch shadows and receive
                 reflected light from the new objects. Renderings are
                 created with a standard global illumination method by
                 simulating the interaction of light amongst the three
                 components. A differential rendering technique allows
                 for good results to be obtained when only an estimate
                 of the local scene reflectance properties is known. We
                 apply the general method to the problem of rendering
                 synthetic objects into real scenes. The light-based
                 model is constructed from an approximate geometric
                 model of the scene and by using a light probe to
                 measure the incident illumination at the location of
                 the synthetic objects. The global illumination solution
                 is then composited into a photograph of the scene using
                 the differential rendering technique. We conclude by
                 discussing the relevance of the technique to recovering
                 surface reflectance properties in uncontrolled lighting
                 situations. Applications of the method include visual
                 effects, interior design, and architectural
                 visualization.",
