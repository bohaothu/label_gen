    Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian
    framework for density estimation.  Unfortunately, their flexibility
    comes at a cost: inference in DP mixture models is computationally
    expensive, even when conjugate distributions are used.  In the common
    case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment of data
    points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical
    alternative to expensive MCMC and variational techniques.  When a true
    posterior sample is desired, the solution found by search can serve as
    a good initializer for MCMC.  Experimental results show that using
    these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very
    large data sets.

  tagline = {When using DPs for mixture modeling, one often only cares about getting the MAP cluster assignment. In such cases, we show that it is a good idea just to do an efficient search, rather than performing (expensive) sampling. A surprising result emerges: nearly greedy search actually works incredibly well!
