  abstract = {{A} new species, {P}seudocodium mucronatum, is described from the {C}hesterfield platform off the west coast of {N}ew {C}aledonia. {T}he species differs from its congeners in having mucronate utricules. {A} phylogenetic analysis of rbc{L} and tuf{A} sequences showed that {P}. mucronatum is most closely associated with {P}. natalense {D}e {C}lerck, {C}oppejans et {V}erbruggen and {P}. devriesii {W}eber {B}osse, with which it shares compressed axes, depressed apices, and plastids in the utricles and the medullar siphons. {W}e studied the evolution of climatic and ecological preferences in the genus using an interdisciplinary approach consisting of relaxed molecular clock analysis, extraction of macroecological data from satellite imagery in a geographic information system ({GIS}) framework, and ancestral character state estimation. {I}t was shown that the genus originated in tropical waters during the {E}arly {M}esozoic. {W}hereas the {P}. floridanum-okinawense lineage remained tropical, the lineage including {P}. natalense, {P}. devriesii, and {P}. mucronatum gradually invaded more temperate waters during {C}enozoic times. {E}xcept for {P}. devriesii, which occurs in shallow and intertidal habitats, all {P}seudocodium species grow in deep-water habitats, and this ecological preference appears to be ancestral.},
