%X The pressures of modern business have precipitated new approaches to
supporting workers' operations.  One such approach, performance support, is
described in this paper.
   The business problems are outlined, and performance support and performance
support systems (PSSs) are defined.  The work in this area at Bell-Northern
Research Ltd. (BNR) is described, including results of a PSS pilot project. 
Performance support is described in more depth, including a sample scenario of
a day at the office with a PSS, a survey of the PSS industry, and a discussion
of applications that are suitable for PSSs.  Then a summary is given of
critical success factors, benefits, and challenges for PSS implementation.  The
paper concludes by discussing PSS roles for writers and trainers, and by
summarizing recommendations for groups that are investigating performance
support techniques.

%X For more than a decade, technical communicators (TC) have argued that their
vast experience communicating with users and communicating technology to users
should be put to better use in the systems development process.  They stipulate
that their early involvement in the process would benefit the overall usability
of delivered systems.  A few studies from the late eighties (e.g., Grudin and
Poltrock, 1989; Chisholm, 1988) indicated that problems with implementing this
idea remained.  To determine if these difficulties were still present was one
major impetus behind this small bicultural survey.
   Further motivation came from the Delta study (see, Carlshamre, 1994a,
1994b), in which close collaboration between TCs and system developers (SDs)
was the subject of an in-depth study.  The analysis revealed several obstacles
to such close collaboration, including cultural, technical, and managerial
problems.  Because the Delta study involved only one office, we were interested
in discovering whether the findings were specific to that office, or if their
validity could be extended to a wider context, perhaps even to different
cultures.  Consequently, we wanted to examine two geographically and otherwise
culturally separate groups to determine what cultural similarities and
differences, if any, could be established between the two groups. 
Specifically, our research questions were both descriptive and normative:
 * How important is the concept of usability in the work of the TC, and what
   impact does this have on the development process?
 * Is it common practice that TCs and SDs collaborate in systems development,
   and if not, what do the TCs think is the reason for this?
 * What are the most prominent obstacles in the work of the TC, and what could
   be done to overcome these?
 * Could any clear differences be established between American and Swedish TCs,
   with respect to these questions?
Based on these questions, we set out to interview five American TCs and five
Swedish TCs about their views on their own roles in systems development.
   The results indicate that TCs are potentially valuable usability resources,
but they are systematically restrained by their own organizations from
exercising usability-oriented activities.
   Below, we briefly describe the methodology used.  Then, the results are
presented, followed by a discussion of the findings, and conclusions.

information to conduct network management by exception.  The AT&T PersonaLink
Services Network, based on innovative Telescript technology, never before used
in an operating network, had network node performance characteristics that were
unknown at the outset.  To insure the network could operate under normal
conditions as well as failures, a great deal of effort went into the design of
monitoring and control features for the network management system (NMS).
   Personnel at the Network Operations Center (NOC) operate the network
remotely through the NMS, using methods and procedures that were developed for
this service.  The online documentation system serves as the network operators'
reference for carrying out those procedures.

documentation field and is expected to continue to grow.  In the wake of
widespread downsizing, industries are increasingly augmenting their thinning
ranks with a modern-day version of the hired gun: the contract writer. 
Contract writers are skilled, temporary professionals thriving in a climate of
job insecurity where corporate budgets are cut like sides of beef and full-time
personnel are squeezed to produce at maximum efficiency.  Benefits-barren and
dollar-driven, contractors represent the future of the next decade in both
employment and entrepreneurial opportunity.  Experts estimate that the
country's corporate workforce will comprise 30 to 60 percent contract laborers
as we approach the turn of the century.  Who are these contractors?  How are
they affecting the industry?  And how can they be successfully managed?

of time and resources, information developers can create libraries of reusable
information elements, which in turn can be structured as virtual documents,
i.e., file structures which contain multiple conditional document images.
   Information developers, technical writers, graphic designers, and others
involved in information technology (IT) often must deal with a kind of
professional dilemma.  For many of us, information development is on-line,
WYSIWYG, and paperless.  When we are capturing and organizing information, we
produce only application files with our publishing tools, eventually creating
page and book images to be dumped to some printer.  For the end-user,
information only becomes "real" and accessible after we print it.

%X Due to the sheer volume of information contained in CSC's corporate system
development methodology, Catalyst, there was a high need to place this
information on-line.  The methodology consists of 15 books along with over
1,500 graphics.  Having access to this information on-line would dramatically
impact productivity.  To help support users and facilitate the use of Catalyst,
the Microsoft (MS) help system was used, in conjunction with RoboHELP to put
Catalyst on-line in a hypertext format.  Initially, this tool would be used by
over 1,600 users, and eventually by upwards to 20,000 users.  The design
evolved over several months, through consistent user involvement.  Determining
how users could best utilize this product was especially important because of
the large number of users.  Feedback and usability concerns helped shape the
final design.  In order to be most effective, the limited functionality of the
MS help system was extended to provide a more robust product.  This paper
discusses the challenges surrounding the design, development, and
implementation of a large scale windows help system, which is approximately 53
MB in size (33 MB when fully compressed).

%X This paper discusses 'Hyperintelligence' system and its functions. 
Hyperintelligence is a total work support system, not only for office works,
but also for field works, in which process and transaction information are key
factors.
   When a worker encounters new work, s(he) might refer and re-use a similar
work process and its results from the past, to do it efficiently.  So, an
engineering or business application program generally supports to store the
work functions and the results.  But, when a worker uses several application
programs in a complex manner, only small amount of work could be accumulated.
   In Hyperintelligence, working processes and transactions are accumulated
automatically, while a worker uses this system.  The worker can easily improve
either working procedures or transactions independently, to make the work more
efficient, and store them in a database.
   We confirmed that the basic functions of Hyperintelligence are useful, by
applying it to two kinds of work; maintenance work and office work using
Internet.

%X The VisualAge C++ for OS/2 User's Guide is an 1100 page book, and a 4 Meg
online document.  It is maintained in a source format called BookMaster, which
is a Generalized Markup Language.  For the online build, the source is
customised with macros and conditional processing directives, and converted to
IPF (a similar markup language for online information).  Although the User's
Guide is a new book, much of its content existed in other forms in previous
releases of the product.  Much of the source was from hardcopy-only documents,
which had been written with the constraints of hardcopy in mind.  This paper
concentrates on the design issues involved in customising existing hardcopy
information for online, without compromising its hardcopy appearance, or
sacrificing the maintainability that justifies a single-sourced document.

%X VisualAge C++ (previously C Set++) is a suite of tools for application
development, including a visual development environment, a compiler, a
debugger, and class libraries.  In the previous release, each of the components
had separate documentation: the compiler, linker, debugger, browser, and
various other tools all had their own guides.  Most of this information was
available in hardcopy (paper) form only, but some of it was available only
online.  Very little information was available in both formats, and there was
no consistent mapping between the coverage of the online documentation and the
hardcopy books.
   Customers identified the scattered hardcopy documentation, and the lack of
equivalent online documentation, as two key shortcomings of the product
information.  In response, we consolidated the information as much as possible,
concentrating it into three main areas:
 * language (documenting the actual use of the C and C++ languages)
 * class libraries (documenting the class libraries provided with the product,
   that extend the functionality of the languages by providing common routines
   and structures)
 * the compiler, linker, and other tools and utilities
This third category formed the basis for the User's Guide, which was to be
available in both hardcopy and online versions.

%X Now, more than ever, technical communicators are being forced to justify the
necessity of their jobs.  Due to current trends in corporate downsizing,
technical communication jobs are being minimized, and in some cases, eliminated
altogether.  Many companies are cutting full time technical writing positions,
and adopting the process of hiring contract or part time technical writers.
   One of the reasons for this trend is the belief that technical communicators
document only "finished products", and are best used during the final phases of
a project.  However, we have recently begun to challenge these outdated
notions.  For example, we have begun to explore ways in which the technical
communicator can play a more visible role in the design team -- by filling
usability gaps in product development teams, writing and editing requirements
and specifications documents, and so forth.
   However, many companies still fail to recognize the added value that good
technical writing skills can provide on a long-term basis.  In addition to
writing and editing product documentation, technical communicators can make
substantial contributions to writing and organizing the documents that describe
and define the organizational structure of a company.
   If we hope to keep our jobs and further our profession, we must begin to
show our employers that we can offer benefits beyond simply "getting a manual
out the door".  We must begin to seek opportunities in other areas of the
organization.  We must focus on tasks that will offer more long-term benefits
for our employers.

including document processors, desktop publishing systems, help compilers,
tutorial systems, and multimedia authoring environments.  Many of these tools
(such as those described by Walker [7]) are designed with professional writers
in mind.  However, user documentation, particularly that for commercial
software applications, is often produced by "part-time" writers who must
balance many other roles.
   This paper describes a study that looked at how user documentation for
commercial applications is developed.  The study found that this activity is
often the responsibility of non-professional writers who face many problems in
developing documentation.  An analysis of these problems was used to propose
five key issues for the next generation of authoring tools.

University of Michigan faculty, staff, and students.
   The new online system needed to fit into our distributed campus computing
environment, and had to be easy to maintain and update.  It had to use tools
and workstation platforms that our users already had and were familiar with, so
that no steep learning curve or new equipment purchases were required in order
to use the system.  And, it had to operate over both high-speed network
connections and slower-speed dial-in connections.

%X A case is presented for cost-effectively creating custom DTDs for an
organization by non-SGML experts using tools that automatically create DTDs
from tagged text.  Such tools make it practical and easy to create DTDs without
having to hire consultants or invest heavily to develop internal SGML
expertise.  The specific tool focused on is the SGML Document Grammar Builder,
a tool developed at OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.

%X Paper journals, conferences and workshops have been the major media for
scholarly discourse for 300 years.  However, in the 1990s access to low-cost
personal computing and Internet communications is leading to radical changes in
the operation of scholarly communities.  Electronic publication and
conferencing is becoming common in all disciplines using commonly available
Internet facilities such as ftp archives, list servers, gopher and world-wide
web.  Some scholarly communities that had not previously achieved a critical
mass have done so through the net, others have launched major collaborative
projects managed through the net, and others are questioning the value of
conventional conferences that are limited by being localized in space and time
compared with the flexibility of continuous international electronic
conferencing through the web.  However, the majority of current electronic
scholarly discourse emulates paper-based media in relying primarily on text and
diagrams for knowledge communication.  It is beginning to take advantage of
some of the multimedia capabilities of electronic publishing for color
diagrams, pictures, movies and sound.  Hypertext and hypermedia capabilities
are being used to develop webs of linked material.  Concept maps and formal
knowledge structures are being used to provide a framework for knowledge
expression, interchange and collaborative development.  This article focuses on
the extension of current documentation technologies to provide knowledge-level
support for scholarly communities.
