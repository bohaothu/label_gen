   abstract = {Cloud computing has drastically changed the way in which IT resources can be
      consumed. The properties of clouds – elasticity, pay-per-use, and
      standardization of the runtime infrastructure – enable cloud providers and
      users alike to benefit from economies of scale, faster provisioning times, and
      reduced runtime costs. However, to achieve these benefits, application
      architects and developers have to respect the characteristics of the cloud
      environment. To reduce the complexity of cloud application architecture and
      design, we propose a pattern-based approach for cloud application architecture
      and development. We defined a pattern format to describe the principles of
      cloud computing, available cloud offerings, and cloud application
      architectures. Based on this format we developed an architectural pattern
      language of cloud-based applications. Through interrelation of patterns for
      cloud offering descriptions and cloud application architectures, developers are
      guided during the identification of patterns applicable to their problems. We
      cover the proceeding how we identified patterns, give an overview of previously
      discovered patterns, and introduce one new pattern. Further, we propose a
      framework for the organizations of patterns and the guidance of developers
      during their instantiation.},

      development as required in scientific workflows. In this paper, we therefore
      formalize operations for the repeated enactment of activities—for both
      iteration and re-execution. Starting point of the rerun is an arbitrary,
      manually selected activity. Since we define the operations on a meta-model

      Although the software landscape is crucial to support scientists in their every

      simulation programs can be considered legacy monolithic applications. They are
      developed without adhering to known software engineering guidelines, lack an
      acceptable software ergonomics, run sequentially on single workstations and

      is that changes of the process can be driven by IT and Business in the same

      summarize and filter out information, and customize the visual appearance of a
      process to the need of particular stakeholders. However, composition of process
      view transformations and their provisioning as a service to enable their usage
      in various different scenarios is currently not discussed in research. In this
      paper, we present a lightweight, service-oriented approach to compose modular
      process viewing functions to form complex process view transformations which
      can be offered as a service. We introduce a concept and an architectural
      framework to generate process view service compositions automatically with
      focus on usability. Furthermore, we discuss key aspects regarding the
      implementation as well as different scenarios where process view services and
      their compositions are needed.},

      To increase the number of customers, a flexible application design is of major
      importance. It enables customers to adjust the application to their individual
      needs in a self-service manner. In this paper, we classify the required
      variability of these flexible applications: data variability – changes to

      the application supports; user interface variability – changes to the
      appearance of the application; provisioning variability – the ability of the
      application to be deployed in different runtime environments. Existing and new
      technologies and tools are leveraged to realize these classes of variability.
      Further, we cover architectural principles to follow during the design of
      flexible cloud applications and we introduce an abstract architectural pattern
      to enable data variability.},

      networks for the exchanging of goods and services. Service networks models
      represent the interconnections among companies, their parts and individuals in

      representation of these interconnections. Due to the size of nowadays service

      requirements within the research area of compliant business process design has

      have to deal with when moving applications and data to the cloud. Enterprises

      considered in the field of cloud computing. These requirements have been
      created to meet laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are

   abstract = {Modeling and execution of business processes is often performed on different
      levels of abstraction. For example, when a business process is modeled using a
      high-level notation near to business such as Event-driven Process Chains (EPC),
      a technical refinement step is required before the process can be executed.
      Also, model-driven process design allows modeling a process on high-level,
      while executing it in a more detailed and executable low-level representation
      such as processes defined in the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) or
      as Java code. However, current approaches for graphical monitoring of business
      processes are limited to scenarios in which the process that is being executed
      and the process that is being monitored are either one and the same or on the
      same level of abstraction. In this paper, we present an approach to facilitate
      business-oriented process monitoring while considering process design on
      high-level. We propose process views for business process monitoring as
      projections of activities and execution states in order to support business
      process monitoring of running process instances on different levels of

      workflow models. Adapted workflow models are deployed on a workflow engine as
      new model version. That means two versions of the same model are deployed on

      For example, how does a client find and choose the desired workflow version to
      instantiate? Typically, these problems are solved by deactivating the old
      model. New instances can only be created for the new model. In our work on

      keep the old model activated. In this paper we investigate what it means to
      have several model versions active. We develop a general concept for this
      “concurrent workflow evolution” that solves emerging problems. Moreover, we

      in which IT resources can be consumed. By taking advantage of the properties of
      the cloud - elasticity, pay-per-use and standardization - customers and
      providers alike can benefit from economies of scale, faster provisioning times
      and reduced costs. However, to fully exploit the potentials of the cloud, it is
      necessary, that applications, to be deployed on the cloud, support the inherent
      cloud properties. In this paper we investigate how applications can be designed
      to comply with cloud infrastructures. We present a framework that allows
      modeling the variability within such applications regarding their structure,
      functional, and non-functional properties, as well as their deployment. Using
      these models the framework guides the user during the customization of an
      application, provisions it on available clouds, and enables common management
      functionality for cloud applications, such as elasticity, suspend, and resume.},

      definitions based on the existing ones, which is crucial for an iterative and

      management research. We understand a process fragment as a connected and
      reusable process structure, which has relaxed completeness and consistency
      criteria compared to executable processes. We claim that process fragments
      allow for an easier and faster development of process-based applications. As
      evidence to this claim we present a process fragment concept and show a sample
      collection of concrete, real-world process fragments. We present advanced
      application scenarios for using such fragments in development of process-based
      applications. Process fragments are typically managed in a repository, forming
      a process fragment library. On top of a process fragment library from previous
      work, we discuss the potential impact of using process fragment libraries in
      cross-enterprise collaboration and application integration.},

      This fact suggests the need for detailed investigations in the qualification of
      conven-tional workflow technology for the evolving application domain of
      e-Science. This chapter discusses the requirements on scientific workflows, the
      state of the art of scientific workflow management systems as well as the
      ability of conven-tional workflow technology to fulfill requirements of
      scientists and scientific ap-plications. It becomes clear that the features of
      conventional workflows can be advantageous for scientists but also that
      thorough enhancements are needed. We therefore propose a conceptual
      architecture for scientific workflow management systems based on the business
      workflow technology as well as extensions of exist-ing workflow concepts in
      order to improve the ability of established workflow technology to an
      application in the scientific domain with focus on scientific simulations.},
