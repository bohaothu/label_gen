% p.3: Unlike common procedure of proposing a procedure 
% 	and investigating its properties, we instead ask 
% 	what properties are required and then find procedures that have these properties. I like it!
% Lindley reviews Ramsey's gambling scenario that proves that you have 
% to have a utility function and a prob dist. Savage later did a rigorous 
% version of the same. 
% 	Assume that lotteries can be ordered. The ordering is transitive. 
% Lindley also mentions Wald. He knocks Dempster-Schafer. 
% He then states that any coherent inferences/decisions
% must be interpretable in terms of a prior. That prob distbn is a 
% subjective prob possessed by the decision maker. 
% `Objections to this attitude are numerous but none that I am aware of 
% have gone to the axioms and criticised those. Indeed, it is hard to see how 
% such criticism could be sustained since the requirements impoosed by coherence
% are so modest.'
% 	If the scientific community makes decisions, it must have a prior
% and a utility. In half a line he mentions the result in game theory that 
% e baum takes 50 pages to prove. 
% 	Lindley then distinguishes inference and decision theory nicely. 
% 	Then he attqacks sampling theory for incoherence by showing counter-
% examples.  Likelihood p. 
% The requirement of unbiasedness violates the l.p.
% eg, If sample r/n binomial, theta = r/n.
% But if sample n for fixed r, theta = r-1/n-1 is the unbiased estimator.
% 	A statistic t(x) is called ancillary if its P does not depend on theta.
% [That is , for example, it is the deviations of the samples from x_bar]
% Some crap sampling theory dicks base their methods on ancill stats. They 
% are wrong of course. counterexamples on p.11-12.
% 	Maximu likelihood couterexample: mixture model has singularity
% when sigma-> 0 with one component of the mixture on top of a particular 
% data point. Similarly sigma N-1 can be generalised to give examples 
% that don't converge. 
% 	Significance tests counterexamples.
% 	Minimax	counterexamples. 
% 	Examples where a rejected hypothesis has probability close to 1.
% 	Examples are citred of confidence intervals where the larger interval 
% doesn't include the smaller!
% 	Another example of a ludicrous unbiased estimator. 
% 	Later on p.42 he cites Edwards et al 1963 as the definitive (but long) paper on 
% the robustness of {B}ayesian inferences to the prior. 
% 	He distinguishes [Box and Tiao 62 64a 64b] Criterion robustness and inference
% robustness. The first is robustness of a fixed procedure to the distribution
% being different from the assumptions. THe latter is the {B}ayesian attitude. 
% [p.43]
% p.44 reviews the non-normal model studied by Box. He says more work is needed
% here. 
% 
% p. 46 -> outliers. Box 1968b uses a mixture model, same mean, two gaussians. 
% The outlier problem is discussed by Hartigan by seeing how influential each
% individual datum is.

% DT- ARTICLE
% AB- A VISUAL system makes assumptions in order to interpret visual data. The
%     assumption of 'generic view'1-4 states that the observer is not in a special
%     position relative to the scene. Researchers commonly use a binary decision
%     of generic or accidental view to disqualify scene interpretations that
%     assume accidental viewpoints5-10. Here we show how to use the generic view
%     assumption, and others like it, to quantify the likelihood of a view, adding
%     a new term to the probability of a given image interpretation. The resulting
%     framework better models the visual world and reduces the reliance on other
%     prior assumptions. It may lead to computer vision algorithms of greater
%     power and accuracy, or to better models of human vision. We show
%     applications to the problems of inferring shape  surface reflectance
%     properties  and motion from images.

    This allows a fully Bayesian or maximum likelihood analysis of some 
    interesting models, including outlier models, discrete Markov chain 
    components, multiplicative models and stochastic variance models. 
    Finally we discuss at some length the use of a non-Gaussian model to 
    seasonally adjust the published money supply figures."

    on a linear state space model with errors that are a mixture of 
    normals and coefficients that can switch over time. Our approach 
    simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the 
    mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously 
    generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state 
    vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman 
    filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and 
    empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where 
    the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest
    that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the 
    Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time."

    propose linear coding schemes that admit simple decoding. We show 
    that theta is particularly relevant to the erasure channel since 
    linear codes achieve a vanishing error probability as long as p less 
    than or equal to theta, where p is the probability of erasure. In 
    effect, theta can be thought of as a capacity notion designed for 
    codes rather than for channels. Binomial codes have highest possible 
    theta (and achieve capacity). As for the Z-channel, a subcapacity is 
    derived with respect to the linear coding scheme. For a transition

    information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear

    able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and 
    perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in 
    the output representation. This enables the network to separate 
    statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order 
    generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network
    to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully 
    separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a
    variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind
