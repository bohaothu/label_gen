  title = {An insight into the phylogenetic history of HOX linked gene families
	in vertebrates.},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {239},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human chromosomes 2q, 7, 12q and 17q show extensive
	intra-genomic homology, containing duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate
	paralogous regions centered on the HOX gene clusters. The fact that
	two or more representatives of different gene families are linked
	with HOX clusters is taken as evidence that these paralogous gene
	sets might have arisen from a single chromosomal segment through
	block or whole chromosome duplication events. This would imply that
	the constituent genes including the HOX clusters reflect the architecture
	of a single ancestral block (before vertebrate origin) where all
	of these genes were linked in a single copy. RESULTS: In the present
	study we have employed the currently available set of protein data
	for a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate genomes to analyze
	the phylogenetic history of 11 multigene families with three or more
	of their representatives linked to human HOX clusters. A topology
	comparison approach revealed four discrete co-duplicated groups:
	group 1 involves the genes from GLI, HH, INHB, IGFBP (cluster-1),
	and SLC4A families; group 2 involves ERBB, ZNFN1A, and IGFBP (cluster-2)
	gene families; group 3 involves the HOX clusters and the SP gene
	family; group 4 involves the integrin beta chain and myosine light
	chain families. The distinct genes within each co-duplicated group
	share the same evolutionary history and are duplicated in concert
	with each other, while the constituent genes of two different co-duplicated
	groups may not share their evolutionary history and may not have
	duplicated simultaneously. CONCLUSION: We conclude that co-duplicated
	groups may themselves be remnants of ancient small-scale duplications
	(involving chromosomal segments or gene-clusters) which occurred
	at different time points during chordate evolution. Whereas the recent
	combination of genes from distinct co-duplicated groups on different
	chromosomal regions (human chromosomes 2q, 7, 12q, and 17q) is probably
	the outcome of subsequent rearrangement of genomic segments, including
	syntenic groups of genes.},

  pages = {23},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein interaction networks aim to summarize the complex
	interplay of proteins in an organism. Early studies suggested that
	the position of a protein in the network determines its evolutionary
	rate but there has been considerable disagreement as to what extent
	other factors, such as protein abundance, modify this reported dependence.
	RESULTS: We compare the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis
	elegans with those of closely related species to elucidate the recent
	evolutionary history of their respective protein interaction networks.
	Interaction and expression data are studied in the light of a detailed
	phylogenetic analysis. The underlying network structure is incorporated
	explicitly into the statistical analysis. The increased phylogenetic
	resolution, paired with high-quality interaction data, allows us
	to resolve the way in which protein interaction network structure
	and abundance of proteins affect the evolutionary rate. We find that
	expression levels are better predictors of the evolutionary rate
	than a protein's connectivity. Detailed analysis of the two organisms
	also shows that the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are
	not sufficiently similar to be mutually predictive. CONCLUSION: It
	appears that meaningful inferences about the evolution of protein
	interaction networks require comparative analysis of reasonably closely
	related species. The signature of protein evolution is shaped by
	a protein's abundance in the organism and its function and the biological
	process it is involved in. Its position in the interaction networks
	and its connectivity may modulate this but they appear to have only
	minor influence on a protein's evolutionary rate.},

  abstract = {A family of 5 genes that evolved within the past 1.9 Myr in diploid
	wheat was characterized. The ancestral gene, ALP-A1, is on chromosome
	1A and encodes an aci-reductone dioxygenase-like protein. The duplicated
	genes ALP-A2, ALP-A3, ALP-A4.1, and ALP-A4.2 acquired complete coding
	sequences but lost the original promoter. They are on chromosomes
	4A, 2A, 6A and 6A, respectively, and evolved sequentially, the youngest
	duplicated gene always producing the next duplicate. It is shown
	that dispersed gene duplication rate consists of the primary rate
	(duplications of ancestral genes) and the secondary rate (duplications
	of genes that had been generated by recent duplications). The primary
	rate was 2.5 x 10(-3) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in diploid wheat. The secondary
	rate was 5.2 x 10(-2) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in the ALP family. The 20-fold
	acceleration of the secondary rate was caused by the insertion of
	the ALP-A2 gene into a novel type transposon. Only the ALP-A1 and
	ALP-A3 genes are transcribed. The transcription of ALP-A3 is directed
	by a promoter within a DNA fragment similar to a CACTA type of DNA
	transposons, making ALP-A3 a new gene. The ALP-A3 transcript is longer
	than that of the ALP-A1. The half-life of ALP duplicated genes was
	estimated to be 0.87 Myr. Strong purifying selection acting on the
	ancestral gene ALP-A1 was undiminished by the evolution of duplicated
	genes. The evolution of the ALP family shows that repeated elements
	facilitate both gene duplication and expression of duplicated genes
	and highlights their importance for the evolution of gene repertoire

	Proteins are gene products, and at the level of genes, duplication,

	new genes. We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying
	the evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences
	of 40 genomes. The domain and superfamily definitions in the Structural
	Classification of Proteins Database are used, so that we can view
	all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their
	superfamily combinations. We find 783 out of the 859 superfamilies
	in SCOP in these genomes, and the 783 families occur in 1307 pairwise
	combinations. Most families are observed in combination with one
	or two other families, while a few families are very versatile in
	their combinatorial behaviour; 209 families do not make combinations
	with other families. This type of pattern can be described as a scale-free
	network. We also study the N to C-terminal orientation of domain
	pairs and domain repeats. The phylogenetic distribution of domain
	combinations is surveyed, to establish the extent of common and kingdom-specific
	combinations. Of the kingdom-specific combinations, significantly
	more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms

	to conclude that recombination between common families, as compared
	to the invention of new families and recombination among these, has
	also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom-specific
	and species-specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms.
	Finally, we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes

  journal = {Cell Cycle},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {369--376},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {SET domains are protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate diverse
	proteins, such as, histones, Rubisco and cytochrome C. In particular,
	they play an important role in the dynamics of the eukaryotic chromatin
	and are present in several chromatin-associated proteins. Recently,
	structures of several SET domains have been solved, and they contain
	a conserved fold that is unrelated to previously characterized methyltransferases,
	which possess either Rossmann fold or SPOUT domains. Phylogenetic
	and phyletic-profile analysis of the SET domain suggests that it
	was an evolutionary "invention" of the eukaryotic lineage, with secondary
	lateral transfers to bacteria. We show that the conserved N- and
	C- terminal regions, which comprise the core barrel-like module of
	the SET domain, are symmetric repeats of a simple 3-stranded unit.
	Furthermore, the two symmetrically arranged repeats contribute to
	the binding sites for the two substrates of the SET domain. This
	suggests the SET domain arose from an ancestral dimer of this 3-stranded
	unit, with each unit probably functioning as generic-ligand binding
	structure. The divergence between the two repeat units appears to
	have arisen as a result of their interactions with the central module
	of the SET domain, which was inserted between the two repeats. One
	of the repeats appears to have acquired adaptations, which helped
	it to specialize in AdoMet binding, whereas the second repeat contributed
	to histone-interaction, and in orienting a crucial active site residue.
	The central module of the SET domain supplies a critical asparagine
	to the active site, and its structural features suggest that it may
	have also arisen from a further duplication of one of the repeats
	comprising the core barrel. However, it appears to have structurally
	diverged from the two canonical repeats due to the lack of an obligate
	dimerization partner. The spatial position of the two repeats in
	the ancestral dimer appears to have favored the formation of the
	structural knot typical of the SET domain. A comparable knot is seen
	in the SPOUT-domain methyltransferases, and this represents a case
	of convergent evolution of an active-site-associated configuration
	in two otherwise unrelated classes of methylases. Thus, the SET domain
	provides a model for the innovation of a complex enzymatic fold through
	the duplications of a structurally simple non-enzymatic unit.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {280},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plant genomes contain a high proportion of duplicated
	genes as a result of numerous whole, segmental and local duplications.
	These duplications lead up to the formation of gene families, which
	are the usual material for many evolutionary studies. However, all
	characterized genomes include single-copy (unique) genes that have
	not received much attention. Unlike gene duplication, gene loss is
	not an unspecific mechanism but is rather influenced by a functional
	selection. In this context, we have established and used stringent
	criteria in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present
	in plant proteomes. Comparisons of unique genes in the green phylum
	were used to characterize the gene and protein features exhibited
	by both conserved and species-specific unique genes. RESULTS: We
	identified the unique genes within both A. thaliana and O. sativa
	genomes and classified them according to the number of homologs in
	the alternative species: none (U{1:0}), one (U{1:1}) or several (U{1:m}).
	Regardless of the species, all the genes in these groups present
	some conserved characteristics, such as small average protein size
	and abnormal intron number. In order to understand the origin and
	function of unique genes, we further characterized the U{1:1} gene
	pairs. The possible involvement of sequence convergence in the creation
	of U{1:1} pairs was discarded due to the frequent conservation of
	intron positions. Furthermore, an orthology relationship between
	the two members of each U{1:1} pair was strongly supported by a high
	conservation in the protein sizes and transcription levels. Within
	the promoter of the unique conserved genes, we found a number of
	TATA and TELO boxes that specifically differed from their mean number
	in the whole genome. Many unique genes have been conserved as unique
	through evolution from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus to
	higher plants. Plant unique genes may also have homologs in bacteria
	and we showed a link between the targeting towards plastids of proteins
	encoded by plant nuclear unique genes and their homology with a bacterial

	genes are conserved in plants for which the ancestor diverged at
	least 725 million years ago (MYA). Half of these genes are also present
	in other eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic species. Thus, our results
	indicate that (i) a strong negative selection pressure has conserved
	a number of genes as unique in genomes throughout evolution, (ii)
	most unique genes are subjected to a low divergence rate, (iii) they
	have some features observed in housekeeping genes but for most of

	identities of paralogous proteins.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {32},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolution of the full repertoire of proteins encoded
	in a given genome is mostly driven by gene duplications, deletions,
	and sequence modifications of existing proteins. Indirect information
	about relative rates and other intrinsic parameters of these three
	basic processes is contained in the proteome-wide distribution of
	sequence identities of pairs of paralogous proteins. RESULTS: We
	introduce a simple mathematical framework based on a stochastic birth-and-death
	model that allows one to extract some of this information and apply
	it to the set of all pairs of paralogous proteins in H. pylori, E.
	coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens.
	It was found that the histogram of sequence identities p generated
	by an all-to-all alignment of all protein sequences encoded in a
	genome is well fitted with a power-law form approximately p-gamma
	with the value of the exponent gamma around 4 for the majority of
	organisms used in this study. This implies that the intra-protein
	variability of substitution rates is best described by the Gamma-distribution
	with the exponent alpha approximately 0.33. Different features of
	the shape of such histograms allow us to quantify the ratio between
	the genome-wide average deletion/duplication rates and the amino-acid
	substitution rate. CONCLUSION: We separately measure the short-term
	("raw") duplication and deletion rates , which include gene copies
	that will be removed soon after the duplication event and their dramatically
	reduced long-term counterparts r(*)dup, r(*)del. High deletion rate
	among recently duplicated proteins is consistent with a scenario
	in which they didn't have enough time to significantly change their
	functional roles and thus are to a large degree disposable. Systematic
	trends of each of the four duplication/deletion rates with the total
	number of genes in the genome were analyzed. All but the deletion
	rate of recent duplicates r(*)del were shown to systematically increase
	with Ngenes. Abnormally flat shapes of sequence identity histograms
	observed for yeast and human are consistent with lineages leading
	to these organisms undergoing one or more whole-genome duplications.
	This interpretation is corroborated by our analysis of the genome
	of Paramecium tetraurelia where the p-4 profile of the histogram
	is gradually restored by the successive removal of paralogs generated
	in its four known whole-genome duplication events.},

  abstract = {The structure of complex transcriptional regulatory networks has been

	We use the known transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia

	175 prokaryotic genomes, and predict components of the regulatory
	networks for these organisms. We observe that transcription factors
	are typically less conserved than their target genes and evolve independently

	transcription factors responding to specific signals. We show that
	prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks have evolved principally
	through widespread tinkering of transcriptional interactions at the
	local level by embedding orthologous genes in different types of
	regulatory motifs. Different transcription factors have emerged independently
	as dominant regulatory hubs in various organisms, suggesting that
	they have convergently acquired similar network structures approximating
	a scale-free topology. We note that organisms with similar lifestyles
	across a wide phylogenetic range tend to conserve equivalent interactions

  abstract = {The concept of a tree of life is prevalent in the evolutionary literature.
	It stems from attempting to obtain a grand unified natural system
	that reflects a recurrent process of species and lineage splittings
	for all forms of life. Traditionally, the discipline of systematics
	operates in a similar hierarchy of bifurcating (sometimes multifurcating)
	categories. The assumption of a universal tree of life hinges upon
	the process of evolution being tree-like throughout all forms of
	life and all of biological time. In multicellular eukaryotes, the
	molecular mechanisms and species-level population genetics of variation
	do indeed mainly cause a tree-like structure over time. In prokaryotes,
	they do not. Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different
	things, and we need to treat them as such, rather than extrapolating
	from macroscopic life to prokaryotes. In the following we will consider
	this circumstance from philosophical, scientific, and epistemological
	perspectives, surmising that phylogeny opted for a single model as
	a holdover from the Modern Synthesis of evolution.It was far easier
	to envision and defend the concept of a universal tree of life before
	we had data from genomes. But the belief that prokaryotes are related
	by such a tree has now become stronger than the data to support it.
	The monistic concept of a single universal tree of life appears,
	in the face of genome data, increasingly obsolete. This traditional
	model to describe evolution is no longer the most scientifically
	productive position to hold, because of the plurality of evolutionary
	patterns and mechanisms involved. Forcing a single bifurcating scheme
	onto prokaryotic evolution disregards the non-tree-like nature of
	natural variation among prokaryotes and accounts for only a minority
	of observations from genomes.Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of
	life are two different things. Hence we will briefly set out alternative
	models to the tree of life to study their evolution. Ultimately,
	the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved, such
	as the discontinuity of the process of evolution across the prokaryote-eukaryote
	divide, summons forth a pluralistic approach to studying evolution.This

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {43},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since thermodynamic stability is a global property of
	proteins that has to be conserved during evolution, the selective
	pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the amino
	acids present at other sites. However, models of molecular evolution
	that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of macromolecules
	become computationally intractable if such correlations between sites
	are explicitly taken into account. RESULTS: We introduce an evolutionary
	model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint
	on the conservation of structural stability. This model consists
	of a selection process, which depends on two hydrophobicity parameters
	that can be computed from protein sequences without any fit, and
	a mutation process for which we consider various models. It reproduces
	quantitatively the results of Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN)
	simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native
	state is explicitly computed and conserved. We then compare the predicted
	site-specific amino acid distributions with those sampled from the
	Protein Data Bank (PDB). The parameters of the mutation model, whose
	number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the data. The
	mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed site-specific
	amino acid distributions is larger than <r> = 0.70 for a mutation
	model with no free parameters and no genetic code. In contrast, considering
	only the mutation process with no selection yields a mean correlation
	coefficient of <r> = 0.56 with three fitted parameters. The mutation
	model that best fits the data takes into account increased mutation
	rate at CpG dinucleotides, yielding <r> = 0.90 with five parameters.
	CONCLUSION: The effective selection process that we propose reproduces
	well amino acid distributions as observed in the protein sequences
	in the PDB. Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood
	calculations in phylogenetic studies. Interestingly, in this approach
	the mutation process influences the effective selection process,
	i.e. selection and mutation must be entangled in order to obtain
	effectively independent sites. This interdependence between mutation
	and selection reflects the deep influence that mutation has on the
	evolutionary process: The bias in the mutation influences the thermodynamic
	properties of the evolving proteins, in agreement with comparative
	studies of bacterial proteomes, and it also influences the rate of
	accepted mutations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The structure of molecular networks derives from dynamical
	processes on evolutionary time scales. For protein interaction networks,
	global statistical features of their structure can now be inferred
	consistently from several large-throughput datasets. Understanding
	the underlying evolutionary dynamics is crucial for discerning random
	parts of the network from biologically important properties shaped
	by natural selection. RESULTS: We present a detailed statistical
	analysis of the protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	based on several large-throughput datasets. Protein pairs resulting
	from gene duplications are used as tracers into the evolutionary
	past of the network. From this analysis, we infer rate estimates
	for two key evolutionary processes shaping the network: (i) gene
	duplications and (ii) gain and loss of interactions through mutations
	in existing proteins, which are referred to as link dynamics. Importantly,
	the link dynamics is asymmetric, i.e., the evolutionary steps are
	mutations in just one of the binding parters. The link turnover is
	shown to be much faster than gene duplications. Both processes are
	assembled into an empirically grounded, quantitative model for the
	evolution of protein interaction networks. CONCLUSIONS: According
	to this model, the link dynamics is the dominant evolutionary force
	shaping the statistical structure of the network, while the slower
	gene duplication dynamics mainly affects its size. Specifically,
	the model predicts (i) a broad distribution of the connectivities
	(i.e., the number of binding partners of a protein) and (ii) correlations
	between the connectivities of interacting proteins, a specific consequence
	of the asymmetry of the link dynamics. Both features have been observed
	in the protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae.},

  abstract = {New genes with novel functions arise by duplication and divergence,
	but the process poses a problem. After duplication, an extra gene
	copy must rise to sufficiently high frequency in the population and
	remain free of common inactivating lesions long enough to acquire
	the rare mutations that provide a new selectable function. Maintaining
	a duplicated gene by selection for the original function would restrict
	the freedom to diverge. (We refer to this problem as Ohno's dilemma).
	A model is described by which selection continuously favors both
	maintenance of the duplicate copy and divergence of that copy from
	the parent gene. Before duplication, the original gene has a trace
	side activity (the innovation) in addition to its original function.
	When an altered ecological niche makes the minor innovation valuable,
	selection favors increases in its level (the amplification), which
	is most frequently conferred by increased dosage of the parent gene.
	Selection for the amplified minor function maintains the extra copies
	and raises the frequency of the amplification in the population.
	The same selection favors mutational improvement of any of the extra
	copies, which are not constrained to maintain their original function
	(the divergence). The rate of mutations (per genome) that improve
	the new function is increased by the multiplicity of target copies
	within a genome. Improvement of some copies relaxes selection on
	others and allows their loss by mutation (becoming pseudogenes).
	Ultimately one of the extra copies is able to provide all of the
	new activity.},

  title = {The transition from noncoded to coded protein synthesis: did coding
	mRNAs arise from stability-enhancing binding partners to tRNA?},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {16},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the origin of protein synthesis has been
	notoriously difficult. We have taken as a starting premise Wolf and
	Koonin's view that "evolution of the translation system is envisaged
	to occur in a compartmentalized ensemble of replicating, co-selected
	RNA segments, i.e., in an RNA world containing ribozymes with versatile
	activities". PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: We propose that coded
	protein synthesis arose from a noncoded process in an RNA world as
	a natural consequence of the accumulation of a range of early tRNAs
	and their serendipitous RNA binding partners. We propose that, initially,
	RNA molecules with 3' CCA termini that could be aminoacylated by
	ribozymes, together with an ancestral peptidyl transferase ribozyme,
	produced small peptides with random or repetitive sequences. Our
	concept is that the first tRNA arose in this context from the ligation
	of two RNA hairpins and could be similarly aminoacylated at its 3'
	end to become a substrate for peptidyl transfer catalyzed by the
	ancestral ribozyme. Within this RNA world we hypothesize that proto-mRNAs
	appeared first simply as serendipitous binding partners, forming
	complementary base pair interactions with the anticodon loops of
	tRNA pairs. Initially this may have enhanced stability of the paired
	tRNA molecules so they were held together in close proximity, better
	positioning the 3' CCA termini for peptidyl transfer and enhancing
	the rate of peptide synthesis. If there were a selective advantage
	for the ensemble through the peptide products synthesized, it would
	provide a natural pathway for the evolution of a coding system with
	the expansion of a cohort of different tRNAs and their binding partners.
	The whole process could have occurred quite unremarkably for such
	a profound acquisition. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: It should be possible
	to test the different parts of our model using the isolated contemporary
	50S ribosomal subunit initially, and then with RNAs transcribed in
	vitro together with a minimal set of ribosomal proteins that are
	required today to support protein synthesis. IMPLICATIONS OF THE
	HYPOTHESIS: This model proposes that genetic coding arose de novo
	from complementary base pair interactions between tRNAs and single-stranded
	RNAs present in the immediate environment. REVIEWERS: This article

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: There has been considerable interest in developing computational
	techniques for inferring genetic regulatory networks from whole-genome
	expression profiles. When expression time series data sets are available,
	dynamic models can, in principle, be used to infer correlative relationships
	between gene expression levels, which may be causal. However, because
	of the range of detectable expression levels and the current quality
	of the data, the predictive nature of such inferred, quantitative
	models is questionable. Network models derived from simple rate laws
	offer an intermediate level analysis, going beyond simple statistical
	analysis, but falling short of a fully quantitative description.
	This work shows how such network models can be constructed and describes
	the global properties of the networks derived from such a model.
	These global properties are statistically robust and provide insights
	into the design of the underlying network. RESULTS: Several whole-genome
	expression time series data sets from yeast microarray experiments
	were analyzed using a Markov-modeling method (Dewey and Galas, FUNC:
	Integr. Genomics, 1, 269-278, 2001) to infer an approximation to
	the underlying genetic network. We found that the global statistical
	properties of all the resulting networks are similar. The overall
	structure of these biological networks is distinctly different from
	that of other recently studied networks such as the Internet or social
	networks. These biological networks show hierarchical, hub-like structures
	that have some properties similar to a class of graphs known as small
	world graphs. Small world networks exhibit local cliquishness while
	exhibiting strong global connectivity. In addition to the small world
	properties, the biological networks show a power law or scale free
	distribution of connectivities. An inverse power law, N(k) approximately
	k(-3/2), for the number of vertices (genes) with k connections was
	observed for three different data sets from yeast. We propose network
	growth models based on gene duplication events. Simulations of these
	models yield networks with the same combination of global graphical
	properties that we inferred from the expression data.},

	to control common targets and this allows a small number of regulators
	to govern many targets. One interesting question is that given this
	combinatorial regulation, how does the number of regulators scale
	with the number of targets? Here, we address this question by building
	and analyzing co-regulation (co-transcription and co-phosphorylation)
	networks that describe partnerships between regulators controlling
	common genes. We carry out analyses across five diverse species:
	Escherichia coli to human. These reveal many properties of partnership
	networks, such as the absence of a classical power-law degree distribution
	despite the existence of nodes with many partners. We also find that
	the number of co-regulatory partnerships follows an exponential saturation
	curve in relation to the number of targets. (For E. coli and Bacillus
	subtilis, only the beginning linear part of this curve is evident
	due to arrangement of genes into operons.) To gain intuition into
	the saturation process, we relate the biological regulation to more
	commonplace social contexts where a small number of individuals can
	form an intricate web of connections on the internet. Indeed, we
	find that the size of partnership networks saturates even as the
	complexity of their output increases. We also present a variety of
	models to account for the saturation phenomenon. In particular, we
	develop a simple analytical model to show how new partnerships are
	acquired with an increasing number of target genes; with certain
	assumptions, it reproduces the observed saturation. Then, we build
	a more general simulation of network growth and find agreement with
	a wide range of real networks. Finally, we perform various down-sampling

	analysis of vertebrate genomes has revealed an abundance of evolutionarily
	conserved but noncoding sequences. These conserved noncoding (CNC)
	sequences may well harbor critical regulatory variants that have
	driven recent human evolution. RESULTS: Here we identify 1,356 CNC
	sequences that appear to have undergone dramatic human-specific changes
	in selective pressures, at least 15\% of which have substitution
	rates significantly above that expected under neutrality. The 1,356
	'accelerated CNC' (ANC) sequences are enriched in recent segmental
	duplications, suggesting a recent change in selective constraint
	following duplication. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms
	within ANC sequences have a significant excess of high frequency
	derived alleles and high F(ST) values relative to controls, indicating
	that acceleration and positive selection are recent in human populations.
	Finally, a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms
	within ANC sequences are associated with changes in gene expression.
	The probability of variation in an ANC sequence being associated
	with a gene expression phenotype is fivefold higher than variation
	in a control CNC sequence. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern sequencing technologies allow rapid sequencing
	and bioinformatic analysis of genomes and metagenomes. With every
	new sequencing project a vast number of new proteins become available
	with many genes remaining functionally unclassified based on evidences
	from sequence similarities alone. Extending similarity searches with
	gene pattern approaches, defined as genes sharing a distinct genomic
	neighbourhood, have shown to significantly improve the number of
	functional assignments. Further functional evidences can be gained
	by correlating these gene patterns with prevailing environmental
	parameters. MetaMine was developed to approach the large pool of
	unclassified proteins by searching for recurrent gene patterns across
	habitats based on key genes. RESULTS: MetaMine is an interactive
	data mining tool which enables the detection of gene patterns in
	an environmental context. The gene pattern search starts with a user
	defined environmentally interesting key gene. With this gene a BLAST
	search is carried out against the Microbial Ecological Genomics DataBase
	(MEGDB) containing marine genomic and metagenomic sequences. This
	is followed by the determination of all neighbouring genes within
	a given distance and a search for functionally equivalent genes.
	In the final step a set of common genes present in a defined number
	of distinct genomes is determined. The gene patterns found are associated
	with their individual pattern instances describing gene order and
	directions. They are presented together with information about the
	sample and the habitat. MetaMine is implemented in Java and provided
	as a client/server application with a user-friendly graphical user
	interface. The system was evaluated with environmentally relevant
	genes related to the methane-cycle and carbon monoxide oxidation.
	CONCLUSION: MetaMine offers a targeted, semi-automatic search for
	gene patterns based on expert input. The graphical user interface
	of MetaMine provides a user-friendly overview of the computed gene
	patterns for further inspection in an ecological context. Prevailing
	biological processes associated with a key gene can be used to infer
	new annotations and shape hypotheses to guide further analyses. The
	use-cases demonstrate that meaningful gene patterns can be quickly
	detected using MetaMine.MetaMine is freely available for academic

  abstract = {Domains rich in alternating arginine and serine residues (RS domains)
	are frequently found in metazoan proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
	The RS domains of splicing factors associate with each other and
	are important for the formation of protein-protein interactions required
	for both constitutive and regulated splicing. The prevalence of the
	RS domain in splicing factors suggests that it might serve as a useful
	signature for the identification of new proteins that function in
	pre-mRNA processing, although it remains to be determined whether
	RS domains also participate in other cellular functions. Using database
	search and sequence clustering methods, we have identified and categorized
	RS domain proteins encoded within the entire genomes of Homo sapiens,
	Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae. This genome-wide survey revealed a surprising complexity
	of RS domain proteins in metazoans with functions associated with
	chromatin structure, transcription by RNA polymerase II, cell cycle,
	and cell structure, as well as pre-mRNA processing. Also identified
	were RS domain proteins in S. cerevisiae with functions associated
	with cell structure, osmotic regulation, and cell cycle progression.
	The results thus demonstrate an effective strategy for the genomic
	mining of RS domain proteins. The identification of many new proteins
	using this strategy has provided a database of factors that are candidates
	for forming RS domain-mediated interactions associated with different
	steps in pre-mRNA processing, in addition to other cellular functions.},

  title = {Phylogenomic approaches to common problems encountered in the analysis

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {22},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blocks of duplicated genomic DNA sequence longer than
	1000 base pairs are known as low copy repeats (LCRs). Identified
	by their sequence similarity, LCRs are abundant in the human genome,
	and are interesting because they may represent recent adaptive events,
	or potential future adaptive opportunities within the human lineage.
	Sequence analysis tools are needed, however, to decide whether these
	interpretations are likely, whether a particular set of LCRs represents
	nearly neutral drift creating junk DNA, or whether the appearance
	of LCRs reflects assembly error. Here we investigate an LCR family
	containing the sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A genes involved in drug
	metabolism, cancer, hormone regulation, and neurotransmitter biology
	as a first step for defining the problems that those tools must manage.
	RESULTS: Sequence analysis here identified a fourth sulfotransferase
	gene, which may be transcriptionally active, located on human chromosome
	16. Four regions of genomic sequence containing the four human SULT1A
	paralogs defined a new LCR family. The stem hominoid SULT1A progenitor
	locus was identified by comparative genomics involving complete human
	and rodent genomes, and a draft chimpanzee genome. SULT1A expansion
	in hominoid genomes was followed by positive selection acting on
	specific protein sites. This episode of adaptive evolution appears
	to be responsible for the dopamine sulfonation function of some SULT
	enzymes. Each of the conclusions that this bioinformatic analysis
	generated using data that has uncertain reliability (such as that
	from the chimpanzee genome sequencing project) has been confirmed
	experimentally or by a "finished" chromosome 16 assembly, both of
	which were published after the submission of this manuscript. CONCLUSION:
	SULT1A genes expanded from one to four copies in hominoids during
	intra-chromosomal LCR duplications, including (apparently) one after
	the divergence of chimpanzees and humans. Thus, LCRs may provide
	a means for amplifying genes (and other genetic elements) that are
	adaptively useful. Being located on and among LCRs, however, could
	make the human SULT1A genes susceptible to further duplications or
	deletions resulting in 'genomic diseases' for some individuals. Pharmacogenomic
	studies of SULT1Asingle nucleotide polymorphisms, therefore, should
	also consider examining SULT1A copy number variability when searching
	for genotype-phenotype associations. The latest duplication is, however,
	only a substantiated hypothesis; an alternative explanation, disfavored
	by the majority of evidence, is that the duplication is an artifact
	of incorrect genome assembly.},

	Three phases are observed in globally optimal configurations for
	different cost-communication trade offs: (i) regular small worlds,

	hubs. In the latter regime, i.e., for very expensive wire, power

	In contrast, in the local optimization process the presence of sharp

  abstract = {Gene duplication is the predominant mechanism for the evolution of
	new genes. Major existing models of this process assume that duplicate
	genes are redundant; degenerative mutations in one copy can therefore
	accumulate close to neutrally, usually leading to loss from the genome.
	When gene products dimerize or interact with other molecules for
	their functions, however, degenerative mutations in one copy may
	produce repressor alleles that inhibit the function of the other
	and are therefore exposed to selection. Here, we describe the evolution
	of a duplicate repressor by simple degenerative mutations in the
	steroid hormone receptors (SRs), a biologically crucial vertebrate
	gene family. We isolated and characterized the SRs of the cephalochordate
	Branchiostoma floridae, which diverged from other chordates just
	after duplication of the ancestral SR. The B. floridae genome contains
	two SRs: BfER, an ortholog of the vertebrate estrogen receptors,
	and BfSR, an ortholog of the vertebrate receptors for androgens,
	progestins, and corticosteroids. BfSR is specifically activated by
	estrogens and recognizes estrogen response elements (EREs) in DNA;
	BfER does not activate transcription in response to steroid hormones
	but binds EREs, where it competitively represses BfSR. The two genes
	are partially coexpressed, particularly in ovary and testis, suggesting
	an ancient role in germ cell development. These results corroborate
	previous findings that the ancestral steroid receptor was estrogen-sensitive
	and indicate that, after duplication, BfSR retained the ancestral
	function, while BfER evolved the capacity to negatively regulate
	BfSR. Either of two historical mutations that occurred during BfER
	evolution is sufficient to generate a competitive repressor. Our
	findings suggest that after duplication of genes whose functions
	depend on specific molecular interactions, high-probability degenerative
	mutations can yield novel functions, which are then exposed to positive
	or negative selection; in either case, the probability of neofunctionalization
	relative to gene loss is increased compared to existing models.},

  title = {Subgroup analyses in randomised controlled trials: quantifying the

  journal = {Health Technol Assess},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {1--56},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subgroup analyses are common in randomised controlled
	trials (RCTs). There are many easily accessible guidelines on the
	selection and analysis of subgroups but the key messages do not seem
	to be universally accepted and inappropriate analyses continue to
	appear in the literature. This has potentially serious implications
	because erroneous identification of differential subgroup effects
	may lead to inappropriate provision or withholding of treatment.
	OBJECTIVES: (1) To quantify the extent to which subgroup analyses
	may be misleading. (2) To compare the relative merits and weaknesses
	of the two most common approaches to subgroup analysis: separate
	(subgroup-specific) analyses of treatment effect and formal statistical
	tests of interaction. (3) To establish what factors affect the performance
	of the two approaches. (4) To provide estimates of the increase in
	sample size required to detect differential subgroup effects. (5)
	To provide recommendations on the analysis and interpretation of
	subgroup analyses. METHODS: The performances of subgroup-specific
	and formal interaction tests were assessed by simulating data with
	no differential subgroup effects and determining the extent to which
	the two approaches (incorrectly) identified such an effect, and simulating
	data with a differential subgroup effect and determining the extent
	to which the two approaches were able to (correctly) identify it.
	Initially, data were simulated to represent the 'simplest case' of
	two equal-sized treatment groups and two equal-sized subgroups. Data
	were first simulated with no differential subgroup effect and then
	with a range of types and magnitudes of subgroup effect with the
	sample size determined by the nominal power (50-95\%) for the overall
	treatment effect. Additional simulations were conducted to explore
	the individual impact of the sample size, the magnitude of the overall
	treatment effect, the size and number of treatment groups and subgroups
	and, in the case of continuous data, the variability of the data.
	The simulated data covered the types of outcomes most commonly used
	in RCTs, namely continuous (Gaussian) variables, binary outcomes
	and survival times. All analyses were carried out using appropriate
	regression models, and subgroup effects were identified on the basis
	of statistical significance at the 5\% level. RESULTS: While there
	was some variation for smaller sample sizes, the results for the
	three types of outcome were very similar for simulations with a total
	sample size of greater than or equal to 200. With simulated simplest
	case data with no differential subgroup effects, the formal tests
	of interaction were significant in 5\% of cases as expected, while
	subgroup-specific tests were less reliable and identified effects
	in 7-66\% of cases depending on whether there was an overall treatment
	effect. The most common type of subgroup effect identified in this
	way was where the treatment effect was seen to be significant in
	one subgroup only. When a simulated differential subgroup effect
	was included, the results were dependent on the nominal power of
	the simulated data and the type and magnitude of the subgroup effect.
	However, the performance of the formal interaction test was generally
	superior to that of the subgroup-specific analyses, with more differential
	effects correctly identified. In addition, the subgroup-specific
	analyses often suggested the wrong type of differential effect. The
	ability of formal interaction tests to (correctly) identify subgroup
	effects improved as the size of the interaction increased relative
	to the overall treatment effect. When the size of the interaction
	was twice the overall effect or greater, the interaction tests had
	at least the same power as the overall treatment effect. However,
	power was considerably reduced for smaller interactions, which are
	much more likely in practice. The inflation factor required to increase
	the sample size to enable detection of the interaction with the same
	power as the overall effect varied with the size of the interaction.
	For an interaction of the same magnitude as the overall effect, the
	inflation factor was 4, and this increased dramatically to of greater
	than or equal to 100 for more subtle interactions of < 20\% of the
	overall effect. Formal interaction tests were generally robust to
	alterations in the number and size of the treatment and subgroups
	and, for continuous data, the variance in the treatment groups, with
	the only exception being a change in the variance in one of the subgroups.
	In contrast, the performance of the subgroup-specific tests was affected
	by almost all of these factors with only a change in the number of
	treatment groups having no impact at all. CONCLUSIONS: While it is
	generally recognised that subgroup analyses can produce spurious
	results, the extent of the problem is almost certainly under-estimated.
	This is particularly true when subgroup-specific analyses are used.
	In addition, the increase in sample size required to identify differential
	subgroup effects may be substantial and the commonly used 'rule of
	four' may not always be sufficient, especially when interactions
	are relatively subtle, as is often the case. CONCLUSIONS--RECOMMENDATIONS
	FOR SUBGROUP ANALYSES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION: (1) Subgroup analyses
	should, as far as possible, be restricted to those proposed before
	data collection. Any subgroups chosen after this time should be clearly
	identified. (2) Trials should ideally be powered with subgroup analyses
	in mind. However, for modest interactions, this may not be feasible.
	(3) Subgroup-specific analyses are particularly unreliable and are
	affected by many factors. Subgroup analyses should always be based
	on formal tests of interaction although even these should be interpreted
	with caution. (4) The results from any subgroup analyses should not
	be over-interpreted. Unless there is strong supporting evidence,
	they are best viewed as a hypothesis-generation exercise. In particular,
	one should be wary of evidence suggesting that treatment is effective
	in one subgroup only. (5) Any apparent lack of differential effect
	should be regarded with caution unless the study was specifically
	powered with interactions in mind. CONCLUSIONS--RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
	RESEARCH: (1) The implications of considering confidence intervals
	rather than p-values could be considered. (2) The same approach as
	in this study could be applied to contexts other than RCTs, such
	as observational studies and meta-analyses. (3) The scenarios used
	in this study could be examined more comprehensively using other
	statistical methods, incorporating clustering effects, considering
	other types of outcome variable and using other approaches, such
	as Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods.},

	for the exploration of the reliability of clustering methods that
	can potentially be used when we are confronted with opaque natural

	in research on the relations between brain, thought and language).
	From our social net, we constructed two different graph representations

	Evidence of preferential attachment of new nodes and of new links

	a century. Yet fundamental questions remain unanswered, including
	which came first, the metabolic machinery or the encoding nucleic
	acids. In this study we take a protein-centric view and explore the
	ancestral origins of proteins. Protein domain structures in proteomes
	are highly conserved and embody molecular functions and interactions
	that are needed for cellular and organismal processes. Here we use
	domain structure to study the evolution of molecular function in
	the protein world. Timelines describing the age and function of protein
	domains at fold, fold superfamily, and fold family levels of structural
	complexity were derived from a structural phylogenomic census in
	hundreds of fully sequenced genomes. These timelines unfold congruent
	hourglass patterns in rates of appearance of domain structures and
	functions, functional diversity, and hierarchical complexity, and
	revealed a gradual build up of protein repertoires associated with
	metabolism, translation and DNA, in that order. The most ancient
	domain architectures were hydrolase enzymes and the first translation
	domains had catalytic functions for the aminoacylation and the molecular
	switch-driven transport of RNA. Remarkably, the most ancient domains
	had metabolic roles, did not interact with RNA, and preceded the
	gradual build-up of translation. In fact, the first translation domains
	had also a metabolic origin and were only later followed by specialized
	translation machinery. Our results explain how the generation of
	structure in the protein world and the concurrent crystallization
	of translation and diversified cellular life created further opportunities
	for proteomic diversification.},

  pages = {10},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most genes in Arabidopsis thaliana are members of gene
	families. How do the members of gene families arise, and how are
	gene family copy numbers maintained? Some gene families may evolve
	primarily through tandem duplication and high rates of birth and
	death in clusters, and others through infrequent polyploidy or large-scale
	segmental duplications and subsequent losses. RESULTS: Our approach
	to understanding the mechanisms of gene family evolution was to construct
	phylogenies for 50 large gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana, identify
	large internal segmental duplications in Arabidopsis, map gene duplications
	onto the segmental duplications, and use this information to identify
	which nodes in each phylogeny arose due to segmental or tandem duplication.
	Examples of six gene families exemplifying characteristic modes are
	described. Distributions of gene family sizes and patterns of duplication
	by genomic distance are also described in order to characterize patterns
	of local duplication and copy number for large gene families. Both
	gene family size and duplication by distance closely follow power-law
	distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Combining information about genomic segmental
	duplications, gene family phylogenies, and gene positions provides
	a method to evaluate contributions of tandem duplication and segmental
	genome duplication in the generation and maintenance of gene families.
	These differences appear to correspond meaningfully to differences

	aflatoxin gene cluster.},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {111},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biosynthesis of aflatoxin (AF) involves over 20 enzymatic
	reactions in a complex polyketide pathway that converts acetate and
	malonate to the intermediates sterigmatocystin (ST) and O-methylsterigmatocystin
	(OMST), the respective penultimate and ultimate precursors of AF.
	Although these precursors are chemically and structurally very similar,
	their accumulation differs at the species level for Aspergilli. Notable
	examples are A. nidulans that synthesizes only ST, A. flavus that
	makes predominantly AF, and A. parasiticus that generally produces
	either AF or OMST. Whether these differences are important in the
	evolutionary/ecological processes of species adaptation and diversification
	is unknown. Equally unknown are the specific genomic mechanisms responsible
	for ordering and clustering of genes in the AF pathway of Aspergillus.
	RESULTS: To elucidate the mechanisms that have driven formation of
	these clusters, we performed systematic searches of aflatoxin cluster
	homologs across five Aspergillus genomes. We found a high level of
	gene duplication and identified seven modules consisting of highly
	correlated gene pairs (aflA/aflB, aflR/aflS, aflX/aflY, aflF/aflE,
	aflT/aflQ, aflC/aflW, and aflG/aflL). With the exception of A. nomius,
	contrasts of mean Ka/Ks values across all cluster genes showed significant
	differences in selective pressure between section Flavi and non-section
	Flavi species. A. nomius mean Ka/Ks values were more similar to partial
	clusters in A. fumigatus and A. terreus. Overall, mean Ka/Ks values
	were significantly higher for section Flavi than for non-section
	Flavi species. CONCLUSION: Our results implicate several genomic
	mechanisms in the evolution of ST, OMST and AF cluster genes. Gene
	modules may arise from duplications of a single gene, whereby the
	function of the pre-duplication gene is retained in the copy (aflF/aflE)
	or the copies may partition the ancestral function (aflA/aflB). In
	some gene modules, the duplicated copy may simply augment/supplement
	a specific pathway function (aflR/aflS and aflX/aflY) or the duplicated
	copy may evolve a completely new function (aflT/aflQ and aflC/aflW).
	Gene modules that are contiguous in one species and noncontiguous
	in others point to possible rearrangements of cluster genes in the
	evolution of these species. Significantly higher mean Ka/Ks values
	in section Flavi compared to non-section Flavi species indicate increased
	positive selection acting in the evolution of genes in OMST and AF
	gene clusters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative approaches using protostome and deuterostome
	data have greatly contributed to understanding gene function and
	organismal complexity. The family 2 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
	are one of the largest and best studied hormone and neuropeptide
	receptor families. They are suggested to have arisen from a single
	ancestral gene via duplication events. Despite the recent identification
	of receptor members in protostome and early deuterostome genomes,
	relatively little is known about their function or origin during
	metazoan divergence. In this study a comprehensive description of
	family 2 GPCR evolution is given based on in silico and expression
	analyses of the invertebrate receptor genes. RESULTS: Family 2 GPCR
	members were identified in the invertebrate genomes of the nematodes
	C. elegans and C. briggsae, the arthropods D. melanogaster and A.
	gambiae (mosquito) and in the tunicate C. intestinalis. This suggests
	that they are of ancient origin and have evolved through gene/genome
	duplication events. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses
	have demonstrated that the immediate gene environment, with regard
	to gene content, is conserved between the protostome and deuterostome
	receptor genomic regions. Also that the protostome genes are more
	like the deuterostome Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF) and Calcitonin/Calcitonin
	Gene-Related Peptide (CAL/CGRP) receptors members than the other
	family 2 GPCR members. The evolution of family 2 GPCRs in deuterostomes
	is characterised by acquisition of new family members, with SCT (Secretin)
	receptors only present in tetrapods. Gene structure is characterised
	by an increase in intron number with organismal complexity with the
	exception of the vertebrate CAL/CGRP receptors. CONCLUSION: The family
	2 GPCR members provide a good example of gene duplication events
	occurring in tandem with increasing organismal complexity during
	metazoan evolution. The putative ancestral receptors are proposed
	to be more like the deuterostome CAL/CGRP and CRF receptors and this
	may be associated with their fundamental role in calcium regulation

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {192},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of introns in protein-coding genes is a universal
	feature of eukaryotic genome organization, and the genes of multicellular
	eukaryotes, typically, contain multiple introns, a substantial fraction
	of which share position in distant taxa, such as plants and animals.
	Depending on the methods and data sets used, researchers have reached
	opposite conclusions on the causes of the high fraction of shared
	introns in orthologous genes from distant eukaryotes. Some studies
	conclude that shared intron positions reflect, almost entirely, a
	remarkable evolutionary conservation, whereas others attribute it
	to parallel gain of introns. To resolve these contradictions, it
	is crucial to analyze the evolution of introns by using a model that
	minimally relies on arbitrary assumptions. RESULTS: We developed
	a probabilistic model of evolution that allows for variability of
	intron gain and loss rates over branches of the phylogenetic tree,
	individual genes, and individual sites. Applying this model to an
	extended set of conserved eukaryotic genes, we find that parallel
	gain, on average, accounts for only approximately 8\% of the shared
	intron positions. However, the distribution of parallel gains over
	the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes is highly non-uniform. There
	are, practically, no parallel gains in closely related lineages,
	whereas for distant lineages, such as animals and plants, parallel
	gains appear to contribute up to 20\% of the shared intron positions.
	In accord with these findings, we estimated that ancestral introns
	have a high probability to be retained in extant genomes, and conversely,
	that a substantial fraction of extant introns have retained their
	positions since the early stages of eukaryotic evolution. In addition,
	the density of sites that are available for intron insertion is estimated
	to be, approximately, one in seven basepairs. CONCLUSION: We obtained
	robust estimates of the contribution of parallel gain to the observed
	sharing of intron positions between eukaryotic species separated
	by different evolutionary distances. The results indicate that, although
	the contribution of parallel gains varies across the phylogenetic
	tree, the high level of intron position sharing is due, primarily,
	to evolutionary conservation. Accordingly, numerous introns appear
	to persist in the same position over hundreds of millions of years
	of evolution. This is compatible with recent observations of a negative
	correlation between the rate of intron gain and coding sequence evolution
	rate of a gene, suggesting that at least some of the introns are
	functionally relevant.},

	model and an extended data set, including 391 conserved genes from
	19 eukaryotes, to uncover previously unnoticed aspects of intron
	evolution--in particular, to assign intron gain and loss rates to
	individual genes. The rates of intron gain and loss in a gene show
	moderate positive correlation. A gene's intron gain rate shows a
	highly significant negative correlation with the coding-sequence

	correlates with the sequence evolution rate. Correlations of the
	opposite signs, albeit less significant ones, are observed between

	that intron evolution includes a neutral component, which is manifest
	in the positive correlation between the gain and loss rates and a

	gain and loss and sequence evolution. The increased intron gain and
	decreased intron loss in evolutionarily conserved genes indicate

	involved the identification of duplicated genes with greater similarity

	to be present in multiple mammalian genomes, suggesting duplication
	early in mammalian divergence. To eliminate genes that have been
	conserved due to strong purifying selection, our analysis also required
	at least one intron to have retained high sequence similarity between
	paralogues. RESULTS: We identified three human gene pairs undergoing
	concerted evolution (BMP8A/B, DDX19A/B, and TUBG1/2). Phylogenetic
	investigations reveal that in each case the duplication appears to
	have occurred prior to eutherian mammalian radiation, with exactly

	Here, we show that identifying lineage-specific gene loss after genome
	duplication is important for understanding the evolution of gene
	subfunctions in surviving paralogs and for improving functional connectivity
	among human and model organism genomes. We examine the general principles
	of gene loss following duplication, coupled with expression analysis
	of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh1a gene family during retinoic
	acid signaling in eye development as a case study. Humans have three
	ALDH1A genes, but teleosts have just one or two. We used comparative
	genomics and conserved syntenies to identify loss of ohnologs (paralogs
	derived from genome duplication) and to clarify uncertain phylogenies.
	Analysis showed that Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2 form a clade that is sister
	to Aldh1a3-related genes. Genome comparisons showed secondarily loss
	of aldh1a1 in teleosts, revealing that Aldh1a1 is not a tetrapod
	innovation and that aldh1a3 was recently lost in medaka, making it
	the first known vertebrate with a single aldh1a gene. Interestingly,
	results revealed asymmetric distribution of surviving ohnologs between
	co-orthologous teleost chromosome segments, suggesting that local
	genome architecture can influence ohnolog survival. We propose a
	model that reconstructs the chromosomal history of the Aldh1a family
	in the ancestral vertebrate genome, coupled with the evolution of
	gene functions in surviving Aldh1a ohnologs after R1, R2, and R3
	genome duplications. Results provide evidence for early subfunctionalization
	and late subfunction-partitioning and suggest a mechanistic model
	based on altered regulation leading to heterochronic gene expression
	to explain the acquisition or modification of subfunctions by surviving
	ohnologs that preserve unaltered ancestral developmental programs
	in the face of gene loss.},

	study has been done about the origins and evolution of this gene

	of the formin genes by examining 597 prokaryotic and 53 eukaryotic
	genomes. Additionally, we used three-dimensional protein structure
	data in an effort to uncover distantly related sequences. Our results
	suggest that the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, which promotes the
	formation of actin filaments, is a eukaryotic innovation and apparently
	originated only once in eukaryotic evolution. Despite the high degree
	of FH2 domain sequence divergence, the FH2 domains of most eukaryotic
	formins are predicted to assume the same fold and thus have similar
	functions. The formin genes have experienced multiple taxon-specific
	duplications and followed the birth-and-death model of evolution.
	Additionally, the formin genes experienced taxon-specific genomic
	rearrangements that led to the acquisition of unrelated protein domains.
	The evolutionary diversification of formin genes apparently increased
	the number of formin's interacting molecules and consequently contributed
	to the development of a complex and precise actin assembly mechanism.
	The diversity of formin types is probably related to the range of

	We sequenced the entire duplicated HoxAa and HoxAb clusters of zebrafish
	(Danio rerio) and extended the 5' (posterior) part of the HoxM (HoxA-like)
	cluster of horn shark (Heterodontus francisci) containing the hoxa11
	and hoxa13 orthologs as well as intergenic and flanking noncoding
	sequences. The duplicated HoxA clusters in zebrafish each house considerably
	fewer genes and are dramatically shorter than the single HoxA clusters
	of human and horn shark. We compared the intergenic sequences of
	the HoxA clusters of human, horn shark, zebrafish (Aa, Ab), and striped
	bass and found extensive conservation of noncoding sequence motifs,
	i.e., phylogenetic footprints, between the human and horn shark,
	representing two of the three gnathostome lineages. These are putative
	cis-regulatory elements that may play a role in the regulation of
	the ancestral HoxA cluster. In contrast, homologous regions of the
	duplicated HoxAa and HoxAb clusters of zebrafish and the HoxA cluster
	of striped bass revealed a striking loss of conservation of these
	putative cis-regulatory sequences in the 3' (anterior) segment of
	the cluster, where zebrafish only retains single representatives
	of group 1, 3, 4, and 5 (HoxAa) and group 2 (HoxAb) genes and in
	the 5' part of the clusters, where zebrafish retains two copies of
	the group 13, 11, and 9 genes, i.e., AbdB-like genes. In analyzing
	patterns of cis-sequence evolution in the 5' part of the clusters,
	we explicitly looked for evidence of complementary loss of conserved
	noncoding sequences, as predicted by the duplication-degeneration-complementation
	model in which genetic redundancy after gene duplication is resolved
	because of the fixation of complementary degenerative mutations.
	Our data did not yield evidence supporting this prediction. We conclude
	that changes in the pattern of cis-sequence conservation after Hox
	cluster duplication are more consistent with being the outcome of
	adaptive modification rather than passive mechanisms that erode redundancy
	created by the duplication event. These results support the view
	that genome duplications may provide a mechanism whereby master control
	genes undergo radical modifications conducive to major alterations
	in body plan. Such genomic revolutions may contribute significantly

	in prokaryotes, from approximately 20\% to approximately 75\% GC,
	one wonders if these extreme biases in base pair composition affect
	the evolution of transcription factor-binding sites (BS). This letter
	shows that, along the wide range of GC content variation in bacteria,
	bacterial BS keep a high frequency of AT bases, roughly independently
	of the background (BG) base pair composition of intergenic regions.
	As a result, the equilibrium base pair frequencies of BS depart the
	most from those of BS DNA in GC-rich genomes. This not only implies
	a higher specificity but also a higher coding barrier for BS in GC-rich
	genomes. In accordance, we observe that the average percentage of
	divergently transcribed regions increases with the GC content of
	the genome, suggesting the use of a more efficient coding strategy.},

	To study the evolution of complete gene repertoires, we propose here
	a mathematical framework that does not rely on resolved gene family

	family sizes across multiple genomes, are sufficient to infer principal
	evolutionary trends. The main novelty in our approach is an efficient
	algorithm to compute the likelihood of a phylogenetic profile in
	a model of birth-and-death processes acting on a phylogeny. We examine
	known gene families in 28 archaeal genomes using a probabilistic
	model that involves lineage- and family-specific components of gene
	acquisition, duplication, and loss. The model enables us to consider
	all possible histories when inferring statistics about archaeal evolution.
	According to our reconstruction, most lineages are characterized
	by a net loss of gene families. Major increases in gene repertoire
	have occurred only a few times. Our reconstruction underlines the
	importance of persistent streamlining processes in shaping genome

  abstract = {The duplication of genes and genomes is believed to be a major force
	in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. However, different models
	have been presented about how duplicated genes are preserved from
	elimination by purifying selection. Preservation of one of the gene
	copies due to rare mutational events that result in a new gene function
	(neofunctionalization) necessitates that the other gene copy retain
	its ancestral function. Alternatively, preservation of both gene
	copies due to rapid divergence of coding and noncoding regions such
	that neither retains the complete function of the ancestral gene
	(subfunctionalization) may result in a requirement for both gene
	copies for organismal survival. The duplication and divergence of
	the tandemly arrayed homeotic clusters have been studied in considerable
	detail and have provided evidence in support of the subfunctionalization
	model. However, the vast majority of duplicated genes are not clustered
	tandemly, but instead are dispersed in syntenic regions on different
	chromosomes, most likely as a result of genome-wide duplications
	and rearrangements. The Myb oncogene family provides an interesting
	opportunity to study a dispersed multigene family because invertebrates
	possess a single Myb gene, whereas all vertebrate genomes examined
	thus far contain three different Myb genes (A-Myb, B-Myb, and c-Myb).
	A-Myb and c-Myb appear to have arisen by a second round of gene duplication,
	which was preceded by the acquisition of a transcriptional activation
	domain in the ancestral A-Myb/c-Myb gene generated from the initial
	duplication of an ancestral B-Myb-like gene. B-Myb appears to be
	essential in all dividing cells, whereas A-Myb and c-Myb display
	tissue-specific requirements during spermatogenesis and hematopoiesis,
	respectively. We now report that the absence of Drosophila Myb (Dm-Myb)
	causes a failure of larval hemocyte proliferation and lymph gland
	development, while Dm-Myb(-/-) hemocytes from mosaic larvae reveal
	a phagocytosis defect. In addition, we show that vertebrate B-Myb,
	but neither vertebrate A-Myb nor c-Myb, can complement these hemocyte
	proliferation defects in Drosophila. Indeed, vertebrate A-Myb and
	c-Myb cause lethality in the presence or absence of endogenous Dm-Myb.
	These results are consistent with a neomorphic origin of an ancestral
	A-Myb/c-Myb gene from a duplicated B-Myb-like gene. In addition,
	our results suggest that B-Myb and Dm-Myb share essential conserved
	functions that are required for cell proliferation. Finally, these
	experiments demonstrate the utility of genetic complementation in
	Drosophila to explore the functional evolution of duplicated genes

	RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the distribution of attention
	paid to different organisms has a smooth distribution that approximates
	to a scale-free power law, in which there is no clear discontinuity
	that divides organisms into 'models' and the rest. This is true for
	both individual years and for the aggregate of all years' data. In
	other systems (eg connections in the World Wide Web), such power-law
	distributions arise from mechanisms of preferential attachment ('the
	rich get richer'). Detailed analysis of the progress of different
	organisms over the years under study shows that, while preferential
	attachment may be part of the mechanism that generates the power
	law distribution, it is insufficient to explain it. CONCLUSION: The
	smoothness of the distribution suggests that there is no empirical
	basis for dividing species under study into 'model' organisms and
	'the rest', and that the widely-held view about organism choice in
	developmental biology is distorted.},

	a number of higher-order correlations in these networks. A key support

	The scale-free nature of this graph, termed the protein domain universe

	the existence of a successful convergent model. To further resolve
	the issue of protein structural evolution, we explore the predictions

	nodes from the PDUG are partitioned into subgraphs on the basis of
	their occurrence in the proteomes of particular organisms, these
	subgraphs exhibit a scale-free nature as well. We explore a simple

	families contained within the whole genomes of human, chimpanzee,

	9,990 families present in the mammalian common ancestor have either
	expanded or contracted along at least one lineage. Additionally,
	we find that a large number of families are completely lost from
	one or more mammalian genomes, and a similar number of gene families
	have arisen subsequent to the mammalian common ancestor. Along the
	lineage leading to modern humans we infer the gain of 689 genes and
	the loss of 86 genes since the split from chimpanzees, including
	changes likely driven by adaptive natural selection. Our results
	imply that humans and chimpanzees differ by at least 6\% (1,418 of
	22,000 genes) in their complement of genes, which stands in stark

	In these models, religious content colonizes individual humans. Rates

	reached dominance), we assume that the rate of loss of belief increases

  journal = {BMC Biol},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {66},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylostratigraphy is a method used to correlate the evolutionary
	origin of founder genes (that is, functional founder protein domains)
	of gene families with particular macroevolutionary transitions. It
	is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin
	of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence
	of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced
	in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered
	to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions
	would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular
	life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between
	cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking
	of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights
	into the origin of multicellularity. RESULTS: We find two strong
	peaks of the emergence of cancer related protein domains, one at
	the time of the origin of the first cell and the other around the
	time of the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms. These
	peaks correlate with two major classes of cancer genes, the 'caretakers',
	which are involved in general functions that support genome stability
	and the 'gatekeepers', which are involved in cellular signalling
	and growth processes. Interestingly, this phylogenetic succession
	mirrors the ontogenetic succession of tumour progression, where mutations
	in caretakers are thought to precede mutations in gatekeepers. CONCLUSIONS:
	A link between multicellularity and formation of cancer has often
	been predicted. However, this has not so far been explicitly tested.
	Although we find that a significant number of protein domains involved
	in cancer predate the origin of multicellularity, the second peak
	of cancer protein domain emergence is, indeed, connected to a phylogenetic
	level where multicellular animals have emerged. The fact that we
	can find a strong and consistent signal for this second peak in the
	phylostratigraphic map implies that a complex multi-level selection
	process has driven the transition to multicellularity.},

	of non-reciprocal DNA exchange, in particular within multigene families,
	provides alternative explanations for conservation and divergence,

	cause continual fluctuations in the copy-number of variant genes

	of a variant gene throughout a family (homogenization) and throughout

	homogenization and fixation are inextricably linked. Data are presented
	of the expected stages of transition in the spread of variant repeats
	by molecular drive in some non-genic families of DNA, seemingly not
	under the influence of selection. When a molecularly driven change
	in a given gene family is accompanied by the coevolution (mediated
	by selection) of other DNA, RNA or protein molecules that interact
	with the gene family then biological function is observed to be maintained

	and a turnover bias in favour of ancestral sequences can dramatically
	retard the rate of sequence change, in the absence of function. Examples
	of the maintenance of function by molecular coevolution and conservation
	of sequences in the absence of function, are drawn mainly from the

	Thus, for example, most of the enzymatic components of plant secondary

	family evolution are well illustrated by the genes that encode chalcone
	synthase (CHS), the first committed step in flavonoid biosynthesis.
	We review pertinent facts about CHS evolution in flowering plants
	with special reference to the morning glory genus, Ipomoea. Our review
	shows that new CHS genes are recruited recurrently in flowering plant
	evolution. Rates of nucleotide substitution are frequently accelerated
	in new duplicate genes, and there is clear evidence for repeated
	shifts in enzymatic function among duplicate copies of CHS genes.
	In addition, we present new data on expression patterns of CHS genes
	as a function of tissue and developmental stage in the common morning
	glory (I. purpurea). These data show extensive differentiation in
	gene expression among duplicate copies of CHS genes. We also show
	that a single mutation which blocks anthocyanin biosynthesis in the
	floral limb is correlated with a loss of expression of one of the
	six duplicate CHS genes present in the morning glory genome. This
	suggests that different duplicate copies of CHS have acquired specialized

	focusing on the evolution of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
	We solve a general duplication-divergence model, based on the statistically
	necessary deletions of protein-protein interactions arising from
	stochastic duplications at various genomic scales, from single-gene
	to whole-genome duplications. Major evolutionary scenarios are shown
	to depend on two global parameters only: (i) a protein conservation

	and (ii) a distinct topology index (M') controlling their resulting
	structure. We then demonstrate that conserved, nondense networks,
	which are of prime biological relevance, are also necessarily scale-free
	by construction, irrespective of any evolutionary variations or fluctuations
	of the model parameters. It is shown to result from a fundamental
	linkage between individual protein conservation and network topology

	All in all, these evolutionary constraints, inherent to duplication-divergence

  journal = {BMC Syst Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {49},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successive whole genome duplications have recently been
	firmly established in all major eukaryote kingdoms. Such exponential
	evolutionary processes must have largely contributed to shape the
	topology of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks by outweighing,
	in particular, all time-linear network growths modeled so far. RESULTS:
	We propose and solve a mathematical model of PPI network evolution
	under successive genome duplications. This demonstrates, from first
	principles, that evolutionary conservation and scale-free topology
	are intrinsically linked properties of PPI networks and emerge from
	i) prevailing exponential network dynamics under duplication and
	ii) asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates. While required, we
	argue that this asymmetric divergence arises, in fact, spontaneously
	at the level of protein-binding sites. This supports a refined model
	of PPI network evolution in terms of protein domains under exponential
	and asymmetric duplication/divergence dynamics, with multidomain
	proteins underlying the combinatorial formation of protein complexes.
	Genome duplication then provides a powerful source of PPI network
	innovation by promoting local rearrangements of multidomain proteins
	on a genome wide scale. Yet, we show that the overall conservation
	and topology of PPI networks are robust to extensive domain shuffling
	of multidomain proteins as well as to finer details of protein interaction
	and evolution. Finally, large scale features of direct and indirect
	PPI networks of S. cerevisiae are well reproduced numerically with
	only two adjusted parameters of clear biological significance (i.e.
	network effective growth rate and average number of protein-binding
	domains per protein). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the statistical
	consequences of genome duplication and domain shuffling on the conservation
	and topology of PPI networks over a broad evolutionary scale across
	eukaryote kingdoms. In particular, scale-free topologies of PPI networks,
	which are found to be robust to extensive shuffling of protein domains,
	appear to be a simple consequence of the conservation of protein-binding
	domains under asymmetric duplication/divergence dynamics in the course
	of evolution.},

	in organisms with larger population size, where evolutionary forces
	are more efficient at promoting adaptive functional innovation and
	purifying selection, thus curbing the concentration imbalance arising
	from gene duplication. By examining miRNA target dissimilarities
	within human gene families, we show that the capacitance is operative
	at a post-transcriptional regulatory level: The higher the packing
	deficiency of a protein, the more likely that its paralogs will be
	dissimilarly targeted by miRNA to mitigate dosage imbalance. For
	families with low capacitance, paralog sequence divergence and family
	size correlate tightly with packing deficiency, just like in unicellular
	eukaryotes. Thus, a major component of human tolerance toward dosage
	imbalances is rooted in the paralog-discriminating capacity of miRNA
	regulation. The results may clarify the evolutionary etiology of
	aggregation-related diseases, since aggregation is often promoted
	by overexpression (a dosage imbalance) and aggregation propensity
	is associated with extreme packing deficiency.},

  abstract = {The association of a drug with its target protein has the effect of
	blocking the protein activity and is termed a promiscuous function
	to distinguish from the protein's native function (Tawfik and associates,
	Nat. Genet. 37, 73-6, 2005). Obviously, a protein has not evolved
	naturally for drug association or drug resistance. Promiscuous protein
	functions exhibit unique traits of evolutionary adaptability, or
	evolvability, which is dependent on the induction of novel phenotypic
	traits by a small number of mutations. These mutations might have
	small effects on native functions, but large effects on promiscuous
	function; for example, an evolving protein could become increasingly
	drug resistant while maintaining its original function. Ariel Fernandez,
	in his opinion piece, notes that drug-binding "promiscuity" can hardly
	be dissociated from native functions; a dominant approach to drug
	discovery is the protein-native-substrate transition-state mimetic
	strategy. Thus, man-made ligands (e.g. drugs) have been successfully
	crafted to restrain enzymatic activity by focusing on the very same
	structural features that determine the native function. Using the
	successful inhibition of HIV-1 protease as an example, Fernandez
	illustrates how drug designers have employed naturally evolved features
	of the protein to suppress its activity. Based on these arguments,
	he dismisses the notion that drug binding is quintessentially promiscuous,
	even though in principle, proteins did not evolve to associate with
	man made ligands. In short, Fernandez argues that there may not be
	separate protein domains that one could term promiscuous domains.
	While acknowledging that drugs may bind promiscuously or in a native-like
	manner a la Fernandez, Tawfik maintains the role of evolutionary
	adaptation, even when a drug binds native-like. In the case of HIV-1
	protease, drugs bind natively, and the initial onset of mutations
	results in drug resistance in addition to a dramatic decline in enzymatic
	activity and fitness of the virus. A chain of compensatory mutations
	follows this, and then the virus becomes fully fit and drug resistant.
	Ben Berkhout and Rogier Sanders subscribe to the evolution of new
	protein functions through gene duplication. With two identical protein
	domains, one domain can be released from a constraint imposed by
	the original function and it is thus free to move in sequence space
	toward a new function without loss of the original function. They
	emphasize that the forced evolution of drug-resistance differs significantly
	from the spontaneous evolution of an additional protein function.
	For instance, the latter process could proceed gradually on an evolutionary
	time scale, whereas the acquisition of drug-resistance is an all
	or nothing process for a virus, leading to the failure or success
	of therapy. They find no evidence to the thesis that resistance-mutations
	appear more rapidly in promiscuous domains than native domains. Berkhout
	and Sanders illustrate the genetic plasticity of HIV-1 by citing
	examples in which well-conserved amino acid residues of catalytic
	domains are forced to mutate under drug-pressure. HIV drug resistance
	biology is very complex. Instead of a viral protein, a drug can be
	targeted at a cellular protein. For example, Berkhout and Sanders
	claim, a drug targeted at the cellular protein CCR5 inhibits the
	binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) to CCR5. However,
	Env mutates so that it binds to the CCR5-drug complex and develops
	drug resistance. Interestingly, CCR5 has not evolved to bind to Env,
	but to a series of chemokines. Andrzej Kloczkowski, Taner Sen, and
	Bob Jernigan point out the importance of protein motions for binding.
	They believe it is likely that different ligands can bind to the
	diverse protein conformations sampled in the course of normal protein
	conformational fluctuations. They have been applying simple elastic
	network models to extract the motions as normal modes, which yield
	relatively small numbers of conformations that are useful for developing
	protein mechanisms; while these are typically small motions, for
	some proteins they can be quite large in scale. One of the major
	advantages of the approach is that only relatively small numbers
	of modes are important contributors to the overall motion -- so the
	approach provides a way to systematically map out a protein's motions.
	These models successfully represent the conformational fluctuations
	manifested in the crystallographic B-factors, and often suggest motions
	related to protein functional behaviors, such as those observed for
	reverse transcriptase, where two dominant hinges clearly relate to
	the processing steps -- one showing anti-correlation between the
	polymerase and ribonuclease H sites related to the translation and
	positioning of the nucleic acid chain, and another for opening and
	closing the polymerase site. Disordered proteins represent a more
	extreme case where the set of accessible conformations is much larger;
	thus they could offer up a broader range of possible binding forms.
	Whether evolution controls the functional motions for proteins remains
	little studied. Intriguingly, buried in the existing databases of
	protein-protein interactions may be information that can shed light
	on the extent of promiscuous binding among proteins themselves. Within
	these data there are cases where large numbers of diverse proteins
	have been shown to interact with a single protein; some of these
	could represent promiscuous protein-protein binding. Uncovering these
	promiscuous behaviors could be important for comprehending the details
	of how proteins can bind promiscuously to one another, and can exhibit
	even greater promiscuity in their binding to small molecules. The
	evolutionary routes, the dynamics of the target protein, and the
	many other aspects that need to be addressed while designing a drug
	that may dodge drug resistance, indicate the complexity and multi-disciplinary
	nature of the issue of drug resistance.},

  pages = {1531--1545},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly
	coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent
	to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution
	of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates
	within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations,
	while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model
	further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire
	a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members
	of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the
	old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion
	of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model.
	Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the
	evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum.
	Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show
	how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory
	elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both
	duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution
	of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation
	(DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory
	elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate
	gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation
	is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution
	of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis
	of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent
	with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental
	approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene
	subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to
	be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.
	For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of
	the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous
	regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an
	advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable,
	function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial
	protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional
	mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively,
	a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a
	pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if
	mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that
	is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus
	overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention
	of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition
	of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying
	opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension
	of development itself. Cooke et al. 1997 (p. 362)},

	onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological
	communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary
	around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes.
	A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process
	follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections
	of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness;
	species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These
	neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature.
	In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can
	understand why these neutral generative models are so successful.
	I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson
	pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic
	pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model.
	The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe
	the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information.
	For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information
	only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern;
	any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts
	to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information
	only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern.
	I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the
	common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy.
	This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special
	case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints;
	those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral
	generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.},

  abstract = {With the aim of understanding the concerted evolution of the immunoglobulin
	VH multigene family, a phylogenetic tree for the DNA sequences of
	16 mouse and five human germ line genes was constructed. This tree
	indicates that all genes in this family have undergone substantial
	evolutionary divergence. The most closely related genes so far identified
	in the mouse genome seem to have diverged about 6 million years (MY)
	ago, whereas the most distantly related genes diverged about 300
	MY ago. This suggests that gene duplication caused by unequal crossing-over
	or gene conversion occurs very slowly in this gene family. The rate
	of occurrence of gene duplication in the VH gene family has been
	estimated to be 5 x 10(-7) per gene per year, which seems to be at
	least about 100 times lower than that for the rRNA gene family. This
	low rate of concerted evolution in the VH gene family helps retain
	intergenic genetic variability that in turn contributes to antibody
	diversity. Because of accumulation of destructive mutations, however,
	about one-third of the mouse and human VH genes seem to have become

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exploring metabolic evolution is a way to understand metabolic
	complexity. The substrate transport of mitochondrial carrier family
	(MCF) influences direct metabolic activities, making it possible
	to understand indirectly metabolic evolution from the evolution of
	substrate transport of MCF. However, the evolutionary study of substrate
	transport of MCF does not mean that all the concrete structures of
	mitochondrial carriers (MCs) must first be gained. RESULTS: Here
	we studied the alternation of MCF structure and potential correlated
	functions of MCF during metazoan evolution. The data analysis indicates
	that the types of substrates transported by MCF as a whole were maintained
	during metazoan evolution. However, the size of the substrates transported
	by members of MCs continuously diminished during the evolutionary
	process. We have found that the ratio of hydrophobic amino acids
	at specific helix-helix interfaces increases significantly during
	vertebrate evolution. Amino acid's spatial positioning and the calculating
	of packing values both indicate the increase in the number of hydrophobic
	amino acids would lead to a more "tight" structure of the TR domain,
	which is in agreement with the trend of diminishing size of substrates
	transported by MCs. In addition, there was a significant increase
	in the number of carriers of MCF during vertebrate evolution. CONCLUSIONS:
	We propose that the more "tight" TR structure generated by the increase
	of the hydrophobic amino acids at specific helix-helix interfaces
	during vertebrate evolution enhances the substrate selectivity of
	MCF, reflecting the evolutionary trajectory of MCF during metazoan
	evolution.},

  abstract = {DNA duplication is one of the main forces acting on the evolution
	of organisms because it creates the raw genetic material that natural
	selection can subsequently modify. Duplicated regions are mainly
	due to "errors" in different phases of meiosis, but DNA transposable
	elements and reverse transcription also contribute to amplify and
	move the genomic material to different genomic locations. As a result,
	redundancy affects genomes to variable degrees: from the single gene
	to the whole genome (WGD). Gene families are clusters of genes created
	by duplication and their size reflects the number of duplicated genes,
	called paralogs, in each species. The aim of this review is to describe
	the state of the art in the identification and analysis of gene families
	in eukaryotes, with specific attention to those generated by ancient
	large scale events in vertebrates (WGD or large segmental duplications).
	As a case study, we report our work on the evolution of gene families
	encoding subunits of the five OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation)
	complexes, fundamental and highly conserved in all respiring cells.
	Although OXPHOS gene families are smaller than the general trend
	in nuclear gene families, some exceptions are observed, such as three
	gene families with at least two paralogs in vertebrates. These gene
	families encode cytochrome c (Cyt c, the electron shuttle protein
	between complex III and IV), Lipid Binding Protein (LBP, the channel
	protein of complex V which transfers protons through the inner mitochondrial
	membrane) and the MLRQ subunit (MLRQ, a supernumerary subunit of
	the large complex I, with unknown function). We provide a two-step
	approach, based on structural genomic data, to demonstrate that these
	gene families should have arisen through WGD (or large segmental
	duplication) events at the origin of vertebrates and, only afterwards,
	underwent species-specific events of further gene duplications and
	loss. In summary, this review reflects the need to apply genome comparative
	approaches, deriving from both "classical" molecular phylogenetic
	analysis and "new" genome map analysis, to successfully define the
	complex evolutionary relations between gene family members which,
	in turn, are essential to obtain any other comparative phylogenetic

	another fundamental distribution, that of the substitution rates

  journal = {BMC Genomics},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {69},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a large family of
	proteins that function in a variety of key regulatory pathways in
	eukaryotic cells, including control over the cell cycle and gene
	transcription. Among the most important and broadly studied of these
	roles is reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD)
	of RNA polymerase II, part of a complex array of CTD/protein interactions
	that coordinate the RNAP II transcription cycle. The RNAP CTD is
	strongly conserved in some groups of eukaryotes, but highly degenerate
	or absent in others; the reasons for these differences in stabilizing
	selection on CTD structure are not clear. Given the importance of
	reversible phosphorylation for CTD-based transcription, the distribution
	and evolutionary history of CDKs may be a key to understanding differences
	in constraints on CTD structure; however, the origins and evolutionary
	relationships of CTD kinases have not been investigated thoroughly.
	Moreover, although the functions of most CDKs are reasonably well
	studied in mammals and yeasts, very little is known from most other
	eukaryotes. RESULTS: Here we identify 123 CDK family members from
	animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which genome sequences
	have been completed, and 10 additional CDKs from incomplete genome
	sequences of organisms with known CTD sequences. Comparative genomic
	and phylogenetic analyses suggest that cell-cycle CDKs are present
	in all organisms sampled in this study. In contrast, no clear orthologs
	of transcription-related CDKs are identified in the most putatively
	ancestral eukaryotes, Trypanosoma or Giardia. Kinases involved in
	CTD phosphorylation, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9, all are recovered as well-supported
	and distinct orthologous families, but their relationships to each
	other and other CDKs are not well-resolved. Significantly, clear
	orthologs of CDK7 and CDK8 are restricted to only those organisms
	belonging to groups in which the RNAP II CTD is strongly conserved.
	CONCLUSIONS: The apparent origins of CDK7 and CDK8, or at least their
	conservation as clearly recognizable orthologous families, correlate
	with strong stabilizing selection on RNAP II CTD structure. This
	suggests co-evolution of the CTD and these CTD-directed CDKs. This
	observation is consistent with the hypothesis that CDK7 and CDK8
	originated at about the same time that the CTD was canalized as the
	staging platform RNAP II transcription. Alternatively, extensive
	CTD phosphorylation may occur in only a subset of eukaryotes and,
	when present, this interaction results in greater stabilizing selection
	on both CTD and CDK sequences. Overall, our results suggest that
	transcription-related kinases originated after cell-cycle related
	CDKs, and became more evolutionarily and functionally diverse as
	transcriptional complexity increased.},

	source of molecular evolution, gene gain and loss, is accelerated
	in primates relative to other mammals. Using a novel method that
	allows estimation of rate heterogeneity among lineages, we find that
	the rate of gene turnover in humans is more than 2.5 times faster
	than in other mammals and may be due to both mutational and selective
	forces. By reconciling the gene trees for all of the gene families

	the genome assembly of rhesus macaque to further verify our results.
	Our analyses identify several gene families that have expanded or
	contracted more rapidly than is expected even after accounting for
	an overall rate acceleration in primates, including brain-related
	families that have more than doubled in size in humans. Many of the
	families showing large expansions also show evidence for positive
	selection on their nucleotide sequences, suggesting that selection
	has been important in shaping copy-number differences among mammals.
	These findings may help explain why humans and chimpanzees show high

  abstract = {Comparison of whole genomes has revealed large and frequent changes
	in the size of gene families. These changes occur because of high
	rates of both gene gain (via duplication) and loss (via deletion
	or pseudogenization), as well as the evolution of entirely new genes.
	Here we use the genomes of 12 fully sequenced Drosophila species
	to study the gain and loss of genes at unprecedented resolution.
	We find large numbers of both gains and losses, with over 40\% of
	all gene families differing in size among the Drosophila. Approximately
	17 genes are estimated to be duplicated and fixed in a genome every
	million years, a rate on par with that previously found in both yeast
	and mammals. We find many instances of extreme expansions or contractions
	in the size of gene families, including the expansion of several
	sex- and spermatogenesis-related families in D. melanogaster that
	also evolve under positive selection at the nucleotide level. Newly
	evolved gene families in our dataset are associated with a class
	of testes-expressed genes known to have evolved de novo in a number
	of cases. Gene family comparisons also allow us to identify a number
	of annotated D. melanogaster genes that are unlikely to encode functional
	proteins, as well as to identify dozens of previously unannotated
	D. melanogaster genes with conserved homologs in the other Drosophila.
	Taken together, our results demonstrate that the apparent stasis
	in total gene number among species has masked rapid turnover in individual
	gene gain and loss. It is likely that this genomic revolving door
	has played a large role in shaping the morphological, physiological,
	and metabolic differences among species.},

  abstract = {"Chronoastrobiology: are we at the threshold of a new science? Is
	there a critical mass for scientific research?" A simple photograph
	of the planet earth from outer space was one of the greatest contributions
	of space exploration. It drove home in a glance that human survival
	depends upon the wobbly dynamics in a thin and fragile skin of water
	and gas that covers a small globe in a mostly cold and vast universe.
	This image raised the stakes in understanding our place in that universe,
	in finding out where we came from and in choosing a path for survival.
	Since that landmark photograph was taken, new astronomical and biomedical
	information and growing computer power have been revealing that organic
	life, including human life, is and has been connected to invisible
	(non-photic) forces, in that vast universe in some surprising ways.
	Every cell in our body is bathed in an external and internal environment
	of fluctuating magnetism. It is becoming clear that the fluctuations
	are primarily caused by an intimate and systematic interplay between
	forces within the bowels of the earth--which the great physician
	and father of magnetism William Gilbert called a 'small magnet'--and
	the thermonuclear turbulence within the sun, an enormously larger
	magnet than the earth, acting upon organisms, which are minuscule
	magnets. It follows and is also increasingly apparent that these
	external fluctuations in magnetic fields can affect virtually every
	circuit in the biological machinery to a lesser or greater degree,
	depending both on the particular biological system and on the particular
	properties of the magnetic fluctuations. The development of high
	technology instruments and computer power, already used to visualize
	the human heart and brain, is furthermore making it obvious that
	there is a statistically predictable time structure to the fluctuations
	in the sun's thermonuclear turbulence and thus to its magnetic interactions
	with the earth's own magnetic field and hence a time structure to
	the magnetic fields in organisms. Likewise in humans, and in at least
	those other species that have been studied, computer power has enabled
	us to discover statistically defined endogenous physiological rhythms
	and further direct effects that are associated with these invisible
	geo- and heliomagnetic cycles. Thus, what once might have been dismissed
	as noise in both magnetic and physiological data does in fact have
	structure. And we may be at the threshold of understanding the biological
	and medical meaning and consequences of these patterns and biological-astronomical
	linkages as well. Structures in time are called chronomes; their
	mapping in us and around us is called chronomics. The scientific
	study of chronomes is chronobiology. And the scientific study of
	all aspects of biology related to the cosmos has been called astrobiology.
	Hence we may dub the new study of time structures in biology with
	regard to influences from cosmo- helio- and geomagnetic rhythms chronoastrobiology.
	It has, of course, been understood for centuries that the movements
	of the earth in relation to the sun produce seasonal and daily cycles
	in light energy and that these have had profound effects on the evolution
	of life. It is now emerging that rhythmic events generated from within
	the sun itself, as a large turbulent magnet in its own right, can
	have direct effects upon life on earth. Moreover, comparative studies
	of diverse species indicate that there have also been ancient evolutionary
	effects shaping the endogenous chronomic physiological characteristics
	of life. Thus the rhythms of the sun can affect us not only directly,
	but also indirectly through the chronomic patterns that solar magnetic
	rhythms have created within our physiology in the remote past. For
	example, we can document the direct exogenous effects of given specific
	solar wind events upon human blood pressure and heart rate. We also
	have evidence of endogenous internal rhythms in blood pressure and
	heart rate that are close to but not identical to the period length
	of rhythms in the solar wind. These were installed genetically by
	natural selection at some time in the distant geological past. This
	interpretive model of the data makes the prediction that the internal
	and external influences on heart rate and blood pressure can reinforce
	or cancel each other out at different times. A study of extensive
	clinical and physiological data shows that the interpretive model
	is robust and that internal and external effects are indeed augmentative
	at a statistically significant level. Chronoastrobiological studies
	are contributing to basic science--that is, our understanding is
	being expanded as we recognize heretofore unelaborated linkages of
	life to the complex dynamics of the sun, and even to heretofore unelaborated
	evolutionary phenomena. Once, one might have thought of solar storms
	as mere transient 'perturbations' to biology, with no lasting importance.
	Now we are on the brink of understanding that solar turbulences have
	played a role in shaping endogenous physiological chronomes. There
	is even documentation for correlations between solar magnetic cycles
	and psychological swings, eras of belligerence and of certain expressions
	of sacred or religious feelings. Chronoastrobiology can surely contribute
	to practical applications as well as to basic science. It can help
	develop refinements in our ability to live safely in outer space,
	where for example at the distance of the moon the magnetic influences
	of the sun will have an effect upon humans unshielded by the earth's
	native magnetic field. We should be better able to understand these
	influences as physiological and mechanical challenges, and to improve
	our estimations of the effects of exposure. Chronoastrobiology moreover
	holds great promise in broadening our perspectives and powers in
	medicine and public health right here upon the surface of the earth.
	Even the potential relevance of chronoastrobiology for practical
	environmental and agricultural challenges cannot be ruled out at
	this early stage in our understanding of the apparently ubiquitous
	effects of magnetism and hence perhaps of solar magnetism on life.
	The evidence already mentioned that fluctuations in solar magnetism
	can influence gross clinical phenomena such as rates of strokes and
	heart attacks, and related cardiovascular variables such as blood
	pressure and heart rate, should illustrate the point that the door
	is open to broad studies of clinical implications. The medical value
	of better understanding magnetic fluctuations as sources of variability
	in human physiology falls into several categories: 1) The design
	of improved analytical and experimental controls in medical research.
	Epidemiological analyses require that the multiple sources causing
	variability in physiological functions and clinical phenomena be
	identified and understood as thoroughly as possible, in order to
	estimate systematic alterations of any one variable. 2) Preventive
	medicine and the individual patients'care. There are no flat 'baselines',
	only reference chronomes. Magnetic fluctuations can be shown statistically
	to exacerbate health problems in some cases. The next step should
	be to determine whether vulnerable individuals can be identified
	by individual monitoring. Such vulnerable patients may then discover
	that they have the option to avoid circumstances associated with
	anxiety during solar storms, and/or pay special attention to their
	medication or other treatments. Prehabilitation by self-help can
	hopefully complement and eventually replace much costly rehabilitation.
	3) Basic understanding of human physiological mechanisms. The chronomic
	organization of physiology implies a much more subtle dynamic integration
	of functions than is generally appreciated. All three categories
	of medical value in turn pertain to the challenges for space science
	of exploring and colonizing the solar system. The earth's native
	magnetic field acts like an enormous umbrella that offers considerable
	protection on the surface from harsh solar winds of charged particles
	and magnetic fluxes. The umbrella becomes weaker with distance from
	the earth and will offer little protection for humans, other animals,
	and plants in colonies on the surface of the moon or beyond. Thus
	it is important before more distant colonization is planned or implemented
	to better understand those magnetism-related biological- solar interactions
	that now can be studied conveniently on earth. Thorough lifelong
	maps of chronomes should be generated and made available to the scientific
	world. Individual workers should not have to rediscover cycles and
	rhythms, which can be a confusing source of variation when ignored.
	By contrast, once mapped, the endpoints of a spectral element in
	chronomes can serve everybody, for instance for the detection of
	an elevation of vascular disease risk. Chronomic cartography from
	birth to death is a task for governments to implement, thereby serving
	the interests of transdisciplinary science and the general public
	alike. Governments have supported the systematic gathering of physical
	data for nearly two centuries on earth in order to serve exploration,
	trade, and battle on land and on the seas, and indeed agriculture.
	These government functions have been augmented enormously with satellite
	technology in more recent decades. The biological comparison with
	regard to government support and chronomic needs would be the mapping
	of the human genome. The complete sequences of DNA might have eventually
	become available due simply to countless individual laboratories
	publishing piecemeal results in scattered journals. But there would
	have been enormous redundancy and confusion in assembling and piecing
	the information together. The waste of time and money involved in
	the redundancy and confusion would have been considerable. (ABSTRACT

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low nucleotide divergence between human and chimpanzee
	does not sufficiently explain the species-specific morphological,
	physiological and behavioral traits. As gene duplication is a major
	prerequisite for the emergence of new genes and novel biological
	processes, comparative studies of human and chimpanzee duplicated
	genes may assist in understanding the mechanisms behind primate evolution.
	We addressed the divergence between human and chimpanzee duplicated
	genomic regions by using Luteinizing Hormone Beta (LHB)/Chorionic
	Gonadotropin Beta (CGB) gene cluster as a model. The placental CGB
	genes that are essential for implantation have evolved from an ancestral
	pituitary LHB gene by duplications in the primate lineage. RESULTS:
	We shotgun sequenced and compared the human (45,165 bp) and chimpanzee
	(39,876 bp) LHB/CGB regions and hereby present evidence for structural
	variation resulting in discordant number of CGB genes (6 in human,
	5 in chimpanzee). The scenario of species-specific parallel duplications
	was supported (i) as the most parsimonious solution requiring the
	least rearrangement events to explain the interspecies structural
	differences; (ii) by the phylogenetic trees constructed with fragments
	of intergenic regions; (iii) by the sequence similarity calculations.
	Across the orthologous regions of LHB/CGB cluster, substitutions
	and indels contributed approximately equally to the interspecies
	divergence and the distribution of nucleotide identity was correlated
	with the regional repeat content. Intraspecies gene conversion may
	have shaped the LHB/CGB gene cluster. The substitution divergence
	(1.8-2.59\%) exceeded two-three fold the estimates for single-copy
	loci and the fraction of transversional mutations was increased compared
	to the unique sequences (43\% versus approximately 30\%). Despite
	the high sequence identity among LHB/CGB genes, there are signs of
	functional differentiation among the gene copies. Estimates for dn/ds
	rate ratio suggested a purifying selection on LHB and CGB8, and a
	positive evolution of CGB1. CONCLUSION: If generalized, our data
	suggests that in addition to species-specific deletions and duplications,
	parallel duplication events may have contributed to genetic differences
	separating humans from their closest relatives. Compared to unique
	genomic segments, duplicated regions are characterized by high divergence
	promoted by intraspecies gene conversion and species-specific chromosomal
	rearrangements, including the alterations in gene copy number.},

  volume = {9},
  pages = {609},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One mechanism to account for robustness against gene knockouts
	or knockdowns is through buffering by gene duplicates, but the extent
	and general correlates of this process in organisms is still a matter
	of debate. To reveal general trends of this process, we provide a
	comprehensive comparison of gene essentiality, duplication and buffering
	by duplicates across seven bacteria (Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus
	subtilis, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium
	tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), and four
	eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans
	(worm), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), Mus musculus (mouse)). RESULTS:
	In nine of the eleven organisms, duplicates significantly increase
	chances of survival upon gene deletion (P-value < or = 0.05), but
	only by up to 13\%. Given that duplicates make up to 80\% of eukaryotic
	genomes, the small contribution is surprising and points to dominant
	roles of other buffering processes, such as alternative metabolic
	pathways. The buffering capacity of duplicates appears to be independent
	of the degree of gene essentiality and tends to be higher for genes
	with high expression levels. For example, buffering capacity increases
	to 23\% amongst highly expressed genes in E. coli. Sequence similarity
	and the number of duplicates per gene are weak predictors of the
	duplicate's buffering capacity. In a case study we show that buffering
	gene duplicates in yeast and worm are somewhat more similar in their
	functions than non-buffering duplicates and have increased transcriptional
	and translational activity. CONCLUSION: In sum, the extent of gene
	essentiality and buffering by duplicates is not conserved across
	organisms and does not correlate with the organisms' apparent complexity.
	This heterogeneity goes beyond what would be expected from differences
	in experimental approaches alone. Buffering by duplicates contributes
	to robustness in several organisms, but to a small extent--and the
	relatively large amount of buffering by duplicates observed in yeast
	and worm may be largely specific to these organisms. Thus, the only
	common factor of buffering by duplicates between different organisms
	may be the by-product of duplicate retention due to demands of high
	dosage.},

	Unfortunately, the information of truncated genes has not been considered

	Systematic overestimation of gene gain through false diagnosis of

	The presence of truncated genes or false diagnosis of gene absence

	have been employed to study the dynamic process of gene insertions

	Previous maximum likelihood studies have assumed that the rate of
	gene insertions/deletions is constant over different genes. This
	assumption is unrealistic. For instance, it has been shown that informational
	genes are less likely to be laterally transferred than non-informational
	genes. However, how much of the variation in gene transfer rates
	is due to the difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is unclear. In this study, a Gamma-distribution was incorporated
	in the likelihood estimation by considering rate variation for gene
	insertions/deletions between genes. This makes it possible to address
	whether a difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is the main contributor to rate variation of lateral gene transfers.The
	results show that models incorporating rate variation fit the data
	better than do constant rate models in many phylogenetic groups.
	Even though informational genes are less likely to be laterally transferred
	than non-informational genes, the degree of rate variation for insertions/deletions
	did not change dramatically and remained high even when informational
	genes were excluded from the study. This suggests that the variation
	in rate of insertions/deletions is not due mainly to the simple difference
	between informational genes and non-informational genes. Among genes
	that are not classified as informational and among the informational
	genes themselves, there are still large differences in the rates
	that these genes are inserted and deleted.While the difference in
	informational gene rates contributes to rate variation, it is only
	a small fraction of the variation present; instead, a substantial
	amount of rate variation for insertions/deletions remains among both
	informational genes and among non-informational genes.},

  abstract = {Protein families can be used to understand many aspects of genomes,
	both their "live" and their "dead" parts (i.e. genes and pseudogenes).
	Surveys of genomes have revealed that, in every organism, there are
	always a few large families and many small ones, with the overall
	distribution following a power-law. This commonality is equally true
	for both genes and pseudogenes, and exists despite the fact that
	the specific families that are enlarged differ greatly between organisms.
	Furthermore, because of family structure there is great redundancy
	in proteomes, a fact linked to the large number of dispensable genes
	for each organism and the small size of the minimal, indispensable
	sub-proteome. Pseudogenes in prokaryotes represent families that
	are in the process of being dispensed with. In particular, the genome
	sequences of certain pathogenic bacteria (Mycobacterium leprae, Yersinia
	pestis and Rickettsia prowazekii) show how an organism can undergo
	reductive evolution on a large scale (i.e. the dying out of families)
	as a result of niche change. There appears to be less pressure to
	delete pseudogenes in eukaryotes. These can be divided into two varieties,
	duplicated and processed, where the latter involves reverse transcription
	from an mRNA intermediate. We discuss these collectively in yeast,
	worm, fly, and human. The fly has few pseudogenes apparently because
	of its high rate of genomic DNA deletion. In the other three organisms,
	the distribution of pseudogenes on the chromosome and amongst different
	families is highly non-uniform. Pseudogenes tend not to occur in
	the middle of chromosome arms, and tend to be associated with lineage-specific
	(as opposed to highly conserved) families that have environmental-response
	functions. This may be because, rather than being dead, they may
	form a reservoir of diverse "extra parts" that can be resurrected
	to help an organism adapt to its surroundings. In yeast, there may
	be a novel mechanism involving the [PSI+] prion that potentially
	enables this resurrection. In worm, the pseudogenes tend to arise
	out of families (e.g. chemoreceptors) that are greatly expanded in
	it compared to the fly. The human genome stands out in having many
	processed pseudogenes. These have a character very different from
	those of the duplicated variety, to a large extent just representing
	random insertions. Thus, their occurrence tends to be roughly in
	proportion to the amount of mRNA for a particular protein and to
	reflect the extent of the intergenic sequences. Further information

	cluster coefficient (<C>) is much higher than in a random network,
	but the average shortest path length (<L>) is similar between the
	two networks. To understand the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the
	structure of PINs, simulation studies using various network growth
	models have been performed. It has been reported that the heterodimerization
	(HD) model, in which a new link is added between duplicated nodes
	with a uniform probability, could reproduce scale-freeness and a
	high <C>. In this paper, however, we show that the HD model is unsatisfactory,
	because (i) to reproduce the high <C> in the yeast PIN, a much larger
	number (n(HI)) of HD links (links between duplicated nodes) are required
	than the estimated number of n(HI) in the yeast PIN and (ii) the
	spatial distribution of triangles in the yeast PIN is highly skewed
	but the HD model cannot reproduce the skewed distribution. To resolve
	these discrepancies, we here propose a new model named the non-uniform
	heterodimerization (NHD) model. In this model, an HD link is preferentially
	attached between duplicated nodes when they share many common neighbors.
	Simulation studies demonstrated that the NHD model can successfully
	reproduce the high <C>, the low n(HI), and the skewed distribution
	of triangles in the yeast PIN. These results suggest that the survival
	rate of HD links is not uniform in the evolution of PINs, and that
	an HD link between high-degree nodes tends to be evolutionarily conservative.
	The non-uniform survival rate of HD links can be explained by assuming
	a low mutation rate for a high-degree node, and thus this model appears
	to be biologically plausible.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A protein-protein interaction network (PIN)
	was suggested to be a disassortative network, in which interactions
	between high- and low-degree nodes are favored while hub-hub interactions
	are suppressed. It was postulated that a disassortative structure
	minimizes unfavorable cross-talks between different hub-centric functional
	modules and was positively selected in evolution. However, by re-examining
	yeast PIN data, several researchers reported that the disassortative
	structure observed in a PIN might be an experimental artifact. Therefore,
	the existence of a disassortative structure and its possible evolutionary
	mechanism remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated
	PINs from the yeast, worm, fly, human, and malaria parasite including
	four different yeast PIN datasets. The analyses showed that the yeast,
	worm, fly, and human PINs are disassortative while the malaria parasite
	PIN is not. By conducting simulation studies on the basis of a duplication-divergence
	model, we demonstrated that a preferential duplication of low- and
	high-degree nodes can generate disassortative and non-disassortative
	networks, respectively. From this observation, we hypothesized that
	the difference in degree dependence on gene duplications accounts
	for the difference in assortativity of PINs among species. Comparison
	of 55 proteomes in eukaryotes revealed that genes with lower degrees
	showed higher gene duplicabilities in the yeast, worm, and fly, while
	high-degree genes tend to have high duplicabilities in the malaria
	parasite, supporting the above hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results
	suggest that disassortative structures observed in PINs are merely
	a byproduct of preferential duplications of low-degree genes, which
	might be caused by an organism's living environment.},

	abundant tRNAs (translational efficiency), (ii) preferentially use
	amino acids with low cost of synthesis, (iii) be under stronger selection
	to maintain the required amino acid content, and (iv) be selected
	for translational robustness. These effects act simultaneously and
	can be contradictory. We develop a model that combines these factors,
	and use Akaike's Information Criterion for model selection. We consider
	pairs of paralogues that arose by whole-genome duplication in Saccharmyces
	cerevisiae. A codon-based model is used that includes asymmetric
	effects due to selection on highly expressed genes. The largest effect
	is translational efficiency, which is found to strongly influence
	synonymous, but not non-synonymous rates. Minimization of the cost
	of amino acid synthesis is implicated. However, when a more general
	measure of selection for amino acid usage is used, the cost minimization
	effect becomes redundant. Small effects that we attribute to selection
	for translational robustness can be identified as an improvement
	in the model fit on top of the effects of translational efficiency
	and amino acid usage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phylum Verrucomicrobia is a widespread but poorly
	characterized bacterial clade. Although cultivation-independent approaches
	detect representatives of this phylum in a wide range of environments,
	including soils, seawater, hot springs and human gastrointestinal
	tract, only few have been isolated in pure culture. We have recently
	reported cultivation and initial characterization of an extremely
	acidophilic methanotrophic member of the Verrucomicrobia, strain
	V4, isolated from the Hell's Gate geothermal area in New Zealand.
	Similar organisms were independently isolated from geothermal systems
	in Italy and Russia. RESULTS: We report the complete genome sequence
	of strain V4, the first one from a representative of the Verrucomicrobia.
	Isolate V4, initially named "Methylokorus infernorum" (and recently
	renamed Methylacidiphilum infernorum) is an autotrophic bacterium
	with a streamlined genome of ~2.3 Mbp that encodes simple signal
	transduction pathways and has a limited potential for regulation
	of gene expression. Central metabolism of M. infernorum was reconstructed
	almost completely and revealed highly interconnected pathways of
	autotrophic central metabolism and modifications of C1-utilization
	pathways compared to other known methylotrophs. The M. infernorum
	genome does not encode tubulin, which was previously discovered in
	bacteria of the genus Prosthecobacter, or close homologs of any other
	signature eukaryotic proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal
	proteins and RNA polymerase subunits unequivocally supports grouping
	Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae into a single clade,
	the PVC superphylum, despite dramatically different gene content
	in members of these three groups. Comparative-genomic analysis suggests
	that evolution of the M. infernorum lineage involved extensive horizontal
	gene exchange with a variety of bacteria. The genome of M. infernorum
	shows apparent adaptations for existence under extremely acidic conditions
	including a major upward shift in the isoelectric points of proteins.
	CONCLUSION: The results of genome analysis of M. infernorum support
	the monophyly of the PVC superphylum. M. infernorum possesses a streamlined
	genome but seems to have acquired numerous genes including those
	for enzymes of methylotrophic pathways via horizontal gene transfer,
	in particular, from Proteobacteria. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed

	at 1,300-m depth on the Loihi submarine volcano, Hawaii. The I. loihiensis
	genome comprises a single chromosome of 2,839,318 base pairs, encoding
	2,640 proteins, four rRNA operons, and 56 tRNA genes. A comparison
	of I. loihiensis to the genomes of other gamma-proteobacteria reveals
	abundance of amino acid transport and degradation enzymes, but a
	loss of sugar transport systems and certain enzymes of sugar metabolism.
	This finding suggests that I. loihiensis relies primarily on amino
	acid catabolism, rather than on sugar fermentation, for carbon and
	energy. Enzymes for biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, the majority
	of amino acids, and coenzymes are encoded in the genome, but biosynthetic
	pathways for Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, and Met are incomplete. Auxotrophy
	for Val and Thr was confirmed by in vivo experiments. The I. loihiensis
	genome contains a cluster of 32 genes encoding enzymes for exopolysaccharide
	and capsular polysaccharide synthesis. It also encodes diverse peptidases,
	a variety of peptide and amino acid uptake systems, and versatile
	signal transduction machinery. We propose that the source of amino
	acids for I. loihiensis growth are the proteinaceous particles present
	in the deep sea hydrothermal vent waters. I. loihiensis would colonize
	these particles by using the secreted exopolysaccharide, digest these
	proteins, and metabolize the resulting peptides and amino acids.
	In summary, the I. loihiensis genome reveals an integrated mechanism

  pages = {S14},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: How gene duplication has influenced the evolution of gene
	networks is one of the core problems in evolution. Current duplication-divergence
	theories generally suggested that genes on the periphery of the networks
	were preferentially retained after gene duplication. However, previous
	studies were mostly based on gene networks in invertebrate species,
	and they had the inherent shortcoming of not being able to provide
	information on how the duplication-divergence process proceeded along
	the time axis during major speciation events. RESULTS: In this study,
	we constructed a model system consisting of human G protein-coupled
	receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream genes in the GPCR pathways.
	These two groups of genes offered a natural partition of genes in
	the peripheral and the backbone layers of the network. Analysis of
	the age distributions of the duplication events in human GPCRs and
	"downstream genes" gene families indicated that they both experienced
	an explosive expansion at the time of early vertebrate emergence.
	However, we found only GPCR families saw a continued expansion after
	early vertebrates, mostly prominently in several small subfamilies
	of GPCRs involved in immune responses and sensory responses. CONCLUSION:
	In general, in the human GPCR model system, we found that the position
	of a gene in the gene networks has significant influences on the
	likelihood of fixation of its duplicates. However, for a super gene
	family, the influence was not uniform among subfamilies. For super
	families, such as GPCRs, whose gene basis of expression diversity
	was well established at early vertebrates, continued expansions were
	mostly prominent in particular small subfamilies mainly involved
	in lineage-specific functions.},

	duplicate genes from the tetraploid frog Xenopus laevis suggests
	that such genes are subject to purifying selection and are thus not
	free to accumulate substitutions at random; (ii) in a number of multi-gene
	families, there is now evidence that functionally distinct proteins
	have arisen not as a result of chance fixation of neutral variants
	but rather as a result of positive Darwinian selection; and (iii)
	the phenomenon of gene sharing, in which a single gene encodes a
	protein having two distinct functions, shows that gene duplication
	is not a necessary prerequisite to the evolution of a new protein
	function. A model for the evolution of new protein is proposed under
	which a period of gene sharing ordinarily precedes the evolution
	of functionally distinct proteins. Gene duplication then allows each
	daughter gene to specialize for one of the functions of the ancestral
	gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	network from Caenorhabditis elegans. In both networks, genes belonging
	to gene families represented by a single member in the genome ("singletons")
	were disproportionately represented among the nodes having large

	or more network connections, 28 (44.4\%) were located in duplicated
	genomic segments believed to have originated from an ancient polyploidization

	major "hubs" with a large number of connections, tended to be relatively
	sparsely interconnected among themselves. Furthermore, duplicated

	We tested this hypothesis by phylogenetic analysis of 42 gene families

	In 32 of these families there was evidence against the hypothesis
	that gene duplication occurred simultaneously with duplication of

	of one or more gene duplications before the origin of vertebrates,
	and of 15 gene duplication times estimated for gene families evolving

	Furthermore, of gene families duplicated around the same time as

	their having duplicated simultaneously with the Hox clusters. The

	A comparison of the repertoires of DDIs in the networks of Escherichia

  abstract = {Recently Mycobacterium tuberculosis was shown to possess a novel protein
	modification, in which a small protein Pup is conjugated to the epsilon-amino
	groups of lysines in target proteins. Analogous to ubiquitin modification
	in eukaryotes, this remarkable modification recruits proteins for
	degradation via archaeal-type proteasomes found in mycobacteria and
	allied actinobacteria. While a mycobacterial protein named PafA was
	found to be required for this conjugation reaction, its biochemical
	mechanism has not been elucidated. Using sensitive sequence profile
	comparison methods we establish that the PafA family proteins are
	related to the gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase and glutamine synthetase.
	Hence, we predict that PafA is the Pup ligase, which catalyzes the
	ATP-dependent ligation of the terminal gamma-carboxylate of glutamate
	to lysines, similar to the above enzymes. We further discovered that
	an ortholog of the eukaryotic PAC2 (e.g. cg2106) is often present
	in the vicinity of the actinobacterial Pup-proteasome gene neighborhoods
	and is likely to represent the ancestral proteasomal chaperone. Pup-conjugation
	is sporadically present outside the actinobacteria in certain lineages,

	and in the latter two lineages it might modify membrane proteins.REVIEWERS:This

	on clusters of orthologous protein sequences from complete bacterial
	genomes (Chlamydia trachomatis, C. muridarum and Chlamydophila pneumoniae),
	complete archaeal genomes (Pyrococcus horikoshii, P. abyssi and P.
	furiosus) and partially sequenced mammalian genomes (human, mouse
	and rat). RESULTS: Amino-acid sequence evolution rates are significantly
	correlated on different branches of phylogenetic trees representing
	the great majority of analyzed orthologous protein sets from all
	three domains of life. However, approximately 1\% of the proteins
	from each group of species deviates from this pattern and instead
	shows variation that is consistent with an acceleration of the rate
	of amino-acid substitution, which may be due to functional diversification.
	Most of the putative functionally diversified proteins from all three
	species groups are predicted to function at the periphery of the
	cells and mediate their interaction with the environment. CONCLUSIONS:
	Relative rates of protein evolution are remarkably constant for the
	three species groups analyzed here. Deviations from this rate constancy
	are probably due to changes in selective constraints associated with
	diversification between orthologs. Functional diversification between
	orthologs is thought to be a relatively rare event. However, the
	resolution afforded by the test designed specifically for genomic-scale
	datasets allowed us to identify numerous cases of possible functional
	diversification between orthologous proteins.},

	comprise a substantial fraction (approximately 5\%-33\%) of their

	of the genes taken up by lineage-specific expansions and the total
	number of genes in a genome. Consistent with the notion that lineage-specific
	expansions are made up of relatively recently duplicated genes, >90\%
	of the detected clusters consists of only two to four genes. The

	similarity (as reflected by average score density) than larger clusters.
	Regardless of size, cluster members tend to be located more closely

	The topology of a human gene coexpression network, derived from tissue-specific

	self-organization via preferential node attachment. Genes with numerous

	the strength of selective constraints on gene sequences is affected
	by the topology of the gene coexpression network. This connection
	is strong for the coding regions and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs),
	but the 5' UTRs appear to evolve under a different regime. Surprisingly,
	we found no connection between the rate of gene sequence divergence
	and the extent of gene expression profile divergence between human

  year = {2004},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {22},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplication is an important mechanism that can lead
	to the emergence of new functions during evolution. The impact of
	duplication on the mode of gene evolution has been the subject of
	several theoretical and empirical comparative-genomic studies. It
	has been shown that, shortly after the duplication, genes seem to
	experience a considerable relaxation of purifying selection. RESULTS:
	Here we demonstrate two opposite effects of gene duplication on evolutionary
	rates. Sequence comparisons between paralogs show that, in accord
	with previous observations, a substantial acceleration in the evolution
	of paralogs occurs after duplication, presumably due to relaxation
	of purifying selection. The effect of gene duplication on evolutionary
	rate was also assessed by sequence comparison between orthologs that
	have paralogs (duplicates) and those that do not (singletons). It
	is shown that, in eukaryotes, duplicates, on average, evolve significantly
	slower than singletons. Eukaryotic ortholog evolutionary rates for
	duplicates are also negatively correlated with the number of paralogs
	per gene and the strength of selection between paralogs. A tally
	of annotated gene functions shows that duplicates tend to be enriched
	for proteins with known functions, particularly those involved in
	signaling and related cellular processes; by contrast, singletons
	include an over-abundance of poorly characterized proteins. CONCLUSIONS:
	These results suggest that whether or not a gene duplicate is retained
	by selection depends critically on the pre-existing functional utility
	of the protein encoded by the ancestral singleton. Duplicates of
	genes of a higher biological import, which are subject to strong
	functional constraints on the sequence, are retained relatively more
	often. Thus, the evolutionary trajectory of duplicated genes appears
	to be determined by two opposing trends, namely, the post-duplication
	rate acceleration and the generally slow evolutionary rate owing
	to the high level of functional constraints.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution
	are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid
	residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement
	with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation
	between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions.
	However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions
	influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this
	question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness.
	RESULTS: Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein interactions
	among Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible
	correlation with evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces
	pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative correlation between the
	number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein was observed.
	Furthermore, no relationship was found between a more general measure
	of the evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based
	on the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number of
	protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins from yeast
	were assorted into discrete bins according to the number of interactions,
	it turned out that 6.5\% of the proteins with the greatest number
	of interactions evolved, on average, significantly slower than the
	rest of the proteins. Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein
	interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of Helicobacter
	pylori proteins. No convincing relationship between the number of
	protein-protein interactions and evolutionary rates was detected,
	either for comparisons of orthologs from two completely sequenced
	H. pylori strains or for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter
	jejuni orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins
	by the number of interactions. CONCLUSION: The currently available
	comparative-genomic data do not support the hypothesis that the evolutionary
	rates of the majority of proteins substantially depend on the number
	of protein-protein interactions they are involved in. However, a
	small fraction of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions

	events, but recently retrotransposition has also been shown to contribute
	new functional protein coding genes and siRNA's. In this study, we
	utilize pseudogenes to recreate more complete gene family histories,
	and compare the rates of RNA and DNA-mediated duplication and new
	functional gene formation in five mammalian genomes. We find that
	RNA-mediated duplication occurs at a much higher and more variable
	rate than DNA-mediated duplication, and gives rise to many more duplicated
	sequences over time. We show that, while the chance of RNA-mediated
	duplicates becoming functional is much lower than that of their DNA-mediated
	counterparts, the higher rate of retrotransposition leads to nearly
	equal contributions of new genes by each mechanism. We also find
	that functional RNA-mediated duplicates are closer to neighboring
	genes than non-functional RNA-mediated copies, consistent with co-option
	of regulatory elements at the site of insertion. Overall, new genes
	derived from DNA and RNA-mediated duplication mechanisms are under

	death and innovation models (BDIMs) of genome evolution. These models
	explain the origin of the characteristic Pareto distribution of paralogous
	gene family sizes in genomes, and model parameters that provide for
	the evolution of these distributions within a realistic time frame
	have been identified. However, extracting the temporal dynamics of
	genome evolution from discrete-space BDIM was not technically feasible.
	We were interested in obtaining dynamic portraits of the genome evolution
	process by developing a diffusion approximation of BDIM. RESULTS:
	The diffusion version of BDIM belongs to a class of continuous-state
	models whose dynamics is described by the Fokker-Plank equation and
	the stationary solution could be any specified Pareto function. The
	diffusion models have time-dependent solutions of a special kind,
	namely, generalized self-similar solutions, which describe the transition
	from one stationary distribution of the system to another; this provides
	for the possibility of examining the temporal dynamics of genome
	evolution. Analysis of the generalized self-similar solutions of
	the diffusion BDIM reveals a biphasic curve of genome growth in which
	the initial, relatively short, self-accelerating phase is followed
	by a prolonged phase of slow deceleration. This evolutionary dynamics
	was observed both when genome growth started from zero and proceeded
	via innovation (a potential model of primordial evolution), and when
	evolution proceeded from one stationary state to another. In biological
	terms, this regime of evolution can be tentatively interpreted as
	a punctuated-equilibrium-like phenomenon whereby evolutionary transitions
	are accompanied by rapid gene amplification and innovation, followed
	by slow relaxation to a new stationary state.},

	Death, and Innovation Models (BDIMs). Analysis of the properties
	of different versions of BDIMs has the potential of revealing important
	features of genome evolution. RESULTS: In this work, we extend our
	previous analysis of stochastic BDIMs. In addition to the previously
	examined rational BDIMs, we introduce potentially more realistic
	logistic BDIMs, in which birth/death rates are limited for the largest
	families, and show that their properties are similar to those of
	models that include no such limitation. We show that the mean time
	required for the formation of the largest gene families detected
	in eukaryotic genomes is limited by the mean number of duplications
	per gene and does not increase indefinitely with the model degree.
	Instead, this time reaches a minimum value, which corresponds to
	a non-linear rational BDIM with the degree of approximately 2.7.
	Even for this BDIM, the mean time of the largest family formation
	is orders of magnitude greater than any realistic estimates based
	on the timescale of life's evolution. We employed the embedding chains
	technique to estimate the expected number of elementary evolutionary
	events (gene duplications and deletions) preceding the formation
	of gene families of the observed size and found that the mean number
	of events exceeds the family size by orders of magnitude, suggesting
	a highly dynamic process of genome evolution. The variance of the
	time required for the formation of the largest families was found
	to be extremely large, with the coefficient of variation >> 1. This
	indicates that some gene families might grow much faster than the
	mean rate such that the minimal time required for family formation
	is more relevant for a realistic representation of genome evolution
	than the mean time. We determined this minimal time using Monte Carlo
	simulations of family growth from an ensemble of simultaneously evolving
	singletons. In these simulations, the time elapsed before the formation
	of the largest family was much shorter than the estimated mean time
	and was compatible with the timescale of evolution of eukaryotes.
	CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of stochastic BDIMs presented here shows
	that non-linear versions of such models can well approximate not
	only the size distribution of gene families but also the dynamics
	of their formation during genome evolution. The fact that only higher
	degree BDIMs are compatible with the observed characteristics of
	genome evolution suggests that the growth of gene families is self-accelerating,
	which might reflect differential selective pressure acting on different
	genes.},

  pages = {18},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Power distributions appear in numerous biological, physical
	and other contexts, which appear to be fundamentally different. In
	biology, power laws have been claimed to describe the distributions
	of the connections of enzymes and metabolites in metabolic networks,
	the number of interactions partners of a given protein, the number
	of members in paralogous families, and other quantities. In network
	analysis, power laws imply evolution of the network with preferential
	attachment, i.e. a greater likelihood of nodes being added to pre-existing
	hubs. Exploration of different types of evolutionary models in an
	attempt to determine which of them lead to power law distributions
	has the potential of revealing non-trivial aspects of genome evolution.
	RESULTS: A simple model of evolution of the domain composition of
	proteomes was developed, with the following elementary processes:
	i) domain birth (duplication with divergence), ii) death (inactivation
	and/or deletion), and iii) innovation (emergence from non-coding
	or non-globular sequences or acquisition via horizontal gene transfer).
	This formalism can be described as a birth, death and innovation
	model (BDIM). The formulas for equilibrium frequencies of domain
	families of different size and the total number of families at equilibrium
	are derived for a general BDIM. All asymptotics of equilibrium frequencies
	of domain families possible for the given type of models are found
	and their appearance depending on model parameters is investigated.
	It is proved that the power law asymptotics appears if, and only
	if, the model is balanced, i.e. domain duplication and deletion rates
	are asymptotically equal up to the second order. It is further proved
	that any power asymptotic with the degree not equal to -1 can appear
	only if the hypothesis of independence of the duplication/deletion
	rates on the size of a domain family is rejected. Specific cases
	of BDIMs, namely simple, linear, polynomial and rational models,
	are considered in details and the distributions of the equilibrium
	frequencies of domain families of different size are determined for
	each case. We apply the BDIM formalism to the analysis of the domain
	family size distributions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes
	and show an excellent fit between these empirical data and a particular
	form of the model, the second-order balanced linear BDIM. Calculation
	of the parameters of these models suggests surprisingly high innovation
	rates, comparable to the total domain birth (duplication) and elimination
	rates, particularly for prokaryotic genomes. CONCLUSIONS: We show
	that a straightforward model of genome evolution, which does not
	explicitly include selection, is sufficient to explain the observed
	distributions of domain family sizes, in which power laws appear
	as asymptotic. However, for the model to be compatible with the data,
	there has to be a precise balance between domain birth, death and
	innovation rates, and this is likely to be maintained by selection.
	The developed approach is oriented at a mathematical description
	of evolution of domain composition of proteomes, but a simple reformulation
	could be applied to models of other evolving networks with preferential
	attachment.},

	results from an analysis comprising 68 duplication events in the

	(from small-scale duplication events) to determine whether their
	disparate origins commit them to divergent evolutionary trajectories
	and genomic attributes. RESULTS: We conclude that, for the most part,
	ohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar to non-ohnologs in their
	structural attributes (specifically the relative composition frequencies
	of complete, partial and chimeric duplicates), the discernible length
	of the duplicated region (duplication span) as well as genomic location.
	Furthermore, we find notable differences in the features of S. cerevisiae

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has
	a characteristic reproductive mode; mature males build nests using
	a secreted glue-like protein called spiggin. Although recent studies
	reported multiple occurrences of genes that encode this glue-like
	protein spiggin in threespine and ninespine sticklebacks, it is still
	unclear how many genes compose the spiggin multi-gene family. RESULTS:
	Genome sequence analysis of threespine stickleback showed that there
	are at least five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes, whereas a single
	spiggin homolog occurs in the genomes of other fishes. Comparative
	genome sequence analysis demonstrated that Muc19, a single-copy mucous
	gene in human and mouse, is an ortholog of spiggin. Phylogenetic
	and molecular evolutionary analyses of these sequences suggested
	that an ancestral spiggin gene originated from a member of the mucin
	gene family as a single gene in the common ancestor of teleosts,
	and gene duplications of spiggin have occurred in the stickleback
	lineage. There was inter-population variation in the copy number
	of spiggin genes and positive selection on some codons, indicating
	that additional gene duplication/deletion events and adaptive evolution
	at some amino acid sites may have occurred in each stickleback population.
	CONCLUSION: A number of spiggin genes exist in the threespine stickleback
	genome. Our results provide insight into the origin and dynamic evolutionary
	process of the spiggin multi-gene family in the threespine stickleback
	lineage. The dramatic evolution of genes for mucous substrates may
	have contributed to the generation of distinct characteristics such
	as "bio-glue" in vertebrates.},

	on snapshots in time of the whole community. We consider tests for

	time series but not in metacommunity time series. The slope of the
	Taylor's power law in the model was similar to the slopes observed
	in natural populations, but the fit to the power law was worse. Our
	observations of pink noise and density dependence can be attributed
	to the presence of an upper limit to community sizes and to the effect

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In several studies, secondary structures of ribosomal
	genes have been used to improve the quality of phylogenetic reconstructions.
	An extensive evaluation of the benefits of secondary structure, however,
	is lacking. RESULTS: This is the first study to counter this deficiency.
	We inspected the accuracy and robustness of phylogenetics with individual
	secondary structures by simulation experiments for artificial tree
	topologies with up to 18 taxa and for divergency levels in the range
	of typical phylogenetic studies. We chose the internal transcribed
	spacer 2 of the ribosomal cistron as an exemplary marker region.
	Simulation integrated the coevolution process of sequences with secondary
	structures. Additionally, the phylogenetic power of marker size duplication
	was investigated and compared with sequence and sequence-structure
	reconstruction methods. The results clearly show that accuracy and
	robustness of Neighbor Joining trees are largely improved by structural
	information in contrast to sequence only data, whereas a doubled
	marker size only accounts for robustness. CONCLUSIONS: Individual
	secondary structures of ribosomal RNA sequences provide a valuable
	gain of information content that is useful for phylogenetics. Thus,

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates
	the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph.
	Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been
	studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct.
	All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly
	clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light
	(LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus
	group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes
	revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological
	differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight
	newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes
	for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates)
	and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns
	of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution.
	There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes.
	They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction,
	to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates
	by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic
	analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method
	to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene.
	Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes
	involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are
	found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes
	defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes,
	helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus.
	Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify
	highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple
	pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles,
	especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport
	that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core.
	Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout
	the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains
	and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the "leaves
	of the tree," between the most closely related strains. Finally,
	the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome
	comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus
	genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing
	the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and
	the wild.},

  abstract = {Proteins interact in complex protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
	whose topological properties-such as scale-free topology, hierarchical
	modularity, and dissortativity-have suggested models of network evolution.
	Currently preferred models invoke preferential attachment or gene
	duplication and divergence to produce networks whose topology matches
	that observed for real PPIs, thus supporting these as likely models
	for network evolution. Here, we show that the interaction density
	and homodimeric frequency are highly protein age-dependent in real
	PPI networks in a manner which does not agree with these canonical
	models. In light of these results, we propose an alternative stochastic
	model, which adds each protein sequentially to a growing network
	in a manner analogous to protein crystal growth (CG) in solution.
	The key ideas are (1) interaction probability increases with availability
	of unoccupied interaction surface, thus following an anti-preferential
	attachment rule, (2) as a network grows, highly connected sub-networks
	emerge into protein modules or complexes, and (3) once a new protein
	is committed to a module, further connections tend to be localized
	within that module. The CG model produces PPI networks consistent
	in both topology and age distributions with real PPI networks and
	is well supported by the spatial arrangement of protein complexes
	of known 3-D structure, suggesting a plausible physical mechanism
	for network evolution.},

  abstract = {New genes commonly appear through complete or partial duplications

	sequences after fixation, although gene conversion can impede this
	process. New data shed some light on each of these processes. Mutations
	which involve duplications can occur through at least two different
	mechanisms, backward strand slippage during DNA replication and unequal
	crossing-over. The background rate of duplication of a complete gene
	in humans is 10(-9)-10(-10) per generation, although many genes located

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplications have a major role in the evolution of
	new biological functions. Theoretical studies often assume that a
	duplication per se is selectively neutral and that, following a duplication,
	one of the gene copies is freed from purifying (stabilizing) selection,
	which creates the potential for evolution of a new function. RESULTS:
	In search of systematic evidence of accelerated evolution after duplication,
	we used data from 26 bacterial, six archaeal, and seven eukaryotic
	genomes to compare the mode and strength of selection acting on recently
	duplicated genes (paralogs) and on similarly diverged, unduplicated
	orthologous genes in different species. We find that the ratio of
	nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Kn/Ks) in most paralogous
	pairs is <<1 and that paralogs typically evolve at similar rates,
	without significant asymmetry, indicating that both paralogs produced
	by a duplication are subject to purifying selection. This selection
	is, however, substantially weaker than the purifying selection affecting
	unduplicated orthologs that have diverged to the same extent as the
	analyzed paralogs. Most of the recently duplicated genes appear to
	be involved in various forms of environmental response; in particular,
	many of them encode membrane and secreted proteins. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of this analysis indicate that recently duplicated paralogs
	evolve faster than orthologs with the same level of divergence and
	similar functions, but apparently do not experience a phase of neutral
	evolution. We hypothesize that gene duplications that persist in
	an evolving lineage are beneficial from the time of their origin,
	due primarily to a protein dosage effect in response to variable
	environmental conditions; duplications are likely to give rise to
	new functions at a later phase of their evolution once a higher level
	of divergence is reached.},

	duplicate genes provide raw materials for the evolution of mechanisms
	controlling physiological and/or morphological novelties. Gene duplication
	can occur via several mechanisms, including segmental duplication,
	tandem duplication and retroposition. Although segmental and tandem
	duplications have been found to be important for the expansion of
	a number of multigene families, the contribution of retroposition
	is not clear. Here we show that plant SKP1 genes have evolved by
	multiple duplication events from a single ancestral copy in the most
	recent common ancestor (MRCA) of eudicots and monocots, resulting
	in 19 ASK (Arabidopsis SKP1-like) and 28 OSK (Oryza SKP1-like) genes.
	The estimated birth rates are more than ten times the average rate
	of gene duplication, and are even higher than that of other rapidly
	duplicating plant genes, such as type I MADS box genes, R genes,
	and genes encoding receptor-like kinases. Further analyses suggest
	that a relatively large proportion of the duplication events may
	be explained by tandem duplication, but few, if any, are likely to
	be due to segmental duplication. In addition, by mapping the gain/loss
	of a specific intron on gene phylogenies, and by searching for the
	features that characterize retrogenes/retrosequences, we show that
	retroposition is an important mechanism for expansion of the plant
	SKP1 gene family. Specifically, we propose that two and three ancient
	retroposition events occurred in lineages leading to Arabidopsis
	and rice, respectively, followed by repeated tandem duplications
	and chromosome rearrangements. Our study represents a thorough investigation

  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {21},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major transitions in biological evolution show the same
	pattern of sudden emergence of diverse forms at a new level of complexity.
	The relationships between major groups within an emergent new class
	of biological entities are hard to decipher and do not seem to fit
	the tree pattern that, following Darwin's original proposal, remains
	the dominant description of biological evolution. The cases in point
	include the origin of complex RNA molecules and protein folds; major
	groups of viruses; archaea and bacteria, and the principal lineages
	within each of these prokaryotic domains; eukaryotic supergroups;
	and animal phyla. In each of these pivotal nexuses in life's history,
	the principal "types" seem to appear rapidly and fully equipped with
	the signature features of the respective new level of biological
	organization. No intermediate "grades" or intermediate forms between
	different types are detectable. Usually, this pattern is attributed
	to cladogenesis compressed in time, combined with the inevitable
	erosion of the phylogenetic signal. HYPOTHESIS: I propose that most
	or all major evolutionary transitions that show the "explosive" pattern
	of emergence of new types of biological entities correspond to a
	boundary between two qualitatively distinct evolutionary phases.
	The first, inflationary phase is characterized by extremely rapid
	evolution driven by various processes of genetic information exchange,
	such as horizontal gene transfer, recombination, fusion, fission,
	and spread of mobile elements. These processes give rise to a vast
	diversity of forms from which the main classes of entities at the
	new level of complexity emerge independently, through a sampling
	process. In the second phase, evolution dramatically slows down,
	the respective process of genetic information exchange tapers off,
	and multiple lineages of the new type of entities emerge, each of
	them evolving in a tree-like fashion from that point on. This biphasic
	model of evolution incorporates the previously developed concepts
	of the emergence of protein folds by recombination of small structural
	units and origin of viruses and cells from a pre-cellular compartmentalized
	pool of recombining genetic elements. The model is extended to encompass
	other major transitions. It is proposed that bacterial and archaeal
	phyla emerged independently from two distinct populations of primordial
	cells that, originally, possessed leaky membranes, which made the
	cells prone to rampant gene exchange; and that the eukaryotic supergroups
	emerged through distinct, secondary endosymbiotic events (as opposed
	to the primary, mitochondrial endosymbiosis). This biphasic model
	of evolution is substantially analogous to the scenario of the origin
	of universes in the eternal inflation version of modern cosmology.
	Under this model, universes like ours emerge in the infinite multiverse
	when the eternal process of exponential expansion, known as inflation,
	ceases in a particular region as a result of false vacuum decay,
	a first order phase transition process. The result is the nucleation
	of a new universe, which is traditionally denoted Big Bang, although
	this scenario is radically different from the Big Bang of the traditional
	model of an expanding universe. Hence I denote the phase transitions
	at the end of each inflationary epoch in the history of life Biological
	Big Bangs (BBB). CONCLUSION: A Biological Big Bang (BBB) model is
	proposed for the major transitions in life's evolution. According
	to this model, each transition is a BBB such that new classes of
	biological entities emerge at the end of a rapid phase of evolution
	(inflation) that is characterized by extensive exchange of genetic
	information which takes distinct forms for different BBBs. The major
	types of new forms emerge independently, via a sampling process,
	from the pool of recombining entities of the preceding generation.
	This process is envisaged as being qualitatively different from tree-pattern
	cladogenesis.},

	eukaryotes enables in-depth comparative-genomic analysis which is
	expected to help in reconstructing ancestral eukaryotic genomes and

	for currently uncharacterized conserved genes. RESULTS: We examined
	functional and evolutionary patterns in the recently constructed
	set of 5,873 clusters of predicted orthologs (eukaryotic orthologous
	groups or KOGs) from seven eukaryotic genomes: Caenorhabditis elegans,
	Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Encephalitozoon cuniculi.
	Conservation of KOGs through the phyletic range of eukaryotes strongly
	correlates with their functions and with the effect of gene knockout
	on the organism's viability. The approximately 40\% of KOGs that
	are represented in six or seven species are enriched in proteins
	responsible for housekeeping functions, particularly translation
	and RNA processing. These conserved KOGs are often essential for
	survival and might approximate the minimal set of essential eukaryotic
	genes. The 131 single-member, pan-eukaryotic KOGs we identified were
	examined in detail. For around 20 that remained uncharacterized,
	functions were predicted by in-depth sequence analysis and examination
	of genomic context. Nearly all these proteins are subunits of known
	or predicted multiprotein complexes, in agreement with the balance
	hypothesis of evolution of gene copy number. Other KOGs show a variety
	of phyletic patterns, which points to major contributions of lineage-specific
	gene loss and the 'invention' of genes new to eukaryotic evolution.
	Examination of the sets of KOGs lost in individual lineages reveals
	co-elimination of functionally connected genes. Parsimonious scenarios
	of eukaryotic genome evolution and gene sets for ancestral eukaryotic
	forms were reconstructed. The gene set of the last common ancestor
	of the crown group consists of 3,413 KOGs and largely includes proteins
	involved in genome replication and expression, and central metabolism.
	Only 44\% of the KOGs, mostly from the reconstructed gene set of
	the last common ancestor of the crown group, have detectable homologs
	in prokaryotes; the remainder apparently evolved via duplication
	with divergence and invention of new genes. CONCLUSIONS: The KOG
	analysis reveals a conserved core of largely essential eukaryotic
	genes as well as major diversification and innovation associated
	with evolution of eukaryotic genomes. The results provide quantitative
	support for major trends of eukaryotic evolution noticed previously
	at the qualitative level and a basis for detailed reconstruction

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of the publication
	of Jean-Bapteste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique and the 150th anniversary
	of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Lamarck believed that
	evolution is driven primarily by non-randomly acquired, beneficial
	phenotypic changes, in particular, those directly affected by the
	use of organs, which Lamarck believed to be inheritable. In contrast,
	Darwin assigned a greater importance to random, undirected change
	that provided material for natural selection. THE CONCEPT: The classic
	Lamarckian scheme appears untenable owing to the non-existence of
	mechanisms for direct reverse engineering of adaptive phenotypic
	characters acquired by an individual during its life span into the
	genome. However, various evolutionary phenomena that came to fore
	in the last few years, seem to fit a more broadly interpreted (quasi)Lamarckian
	paradigm. The prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas system of defense against mobile
	elements seems to function via a bona fide Lamarckian mechanism,
	namely, by integrating small segments of viral or plasmid DNA into
	specific loci in the host prokaryote genome and then utilizing the
	respective transcripts to destroy the cognate mobile element DNA
	(or RNA). A similar principle seems to be employed in the piRNA branch
	of RNA interference which is involved in defense against transposable
	elements in the animal germ line. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT),
	a dominant evolutionary process, at least, in prokaryotes, appears
	to be a form of (quasi)Lamarckian inheritance. The rate of HGT and
	the nature of acquired genes depend on the environment of the recipient
	organism and, in some cases, the transferred genes confer a selective
	advantage for growth in that environment, meeting the Lamarckian
	criteria. Various forms of stress-induced mutagenesis are tightly
	regulated and comprise a universal adaptive response to environmental
	stress in cellular life forms. Stress-induced mutagenesis can be
	construed as a quasi-Lamarckian phenomenon because the induced genomic
	changes, although random, are triggered by environmental factors
	and are beneficial to the organism. CONCLUSION: Both Darwinian and
	Lamarckian modalities of evolution appear to be important, and reflect
	different aspects of the interaction between populations and the
	environment.},

  title = {The fundamental units, processes and patterns of evolution, and the
	tree of life conundrum.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {33},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The elucidation of the dominant role of horizontal gene
	transfer (HGT) in the evolution of prokaryotes led to a severe crisis
	of the Tree of Life (TOL) concept and intense debates on this subject.
	CONCEPT: Prompted by the crisis of the TOL, we attempt to define
	the primary units and the fundamental patterns and processes of evolution.
	We posit that replication of the genetic material is the singular
	fundamental biological process and that replication with an error
	rate below a certain threshold both enables and necessitates evolution
	by drift and selection. Starting from this proposition, we outline
	a general concept of evolution that consists of three major precepts.
	1. The primary agency of evolution consists of Fundamental Units
	of Evolution (FUEs), that is, units of genetic material that possess
	a substantial degree of evolutionary independence. The FUEs include
	both bona fide selfish elements such as viruses, viroids, transposons,
	and plasmids, which encode some of the information required for their
	own replication, and regular genes that possess quasi-independence
	owing to their distinct selective value that provides for their transfer
	between ensembles of FUEs (genomes) and preferential replication
	along with the rest of the recipient genome. 2. The history of replication
	of a genetic element without recombination is isomorphously represented
	by a directed tree graph (an arborescence, in the graph theory language).
	Recombination within a FUE is common between very closely related
	sequences where homologous recombination is feasible but becomes
	negligible for longer evolutionary distances. In contrast, shuffling
	of FUEs occurs at all evolutionary distances. Thus, a tree is a natural
	representation of the evolution of an individual FUE on the macro
	scale, but not of an ensemble of FUEs such as a genome. 3. The history
	of life is properly represented by the "forest" of evolutionary trees
	for individual FUEs (Forest of Life, or FOL). Search for trends and
	patterns in the FOL is a productive direction of study that leads
	to the delineation of ensembles of FUEs that evolve coherently for
	a certain time span owing to a shared history of vertical inheritance
	or horizontal gene transfer; these ensembles are commonly known as
	genomes, taxa, or clades, depending on the level of analysis. A small
	set of genes (the universal genetic core of life) might show a (mostly)
	coherent evolutionary trend that transcends the entire history of
	cellular life forms. However, it might not be useful to denote this
	trend "the tree of life", or organismal, or species tree because
	neither organisms nor species are fundamental units of life. CONCLUSION:
	A logical analysis of the units and processes of biological evolution
	suggests that the natural fundamental unit of evolution is a FUE,
	that is, a genetic element with an independent evolutionary history.
	Evolution of a FUE on the macro scale is naturally represented by
	a tree. Only the full compendium of trees for individual FUEs (the
	FOL) is an adequate depiction of the evolution of life. Coherent
	evolution of FUEs over extended evolutionary intervals is a crucial
	aspect of the history of life but a "species" or "organismal" tree
	is not a fundamental concept. REVIEWERS: This articles was reviewed

	complemented by sequence profile analysis, we predict the existence
	and protein composition of the archaeal counterpart of the eukaryotic
	exosome, a complex of RNAses, RNA-binding proteins, and helicases
	that mediates processing and 3'->5' degradation of a variety of RNA
	species. The majority of the predicted archaeal exosome subunits
	are encoded in what appears to be a previously undetected superoperon.
	In Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, this predicted superoperon
	consists of 15 genes; in the Crenarchaea, Sulfolobus solfataricus
	and Aeropyrum pernix, one and two of the genes from the superoperon,
	respectively, are relocated in the genome, whereas in other Euryarchaeota,
	the superoperon is split into a variable number of predicted operons
	and solitary genes. Methanococcus jannaschii partially retains the
	superoperon, but lacks the three core exosome subunits, and in Halobacterium
	sp., the superoperon is divided into two predicted operons, with
	the same three exosome subunits missing. This suggests concerted
	gene loss and an alteration of the structure and function of the
	predicted exosome in the Methanococcus and Halobacterium lineages.
	Additional potential components of the exosome are encoded by partially
	conserved predicted small operons. Along with the orthologs of eukaryotic
	exosome subunits, namely an RNase PH and two RNA-binding proteins,
	the predicted archaeal exosomal superoperon also encodes orthologs
	of two protein subunits of RNase P. This suggests a functional and
	possibly a physical interaction between RNase P and the postulated
	archaeal exosome, a connection that has not been reported in eukaryotes.
	In a pattern of apparent gene loss complementary to that seen in
	Methanococcus and Halobacterium, Thermoplasma acidophilum lacks the
	RNase P subunits. Unexpectedly, the identified exosomal superoperon,
	in addition to the predicted exosome components, encodes the catalytic
	subunits of the archaeal proteasome, two ribosomal proteins and a
	DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit. These observations suggest that
	in archaea, a tight functional coupling exists between translation,
	RNA processing and degradation, (apparently mediated by the predicted
	exosome) and protein degradation (mediated by the proteasome), and
	may have implications for cross-talk between these processes in eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {With an ever-increasing amount of available data on protein-protein
	interaction (PPI) networks and research revealing that these networks
	evolve at a modular level, discovery of conserved patterns in these
	networks becomes an important problem. Although available data on
	protein-protein interactions is currently limited, recently developed
	algorithms have been shown to convey novel biological insights through
	employment of elegant mathematical models. The main challenge in
	aligning PPI networks is to define a graph theoretical measure of
	similarity between graph structures that captures underlying biological
	phenomena accurately. In this respect, modeling of conservation and
	divergence of interactions, as well as the interpretation of resulting
	alignments, are important design parameters. In this paper, we develop
	a framework for comprehensive alignment of PPI networks, which is
	inspired by duplication/divergence models that focus on understanding
	the evolution of protein interactions. We propose a mathematical
	model that extends the concepts of match, mismatch, and gap in sequence
	alignment to that of match, mismatch, and duplication in network
	alignment and evaluates similarity between graph structures through
	a scoring function that accounts for evolutionary events. By relying
	on evolutionary models, the proposed framework facilitates interpretation
	of resulting alignments in terms of not only conservation but also
	divergence of modularity in PPI networks. Furthermore, as in the
	case of sequence alignment, our model allows flexibility in adjusting
	parameters to quantify underlying evolutionary relationships. Based
	on the proposed model, we formulate PPI network alignment as an optimization
	problem and present fast algorithms to solve this problem. Detailed
	experimental results from an implementation of the proposed framework
	show that our algorithm is able to discover conserved interaction
	patterns very effectively, in terms of both accuracies and computational
	cost.},

	fundamental task in comparative genomics. Construction of intergenomic
	symmetrical best matches (SymBets) and joining them into clusters
	is a popular method of ortholog definition, embodied in several software
	programs. Despite their wide use, the computational complexity of
	these programs has not been thoroughly examined. RESULTS: In this
	work, we show that in the standard approach of iteration through
	all triangles of SymBets, the memory scales with at least the number
	of these triangles, O(g(3)) (where g = number of genomes), and construction
	time scales with the iteration through each pair, i.e. O(g(6)). We
	propose the EdgeSearch algorithm that iterates over edges in the
	SymBet graph rather than triangles of SymBets, and as a result has
	a worst-case complexity of only O(g(3)log g). Several optimizations
	reduce the run-time even further in realistically sparse graphs.
	In two real-world datasets of genomes from bacteriophages (POGs)
	and Mollicutes (MOGs), an implementation of the EdgeSearch algorithm
	runs about an order of magnitude faster than the original algorithm
	and scales much better with increasing number of genomes, with only
	minor differences in the final results, and up to 60 times faster
	than the popular OrthoMCL program with a 90\% overlap between the
	identified groups of orthologs. Availability and implementation:

	We derived a parsimonious scenario of gene losses for eukaryotic

	The scenario involves substantial gene loss in fungi, nematodes,
	and insects. Based on this evolutionary scenario and estimates of
	the divergence times between major eukaryotic phyla, we introduce
	a numerical measure, the propensity for gene loss (PGL). We explore
	the connection among the propensity of a gene to be lost in evolution
	(PGL value), protein sequence divergence, the effect of gene knockout
	on fitness, the number of protein-protein interactions, and expression
	level for the genes in KOGs. Significant correlations between PGL
	and each of these variables were detected. Genes that have a lower
	propensity to be lost in eukaryotic evolution accumulate fewer substitutions
	in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism
	viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interaction
	partners. The dependence between PGL and gene dispensability and
	interactivity is much stronger than that for sequence evolution rate.
	Thus, propensity of a gene to be lost during evolution seems to be
	a direct reflection of its biological importance.},

  abstract = {Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic
	infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as

	successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission.
	Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation
	scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within
	the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability
	of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful
	emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results
	for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the
	probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical
	results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied
	computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection
	strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak
	effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence
	per introduction. For example, if R0 = 1.4 or larger, any village
	connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively,
	just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence
	and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on
	commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities
	for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected.
	For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity
	are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation.
	We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control

  journal = {BMC Syst Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {31},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In systems biology, network-based pathway analysis facilitates
	understanding or designing metabolic systems and enables prediction
	of metabolic flux distributions. Network-based flux analysis requires
	considering not only pathway architectures but also the proteome
	or transcriptome to predict flux distributions, because recombinant
	microbes significantly change the distribution of gene expressions.
	The current problem is how to integrate such heterogeneous data to
	build a network-based model. RESULTS: To link enzyme activity data
	to flux distributions of metabolic networks, we have proposed Enzyme
	Control Flux (ECF), a novel model that integrates enzyme activity
	into elementary mode analysis (EMA). ECF presents the power-law formula
	describing how changes in enzyme activities between wild-type and
	a mutant are related to changes in the elementary mode coefficients
	(EMCs). To validate the feasibility of ECF, we integrated enzyme
	activity data into the EMCs of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis
	wild-type. The ECF model effectively uses an enzyme activity profile
	to estimate the flux distribution of the mutants and the increase
	in the number of incorporated enzyme activities decreases the model
	error of ECF. CONCLUSION: The ECF model is a non-mechanistic and
	static model to link an enzyme activity profile to a metabolic flux
	distribution by introducing the power-law formula into EMA, suggesting
	that the change in an enzyme profile rather reflects the change in
	the flux distribution. The ECF model is highly applicable to the
	central metabolism in knockout mutants of E. coli and B. subtilis.},

	Therefore, they are not only independent from each other, but also
	independent from the substitution process. After a separate stochastic
	analysis of the substitution and the insertion-deletion processes,
	we obtain a matrix differential equation combining these two processes
	defining the IDIS model. By deriving a general solution, we give
	an analytical expression of the residue occurrence probability at

	insertion rate vector, a deletion rate and an initial residue probability
	vector. Various mathematical properties of the IDIS model in relation

	probability at time t are given for classical substitution rate matrices
	in various biological contexts: equal insertion rate, insertion-deletion
	only and substitution only. All these expressions can be directly
	used for biological evolutionary applications. The IDIS model shows
	a strongly different stochastic behavior from the classical substitution

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein domains can be used to study proteome evolution
	at a coarse scale. In particular, they are found on genomes with
	notable statistical distributions. It is known that the distribution
	of domains with a given topology follows a power law. We focus on
	a further aspect: these distributions, and the number of distinct
	topologies, follow collective trends, or scaling laws, depending
	on the total number of domains only, and not on genome-specific features.
	RESULTS: We present a stochastic duplication/innovation model, in
	the class of the so-called 'Chinese restaurant processes', that explains
	this observation with two universal parameters, representing a minimal
	number of domains and the relative weight of innovation to duplication.
	Furthermore, we study a model variant where new topologies are related
	to occurrence in genomic data, accounting for fold specificity. CONCLUSIONS:
	Both models have general quantitative agreement with data from hundreds
	of genomes, which indicates that the domains of a genome are built
	with a combination of specificity and robust self-organizing phenomena.
	The latter are related to the basic evolutionary 'moves' of duplication
	and innovation, and give rise to the observed scaling laws, a priori
	of the specific evolutionary history of a genome. We interpret this
	as the concurrent effect of neutral and selective drives, which increase
	duplication and decrease innovation in larger and more complex genomes.
	The validity of our model would imply that the empirical observation
	of a small number of folds in nature may be a consequence of their
	evolution.},

	Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion,

	had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous

	highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well
	as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells' apical
	surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells.
	We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion
	in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted
	in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the
	value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to
	uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {184},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the many gene families that expanded in early vertebrate
	evolution is the neuropeptide (NPY) receptor family of G-protein
	coupled receptors. Earlier work by our lab suggested that several
	of the NPY receptor genes found in extant vertebrates resulted from
	two genome duplications before the origin of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes)
	and one additional genome duplication in the actinopterygian lineage,
	based on their location on chromosomes sharing several gene families.
	In this study we have investigated, in five vertebrate genomes, 45
	gene families with members close to the NPY receptor genes in the
	compact genomes of the teleost fishes Tetraodon nigroviridis and
	Takifugu rubripes. These correspond to Homo sapiens chromosomes 4,
	5, 8 and 10. RESULTS: Chromosome regions with conserved synteny were
	identified and confirmed by phylogenetic analyses in H. sapiens,
	M. musculus, D. rerio, T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis. 26 gene families,
	including the NPY receptor genes, (plus 3 described recently by other
	labs) showed a tree topology consistent with duplications in early
	vertebrate evolution and in the actinopterygian lineage, thereby
	supporting expansion through block duplications. Eight gene families
	had complications that precluded analysis (such as short sequence
	length or variable number of repeated domains) and another eight
	families did not support block duplications (because the paralogs
	in these families seem to have originated in another time window
	than the proposed genome duplication events). RT-PCR carried out
	with several tissues in T. rubripes revealed that all five NPY receptors
	were expressed in the brain and subtypes Y2, Y4 and Y8 were also
	expressed in peripheral organs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the
	phylogenetic analyses and chromosomal locations of these gene families
	support duplications of large blocks of genes or even entire chromosomes.
	Thus, these results are consistent with two early vertebrate tetraploidizations
	forming a paralogon comprising human chromosomes 4, 5, 8 and 10 and
	one teleost tetraploidization. The combination of positional and
	phylogenetic data further strengthens the identification of orthologs
	and paralogs in the NPY receptor family.},

	recombination, and functional divergence. The obtained results, then,
	were used to determine what evolutionary forces have influenced the

	S. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in

	pyogenes. Core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18%
	to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive
	selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from
	11% to 34% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was unevenly

	S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection
	pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest

	Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless

	distributed representatives of the P-loop GTPases and GTPase-related
	proteins with the aim of constructing an evolutionary classification
	for this superclass of proteins and reconstructing the principal
	events in their evolution. The GTPase superclass can be divided into
	two large classes, each of which has a unique set of sequence and
	structural signatures (synapomorphies). The first class, designated
	TRAFAC (after translation factors) includes enzymes involved in translation
	(initiation, elongation, and release factors), signal transduction
	(in particular, the extended Ras-like family), cell motility, and
	intracellular transport. The second class, designated SIMIBI (after
	signal recognition particle, MinD, and BioD), consists of signal
	recognition particle (SRP) GTPases, the assemblage of MinD-like ATPases,
	which are involved in protein localization, chromosome partitioning,
	and membrane transport, and a group of metabolic enzymes with kinase
	or related phosphate transferase activity. These two classes together
	contain over 20 distinct families that are further subdivided into
	57 subfamilies (ancient lineages) on the basis of conserved sequence
	motifs, shared structural features, and domain architectures. Ten
	subfamilies show a universal phyletic distribution compatible with
	presence in the last universal common ancestor of the extant life
	forms (LUCA). These include four translation factors, two OBG-like
	GTPases, the YawG/YlqF-like GTPases (these two subfamilies also consist
	of predicted translation factors), the two signal-recognition-associated
	GTPases, and the MRP subfamily of MinD-like ATPases. The distribution
	of nucleotide specificity among the proteins of the GTPase superclass
	indicates that the common ancestor of the entire superclass was a
	GTPase and that a secondary switch to ATPase activity has occurred
	on several independent occasions during evolution. The functions
	of most GTPases that are traceable to LUCA are associated with translation.
	However, in contrast to other superclasses of P-loop NTPases (RecA-F1/F0,
	AAA+, helicases, ABC), GTPases do not participate in NTP-dependent
	nucleic acid unwinding and reorganizing activities. Hence, we hypothesize
	that the ancestral GTPase was an enzyme with a generic regulatory
	role in translation, with subsequent diversification resulting in
	acquisition of diverse functions in transport, protein trafficking,
	and signaling. In addition to the classification of previously known
	families of GTPases and related ATPases, we introduce several previously
	undetected families and describe new functional predictions.},

	studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the
	identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully
	exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to
	apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple
	paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL
	provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across
	multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group
	(putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly
	to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can
	be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL
	clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved
	recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing
	the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC
	annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility
	for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied
	to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human,
	fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,
	and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual
	genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family).

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Standard rate laws are a key requisite for systematically
	turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide
	simple, general and biochemically plausible formulae for reaction
	velocities and reaction elasticities. At the same time, they need
	to respect thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants
	and the metabolic fluxes and concentrations. RESULTS: We present
	a family of reversible rate laws for reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries
	and various types of regulation, including mass-action, Michaelis-Menten
	and uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. With a thermodynamically
	safe parameterization of these rate laws, parameter sets obtained
	by model fitting, sampling or optimization are guaranteed to lead
	to consistent chemical equilibrium states. A reformulation using
	saturation values yields simple formulae for rates and elasticities,
	which can be easily adjusted to the given stationary flux distributions.
	Furthermore, this formulation highlights the role of chemical potential
	differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the modular
	rate laws to the thermodynamic-kinetic modelling formalism and discuss
	a simplified rate law in which the reaction rate directly depends
	on the reaction affinity. For automatic handling of modular rate
	laws, we propose a standard syntax and semantic annotations for the
	Systems Biology Markup Language. AVAILABILITY: An online tool for
	inserting the rate laws into SBML models is freely available at www.semanticsbml.org.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many biological networks show some characteristics of
	scale-free networks. Scale-free networks can evolve through preferential
	attachment where new nodes are preferentially attached to well connected
	nodes. In networks which have evolved through preferential attachment
	older nodes should have a higher average connectivity than younger
	nodes. Here we have investigated preferential attachment in the context
	of metabolic networks. RESULTS: The connectivities of the enzymes
	in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli were determined and
	representatives for these enzymes were located in 11 eukaryotes,
	17 archaea and 46 bacteria. E. coli enzymes which have representatives
	in eukaryotes have a higher average connectivity while enzymes which
	are represented only in the prokaryotes, and especially the enzymes
	only present in betagamma-proteobacteria, have lower connectivities
	than expected by chance. Interestingly, the enzymes which have been
	proposed as candidates for horizontal gene transfer have a higher
	average connectivity than the other enzymes. Furthermore, It was
	found that new edges are added to the highly connected enzymes at
	a faster rate than to enzymes with low connectivities which is consistent
	with preferential attachment. CONCLUSION: Here, we have found indications
	of preferential attachment in the metabolic network of E. coli. A
	possible biological explanation for preferential attachment growth
	of metabolic networks is that novel enzymes created through gene
	duplication maintain some of the compounds involved in the original
	reaction, throughout its future evolution. In addition, we found
	that enzymes which are candidates for horizontal gene transfer have
	a higher average connectivity than other enzymes. This indicates
	that while new enzymes are attached preferentially to highly connected
	enzymes, these highly connected enzymes have sometimes been introduced
	into the E. coli genome by horizontal gene transfer. We speculate
	that E. coli has adjusted its metabolic network to a changing environment
	by replacing the relatively central enzymes for better adapted orthologs
	from other prokaryotic species.},

	However, many archaeal species have two recA/RAD51 homologs (RADA
	and RADB), and eukaryotes possess multiple members (RAD51, RAD51B,
	RAD51C, RAD51D, DMC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, and recA). Phylogenetic analyses

	relatively divergent functions; and (iii) recA, functioning in eubacteria

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplication has been a fundamental process in the
	evolution of eukaryotic genomes. After duplication one copy (or both)
	can undergo divergence in sequence, expression pattern, and function.
	Two divergent copies of the ribosomal protein S13 gene (rps13) of
	chloroplast origin are found in the nucleus of the rosids Arabidopsis,
	Gossypium, and Glycine. One encodes chloroplast-imported RPS13 (nucp
	rps13), while the other encodes mitochondria-imported RPS13 (numit
	rps13). The rps13 gene has been lost from mitochondrial DNA (mt rps13)
	of many rosids. RESULTS: We studied sequence evolution of numit rps13
	in comparison with nucp rps13 in seven rosid genera. Ka/Ks analysis
	and likelihood ratio tests showed considerably higher Ka values and
	Ka/Ks ratios in numit rps13 than in nucp rps13, indicating increased
	amino acid sequence divergence in numit rps13. Two positively selected
	codons were detected in numit RPS13 in regions that are inferred
	to interact with the 16S rRNA. Several amino acids in numit RPS13
	have changed from the one present in nucp RPS13 to the one present
	in mt RPS13, showing that numit rps13 is becoming more like mt rps13.
	Comparison of expression patterns and levels of numit rps13 and nucp
	rps13 in Arabidopsis using microarray data indicated divergence in
	gene expression. We discovered that in addition to numit rps13, Malus
	(apple) contains a transcribed mt rps13 gene. To determine if partitioning
	of expression takes place between numit rps13 and mt rps13, expression
	of both copies and RNA editing of mt rps13 were examined by RT-PCR,
	qRT-PCR, and sequencing from 14 different organ types plus seedlings
	subjected to five different abiotic stresses. Co-expression of numit
	rps13 and mt rps13 was observed in all the organs and various stress
	treatments. We determined that purifying selection is acting on both
	numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence
	that numit rps13 genes in rosids have experienced adaptive sequence
	evolution and convergent evolution with mt rps13. Co-expression of
	numit rps13 and mt rps13 and purifying selection on both genes in
	Malus suggest that both are functional. The three organellar rps13
	genes in rosids provide a distinctive case of gene duplication involving
	the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes.},

	and in levels of gene expression. We show comprehensively that this
	behavior applies across many different genomes, for many different
	types of parts (DNA words, InterPro families, protein superfamilies
	and folds, pseudogene families and pseudomotifs), and for the many
	disparate attributes associated with these parts (their functions,
	interactions and expression levels). CONCLUSIONS: Power-law behavior
	provides a concise mathematical description of an important biological
	feature: the sheer dominance of a few members over the overall population.
	We present this behavior in a unified framework and propose that
	all these observations are connected to an underlying DNA duplication
	process as genomes evolved to their current state.},

	is best known for its extreme resistance to ionizing radiation; not
	only can it grow continuously in the presence of chronic radiation
	(6 kilorads/h), but also it can survive acute exposures to gamma
	radiation exceeding 1,500 kilorads without dying or undergoing induced
	mutation. These characteristics were the impetus for sequencing the
	genome of D. radiodurans and the ongoing development of its use for
	bioremediation of radioactive wastes. Although it is known that these
	multiple resistance phenotypes stem from efficient DNA repair processes,
	the mechanisms underlying these extraordinary repair capabilities
	remain poorly understood. In this work we present an extensive comparative
	sequence analysis of the Deinococcus genome. Deinococcus is the first
	representative with a completely sequenced genome from a distinct
	bacterial lineage of extremophiles, the Thermus-Deinococcus group.
	Phylogenetic tree analysis, combined with the identification of several

	that it is an ancient group with no clear affinities to any of the

	are particularly interesting because of the correlation between desiccation
	and radiation resistance. Compared to other bacteria, the D. radiodurans

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: All archaeal and many bacterial genomes contain Clustered
	Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats (CRISPR) and variable
	arrays of the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes that have been previously
	implicated in a novel form of DNA repair on the basis of comparative
	analysis of their protein product sequences. However, the proximity
	of CRISPR and cas genes strongly suggests that they have related
	functions which is hard to reconcile with the repair hypothesis.
	RESULTS: The protein sequences of the numerous cas gene products
	were classified into approximately 25 distinct protein families;
	several new functional and structural predictions are described.
	Comparative-genomic analysis of CRISPR and cas genes leads to the
	hypothesis that the CRISPR-Cas system (CASS) is a mechanism of defense
	against invading phages and plasmids that functions analogously to
	the eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) systems. Specific functional
	analogies are drawn between several components of CASS and proteins
	involved in eukaryotic RNAi, including the double-stranded RNA-specific
	helicase-nuclease (dicer), the endonuclease cleaving target mRNAs
	(slicer), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, none of
	the CASS components is orthologous to its apparent eukaryotic functional
	counterpart. It is proposed that unique inserts of CRISPR, some of
	which are homologous to fragments of bacteriophage and plasmid genes,
	function as prokaryotic siRNAs (psiRNA), by base-pairing with the
	target mRNAs and promoting their degradation or translation shutdown.
	Specific hypothetical schemes are developed for the functioning of
	the predicted prokaryotic siRNA system and for the formation of new
	CRISPR units with unique inserts encoding psiRNA conferring immunity
	to the respective newly encountered phages or plasmids. The unique
	inserts in CRISPR show virtually no similarity even between closely
	related bacterial strains which suggests their rapid turnover, on
	evolutionary scale. Corollaries of this finding are that, even among
	closely related prokaryotes, the most commonly encountered phages
	and plasmids are different and/or that the dominant phages and plasmids
	turn over rapidly. CONCLUSION: We proposed previously that Cas proteins
	comprise a novel DNA repair system. The association of the cas genes
	with CRISPR and, especially, the presence, in CRISPR units, of unique
	inserts homologous to phage and plasmid genes make us abandon this
	hypothesis. It appears most likely that CASS is a prokaryotic system
	of defense against phages and plasmids that functions via the RNAi
	mechanism. The functioning of this system seems to involve integration
	of fragments of foreign genes into archaeal and bacterial chromosomes
	yielding heritable immunity to the respective agents. However, it
	appears that this inheritance is extremely unstable on the evolutionary
	scale such that the repertoires of unique psiRNAs are completely
	replaced even in closely related prokaryotes, presumably, in response
	to rapidly changing repertoires of dominant phages and plasmids.},

	Deinococcus radiodurans was the first member of this group whose
	genome was completely sequenced. Analysis of the genome sequence
	of D. radiodurans, however, failed to identify unique DNA repair
	systems. To further delineate the genes underlying the resistance
	phenotypes, we report the whole-genome sequence of a second Deinococcus
	species, the thermophile Deinococcus geothermalis, which at its optimal
	growth temperature is as resistant to IR, UV and desiccation as D.
	radiodurans, and a comparative analysis of the two Deinococcus genomes.
	Many D. radiodurans genes previously implicated in resistance, but
	for which no sensitive phenotype was observed upon disruption, are
	absent in D. geothermalis. In contrast, most D. radiodurans genes
	whose mutants displayed a radiation-sensitive phenotype in D. radiodurans
	are conserved in D. geothermalis. Supporting the existence of a Deinococcus
	radiation response regulon, a common palindromic DNA motif was identified
	in a conserved set of genes associated with resistance, and a dedicated
	transcriptional regulator was predicted. We present the case that
	these two species evolved essentially the same diverse set of gene

	clearly define and substantially revise downward the number of uncharacterized

  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {33},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An evolutionary classification of genes from sequenced
	genomes that distinguishes between orthologs and paralogs is indispensable
	for genome annotation and evolutionary reconstruction. Shortly after
	multiple genome sequences of bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes
	became available, an attempt on such a classification was implemented
	in Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs). Rapid accumulation
	of genome sequences creates opportunities for refining COGs but also
	represents a challenge because of error amplification. One of the
	practical strategies involves construction of refined COGs for phylogenetically
	compact subsets of genomes. RESULTS: New Archaeal Clusters of Orthologous
	Genes (arCOGs) were constructed for 41 archaeal genomes (13 Crenarchaeota,
	27 Euryarchaeota and one Nanoarchaeon) using an improved procedure
	that employs a similarity tree between smaller, group-specific clusters,
	semi-automatically partitions orthology domains in multidomain proteins,
	and uses profile searches for identification of remote orthologs.
	The annotation of arCOGs is a consensus between three assignments
	based on the COGs, the CDD database, and the annotations of homologs
	in the NR database. The 7538 arCOGs, on average, cover approximately
	88\% of the genes in a genome compared to a approximately 76\% coverage
	in COGs. The finer granularity of ortholog identification in the
	arCOGs is apparent from the fact that 4538 arCOGs correspond to 2362
	COGs; approximately 40\% of the arCOGs are new. The archaeal gene
	core (protein-coding genes found in all 41 genome) consists of 166
	arCOGs. The arCOGs were used to reconstruct gene loss and gene gain
	events during archaeal evolution and gene sets of ancestral forms.
	The Last Archaeal Common Ancestor (LACA) is conservatively estimated
	to possess 996 genes compared to 1245 and 1335 genes for the last
	common ancestors of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, respectively.
	It is inferred that LACA was a chemoautotrophic hyperthermophile
	that, in addition to the core archaeal functions, encoded more idiosyncratic
	systems, e.g., the CASS systems of antivirus defense and some toxin-antitoxin
	systems. CONCLUSION: The arCOGs provide a convenient, flexible framework
	for functional annotation of archaeal genomes, comparative genomics
	and evolutionary reconstructions. Genomic reconstructions suggest
	that the last common ancestor of archaea might have been (nearly)
	as advanced as the modern archaeal hyperthermophiles. ArCOGs and
	related information are available at: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/koonin/arCOGs/.},

  year = {2009},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {19},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS, also referred
	to as TA loci) are widespread, mobile two-gene modules that can be
	viewed as selfish genetic elements because they evolved mechanisms
	to become addictive for replicons and cells in which they reside,
	but also possess "normal" cellular functions in various forms of
	stress response and management of prokaryotic population. Several
	distinct TAS of type 1, where the toxin is a protein and the antitoxin
	is an antisense RNA, and numerous, unrelated TAS of type 2, in which
	both the toxin and the antitoxin are proteins, have been experimentally
	characterized, and it is suspected that many more remain to be identified.
	RESULTS: We report a comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of
	Type 2 toxin-antitoxin systems in prokaryotes. Using sensitive methods
	for distant sequence similarity search, genome context analysis and
	a new approach for the identification of mobile two-component systems,
	we identified numerous, previously unnoticed protein families that
	are homologous to toxins and antitoxins of known type 2 TAS. In addition,
	we predict 12 new families of toxins and 13 families of antitoxins,
	and also, predict a TAS or TAS-like activity for several gene modules
	that were not previously suspected to function in that capacity.
	In particular, we present indications that the two-gene module that
	encodes a minimal nucleotidyl transferase and the accompanying HEPN
	protein, and is extremely abundant in many archaea and bacteria,
	especially, thermophiles might comprise a novel TAS. We present a
	survey of previously known and newly predicted TAS in 750 complete
	genomes of archaea and bacteria, quantitatively demonstrate the exceptional
	mobility of the TAS, and explore the network of toxin-antitoxin pairings
	that combines plasticity with selectivity. CONCLUSION: The defining
	properties of the TAS, namely, the typically small size of the toxin
	and antitoxin genes, fast evolution, and extensive horizontal mobility,
	make the task of comprehensive identification of these systems particularly
	challenging. However, these same properties can be exploited to develop
	context-based computational approaches which, combined with exhaustive
	analysis of subtle sequence similarities were employed in this work
	to substantially expand the current collection of TAS by predicting
	both previously unnoticed, derived versions of known toxins and antitoxins,
	and putative novel TAS-like systems. In a broader context, the TAS
	belong to the resistome domain of the prokaryotic mobilome which
	includes partially selfish, addictive gene cassettes involved in
	various aspects of stress response and organized under the same general
	principles as the TAS. The "selfish altruism", or "responsible selfishness",
	of TAS-like systems appears to be a defining feature of the resistome
	and an important characteristic of the entire prokaryotic pan-genome
	given that in the prokaryotic world the mobilome and the "stable"
	chromosomes form a dynamic continuum. REVIEWERS: This paper was reviewed

	A substantial fraction of eukaryotic genomes consists of paralogous
	gene families. We assess the extent of ancestral paralogy, which
	dates back to the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes, and examine
	the origins of the ancestral paralogs and their potential roles in
	the emergence of the eukaryotic cell complexity. A parsimonious reconstruction
	of ancestral gene repertoires shows that 4137 orthologous gene sets
	in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) map back to 2150 orthologous
	sets in the hypothetical first eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA)
	[paralogy quotient (PQ) of 1.92]. Analogous reconstructions show
	significantly lower levels of paralogy in prokaryotes, 1.19 for archaea
	and 1.25 for bacteria. The only functional class of eukaryotic proteins
	with a significant excess of paralogous clusters over the mean includes
	molecular chaperones and proteins with related functions. Almost
	all genes in this category underwent multiple duplications during
	early eukaryotic evolution. In structural terms, the most prominent
	sets of paralogs are superstructure-forming proteins with repetitive
	domains, such as WD-40 and TPR. In addition to the true ancestral
	paralogs which evolved via duplication at the onset of eukaryotic
	evolution, numerous pseudoparalogs were detected, i.e. homologous
	genes that apparently were acquired by early eukaryotes via different
	routes, including horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from diverse bacteria.
	The results of this study demonstrate a major increase in the level
	of gene paralogy as a hallmark of the early evolution of eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In eukaryotes, RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism
	of defense against viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating
	translation of endogenous mRNAs. The RNAi systems recognize the target
	RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or partially
	complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi
	systems are proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function
	as slicers, the nucleases that cleave the target RNA that is base-paired
	to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPR-associated
	system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is, in
	part, mechanistically analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic
	RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode homologs of Argonaute-PIWI
	proteins but their functions remain unknown. RESULTS: We present
	a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic
	neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic
	Ago/PIWI proteins always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and
	PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains, the prokaryotic Argonaute
	homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain
	is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported
	by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost
	all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated, and the
	respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases
	in putative operons. An additional, uncharacterized domain that is
	fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique signature of operons
	encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form. By contrast, almost all
	PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to be active nucleases.
	Some proteins of this group (e.g., that from Aquifex aeolicus) have
	been experimentally shown to possess nuclease activity, and are not
	typically associated with genes for other (putative) nucleases. Given
	these observations, the apparent extensive horizontal transfer of
	pAgo genes, and their common, statistically significant over-representation
	in genomic neighborhoods enriched in genes encoding proteins involved
	in the defense against phages and/or plasmids, we hypothesize that
	pAgos are key components of a novel class of defense systems. The
	PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to directly destroy virus
	or plasmid nucleic acids via their nuclease activity, whereas the
	apparently inactivated, PAZ-lacking pAgos could be structural subunits
	of protein complexes that contain, as active moieties, the putative
	nucleases that we predict to be co-expressed with these pAgos. All
	these nucleases are predicted to be DNA endonucleases, so it seems
	most probable that the putative novel phage/plasmid-defense system
	targets phage DNA rather than mRNAs. Given that in eukaryotic RNAi
	systems, the PAZ domain binds a guide RNA and positions it on the
	complementary region of the target, we further speculate that pAgos
	function on a similar principle (the guide being either DNA or RNA),
	and that the uncharacterized domain found in putative operons with
	the short forms of pAgos is a functional substitute for the PAZ domain.
	CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that pAgos are key components of a novel
	prokaryotic immune system that employs guide RNA or DNA molecules
	to degrade nucleic acids of invading mobile elements implies a functional
	analogy with the prokaryotic CASS and a direct evolutionary connection
	with eukaryotic RNAi. The predictions of the hypothesis including
	both the activities of pAgos and those of the associated endonucleases
	are readily amenable to experimental tests.},

	in these species, the G+C content of both noncoding DNA and synonymous

	of genes located in regions of very low recombination; but these
	genes only comprise 4\% of the total. In C. elegans we do not find
	any evidence for the effect of recombination on selection for codon
	bias. Computer simulations indicate that HRi poorly enhances codon
	bias if the local recombination rate is greater than the mutation
	rate. This prediction of the model is consistent with our data and

	The case of C. elegans, which is highly self-fertilizing, is discussed.

	Receptors of this neurotransmitter play a key role in important processes

	and tempo of evolution of the receptors of this neurotransmitter.
	Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships of GABA receptor
	subunits across the chordates and detail their mode of evolution
	among mammals. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our analyses support two major
	monophyletic clades: one clade containing GABA(A) receptor alpha,
	gamma, and epsilon subunits, and another one containing GABA(A) receptor
	rho, beta, delta, theta, and pi subunits. The presence of GABA receptor
	subunits from each of the major clades in the Ciona intestinalis
	genome suggests that these ancestral duplication events occurred
	before the divergence of urochordates. However, while gene divergence
	proceeded at similar rates on most receptor subunits, we show that
	the mammalian-specific subunits theta and epsilon experienced an
	episode of positive selection and of relaxed constraints, respectively,
	after the duplication event. Sites putatively under positive selection
	are placed on a three-dimensional model obtained by homology-modeling.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an early divergence of the GABA
	receptor subunits, before the split from urochordates. We show that
	functional changes occurred in the lineages leading to the mammalian-specific
	subunit theta, and we identify the amino acid sites putatively responsible
	for the functional divergence. We discuss potential consequences

	finding and illustrate it using a simple model in which metabolic
	and regulatory networks of prokaryotes are shaped by horizontal gene
	transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways. Adapting to a new environmental
	condition monitored by a new transcription factor (e.g., learning
	to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new enzymes and
	reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the
	repertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger,
	it can reuse its enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer
	new ones to master each new task. From this observation, it logically
	follows that the number of functional tasks and their regulators
	increases faster than linearly with the total number of genes encoding
	enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because of a loss of a nutrient
	from the environment, followed by deletion of its regulator and all
	enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple models of
	network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and reproducing

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplication followed by the functional divergence
	of the resulting pair of paralogous proteins is a major force shaping
	molecular networks in living organisms. Recent species-wide data
	for protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulations
	allow us to assess the effect of gene duplication on robustness and
	plasticity of these molecular networks. RESULTS: We demonstrate that
	the transcriptional regulation of duplicated genes in baker's yeast
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae diverges fast so that on average they lose
	3\% of common transcription factors for every 1\% divergence of their
	amino acid sequences. The set of protein-protein interaction partners
	of their protein products changes at a slower rate exhibiting a broad
	plateau for amino acid sequence similarity above 70\%. The stability
	of functional roles of duplicated genes at such relatively low sequence
	similarity is further corroborated by their ability to substitute
	for each other in single gene knockout experiments in yeast and RNAi
	experiments in a nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We also quantified
	the divergence rate of physical interaction neighborhoods of paralogous
	proteins in a bacterium Helicobacter pylori and a fly Drosophila
	melanogaster. However, in the absence of system-wide data on transcription
	factors' binding in these organisms we could not compare this rate
	to that of transcriptional regulation of duplicated genes. CONCLUSIONS:
	For all molecular networks studied in this work we found that even
	the most distantly related paralogous proteins with amino acid sequence
	identities around 20\% on average have more similar positions within
	a network than a randomly selected pair of proteins. For yeast we
	also found that the upstream regulation of genes evolves more rapidly
	than downstream functions of their protein products. This is in accordance
	with a view which puts regulatory changes as one of the main driving
	forces of the evolution. In this context a very important open question
	is to what extent our results obtained for homologous genes within
	a single species (paralogs) carries over to homologous proteins in
	different species (orthologs).},

	a new version of the functional-structural model GREENLAB has been

	Emergent properties of this model were revealed by simulations, in
	particular the automatic generation of rhythms in plant development.
	Such behaviour can be observed in natural phenomena such as the appearance
	of fruit (cucumber or capsicum plants, for example) or branch formation
	in trees. METHODS: In the model, a single variable, the source-sink
	ratio controls different events in plant architecture. In particular,
	the number of fruits and branch formation are determined as increasing
	functions of this ratio. For some sets of well-chosen parameters
	of the model, the dynamical evolution of the ratio during plant growth
	generates rhythms. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cyclic patterns in
	branch formation or fruit appearance emerge without being forced
	by the model. The model is based on the theory of discrete dynamical
	systems. The mathematical formalism helps us to explain rhythm generation
	and to control the behaviour of the system. Rhythms can appear during
	both the exponential and stabilized phases of growth, but the causes
	are different as shown by an analytical study of the system. Simulated
	plant behaviours are very close to those observed on real plants.
	With a small number of parameters, the model gives very interesting
	results from a qualitative point of view. It will soon be subjected
	to experimental data to estimate the model parameters.},

	There are markedly different patterns of variation between the paralogs

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent genomic and bioinformatic advances have motivated
	the development of numerous network models intending to describe

	most cases the success of a model has been evaluated by how well
	it reproduces a few key features of the real-world data, such as
	degree distributions, mean geodesic lengths, and clustering coefficients.
	Often pairs of models can reproduce these features with indistinguishable
	fidelity despite being generated by vastly different mechanisms.
	In such cases, these few target features are insufficient to distinguish
	which of the different models best describes real world networks
	of interest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing
	algorithms for network generation offers a predictive description
	of the networks inspiring them. RESULTS: We present a method to assess
	systematically which of a set of proposed network generation algorithms
	gives the most accurate description of a given biological network.
	To derive discriminative classifiers, we construct a mapping from
	the set of all graphs to a high-dimensional (in principle infinite-dimensional)
	"word space". This map defines an input space for classification
	schemes which allow us to state unambiguously which models are most
	descriptive of a given network of interest. Our training sets include

	schemes best describe the E. coli genetic network, the S. cerevisiae
	protein interaction network, and the C. elegans neuronal network,
	out of a set of network models including a linear preferential attachment
	model and a small-world model. CONCLUSIONS: Our method is a first

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {2},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative analysis of sequenced genomes reveals numerous
	instances of apparent horizontal gene transfer (HGT), at least in
	prokaryotes, and indicates that lineage-specific gene loss might
	have been even more common in evolution. This complicates the notion
	of a species tree, which needs to be re-interpreted as a prevailing
	evolutionary trend, rather than the full depiction of evolution,
	and makes reconstruction of ancestral genomes a non-trivial task.
	RESULTS: We addressed the problem of constructing parsimonious scenarios
	for individual sets of orthologous genes given a species tree. The
	orthologous sets were taken from the database of Clusters of Orthologous
	Groups of proteins (COGs). We show that the phyletic patterns (patterns
	of presence-absence in completely sequenced genomes) of almost 90\%
	of the COGs are inconsistent with the hypothetical species tree.
	Algorithms were developed to reconcile the phyletic patterns with
	the species tree by postulating gene loss, COG emergence and HGT
	(the latter two classes of events were collectively treated as gene
	gains). We prove that each of these algorithms produces a parsimonious
	evolutionary scenario, which can be represented as mapping of loss
	and gain events on the species tree. The distribution of the evolutionary
	events among the tree nodes substantially depends on the underlying
	assumptions of the reconciliation algorithm, e.g. whether or not
	independent gene gains (gain after loss after gain) are permitted.
	Biological considerations suggest that, on average, gene loss might
	be a more likely event than gene gain. Therefore different gain penalties
	were used and the resulting series of reconstructed gene sets for
	the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of the extant life forms
	were analysed. The number of genes in the reconstructed LUCA gene
	sets grows as the gain penalty increases. However, qualitative examination
	of the LUCA versions reconstructed with different gain penalties
	indicates that, even with a gain penalty of 1 (equal weights assigned
	to a gain and a loss), the set of 572 genes assigned to LUCA might
	be nearly sufficient to sustain a functioning organism. Under this
	gain penalty value, the numbers of horizontal gene transfer and gene
	loss events are nearly identical. This result holds true for two
	alternative topologies of the species tree and even under random
	shuffling of the tree. Therefore, the results seem to be compatible
	with approximately equal likelihoods of HGT and gene loss in the
	evolution of prokaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: The notion that gene loss
	and HGT are major aspects of prokaryotic evolution was supported
	by quantitative analysis of the mapping of the phyletic patterns
	of COGs onto a hypothetical species tree. Algorithms were developed
	for constructing parsimonious evolutionary scenarios, which include
	gene loss and gain events, for orthologous gene sets, given a species
	tree. This analysis shows, contrary to expectations, that the number
	of predicted HGT events that occurred during the evolution of prokaryotes
	might be approximately the same as the number of gene losses. The
	approach to the reconstruction of evolutionary scenarios employed
	here is conservative with regard to the detection of HGT because
	only patterns of gene presence-absence in sequenced genomes are taken
	into account. In reality, horizontal transfer might have contributed
	to the evolution of many other genes also, which makes it a dominant
	force in prokaryotic evolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Across all sequenced bacterial genomes, the number of
	domains nc in different functional categories c scales as a power-law
	in the total number of domains n, i.e. nc proportional n(alpha)c,
	with exponents alpha(c) that vary across functional categories. Here
	we investigate the implications of these scaling laws for the evolution
	of domain-content in bacterial genomes and derive the simplest evolutionary
	model consistent with these scaling laws. RESULTS: We show that,
	using only an assumption of time invariance, the scaling laws uniquely
	determine the relative rates of domain additions and deletions across
	all functional categories and evolutionary lineages. In particular,
	the model predicts that the rate of additions and deletions of domains
	of category c is proportional to the number of domains nc currently
	in the genome and we discuss the implications of this observation
	for the role of horizontal transfer in genome evolution. Second,
	in addition to being proportional to nc, the rate of additions and
	deletions of domains of category c is proportional to a category-dependent
	constant rho(c), which is the same for all evolutionary lineages.
	This 'evolutionary potential' rho(c) represents the relative probability
	for additions/deletions of domains of category c to be fixed in the
	population by selection and is predicted to equal the scaling exponent
	alpha(c). By comparing the domain content of 93 pairs of closely-related
	genomes from all over the phylogenetic tree of bacteria, we demonstrate
	that the model's predictions are supported by available genome-sequence
	data. CONCLUSION: Our results establish a direct quantitative connection
	between the scaling of domain numbers with genome size, and the rate
	of addition and deletions of domains during short evolutionary time

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The F- and V-type ATPases are rotary molecular machines
	that couple translocation of protons or sodium ions across the membrane
	to the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. Both the F-type (found in
	most bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts) and V-type
	(found in archaea, some bacteria, and eukaryotic vacuoles) ATPases
	can translocate either protons or sodium ions. The prevalent proton-dependent
	ATPases are generally viewed as the primary form of the enzyme whereas
	the sodium-translocating ATPases of some prokaryotes are usually
	construed as an exotic adaptation to survival in extreme environments.
	RESULTS: We combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to clarify
	the evolutionary relation between the proton- and sodium-translocating
	ATPases. A comparison of the structures of the membrane-embedded
	oligomeric proteolipid rings of sodium-dependent F- and V-ATPases
	reveals nearly identical sets of amino acids involved in sodium binding.
	We show that the sodium-dependent ATPases are scattered among proton-dependent
	ATPases in both the F- and the V-branches of the phylogenetic tree.
	CONCLUSION: Barring convergent emergence of the same set of ligands
	in several lineages, these findings indicate that the use of sodium
	gradient for ATP synthesis is the ancestral modality of membrane
	bioenergetics. Thus, a primitive, sodium-impermeable but proton-permeable
	cell membrane that harboured a set of sodium-transporting enzymes
	appears to have been the evolutionary predecessor of the more structurally
	demanding proton-tight membranes. The use of proton as the coupling
	ion appears to be a later innovation that emerged on several independent
	occasions.},

	Bayesian methods with regard to selection of best-fit models of fruiting-body
	evolution and hypothesis testing of ancestral states on a real-life
	data set of a physiological trait (autodigestion) in the family Psathyrellaceae.
	Our phylogenies are based on the first multigene data set generated
	for the family. Two different coding regimes (binary and multistate)
	and two data sets differing in taxon sampling density are examined.
	The Bayesian method outperformed Maximum Likelihood with regard to
	statistical power in all analyses. This is particularly evident if
	the signal in the data is weak, i.e. in cases when the ML approach
	does not provide support to choose among competing hypotheses. Results
	based on binary and multistate coding differed only modestly, although
	it was evident that multistate analyses were less conclusive in all
	cases. It seems that increased taxon sampling density has favourable
	effects on inference of ancestral states, while model parameters
	are influenced to a smaller extent. The model best fitting our data
	implies that the rate of losses of deliquescence equals zero, although

	as tools for genome annotation and are far from being optimal for
	this purpose. We used the database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups
	of proteins (COGs) to reannotate the genomes of two archaea, Aeropyrum
	pernix, the first member of the Crenarchaea to be sequenced, and
	Pyrococcus abyssi. RESULTS: A. pernix and P. abyssi proteins were
	assigned to COGs using the COGNITOR program; the results were verified
	on a case-by-case basis and augmented by additional database searches
	using the PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN programs. Functions were predicted
	for over 300 proteins from A. pernix, which could not be assigned
	a function using conventional methods with a conservative sequence
	similarity threshold, an approximately 50\% increase compared to
	the original annotation. A. pernix shares most of the conserved core
	of proteins that were previously identified in the Euryarchaeota.
	Cluster analysis or distance matrix tree construction based on the
	co-occurrence of genomes in COGs showed that A. pernix forms a distinct
	group within the archaea, although grouping with the two species
	of Pyrococci, indicative of similar repertoires of conserved genes,
	was observed. No indication of a specific relationship between Crenarchaeota
	and eukaryotes was obtained in these analyses. Several proteins that
	are conserved in Euryarchaeota and most bacteria are unexpectedly
	missing in A. pernix, including the entire set of de novo purine
	biosynthesis enzymes, the GTPase FtsZ (a key component of the bacterial
	and euryarchaeal cell-division machinery), and the tRNA-specific
	pseudouridine synthase, previously considered universal. A. pernix
	is represented in 48 COGs that do not contain any euryarchaeal members.
	Many of these proteins are TCA cycle and electron transport chain
	enzymes, reflecting the aerobic lifestyle of A. pernix. CONCLUSIONS:
	Special-purpose databases organized on the basis of phylogenetic
	analysis and carefully curated with respect to known and predicted
	protein functions provide for a significant improvement in genome
	annotation. A differential genome display approach helps in a systematic
	investigation of common and distinct features of gene repertoires
	and in some cases reveals unexpected connections that may be indicative
	of functional similarities between phylogenetically distant organisms
	and of lateral gene exchange.},

  abstract = {Charles Darwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural
	selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning.
	Two of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism.
	Early molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions
	in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change
	of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. This suggestion
	generated an intense controversy over selectionism and neutralism.
	This controversy is partially caused by Kimura's definition of neutrality,
	which was too strict (|2Ns|< or =1). If we define neutral mutations
	as the mutations that do not change the function of gene products
	appreciably, many controversies disappear because slightly deleterious
	and slightly advantageous mutations are engulfed by neutral mutations.
	The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution to
	that of synonymous substitution is a useful quantity to study positive
	Darwinian selection operating at highly variable genetic loci, but
	it does not necessarily detect adaptively important codons. Previously,
	multigene families were thought to evolve following the model of
	concerted evolution, but new evidence indicates that most of them
	evolve by a birth-and-death process of duplicate genes. It is now
	clear that most phenotypic characters or genetic systems such as
	the adaptive immune system in vertebrates are controlled by the interaction
	of a number of multigene families, which are often evolutionarily
	related and are subject to birth-and-death evolution. Therefore,
	it is important to study the mechanisms of gene family interaction
	for understanding phenotypic evolution. Because gene duplication
	occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution contains some
	fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors also play an
	important role. The randomness of phenotypic evolution is qualitatively
	different from allele frequency changes by random genetic drift.
	However, there is some similarity between phenotypic and molecular
	evolution with respect to functional or environmental constraints
	and evolutionary rate. It appears that mutation (including gene duplication
	and other DNA changes) is the driving force of evolution at both
	the genic and the phenotypic levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationships between proteins are often asymmetric:
	one protein (A) depends for its function on another protein (B),
	but the second protein does not depend on the first. In metabolic
	networks there are multiple pathways that converge into one central
	pathway. The enzymes in the converging pathways depend on the enzymes
	in the central pathway, but the enzymes in the latter do not depend
	on any specific enzyme in the converging pathways. Asymmetric relations
	are analogous to the "if->then" logical relation where A implies
	B, but B does not imply A (A->B). RESULTS: We show that the majority
	of relationships between enzymes in metabolic flux models of metabolism
	in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are asymmetric.
	We show furthermore that these asymmetric relationships are reflected
	in the expression of the genes encoding those enzymes, the effect
	of gene knockouts and the evolution of genomes. From the asymmetric
	relative dependency, one would expect that the gene that is relatively
	independent (B) can occur without the other dependent gene (A), but
	not the reverse. Indeed, when only one gene of an A->B pair is expressed,
	is essential, is present in a genome after an evolutionary gain or
	loss, it tends to be the independent gene (B). This bias is strongest
	for genes encoding proteins whose asymmetric relationship is evolutionarily
	conserved. CONCLUSIONS: The asymmetric relations between proteins
	that arise from the system properties of metabolic networks affect
	gene expression, the relative effect of gene knockouts and genome
	evolution in a predictable manner.},

	The approach used is based on comparing the evolutionary distances

	was defined as the median of the distribution of the distances between
	all one-to-one orthologs. Under the clock-like model, the points

	expected to fit a straight line. A statistical technique to identify
	significant deviations from the clock-like behavior is described.
	For several hundred analyzed orthologous sets representing three
	well-defined bacterial lineages, the alpha-Proteobacteria, the gamma-Proteobacteria,
	and the Bacillus-Clostridium group, the clock-like null hypothesis
	could not be rejected for approximately 70\% of the sets, whereas

	analysis of the genes with the strongest deviations indicated that

	horizontal gene transfer, xenologous gene displacement, in which
	a gene is displaced by an ortholog from a different lineage. The
	remaining deviations from the clock-like model could be explained
	by lineage-specific acceleration of evolution. The results indicate
	that although xenologous gene displacement is a major force in bacterial

	gene loss, are typically subjected to relatively weak purifying selection,
	presumably owing to relatively small effective population sizes and
	frequent bottlenecks. However, no evidence of genome streamlining
	caused by strong selective pressure was found in any of the ATGCs.
	On the contrary, a significant positive correlation between the genome
	size, as well as gene size, and selective pressure was observed,
	although a variety of free-living prokaryotes with very close selective
	pressures span nearly the entire range of genome sizes. In addition,
	we examined the connections between the sequence evolution rate and
	other genomic features. Although gene order changes much faster than
	protein sequences during the evolution of prokaryotes, a strong positive
	correlation was observed between the "rearrangement distance" and
	the amino acid distance, suggesting that at least some of the events
	leading to genome rearrangement are subjected to the same type of
	selective constraints as the evolution of amino acid sequences.},

  title = {Evolution of the genetic code: partial optimization of a random code
	for robustness to translation error in a rugged fitness landscape.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {24},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard genetic code table has a distinctly non-random
	structure, with similar amino acids often encoded by codons series
	that differ by a single nucleotide substitution, typically, in the
	third or the first position of the codon. It has been repeatedly
	argued that this structure of the code results from selective optimization
	for robustness to translation errors such that translational misreading
	has the minimal adverse effect. Indeed, it has been shown in several
	studies that the standard code is more robust than a substantial
	majority of random codes. However, it remains unclear how much evolution
	the standard code underwent, what is the level of optimization, and
	what is the likely starting point. RESULTS: We explored possible
	evolutionary trajectories of the genetic code within a limited domain
	of the vast space of possible codes. Only those codes were analyzed
	for robustness to translation error that possess the same block structure
	and the same degree of degeneracy as the standard code. This choice
	of a small part of the vast space of possible codes is based on the
	notion that the block structure of the standard code is a consequence
	of the structure of the complex between the cognate tRNA and the
	codon in mRNA where the third base of the codon plays a minimum role
	as a specificity determinant. Within this part of the fitness landscape,
	a simple evolutionary algorithm, with elementary evolutionary steps
	comprising swaps of four-codon or two-codon series, was employed
	to investigate the optimization of codes for the maximum attainable
	robustness. The properties of the standard code were compared to
	the properties of four sets of codes, namely, purely random codes,
	random codes that are more robust than the standard code, and two
	sets of codes that resulted from optimization of the first two sets.
	The comparison of these sets of codes with the standard code and
	its locally optimized version showed that, on average, optimization
	of random codes yielded evolutionary trajectories that converged
	at the same level of robustness to translation errors as the optimization
	path of the standard code; however, the standard code required considerably
	fewer steps to reach that level than an average random code. When
	evolution starts from random codes whose fitness is comparable to
	that of the standard code, they typically reach much higher level
	of optimization than the standard code, i.e., the standard code is
	much closer to its local minimum (fitness peak) than most of the
	random codes with similar levels of robustness. Thus, the standard
	genetic code appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory
	from a random point (code) about half the way to the summit of the
	local peak. The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be
	extremely rugged, containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution
	of heights, and the standard code is relatively unremarkable, being
	located on the slope of a moderate-height peak. CONCLUSION: The standard
	code appears to be the result of partial optimization of a random
	code for robustness to errors of translation. The reason the code
	is not fully optimized could be the trade-off between the beneficial
	effect of increasing robustness to translation errors and the deleterious
	effect of codon series reassignment that becomes increasingly severe
	with growing complexity of the evolving system. Thus, evolution of
	the code can be represented as a combination of adaptation and frozen
	accident.},

	also complicates genome-based reconstruction of the metabolic pathways
	in a variety of organisms. In 1998, a systematic search for analogous
	enzymes resulted in the identification of 105 Enzyme Commission (EC)
	numbers that included two or more proteins without detectable sequence
	similarity to each other, including 34 EC nodes where proteins were
	known (or predicted) to have distinct structural folds, indicating
	independent evolutionary origins. In the past 12 years, many putative
	non-homologous isofunctional enzymes were identified in newly sequenced
	genomes. In addition, efforts in structural genomics resulted in
	a vastly improved structural coverage of proteomes, providing for
	definitive assessment of (non)homologous relationships between proteins.
	RESULTS: We report the results of a comprehensive search for non-homologous

  volume = {4},
  pages = {R55},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shuffling and disruption of operons and horizontal gene
	transfer are major contributions to the new, dynamic view of prokaryotic
	evolution. Under the 'selfish operon' hypothesis, operons are viewed
	as mobile genetic entities that are constantly disseminated via horizontal
	gene transfer, although their retention could be favored by the advantage
	of coregulation of functionally linked genes. Here we apply comparative
	genomics and phylogenetic analysis to examine horizontal transfer
	of entire operons versus displacement of individual genes within
	operons by horizontally acquired orthologs and independent assembly
	of the same or similar operons from genes with different phylogenetic
	affinities. RESULTS: Since a substantial number of operons have been
	identified experimentally in only a few model bacteria, evolutionarily
	conserved gene strings were analyzed as surrogates of operons. The
	phylogenetic affinities within these predicted operons were assessed
	first by sequence similarity analysis and then by phylogenetic analysis,
	including statistical tests of tree topology. Numerous cases of apparent
	horizontal transfer of entire operons were detected. However, it
	was shown that apparent horizontal transfer of individual genes or
	arrays of genes within operons is not uncommon either and results
	in xenologous gene displacement in situ, that is, displacement of
	an ancestral gene by a horizontally transferred ortholog from a taxonomically
	distant organism without change of the local gene organization. On
	rarer occasions, operons might have evolved via independent assembly,
	in part from horizontally acquired genes. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery
	of in situ gene displacement shows that combination of rampant horizontal
	gene transfer with selection for preservation of operon structure
	provides for events in prokaryotic evolution that, a priori, seem
	improbable. These findings also emphasize that not all aspects of
	operon evolution are selfish, with operon integrity maintained by
	purifying selection at the organism level.},

  pages = {57},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans belong
	to a distinct bacterial clade but have remarkably different phenotypes.
	T. thermophilus is a thermophile, which is relatively sensitive to
	ionizing radiation and desiccation, whereas D. radiodurans is a mesophile,
	which is highly radiation- and desiccation-resistant. Here we present
	an in-depth comparison of the genomes of these two related but differently
	adapted bacteria. RESULTS: By reconstructing the evolution of Thermus
	and Deinococcus after the divergence from their common ancestor,
	we demonstrate a high level of post-divergence gene flux in both
	lineages. Various aspects of the adaptation to high temperature in
	Thermus can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer from archaea
	and thermophilic bacteria; many of the horizontally transferred genes
	are located on the single megaplasmid of Thermus. In addition, the
	Thermus lineage has lost a set of genes that are still present in
	Deinococcus and many other mesophilic bacteria but are not common
	among thermophiles. By contrast, Deinococcus seems to have acquired
	numerous genes related to stress response systems from various bacteria.
	A comparison of the distribution of orthologous genes among the four
	partitions of the Deinococcus genome and the two partitions of the
	Thermus genome reveals homology between the Thermus megaplasmid (pTT27)
	and Deinococcus megaplasmid (DR177). CONCLUSION: After the radiation
	from their common ancestor, the Thermus and Deinococcus lineages
	have taken divergent paths toward their distinct lifestyles. In addition
	to extensive gene loss, Thermus seems to have acquired numerous genes
	from thermophiles, which likely was the decisive contribution to
	its thermophilic adaptation. By contrast, Deinococcus lost few genes
	but seems to have acquired many bacterial genes that apparently enhanced
	its ability to survive different kinds of environmental stresses.
	Notwithstanding the accumulation of horizontally transferred genes,
	we also show that the single megaplasmid of Thermus and the DR177
	megaplasmid of Deinococcus are homologous and probably were inherited
	from the common ancestor of these bacteria.},

	evolutionary relationships of representative VH genes from diverse
	organisms of vertebrates were studied by constructing a phylogenetic

	into group A, B, C, D, and E genes. All VH genes from cartilaginous
	fishes such as sharks and skates from a monophyletic group and belong
	to group E, whereas group D consists of bony-fish VH genes. By contrast,

	suggests that mammalian VH genes are classified into three clusters--i.e.,
	mammalian clans I, II, and III-and that these clans have coexisted
	in the genome for >400 Myr. To study the short-term evolution of

	There is little indication that the VH gene family has been subject

  year = {2002},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {451--483},
  abstract = {Gene and genome duplications have given rise to enormous variability
	among species in the number of genes within their genomes. Gene copies
	have in turn played important roles in adaptation, having been implicated
	in the evolution of the immune response, insecticide resistance,
	efficient protein synthesis, and vertebrate body plans. In this chapter,
	we discuss the life history of gene duplications, from their first
	appearance within a population, through the period during which they
	rise in frequency or disappear, to their long-term fate. At each
	phase, we discuss the evolutionary processes that have influenced
	the dynamics of gene duplications and shaped their ultimate roles
	within a population. We argue that there is no evidence that organisms
	have evolved strategies to promote gene duplication in order to permit
	adaptive evolution. In contrast, many mechanisms exist to silence
	or eliminate duplicated genes, suggesting that selection has acted
	largely to reduce the rate of gene duplication. We also argue that
	natural selection has functioned as an effective sieve, increasing
	the representation of beneficial gene duplicates among those that
	establish within a population and that play a long-term role in evolution.
	To refine our understanding of how selection acts on new gene duplications,
	we provide a model incorporating a single-copy gene, its gene duplicate,
	and selection either favoring heterozygotes or eliminating deleterious
	mutations. Although both forms of selection can increase the initial
	rate of spread of a gene duplicate, the efficacy with which they
	do so differs dramatically. Heterozygote advantage always increases
	the rate of spread and can have a large impact. In contrast, masking
	deleterious mutations never has a large effect on the rate of spread
	of the duplicate, and this minor effect can be negative as well as
	positive. In both cases, the degree of linkage between the two gene
	copies affects the rate of spread of the duplication. Finally, we
	discuss evolutionary processes that occur over longer periods after
	a gene duplication has become established within a population. These
	long-term processes include maintenance, inactivation, and diversification
	in function. Consideration of each of the short-term and long-term
	processes affecting duplicated genes illustrates the subtle ways
	in which selection has acted to shape genomic structure.},

  abstract = {Optimization theory has been used to analyze evolutionary adaptation.
	This theory has explained many features of biological systems, from
	the genetic code to animal behavior. However, these systems show
	important deviations from optimality. Typically, these deviations
	are large in some particular components of the system, whereas others
	seem to be almost optimal. Deviations from optimality may be due
	to many factors in evolution, including stochastic effects and finite
	time, that may not allow the system to reach the ideal optimum. However,
	we still expect the system to have a higher probability of reaching
	a state with a higher value of the proposed indirect measure of fitness.
	In systems of many components, this implies that the largest deviations
	are expected in those components with less impact on the indirect
	measure of fitness. Here, we show that this simple probabilistic
	rule explains deviations from optimality in two very different biological
	systems. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this rule successfully explains
	the experimental deviations of the position of neurons from the configuration
	of minimal wiring cost. In Escherichia coli, the probabilistic rule
	correctly obtains the structure of the experimental deviations of
	metabolic fluxes from the configuration that maximizes biomass production.
	This approach is proposed to explain or predict more data than optimization
	theory while using no extra parameters. Thus, it can also be used
	to find and refine hypotheses about which constraints have shaped
	biological structures in evolution.},

  pages = {S16},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report an analysis of a protein network of functionally
	linked proteins, identified from a phylogenetic statistical analysis
	of complete eukaryotic genomes. Phylogenetic methods identify pairs
	of proteins that co-evolve on a phylogenetic tree, and have been
	shown to have a high probability of correctly identifying known functional
	links. RESULTS: The eukaryotic correlated evolution network we derive
	displays the familiar power law scaling of connectivity. We introduce
	the use of explicit phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the ancestral
	presence or absence of proteins at the interior nodes of a phylogeny
	of eukaryote species. We find that the connectivity distribution
	of proteins at the point they arise on the tree and join the network
	follows a power law, as does the connectivity distribution of proteins
	at the time they are lost from the network. Proteins resident in
	the network acquire connections over time, but we find no evidence
	that 'preferential attachment'--the phenomenon of newly acquired
	connections in the network being more likely to be made to proteins
	with large numbers of connections--influences the network structure.
	We derive a 'variable rate of attachment' model in which proteins
	vary in their propensity to form network interactions independently
	of how many connections they have or of the total number of connections
	in the network, and show how this model can produce apparent power-law
	scaling without preferential attachment. CONCLUSION: A few simple
	rules can explain the topological structure and evolutionary changes
	to protein-interaction networks: most change is concentrated in satellite
	proteins of low connectivity and small phenotypic effect, and proteins
	differ in their propensity to form attachments. Given these rules
	of assembly, power law scaled networks naturally emerge from simple
	principles of selection, yielding protein interaction networks that
	retain a high-degree of robustness on short time scales and evolvability
	on longer evolutionary time scales.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of gene duplication is an important parameter
	in the study of evolution, but the influence of gene conversion and
	technical problems have confounded previous attempts to provide a
	satisfying estimate. We propose a new strategy to estimate the rate
	that involves separate quantification of the rates of two different
	mechanisms of gene duplication and subsequent combination of the
	two rates, based on their respective contributions to the overall
	gene duplication rate. RESULTS: Previous estimates of gene duplication
	rates are based on small gene families. Therefore, to assess the
	applicability of this to families of all sizes, we looked at both
	two-copy gene families and the entire genome. We studied unequal
	crossover and retrotransposition, and found that these mechanisms
	of gene duplication are largely independent and account for a substantial
	amount of duplicated genes. Unequal crossover contributed more to
	duplications in the entire genome than retrotransposition did, but
	this contribution was significantly less in two-copy gene families,
	and duplicated genes arising from this mechanism are more likely
	to be retained. Combining rates of duplication using the two mechanisms,
	we estimated the overall rates to be from approximately 0.515 to
	1.49 x 10(-3) per gene per million years in human, and from approximately
	1.23 to 4.23 x 10(-3) in mouse. The rates estimated from two-copy
	gene families are always lower than those from the entire genome,
	and so it is not appropriate to use small families to estimate the
	rate for the entire genome. CONCLUSION: We present a novel strategy
	for estimating gene duplication rates. Our results show that different
	mechanisms contribute differently to the evolution of small and large
	gene families.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplications are a source of new genes and protein
	functions. The innovative role of duplication events makes families
	of paralogous genes an interesting target for studies in evolutionary
	biology. Here we study global trends in the evolution of human genes
	that resulted from recent duplications. RESULTS: The pressure of
	negative selection is weaker during a short time immediately after
	a duplication event. Roughly one fifth of genes in paralogous gene
	families are evolving asymmetrically: one of the proteins encoded
	by two closest paralogs accumulates amino acid substitutions significantly
	faster than its partner. This asymmetry cannot be explained by differences
	in gene expression levels. In asymmetric gene pairs the number of
	deleterious mutations is increased in one copy, while decreased in
	the other copy as compared to genes constituting non-asymmetrically
	evolving pairs. The asymmetry in the rate of synonymous substitutions
	is much weaker and not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of
	negative selection pressure over time after a duplication event seems
	to be a major trend in the evolution of human paralogous gene families.
	The observed asymmetry in the evolution of paralogous genes shows
	that in many cases one of two gene copies remains practically unchanged,
	while the other accumulates functional mutations. This supports the
	hypothesis that slowly evolving gene copies preserve their original
	functions, while fast evolving copies obtain new specificities or
	functions.},

  abstract = {The first-degree power-law polynomial function is frequently used
	to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals. This
	function has been used in hydrodynamics-based metabolic studies to
	evaluate important parameters of energetic costs, such as the standard
	metabolic rate and the drag power indices. In theory, however, the
	power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than one can
	be used to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals.
	In fact, activity metabolism has been described by the conventional
	exponential function and the cubic polynomial function, although
	only the power-law polynomial function models drag power since it
	conforms to hydrodynamic laws. Consequently, the first-degree power-law
	polynomial function yields incorrect parameter values of energetic
	costs if activity metabolism is governed by the power-law polynomial
	function of any degree greater than one. This issue is important
	in bioenergetics because correct comparisons of energetic costs among
	different steady swimming animals cannot be made unless the degree
	of the power-law polynomial function derives from activity metabolism.
	In other words, a hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity
	metabolism is a power-law polynomial function of any degree greater
	than or equal to one. Therefore, the degree of the power-law polynomial
	function should be treated as a parameter, not as a constant. This
	new treatment not only conforms to hydrodynamic laws, but also ensures
	correct comparisons of energetic costs among different steady swimming
	animals. Furthermore, the exponential power-law function, which is
	a new hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity metabolism,
	is a special case of the power-law polynomial function. Hence, the
	link between the hydrodynamics of steady swimming and the exponential-based
	metabolic model is defined.},

  abstract = {Soil denitrification is a highly variable process that appears to
	be lognormally distributed. This variability is manifested by large
	sample coefficients of variation for replicate estimates of soil
	core denitrification rates. Deterministic models for soil denitrification
	have been proposed in the past, but none of these models predicts
	the approximate lognormality exhibited by natural denitrification
	rate estimates. In this study, probabilistic (stochastic) models
	were developed to understand how positively skewed distributions
	for field denitrification rate estimates result from the combined
	influences of variables known to affect denitrification. Three stochastic
	models were developed to describe the distribution of measured soil
	core denitrification rates. The driving variables used for all the
	models were denitrification enzyme activity and CO(2) production
	rates. The three models were distinguished by the functional relationships
	combining these driving variables. The functional relationships used
	were (i) a second-order model (model 1), (ii) a second-order model
	with a threshold (model 2), and (iii) a second-order saturation model
	(model 3). The parameters of the models were estimated by using 12
	separate data sets (24 replicates per set), and their abilities to
	predict denitrification rate distributions were evaluated by using
	three additional independent data sets of 180 replicates each. Model
	2 was the best because it produced distributions of denitrification
	rate which were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from distributions
	of measured denitrification rates. The generality of this model is
	unknown, but it accurately predicted the mean denitrification rates
	and accounted for the stochastic nature of this variable at the site
	studied. The approach used in this study may be applicable to other

  abstract = {For the last thirty years, progress in the field of physics, known
	as "Chaos theory"--or more precisely: non-linear dynamical systems
	theory--has increased our understanding of complex systems dynamics.
	This framework's formalism is general enough to be applied in other
	domains, such as biology or psychology, where complex systems are
	the rule rather than the exception. Our goal is to show here that
	this framework can become a valuable tool in scientific fields such
	as neuroscience and psychiatry where objects possess natural time
	dependency (i.e. dynamical properties) and non-linear characteristics.
	The application of non-linear dynamics concepts on these topics is
	more precise than a loose metaphor and can throw a new light on mental
	functioning and dysfunctioning. A class of neural networks (recurrent
	neural networks) constitutes an example of the implementation of
	the dynamical system concept and provides models of cognitive processes
	(15). The state of activity of the network is represented in its
	state space and the time evolution of this state is a trajectory
	in this space. After a period of time those networks settle on an
	equilibrium (a kind of attractor). The strength of connections between
	neurons define the number and relations between those attractors.
	The attractors of the network are usually interpreted as "mental
	representations". When an initial condition is imposed to the network,
	the evolution towards an attractor is considered as a model of information
	processing (27). This information processing is not defined in a
	symbolic manner but is a result of the interaction between distributed
	elements. Several properties of dynamical models can be used to define
	a way where the symbolic properties emerge from physical and dynamical
	properties (28) and thus they can be candidates for the definition
	of the emergence of mental properties on the basis of neuronal dynamics
	(42). Nevertheless, mental properties can also be considered as the
	result of an underlying dynamics without explicit mention of the
	neuronal one (47). In that case, dynamical tools can be used to elucidate
	the Freudian psychodynamics (34, 35). Recurrent neuronal networks
	have been used to propose interpretation of several mental dysfunctions
	(12). For example in the case of schizophrenia, it has been proposed
	that troubles in the cortical pruning during development (13) may
	cause a decrease in neural network storage ability and lead to the
	creation of spurious attractors. Those attractors do not correspond
	to stored memories and attract a large amount of initial conditions:
	they were thus associated to reality distorsion observed in schizophrenia
	(14). Nevertheless, the behavior of these models are too simple to
	be directly compared with real physiological data. In fact, equilibrium
	attractors are hardly met in biological dynamics. More complex behaviors
	(such as oscillations or chaos) should thus to be taken into account.
	The study of chaotic behavior have lead to the development of numerical
	methods devoted to the analysis of complex time series (17). These
	methods may be used to characterise the dynamical processes at the
	time-scales of both the cerebral dynamics and the clinical symptoms
	variations. The application of these methods to physiological signals
	have shown that complex behaviors are related to healthy states whereas
	simple dynamics are related to pathology (8). These studies have
	thus confirmed the notion of "dynamical disease" (20, 21) which denotes
	pathological conditions characterised by changes in physiological
	rhythms. Depression has been studied within this framework (25, 32)
	in order to define possible changes in brain electrical rhythms related
	to this trouble and its evolution. It has been shown that controls'
	brain dynamics is more complex than depressive one and that the recovery
	of a complex brain activity depends on the number of previous episodes.
	In the case of the symptoms time evolution, several studies have
	demonstrated that non-linear dynamical process may be involved in
	the recurrence of symptoms in troubles such as manic-depressive illness
	(9) or schizophrenia (51). These observations can contribute to more
	parcimonious interpretation of the time course of these illnesses
	than usual theories. In the search of a relationship between brain
	dynamics and mental troubles, it has been shown in three depressed
	patients an important correlation between the characteristics of
	brain dynamics and the intensity of depressive mood (49). This preliminary
	observation is in accordance with the emergence hypothesis according
	which changes in neuronal dynamics should be related to changes in
	mental processes. We reviewed here some theoretical and experimental
	results related to the use of "physical" dynamical theory in the
	field of psychopathology. It has been argued that these applications
	go beyond metaphor and that they are empirically founded. Nevertheless,
	these studies only constitute first steps on the way of a cautious
	development and definition of a "dynamical paradigm" in psychopathology.
	The introduction of concepts from dynamics such as complexity and
	dynamical changes (i.e. bifurcations) permits a new perspective on
	function and dysfunction of the mind/brain and the time evolution
	of symptoms. Moreover, it offers a ground for the hypothesis of the
	emergence of mental properties on the basis of neuronal dynamics
	(42). Since this theory can help to throw light on classical problems
	in psychopathology, we consider that a precise examination of both
	its theoretical and empirical consequences is requested to define
	its validity on this topic.},

	networks is the presence of hub metabolites such as ATP or NADH that
	are involved in a high number of reactions. To study the emergence
	of hub metabolites, we implemented computer simulations of a widely
	accepted scenario for the evolution of metabolic networks. Our simulations
	indicate that metabolic networks with a large number of highly specialized
	enzymes may evolve from a few multifunctional enzymes. During this
	process, enzymes duplicate and specialize, leading to a loss of biochemical
	reactions and intermediary metabolites. Complex features of metabolic
	networks such as the presence of hubs may result from selection of
	growth rate if essential biochemical mechanisms are considered. Specifically,
	our simulations indicate that group transfer reactions are essential
	for the emergence of hubs.},

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2006},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The PE and PPE multigene families of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
	comprise about 10\% of the coding potential of the genome. The function
	of the proteins encoded by these large gene families remains unknown,
	although they have been proposed to be involved in antigenic variation
	and disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, some members of the PE and
	PPE families are associated with the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions,
	which are regions of immunopathogenic importance, and encode a system
	dedicated to the secretion of members of the potent T-cell antigen
	ESAT-6 family. This study investigates the duplication characteristics
	of the PE and PPE gene families and their association with the ESAT-6
	gene clusters, using a combination of phylogenetic analyses, DNA
	hybridization, and comparative genomics, in order to gain insight
	into their evolutionary history and distribution in the genus Mycobacterium.
	RESULTS: The results showed that the expansion of the PE and PPE
	gene families is linked to the duplications of the ESAT-6 gene clusters,
	and that members situated in and associated with the clusters represent
	the most ancestral copies of the two gene families. Furthermore,
	the emergence of the repeat protein PGRS and MPTR subfamilies is
	a recent evolutionary event, occurring at defined branching points
	in the evolution of the genus Mycobacterium. These gene subfamilies
	are thus present in multiple copies only in the members of the M.
	tuberculosis complex and close relatives. The study provides a complete
	analysis of all the PE and PPE genes found in the sequenced genomes
	of members of the genus Mycobacterium such as M. smegmatis, M. avium
	paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans, and M. tuberculosis. CONCLUSION:
	This work provides insight into the evolutionary history for the
	PE and PPE gene families of the mycobacteria, linking the expansion
	of these families to the duplications of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
	regions, and showing that they are composed of subgroups with distinct
	evolutionary (and possibly functional) differences.},

  abstract = {In spite of its relevance to the origin of complex networks, the interplay

	distributions, cooperative behavior and hierarchical clustering.
	Interestingly, results such as the cooperators being located mostly

  journal = {Rep Carcinog Backgr Doc},
  year = {2010},
  pages = {i--512},
  number = {10-5981},
  abstract = {Executive Summary: Introduction: Formaldehyde is a high-production-volume
	chemical with a wide array of uses. The predominant use of formaldehyde
	in the United States is in the production of industrial resins (mainly
	urea-formaldehyde, phenol-formaldehyde, polyacetal, and melamine-formaldehyde
	resins) that are used to manufacture products such as adhesives and
	binders for wood products, pulp and paper products, plastics, and
	synthetic fibers, and in textile finishing. Formaldehyde is also
	used as a chemical intermediate. Resin production and use as a chemical
	intermediate together account for over 80\% of its use. Other, smaller
	uses of formaldehyde that may be important for potential human exposure
	include use in agriculture, medical use as a disinfectant and preservative
	(for pathology, histology, and embalming), and use in numerous consumer
	products as a biocide and preservative. Formaldehyde (gas) is listed
	in the Eleventh Report on Carcinogens (RoC) as reasonably anticipated
	to be a human carcinogen based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity
	in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory
	animals (NTP 2005a); it was first listed in the 2nd RoC (NTP 1981).
	Formaldehyde (all physical forms) was nominated by NIEHS for possible
	reclassification in the 12th RoC based on the 2004 review by the
	International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 2006), which concluded
	that there was sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde
	in humans. Human Exposure: Formaldehyde has numerous industrial and
	commercial uses and is produced in very large amounts (billions of
	pounds per year in the United States) by catalytic oxidation of methanol.
	Its predominant use, accounting for roughly 55\% of consumption,
	is in the production of industrial resins, which are used in the
	production of numerous commercial products. Formaldehyde is used
	in industrial processes primarily as a solution (formalin) or solid
	(paraformaldehyde or trioxane), but exposure is frequently to formaldehyde
	gas, which is released during many of the processes. Formaldehyde
	gas is also created from the combustion of organic material and can
	be produced secondarily in air from photochemical reactions involving
	virtually all classes of hydrocarbon pollutants. In some instances,
	secondary production may exceed direct air emissions. Formaldehyde
	is also produced endogenously in humans and animals. Formaldehyde
	is a simple, one-carbon molecule that is rapidly metabolized, is
	endogenously produced, and is also formed through the metabolism
	of many xenobiotic agents. Because of these issues, typical biological
	indices of exposure, such as levels of formaldehyde or its metabolites
	in blood or urine, have proven to be ineffective measures of exposure.
	Formaldehyde can bind covalently to single-stranded DNA and protein
	to form crosslinks, or with human serum albumin or the N-terminal
	valine of hemoglobin to form molecular adducts, and these reaction
	products of formaldehyde might serve as biomarkers for exposure to
	formaldehyde. Occupational exposure to formaldehyde is highly variable
	and can occur in numerous industries, including the manufacture of
	formaldehyde and formaldehyde-based resins, wood-composite and furniture
	production, plastics production, histology and pathology, embalming
	and biology laboratories, foundries, fiberglass production, construction,
	agriculture, and firefighting, among others. In fact, because formaldehyde
	is ubiquitous, it has been suggested that occupational exposure to
	formaldehyde occurs in all work places. Formaldehyde is also ubiquitous
	in the environment and has been detected in indoor and outdoor air;
	in treated drinking water, bottled drinking water, surface water,
	and groundwater; on land and in the soil; and in numerous types of
	food. The primary source of exposure is from inhalation of formaldehyde
	gas in indoor settings (both residential and occupational); however,
	formaldehyde also may adsorb to respirable particles, providing a
	source of additional exposure. Major sources of formaldehyde exposure
	for the general public have included combustion sources (both indoor
	and outdoor sources including industrial and automobile emissions,
	home cooking and heating, and cigarette smoke), off-gassing from
	numerous construction and home furnishing products, and off-gassing
	from numerous consumer goods. Ingestion of food and water can also
	be a significant source of exposure to formaldehyde. Numerous agencies,
	including the Department of Homeland Security, CPSC, DOT, EPA, FDA,
	HUD, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, ACGIH, and
	NIOSH, have developed regulations and guidelines to reduce exposure
	to formaldehyde. Human Cancer Studies: A large number of epidemiological
	studies have evaluated the relationship between formaldehyde exposure
	and carcinogenicity in humans. The studies fall into the following
	main groups: (1) historical cohort studies and nested case-control
	studies of workers in a variety of industries that manufacture or
	use formaldehyde, including the chemical, plastics, fiberglass, resins,
	and woodworking industries, as well as construction, garment, iron
	foundry, and tannery workers; (2) historical cohort studies and nested
	case-control studies of health professionals, including physicians,
	pathologists, anatomists, embalmers, and funeral directors; (3) population-based
	cohort or cancer registry studies; and (4) population-based or occupationally
	based case-control incidence or mortality studies of specific cancer
	endpoints. In addition, several studies have re-analyzed data from
	specific cohort or case-control studies or have conducted pooled
	analyses or meta-analyses for specific cancer endpoints. The largest
	study available to date is the cohort mortality study of combined
	mixed industries conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
	This cohort includes 25,691 male and female workers, enrolled from
	10 different formaldehyde-producing or -using plants, employed before
	1966 and followed most recently to 1994 and 2004, most of whom were
	exposed to formaldehyde (Hauptmann et al. 2003, 2004 and Beane Freeman
	et al. 2009). Quantitative exposure data were used to construct job-exposure
	matrices for individual workers, some of whom experienced peak exposures
	to formaldehyde >/= 4 ppm. This cohort is the only study in which
	exposure-response relationships between peak, average, cumulative,
	and duration of exposure and mortality for multiple cancer sites
	were investigated. Two other large cohort studies are available:
	(1) a large multi-plant cohort study (N = 14,014) of workers in six
	chemical manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom (Coggon et al.
	2003), which calculated SMRs among ever-exposed and highly exposed
	workers for formaldehyde, and (2) a NIOSH cohort of garment workers
	(N = 11,039) (Pinkerton et al. 2004) which evaluated mortality for
	duration of exposure, time since first exposure, and year of first
	exposure to formaldehyde for selected cancer sites. The other cohort
	studies (for both industrial and health professional workers) were
	smaller, and in general only reported mortality or incidence for
	ever-exposed workers in external (SMR or PMR) analyses, although
	some of the studies of health professional workers attempted indirect
	measures of exposure (such as length in a professional membership)
	as a proxy for exposure duration. Several of the nested case-control
	studies attempted to evaluate exposure-response relationships, but
	were limited by small numbers of exposed cases, and many of the population-based
	case-control studies lacked quantitative data or sufficient numbers
	of cases to evaluate exposure-response relationships. However, the
	nested case-control study of lymphohematopoietic, nasopharyngeal,
	and brain cancers among U.S. embalmers and funeral directors by Hauptmann
	et al. (2009) had large numbers of exposed cases of lymphohematopoietic
	cancer and used both questionnaire- and experimental model-based
	exposure metrics of exposure, including average, cumulative, peak,
	and duration of exposure, and number of embalmings. [Since most of
	the cohorts have relatively low statistical power to evaluate rare
	cancers such as sinonasal and nasopharyngeal cancers, case-control
	studies are generally more informative for these outcomes.] Findings
	across studies for cancer sites that have been the principal focus
	of investigation are summarized below. Sinonasal cancers: In cohort
	studies, increased risks of sinonasal cancers were observed among
	male (SPIR = 2.3, 95\% CI = 1.3 to 4.0, 13 exposed cases) and female
	(SPIR = 2.4, 95\% CI = 0.6 to 6.0, 4 exposed cases) Danish workers
	exposed to formaldehyde (Hansen and Olsen 1995, 1996) and among formaldehyde-exposed
	workers in the NCI cohort (SMR = 1.19, 95\% CI = 0.38 to 3.68, 3
	deaths) (Hauptmann et al. 2004). One death from squamous-cell sinonasal
	cancer was reported in the study of tannery workers among formaldehyde-exposed
	workers by Stern et al. (1987). No increase in risk was found among
	formaldehyde-exposed workers in the other large cohort studies (Coggon
	et al. 2003, Pinkerton et al. 2004). The smaller cohort studies did
	not report findings or did not observe any deaths for this specific
	endpoint. [Sinonasal cancers are rare, and even the larger cohort
	studies have insufficient numbers of exposed workers and expected
	deaths (e.g., approximately three in the NCI cohort) to be very informative.]
	Of the six case-control studies reviewed, four (Olsen et al. 1984
	and Olsen and Asnaes 1986; Hayes et al. 1986; Roush et al. 1987;
	and Luce et al. 1993) reported an association between sinonasal cancers
	and formaldehyde exposure; statistically significant risks were found
	in three studies among individuals ever exposed to formaldehyde or
	with higher probabilities or levels of exposure (Olsen et al. 1994
	and Olsen and Asnaes 1986; Hayes et al. 1986; and Luce et al. 1993).
	All of these studies found elevated risks among individuals with
	low or no exposure to wood dust or after adjusting for exposure to
	wood dust. Stronger associations were found for adenocarcinoma, with
	higher risks for this endpoint observed among individuals with higher
	average and cumulative exposure, duration of exposure, and earlier
	dates of first exposure (Luce et al. 1993). A pooled analysis of
	12 case-control studies of sinonasal cancer from seven countries
	(Luce et al. 2002) found statistically significant increases in adenocarcinoma
	among subjects in the highest exposure groups (OR = 3.0, 95\% CI
	= 1.5 to 5.7, 91 exposed cases for men, adjusted for wood dust exposure;
	and OR = 6.2, 95\% CI = 2.0 to 19.7, 5 exposed cases for women, unadjusted
	for wood dust exposure). For squamous-cell carcinoma, the corresponding
	ORs were 1.2 (95\% CI = 0.8 to 1.8, 30 exposed cases) for men and
	1.5 (95\% CI = 0.6 to 3.8, 6 exposed cases) for women; neither OR
	was adjusted for wood dust exposure. A statistically significant
	increase in risk for sinonasal cancers (mRR = 1.8, 95\% CI = 1.4
	to 2.3, 933 deaths) was found in a meta-analysis of 11 case-control
	studies by Collins et al. (1997); however, no increase in risks was
	found in meta-analyses of three cohort studies by Collins et al.
	(1987) or in eight industrial cohort studies by Bosetti et al. (2008).
	Nasopharyngeal cancers: Similar to sinonasal cancers, nasopharyngeal
	cancers are rare [and most of the risk estimates reported in the
	cohort studies are based on small numbers of expected cases or deaths].
	Among cohort studies, a statistically significant increase in mortality
	from nasopharyngeal cancer was observed in the large NCI cohort (SMR
	= 2.10, 95\% CI = 1.05 to 4.21, 8 deaths) (Hauptmann et al. 2004),
	and statistically nonsignificant elevated risks were observed among
	white embalmers from the United States (PMR = 1.89, 95\% CI = 0.39
	to 5.48, 3 deaths) (Hayes et al. 1990) and among male Danish workers
	exposed to formaldehyde (SPIR = 1.3, 95\% CI = 0.3 to 3.2, 4 cases)
	(Hansen and Olsen 1995, 1996). One incident case of nasopharyngeal
	cancer was reported among Swedish workers in the abrasive materials
	industry (expected deaths not reported, but only 506 workers were
	potentially exposed) (Edling et al. 1987b). No associations between
	formaldehyde exposure and nasopharyngeal cancer were found in the
	other two large cohorts: one death was observed (vs. 2 expected)
	in the British chemical workers cohort (Coggon et al. 2003) and no
	deaths were observed (vs. 0.96 expected) in the NIOSH cohort (Pinkerton
	et al. 2004). The other, smaller, cohort studies did not report findings
	or did not observe any deaths for nasopharyngeal cancer. Exposure-response
	relationships between formaldehyde exposure and nasopharyngeal cancer
	were evaluated in the large NCI cohort study. Among seven exposed
	and two unexposed deaths, relative risks of nasopharyngeal cancers
	increased with cumulative exposure (Ptrend = 0.025 among exposed
	groups) and with peak and average exposure (Ptrend = 0.044 and 0.126,
	respectively, across exposed and unexposed groups, using unexposed
	as the referent as no deaths were observed in the lowest exposed
	group). Adjustment for duration of exposure to a number of potentially
	confounding substances and plant type did not substantively alter
	the findings. Most of the deaths occurred at one factory (Plant 1),
	which appears to have had the largest numbers of highly exposed workers.
	In a nested case-control analysis of nasopharyngeal deaths in this
	plant, Marsh et al. (2007b) reported that several of the nasopharyngeal
	cancers occurred among workers with previous employment in metal-working
	occupations. Six of the nine available case-control studies reported
	increases in nasopharyngeal cancers in association with probable
	exposure to formaldehyde or at higher levels or duration of estimated
	exposure (Olsen et al. 1984 [women only], Vaughan et al. 1986a, Roush
	et al. 1987, West et al. 1993, Vaughan et al. 2000, and Hildesheim
	et al. 2001). Risks of nasopharyngeal cancers increased with exposure
	duration and cumulative exposure in two population-based case-control
	studies (Vaughan et al. 2000, Hildesheim et al. 2001). In some studies,
	higher risks were found among individuals in the high-exposure groups
	(Vaughan et al. 1986a, Roush et al 1987), or with more years since
	first exposure (West et al. 1993), and some studies reported that
	risks were still elevated after taking into account smoking (Vaughan
	et al. 2000, Vaughan et al. 1986a, West et al. 1993) or exposure
	to wood dust (Hildesheim et al. 2001, Vaughan et al. 2000, West et
	al. 1993). No associations between nasopharyngeal cancer and formaldehyde
	exposure were found in population-based case-control studies in Denmark
	(Olsen et al. 1984 [men only]), and Malaysia (Armstrong et al. 2000),
	a case-cohort study among Chinese textile workers (Li et al. 2006),
	or in a nested case-control study among embalmers (Hauptmann et al.
	2009). Several meta-analyses were available. A statistically significant
	increase in risk (mRR = 1.3, 95\% CI = 1.2 to 1.5, 455 deaths) was
	reported in a large meta-analysis of 12 case-control and cohort studies
	(Collins et al. 1997), and a nonsignificant increase in risk in a
	small meta-analysis of three other cohort mortality studies (SMR
	= 1.33, 95\% CI = 0.69 to 2.56, 9 deaths) (Bosetti et al. 2008).
	Bachand et al. (2010) reported a borderline statistically significant
	risk in a meta-analysis of seven case-control studies (mRR = 1.22,
	95\% CI = 1.00 to 1.50) but did not find an increase in risk (mRR
	= 0.72, 95\% CI = 0.4 to 1.29) in an analysis of data from six cohort
	studies, which excluded Plant 1 of the NCI cohort and used the re-analysis
	data from Marsh et al. (2005) for the other plants. [The Bachand
	meta-analysis used data for all pharyngeal cancer or buccal cavity
	cancer from some cohort studies and one case-control study, however.]
	Other head and neck cancers, and respiratory cancer Most of the cohort
	studies reported risk estimates for cancers of the buccal cavity,
	pharynx, larynx, and lung, or combinations of these cancers. Most
	of these studies, including two of the large cohorts (Pinkerton et
	al. 2004 and Coggon et al. 2003), three of the professional health
	worker studies (Hayes et al. 1990, Walrath and Fraumeni 1983 and
	1984), and two of the smaller industrial cohorts (Andjelkovich et
	al. 1995 and Hansen and Olsen 1995, 1996) found elevated (between
	approximately 10\% and 30\%) but statistically nonsignificant risks
	for cancers of the buccal cavity or buccal cavity and pharynx combined;
	risk estimates were usually based on small numbers of deaths or cases.
	In the NCI cohort, increased risks for all upper respiratory cancers
	or buccal cavity cancer combined were generally found among workers
	in the highest categories of exposure (compared with the lowest category),
	but trends were not statistically significant (Hauptmann et al. 2004).
	Most of the population-based or nested case-control studies that
	reported on head and neck cancers found small increases (usually
	statistically nonsignificant) in risks for formaldehyde exposure
	and cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx (or parts of the pharynx)
	(Vaughan et al. 1986a, Merletti et al. 1991, Gustavsson et al. 1998,
	Laforest et al. 2000, Marsh et al. 2002, Wilson et al. 2004, Berrino
	et al. 2003) or of the upper respiratory tract (Partanen et al. 1990).
	Exposure-response relationships were not clear in most of the available
	studies; however, positive exposure-response relationships between
	probability and duration of exposure and cancers of the hypopharynx
	and larynx combined were reported by Laforest et al. (2000) and between
	combined probability and intensity of exposure and salivary cancer
	by Wilson et al. (2004). No associations between formaldehyde exposure
	and pharyngeal cancers (subtypes or combinations) were observed in
	case-control studies by Shangina et al. (2006) and Tarvainen et al.
	(2008). Most of the cohort studies and two of the four available
	case-control studies found no association between formaldehyde exposure
	and laryngeal cancer. Two case-control studies (Wortley et al. 1992,
	Shangina et al. 2006) reported increased risk among subjects with
	the highest exposure to formaldehyde. Small excesses of mortality
	or incidence of cancers of the lung or respiratory system among formaldehyde-exposed
	workers were observed in four cohort studies (Andjelkovich et al.
	1995, Dell and Teta 1995, Hansen and Olsen 1996 [women only], and
	Coggon et al. 2003). A statistically significant increase in risk
	of lung cancer was observed in the large study of British chemical
	workers (SMR = 1.22, 95\% CI = 1.12 to 1.32, 594 deaths, among all
	workers) (Coggon et al. 2003). In this study, risks increased with
	increasing exposure level (Ptrend < 0.001) but not with duration
	of exposure. No association between formaldehyde exposure and lung
	cancer was observed in the other two large cohorts (Pinkerton et
	al. 2004, Hauptmann et al. 2004), in several of the smaller cohorts
	(Bertazzi et al. 1989, Hansen and Olsen 1995 [in men], Edling et
	al. 1987b, Stellman et al. 1998, Stern 2003), or in the six studies
	of health professional workers. Findings from the population-based
	or nested case-control studies were also mixed. Increases in risk
	were reported in several studies (De Stefani et al. 2005, Gérin et
	al. 1989, Andjelkovich et al. 1994, Chiazze et al. 1997), and were
	statistically significant in two studies (Marsh et al. 2001, Coggon
	et al. 1984). Risks did not increase with increasing exposure in
	most of the studies. An exception is the study by De Stefani et al.
	(2005), in which a statistically significant trend with duration
	of employment was observed. No association between lung cancer and
	formaldehyde exposure was reported in three other occupational case-control
	studies (Bond et al. 1986, Jensen and Andersen 1982, Partanen et
	al. 1990) and one population-based study (Brownson et al. 1993).
	Lymphohematopoietic cancers: Among workers in the NCI cohort study,
	peak exposure to formaldehyde was associated with increased mortality
	for several types of lymphohematopoietic cancers (Beane Freeman et
	al. 2009). For all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined, for leukemias
	combined, and for myeloid leukemia, relative risks increased with
	increasing peak exposure: statistically significant increased risks
	were found among workers with the highest peak exposure (>/= 4 ppm)
	vs. the lowest exposed category for all lymphohematopoietic cancers
	(RR = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.03 to 1.81, 108 deaths, Ptrend = 0.02), and
	statistically nonsignificant increases for all leukemias combined
	and peak exposure >/= 4 ppm (RR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 0.92 to 2.18, 48
	deaths, Ptrend = 0.12) and for myeloid leukemia and peak exposure
	>/= 4 ppm (RR = 1.78, 95\% CI = 0.87 to 3.64, 19 deaths, Ptrend =
	0.13; trends among exposed person-years). No associations were found
	with cumulative or average exposure. An excess of leukemia, especially
	myeloid leukemia, was also found among garment workers in the large
	NIOSH cohort (Pinkerton et al. 2004), but not in the British chemical
	workers cohort (Coggon et al. 2003). In the NIOSH cohort, risks for
	leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia were higher
	among workers with longer duration of exposure (10+ yrs), longer
	time since first exposure (20+ years), and among those exposed prior
	to 1963 (when formaldehyde exposure was thought to be higher) (Pinkerton
	et al. 2004). In the smaller industrial cohort studies, some studies
	reported excesses for all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined among
	formaldehyde-exposed workers (Bertazzi et al. 1989, Stellman et al.
	1998) or leukemia (Hansen and Olsen 1995, 1996), but others observed
	no association for all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined (Andjelkovich
	et al. 1995, Stern 2003, Pinkerton et al. 2004) or leukemia (Andjelkovich
	et al. 1995, Stellman et al. 1998, Stern 2003). Each of the six cohort
	studies of health professionals, and the nested case-control study
	of embalmers from three of these studies, found elevated mortality
	for lymphohematopoietic cancers. Hall et al. (1991), Hayes et al.
	(1990), Stroup et al. (1986), Levine et al. (1984) and Walrath and
	Fraumeni (1983, 1984) reported increases in risk for all lymphohematopoietic
	cancers combined and for leukemia. Most estimates were statistically
	nonsignificant with the exception of the studies of Hayes et al.
	(1990) and Stroup et al. (1986), where statistically significant
	excess mortality was found for all leukemia combined or for myeloid
	leukemia in association with formaldehyde exposure. In the nested
	case-control study by Hauptmann et al. (2009), sufficient numbers
	of cases of lymphohematopoietic cancer deaths among embalmers and
	funeral directors were identified to enable evaluation of exposure-response
	relationships, using models of potential formaldehyde exposure. A
	significant increase in nonlymphoid lymphohematopoietic cancers was
	observed among ever-embalmers (OR = 3.0, 95\% CI = 1.0 to 9.5, 44
	exposed cases), and significant increases in risk were observed at
	the highest levels of cumulative, average, and peak exposure. Most
	of the increase was attributable to myeloid leukemia, which was significantly
	elevated among ever-embalmers (OR = 11.2, 95\% CI = 1.3 to 95.6,
	33 exposed cases) and showed significant trends with duration of
	exposure and peak exposure, and a more attenuated trend with 8-hour
	time-weighted average intensity of exposure. In further analyses
	of non-lymphoid lymphohematopoietic cancers using workers with <
	500 lifetime embalmings as the reference group, statistically significant
	increases in relative risks were found among workers with the longest
	duration of working in jobs with embalming, the highest number of
	lifetime embalmings, and the highest cumulative exposure to formaldehyde.
	With respect to other case-control studies, a population-based study
	found no clear association between leukemia and exposure to formaldehyde
	(Blair et al. 2001), and two nested case-control studies reported
	statistically nonsignificant increases in leukemia risk based on
	small numbers of exposed cases (Partanen et al. 1993, Ott et al.
	1989). Few cohort or case-control studies reported findings for subtypes
	of lymphohematopoietic cancers other than leukemia. Most of the cohort
	studies had relatively low power to detect effects, and either did
	not report findings or did not evaluate exposure-response relationships.
	For Hodgkin's lymphoma, the NCI study was the only cohort or case-control
	study that reported an increase in risk. In an external analysis,
	an SMR of 1.42 (95\% CI = 0.96 to 2.10, 25 deaths) was observed among
	formaldehyde-exposed workers and, in internal analyses, statistically
	significant exposure-response relationships were observed with peak
	(Ptrend = 0.01 among the exposed group) and average exposure (Ptrend
	= 0.05 among the exposed group), but not with cumulative exposure
	(Beane Freeman et al. 2009). For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, statistically
	non-significant increases in risks were observed in one cohort study
	(Hayes et al. 1990), and in most of the population-based or nested
	case-control studies (Partanen et al. 1993, Ott et al. 1989, Richardson
	et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2009a, Tatham et al. 1997, Blair et al.
	1993). The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (large B cell type) increased
	with increasing probability of exposure (Ptrend < 0.01) in a large
	case-control incidence study of U.S. women (Wang et al. 2009a). No
	increase in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was reported in the population-based
	case-control study by Gérin et al. (1989), or in the nested case-control
	study of embalmers by Hauptmann et al. (2009). For multiple myeloma,
	peak exposure of >/= 4 ppm was associated with a statistically significant
	increase in risk in the NCI cohort (RR = 2.04, 95\% CI = 1.01 to
	4.12, 21 deaths, Ptrend = 0.08 among the exposed group) (Beane Freeman
	et al. 2009), although an increase in risk was also seen among unexposed
	workers for this endpoint. Increased risks also were seen among British
	chemical workers (Coggon et al. 2003), abrasive materials workers
	(Edling et al. 1987b), and U.S. embalmers (Hayes et al. 1990). Other
	cohort studies did not find associations, based on small numbers
	of observed deaths or cases, or did not report findings. Among case-control
	studies, statistically nonsignificant increases in risks were observed
	by Boffetta et al. (1989), Pottern et al. (1992) (women only), and
	Hauptmann et al. (2009), but not by Heineman et al. (1992) (men only).
	Several meta-analyses were available. (Hauptmann et al. [2009] was
	not available for any of the analyses.) Statistically significant
	risks were reported for all lymphohematopoietic cancers and leukemia
	among cohort studies of health professionals by Bosetti et al. (2008)
	(RR = 1.31, 95\% CI = 1.16 to 1.47, 263 deaths for all lymphohematopoietic
	cancers; and RR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.15 to 1.68, 106 deaths for leukemia)
	and among studies of occupations with known high formaldehyde exposure
	by Zhang et al. (2009a), (mRR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 1.43, 19
	studies for all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined; mRR = 1.54,
	95\% CI = 1.18 to 2.00, P < 0.001, 15 studies for leukemia; and mRR
	= 1.90, 95\% CI = 1.31 to 2.76, P = 0.001, 6 studies for myeloid
	leukemia. A statistically nonsignificant increase in leukemia risk
	was also estimated among the combined studies of health professional
	workers by Bachand et al. (2010). No increased risks for leukemia
	were found in the available meta-analyses of industrial cohorts (Bosetti
	et al. 2008, Bachand et al. 2010), or combined cohort and case-control
	studies (Collins and Lineker 2004). Other cancer sites: With the
	exception of brain and central nervous system cancers, few of the
	cohort studies reported consistently elevated risks for cancers at
	other sites. Few case-control studies of other cancer endpoints have
	been conducted. Excess mortality from brain and central nervous system
	cancers has been reported in each of the six cohort studies of health
	professionals, with statistically significant SMRs/PMRs (1.94 to
	2.7) reported in three studies (Stroup et al. 1986, Walrath and Fraumeni
	1983, 1984). However, in the nested case-control analysis of brain
	cancers among embalmers and funeral directors by Hauptmann et al.
	(2009), which used subjects from cohort studies of Hayes et al. (1990)
	and Walrath and Fraumeni (1983, 1984), a statistically nonsignificant
	increase in brain cancers was observed in association with ever-embalming
	(OR = 1.9, 95\% CI = 0.7 to 5.3, 42 exposed cases). There were no
	clear exposure-response patterns with duration of employment in embalming
	jobs, or estimated cumulative, peak, or average exposure to formaldehyde,
	however. No increases in brain and central nervous system cancers
	have been observed in the industrial cohort studies that have reported
	findings. A meta-analysis by Bosetti et al. (2008) reported a statistically
	significant increase in the risk of brain cancer among health professional
	workers (RR = 1.56, 95\% CI = 1.24 to 1.96, 74 deaths), but not among
	industrial workers. Several industrial studies have reported increases
	in one or more of stomach, colon, rectal, and kidney cancers, and
	a case-control study of pancreatic cancer (Kernan et al. 1999) suggested
	an increase in this endpoint at higher levels of formaldehyde exposure.
	Two meta-analyses of pancreatic cancer (Ojajärvi et al. 2000, Collins
	et al. 2001) showed no consistent increase in risk across studies,
	however, with the exception of a borderline statistically significant
	increase among pathologists, anatomists and embalmers. Studies in
	Experimental Animals: Formaldehyde has been tested for carcinogenicity
	in mice, rats, and hamsters. Studies reviewed include chronic and
	subchronic inhalation studies in mice, rats, and hamsters; chronic
	and subchronic drinking-water studies in rats; and one chronic skin-application
	study in mice. No chronic studies in primates were found, but one
	subchronic inhalation study and one acute/subacute inhalation study
	in monkeys was reviewed. [Several of these studies were limited by
	a small number of animals per group, short exposure duration, short
	study duration, incomplete pathology or data reporting, and/or incomplete
	statistical analysis.] Formaldehyde exposure resulted in nasal tumors
	(primarily the extremely rare squamous-cell carcinoma) in several
	strains of rats when administered chronically by inhalation (Kerns
	et al. 1983a, Sellakumar et al. 1985, Appelman et al. 1988, Woutersen
	et al. 1989, Monticello et al. 1996, Kamala et al. 1997). Only two
	inhalation studies in mice or hamsters were found. No tumors were
	reported in C3H mice exposed to formaldehyde at 200 mg/m3 [163 ppm]
	for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week, for 35 weeks (Horton et al. 1963), but
	squamous-cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity occurred in 2 of 17 B6C3F1
	male mice exposed at 14.3 ppm for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, and sacrificed
	at 24 months (Kerns et al. 1983a). Although the increase was not
	statistically significant, the authors concluded that the tumors
	were exposure-related. [Biological significance is implied because
	these tumors are extremely rare in non-exposed mice and rats; no
	nasal squamous-cell carcinomas have been observed in more than 2,800
	B6C3F1 mice and 2,800 F344 rats used as controls in NTP inhalation
	studies.] No tumors were reported in Syrian golden hamsters exposed
	at 10 ppm 5 hours/day, 5 days/week for life (Dalbey 1982) or at 2.95
	ppm 22 hours/day, 7 days/week for 26 weeks (Rusch et al. 1983). No
	tumors occurred in male cynomolgus monkeys exposed at 2.95 ppm for
	22 hours/day, 7 days/week for 26 weeks (Rusch et al. 1983) or in
	male rhesus monkeys exposed at 6 ppm for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week
	for 6 weeks (Monticello et al. 1989); however, squamous metaplasia
	and hyperplasia in the nasal passages and respiratory epithelia of
	the trachea and major bronchi occurred. Male Wistar rats administered
	formaldehyde in drinking water at 5,000 ppm for 32 weeks developed
	forestomach tumors (squamous-cell papillomas) in one study (Takahashi
	et al. 1986); however, in two other drinking-water studies, no tumors
	were reported in either male or female Wistar rats administered formaldehyde
	at concentrations ranging from 20 to 5,000 ppm for two years (Til
	et al. 1989, Tobe et al. 1989). In another study, male and female
	Sprague-Dawley breeder rats administered formaldehyde at 2,500 ppm
	in drinking water. Offspring of these breeder rats exposed transplacentally
	beginning on gestation day 13 and postnatally via drinking water
	for life showed increased incidences of benign and malignant tumors
	of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly intestinal leiomyosarcoma
	(a very rare tumor). Male Sprague-Dawley rats administered formaldehyde
	at concentrations up to 1,500 ppm showed increased incidences (compared
	with control groups given tap water) of the number of animals bearing
	malignant tumors, hemolymphoreticular neoplasms (leukemia and lymphoma
	combined), and testicular tumors (interstitial-cell adenoma) (Soffritti
	et al. 2002a). Compared with the vehicle control group (tap water
	containing 15 mg/L methanol), the incidence of testicular tumors
	was significantly higher in the 1,000-ppm exposure group, and the
	incidence of hemolymphoreticular tumors was higher in the 1,500-ppm
	exposure group. Female rats in the 1,500-ppm exposure group showed
	higher incidences of malignant mammary-gland tumors and hemolymphoreticular
	neoplasms than the tap-water control group; however, the incidences
	were not significantly higher than in the vehicle control group.
	In addition, some rare stomach and intestinal tumors occurred in
	a few male and female rats in the exposed groups but not in the control
	groups. Other studies examined the promoting effects of formaldehyde
	when administered after initiation with DBMA, DEN, MNU, or MNNG or
	cocarcinogenic effects when administered with coal tar, benzo[a]pyrene,
	wood dust, and hydrogen chloride. Some of these studies did not show
	an enhanced tumor response. However, a few studies, including a skin-painting
	study in mice (Iverson et al. 1986), a drinking-water study in rats
	(Takahashi et al. 1986), and inhalation studies in rats (Albert et
	al. 1982, Holmström et al. 1989a) and hamsters (Dalbey et al. 1986),
	indicated that formaldehyde could act as a tumor promoter or act
	as a co-carcinogen when administered with other substances. Adsorption,
	distribution, metabolism, and excretion: Formaldehyde is a metabolic
	intermediate that is essential for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidine,
	and some amino acids. The metabolism of formaldehyde is similar in
	all mammalian species studied. Differences in distribution following
	inhalation exposure can be related to anatomical differences. For
	example, rats are obligate nose breathers while monkeys and humans
	are oronasal breathers. Thus, in humans, some inhaled formaldehyde
	will bypass the nasal passages and deposit directly into the lower
	respiratory tract. The endogenous concentrations in the blood of
	humans, rats, and monkeys are about 2 to 3 mug/g and do not increase
	after ingestion or inhalation of formaldehyde from exogenous sources
	(Casanova et al. 1988, Heck et al. 1985, Heck and Casonova 2004).
	Although formaldehyde is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from
	the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts, it is poorly absorbed
	from intact skin. When absorbed after inhalation or ingestion, very
	little formaldehyde reaches the systemic circulation because it is
	rapidly metabolized by glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase
	and S-formyl-glutathione hydrolase to formic acid, which is excreted
	in the urine or oxidized to carbon dioxide and exhaled (IARC 2006).
	Formaldehyde reaching the circulation is rapidly hydrated to methanediol,
	which is the predominant form in the circulation (Fox et al. 1985).
	Although the metabolic pathways are the same in all tissues, the
	data indicate that the route of absorption does affect the route
	of elimination. When inhaled, exhalation is the primary route of
	elimination; however, when ingested, urinary excretion as formate
	is more important. Unmetabolized formaldehyde reacts non-enzymatically
	with sulfhydryl groups or urea, binds to tetrahydrofolate and enters
	the single-carbon intermediary metabolic pool, reacts with macromolecules
	to form DNA and protein adducts, or forms crosslinks primarily between
	protein and single-stranded DNA (Bolt 1987). Toxic effects: Formaldehyde
	is a highly reactive chemical that causes tissue irritation and damage
	on contact. Formaldehyde concentrations that have been associated
	with various toxic effects in humans show wide interindividual variation
	and are route dependent. Symptoms are rare at concentrations below
	0.5 ppm; however, upper airway and eye irritation, changes in odor
	threshold, and neurophysiological effects (e.g., insomnia, memory
	loss, mood alterations, nausea, fatigue) have been reported at concentrations
	</= 0.1 ppm. The most commonly reported effects include eye, nose,
	throat, and skin irritation. Other effects include allergic contact
	dermatitis, histopathological abnormalities (e.g., hyperplasia, squamous
	metaplasia, and mild dysplasia) of the nasal mucosa, occupational
	asthma, reduced lung function, altered immune response, and hemotoxicity
	(IARC 2006). Some studies of Chinese workers suggest that long-term
	exposure to formaldehyde can cause leucopenia, and one study reported
	that a significantly higher percentage of formaldehyde-exposed workers
	had blood cell abnormalities (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and depressed
	serum hemoglobin levels) compared with unexposed controls (reviewed
	by Tang et al. 2009). Zhang et al. (2010) reported that Chinese factory
	workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde had significantly
	lower counts of white blood cells, granulocytes, platelets, red blood
	cells and lymphocytes than unexposed controls. In vitro studies indicated
	that formaldehyde exposure caused a significant, dose-related decrease
	in colony forming progenitor cells (Zhang et al. 2010). Other studies
	have shown that formaldehyde exposure affects changes in the percentage
	of lymphocyte subsets (Ying et al. 1999, Ye et al. 2005). Higher
	rates of spontaneous abortion and low birth weights have been reported
	among women occupationally exposed to formaldehyde (IARC 2006, Saurel-Cubizolles
	et al. 1994). Oral exposure is rare, but there have been several
	apparent suicides and attempted suicides in which individuals drank
	formaldehyde. These data indicate that the lethal dose is 60 to 90
	mL (Bartone et al. 1968, Yanagawa et al. 2007). Formaldehyde ingestion
	results in severe corrosive damage to the gastrointestinal tract
	followed by CNS depression, myocardial depression, circulatory collapse,
	metabolic acidosis, and multiple organ failure. The toxic effects
	of formaldehyde in experimental animals include irritation, cytotoxicity,
	and cell proliferation in the upper respiratory tract, ocular irritation,
	pulmonary hyperactivity, bronchoconstriction, gastrointestinal irritation,
	and skin sensitization. Other reported effects include oxidative
	stress, neurotoxicity, neurobehavioral effects, immunotoxicity, testicular
	toxicity, and decreased liver, thyroid gland, and testis weights
	(IARC 2006, Aslan et al. 2006, Sarsilmaz et al. 2007, Golalipour
	et al. 2008, Ozen et al. 2005, Majumder and Kumar 1995). In vitro
	studies have demonstrated that formaldehyde is directly cytotoxic
	and affects cell viability, cell differentiation and growth, cell
	proliferation, gene expression, membrane integrity, mucociliary action,
	apoptosis, and thiol and ion homeostasis (IARC 2006). Since metabolism
	of formaldehyde is glutathione-dependent, cells depleted of glutathione
	are more susceptible to formaldehyde toxicity (Ku and Killings 1984).
	Carcinogenicity of metabolites and analogues Formic acid (formate
	+ H+), the major metabolite of formaldehyde, has not been tested
	for carcinogenic effects. Acetaldehyde, an analogue of formaldehyde,
	is listed as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen by the
	NTP (2004). Acetaldehyde induced respiratory tract tumors in rats
	(adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma of the nasal mucosa)
	and laryngeal carcinoma in hamsters. In addition, epidemiological
	studies have reported increased risks of cancers of the upper digestive
	tract (esophagus, oral cavity, and pharynx) and upper respiratory
	tract (larynx and bronchi) in humans (Salaspuro 2009). Glutaraldehyde
	and benzaldehyde have also been tested for carcinogenicity in 2-year
	bioassays by the NTP. Glutaraldehyde was not considered to be carcinogenic
	in rats or mice, and benzaldehyde was not considered to be carcinogenic
	in rats. The NTP concluded that there was some evidence of carcinogenicity
	for benzaldehyde in mice based on an increased incidence of squamous-cell
	papilloma and hyperplasia in the forestomachs of male and female
	mice (NTP 1999). Genetic and related effects: Formaldehyde is a direct-acting
	genotoxic compound that affects multiple gene expression pathways,
	including those involved in DNA synthesis and repair and regulation
	of cell proliferation. Most studies in bacteria were positive for
	forward or reverse mutations without metabolic activation and for
	microsatellite induction (Mu and Harris 1988). Studies in non-mammalian
	eukaryotes and plants also were positive for forward and reverse
	mutations, dominant lethal and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations,
	and DNA single-strand breaks (Conaway et al. 1996, IARC 2006). In
	vitro studies with mammalian and human cells were positive for DNA
	adducts, DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA-DNA crosslinks, unscheduled
	DNA synthesis, single-strand breaks, mutations, and cytogenetic effects
	(chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, and micronucleus
	induction). In in vivo studies in rats, formaldehyde caused DNA-protein
	crosslinks (in the nasal mucosa and fetal liver but not bone marrow)
	(Casanova-Schmitz et al. 1994a, Wang and Liu 2006), DNA strand breaks
	(lymphocytes and liver) (Im et al. 2006, Wang and Liu 2006), dominant
	lethal mutations (Kitaeva et al. 1990, Odegiah 1997), chromosomal
	aberrations (pulmonary lavage cells and bone marrow in one of two
	studies) (Dallas et al. 1992, Kitaeva et al. 1990), and micronucleus
	induction in the gastrointestinal tract (Migliore et al. 1989). However,
	it did not induce sister chromatid exchange or chromosomal aberrations
	in lymphocytes or micronucleus formation in peripheral blood (Kilgerman
	et al. 1984, Speit et al. 2009). Mutations in the p53 gene were detected
	in nasal squamous-cell carcinomas from rats (Recio et al. 1992).
	Inhalation exposure to formaldehyde also induced DNA-protein crosslinks
	in the nasal turbinates, nasopharynx, trachea, and bronchi of rhesus
	monkeys (Casanova et al. 1991). In mice, formaldehyde exposure did
	not cause dominant lethal mutations (Epstein et al. 1972, Epstein
	and Shafner 1968), micronucleus induction (Gocke et al. 1981), or
	chromosomal aberrations (Fontignie-Houbrechts 1981, Natarajan et
	al. 1983) when exposed by intraperitoneal injection or induce micronuclei
	by intravenous or oral exposure (Morita et al. 1997), but did induce
	heritable mutations when exposed by inhalation (Liu et al. 2009b).
	In studies of lymphocytes from health professional workers exposed
	to formaldehyde, higher levels of formaldehyde-albumin adducts were
	found in workers exposed to relatively high concentrations compared
	with workers exposed to lower concentrations (Pala et al. 2008) and
	higher levels of DNA-protein crosslinks, strand breaks, and pantropic
	p53 protein levels were found in exposed workers compared with unexposed
	workers (Shaham et al. 2003). Wang et al. (2009) found higher levels
	of DNA adducts (N6-hydroxymethyldeoxyadenosine [N6 HOMe dAdo]) among
	smokers compared with non-smokers; however, the source of formaldehyde
	is not clear (for example, it could be formaldehyde in tobacco or
	a metabolite of a tobacco-specific compound). Numerous studies have
	evaluated chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange in
	lymphocytes and micronucleus induction in lymphocytes, or nasal or
	oral epithelial cells from humans exposed to formaldehyde (primarily
	health professionals, but also industrial workers, volunteers and
	subjects exposed from environmental sources). Among formaldehyde-exposed
	subjects, statistically significant increased frequencies (compared
	with unexposed, low exposure or pre- exposure vs. post-exposure)
	of cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes were observed for chromosomal
	aberrations in 7 of 12 reviewed studies, sister chromatid exchanges
	in 6 of 12 studies and micronuclei induction in 5 of 7 studies reviewed.
	In addition to these studies, Zhang et al. (2010) reported that lymphocytes
	from workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde had statistically
	increased frequency of monosomy of chromosome 7 and trisomy of chromosome
	8. Statistically significant increased frequencies of micronuclei
	were also observed in the buccal cavity or oral epithelium in four
	of five reviewed studies and in the nasal epithelium in all five
	available studies (Note that findings from two studies, Suruda et
	al. [1993] and Tikenko-Holland et al. [1996], evaluating the same
	study participants are treated as one study in this count). In addition
	to these studies, a review of cytogenetic studies in the Chinese
	literature on formaldehyde-exposed workers reported increased incidences
	of chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes (one study) and micronuclei
	in lymphocytes and nasal epithelial cells (one study each); however,
	two studies did find increases in sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes.
	Regulation of gene expression by formaldehyde was investigated in
	eight studies. Formaldehyde exposure increased expression of genes
	involved in intracellular adhesion, inflammation, xenobiotic metabolism,
	nucleic acid metabolism, cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA
	repair. Thus, multiple biochemical pathways are affected by formaldehyde
	exposure. Mechanistic considerations: Although the biological mechanisms
	associated with formaldehyde-induced cancer are not completely understood,
	it is important to recognize that chemicals can act through multiple
	toxicity pathways and mechanisms to induce cancer or other health
	effects (Guyton et al. 2009). Potential carcinogenic modes of actions
	for formaldehyde include DNA reactivity (covalent binding), gene
	mutation, chromosomal breakage, aneuploidy, and epigenetic effects.
	Studies evaluating nasal tumors in rats have shown that regional
	dosimetry, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity are believed to be important
	factors. Computational fluid dynamics models have been developed
	to predict and compare local flux values in the nasal passages of
	rats (Kimbrell et al. 1993, 1997), monkeys (Kepler et al. 1998),
	and humans (Subramaniam et al. 1998). Regions of the nasal passages
	with the highest flux values are the regions most likely affected
	by formaldehyde exposure. Similar flux values were predicted for
	rats and monkeys for regions of the nasal passages with elevated
	cell proliferation rates, thus providing support for the hypothesis
	that formaldehyde flux is a key factor for determining toxic response.
	Furthermore, DNA-protein crosslinks and cell-proliferation rates
	are correlated with the site specificity of tumors (Pala et al. 2008).
	Cell proliferation is stimulated by the cytotoxic effects of formaldehyde.
	Increased cell proliferation may contribute to carcinogenesis by
	increasing the probability of spontaneous or chemically induced mutations.
	The dose-response curves for DNA-protein crosslinks, cell proliferation,
	and tumor formation show similar patterns with sharp increases in
	slope at concentrations greater than 6 ppm. The observed sequence
	of nasal lesions is as follows: rhinitis, epithelial dysplasia, squamous
	metaplasia and hyperplasia, and squamous-cell carcinoma. Biological
	mechanisms have been proposed for the possible association between
	lymphohematopoietic cancers and formaldehyde exposure. Proposed mechanisms
	for formaldehyde-induced leukemia are: (1) direct damage to stem
	cells in the bone marrow, (2) damage to circulating stem cells, and
	(3) damage to pluripotent stem cells present in the nasal turbinate
	or olfactory mucosa (Zhang et al. 2009a,b). Evidence in support of
	the potential for DNA damage to circulating hematopoietic stem cells
	is that DNA-protein crosslinks have been identified in the nasal
	passages of laboratory animals exposed to formaldehyde, and increased
	micronuclei have been identified in the nasal and oral mucosa of
	formaldehyde-exposed humans. In addition, olfactory epithelial cells
	obtained from rat nasal passages contain hematopoietic stem cells,
	which have been shown to re-populate the hematopoietic tissue of
	irradiated rats (Murrell et al. 2005). However, some authors have
	questioned the biological plausibility of an association between
	formaldehyde exposure and leukemia, because formaldehyde is rapidly
	metabolized, and it would not be expected to enter the systemic circulation
	(Cole and Axten 2004, Golden et al. 2006, Heck and Casanova 2004,
	Pyatt et al. 2008). They stated that formaldehyde does not cause
	bone marrow toxicity or pancytopenia, which are common features of
	known leukemogens, and that the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects
	in animals and humans are limited to local effects. [The recent reports
	of adducts in leukocytes of smokers (Wang et al. 2009b), albumin
	adducts in medical research workers (Pala et al. 2008), DNA-protein
	crosslinks measured in peripheral blood cells of hospital workers
	(Shaham et al. 2003), and the hematologic changes measured by Zhang
	et al. (2010) suggest that formaldehyde might enter the systemic
	circulation of humans exposed to formaldehyde.].},

  abstract = {Executive Summary: Introduction: Styrene is a viscous, highly flammable
	liquid used worldwide in the production of polymers, which are incorporated
	into products such as rubber, plastic, insulation, fiberglass, pipes,
	automobile parts, food containers, and carpet backing. Styrene was
	nominated for possible listing in the Report on Carcinogens by a
	private individual based on its widespread use and exposure and evidence
	of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and experimental animals.
	Human Exposure: The primary use of styrene is in the manufacture
	of polystyrene, which is used extensively in the manufacture of plastic
	packaging, thermal insulation in building construction and refrigeration
	equipment, and disposable cups and containers. Styrene also is used
	in styrene-butadiene rubber, other polymers, and resins that are
	used to manufacture boats, shower stalls, tires, automotive parts,
	and many other products. U.S. production of styrene has risen steadily
	over the past 70 years, with 11.4 billion pounds produced in 2006
	(domestic production capacity for 2006 was estimated at 13.7 billion
	pounds). Styrene and styrene metabolites in blood and urine, and
	styrene-7,8-oxide-DNA adducts and styrene-7,8-oxide-hemoglobin adducts
	are generally accepted biological indices of exposure to styrene.
	The primary source of exposure to the general public is inhalation
	of indoor air; however, exposure can also occur from inhalation of
	outdoor air, ingestion of food and water, and potentially from skin
	contact. Tobacco smoke also can be a major source of styrene exposure
	for both active smokers and individuals exposed to environmental
	tobacco smoke. Outdoor and indoor air levels (including air levels
	in most other occupational settings) are generally below 1 ppb [0.001
	ppm], although higher levels have been reported. Workers in certain
	occupations, including the reinforced-plastics , styrene-butadiene,
	and styrene monomer and polymer industries, are potentially exposed
	to higher levels of styrene than the general public. Air levels in
	the reinforced-plastics industry are generally lower than 100 ppm,
	[although much higher levels have frequently been measured], while
	levels in the styrene-butadiene industry and the styrene monomer
	and polymer industries have rarely been reported to exceed 20 ppm.
	Numerous Federal agencies have established regulations for styrene,
	including the Department of Homeland Security, DOT, EPA, FDA, and
	OSHA, and both ACGIH and NIOSH have established guidelines to limit
	occupational exposure to styrene. Human Cancer Studies: Numerous
	epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between styrene
	and cancer in humans. Most of the studies are cohort studies of workers
	in three major industries: (1) the reinforced-plastics industry,
	(2) the styrene-butadiene rubber industry, and (3) the styrene monomer
	and polymer industry. Two additional cohort studies (one on biomonitored
	workers, and the second on environmental exposure to styrene-butadiene),
	several case-control studies, and an ecological study have also been
	published. The limitations of these studies include potential misclassification
	of styrene exposure and disease, small numbers of long-term workers,
	inadequate follow-up, and the potential for co-exposure to other
	chemicals. Thus, although more than a hundred thousand workers have
	been studied to assess a possible carcinogenic effect of styrene
	exposure, only a small fraction of well-characterized, high-level,
	and long-term styrene-exposed workers have been followed for a sufficiently
	long time. In addition, most of the available studies of occupational
	cohorts have focused only on male workers (who constitute the majority
	of exposed workers) or have not performed gender-specific risk analyses.
	[Thus, comparatively few data are available on cancer incidence or
	mortality among exposed female workers, limiting the ability to evaluate
	breast cancer or cancers at tissue sites specific for females.] Workers
	in the reinforced-plastics industry have the highest levels of exposure
	and few other potentially carcinogenic exposures, but many of the
	workers in this industry have short-term exposure, often of less
	than a year. Cancer mortality or incidence was studied in the following
	four populations of reinforced-plastics workers: (1) in Washington
	state in the United States (Ruder et al. 2004), (2) in 30 manufacturing
	plants in unspecified U.S. locations (Wong et al. 1994), (3) in Denmark
	(Kolstad et al. 1994), and (4) in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Italy,
	Norway, United Kingdom, and Sweden) (Kogevinas et al. 1994a). (The
	Danish and the European populations were partly overlapping, as 13,682
	Danish male workers were included among the 36,610 male workers making
	up the European cohort.) In the styrene-butadiene industry, the cohort
	studies are among the largest, with the longest follow-up times.
	The principal methodological challenge is to separate the potentially
	independent or synergistic effects of butadiene, a known human carcinogen,
	which is highly correlated with styrene in this industry. Two independent
	(non-overlapping populations) are available, a small cohort of 6,678
	male workers at a rubber tire manufacturing plant (a subset of the
	workers were engaged in the production of styrene-butadiene and other
	rubbers) (McMichael et al. 1976a) and a larger cohort established
	by Delzell and colleagues (Delzell et al. 1996, 2006) of 13,130 to
	16,610 styrene-butadiene rubber industry workers from multiple plants
	in the United States and Canada. The cohort established by Delzell
	includes most (but not all) of the workers from two cohorts - a 2-plant
	cohort (Texas) (Meinhardt et al. 1982) and an 8-plant cohort originally
	established by Matanoski and colleagues (United States and Canada)
	and reported in a series of previous publications (7 of the 8 plants
	were included in the Delzell cohort). Thus, there is considerable
	overlap between these populations. Two nested case-control studies
	(Matanoski et al.1997, Santos-Burgoa et al. 1992) of a single group
	of cases with lymphohematopoietic cancers were available from the
	Matanoski cohort. The Delzell cohort expanded the previous cohorts
	to include workers employed from 1943 to January 1, 1991 and followed
	to 1998, whereas the earlier cohort included workers employed until
	1976 and followed until 1982. In addition, the individual study populations
	were established by different procedures and exclusion criteria (which
	may partly explain the lack of complete consistency in the number
	of study subjects across the published studies) and often used different
	exposure assessments, selection of study subjects, and types of analysis.
	Two types of analyses were conducted on the Delzell cohort: external
	analyses reporting on standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for the
	total cohort or subsets of the cohorts for multiple cancers sites
	(Sathiakumar et al. 1998, 2005), and, secondly, internal analyses
	of relative risk (RR) estimates for quantitative exposure to styrene
	and lymphohematopoietic cancers (Delzell et al. 2001, 2006, Macaluso
	et al. 2006, Graff et al. 2005). (Dimethyldithiocarbamate [DMDTC]
	was also included as a potential confounder in some analyses of lymphohematopoietic
	cancer in the Delzell cohort, according to the authors, because of
	its potential immunosuppressant activity in CD4+ lymphocytes, although
	its carcinogenicity has not been evaluated outside of this series
	of studies). Workers in the styrene monomer and polymer industry
	may be exposed to a variety of chemicals, including benzene, toluene,
	ethylbenzene, and various solvents, and the cohorts are smaller,
	with many short-term workers, and few cancer outcomes. The potential
	effect of styrene on lymphohematopoietic cancers has been studied
	most extensively. Findings for lymphohematopoietic cancer and other
	tumor sites of interest are discussed below. Lymphohematopoietic
	cancers: Statistically significant increases were observed for all
	lymphohematopoietic cancers combined and leukemia among rubber-tire
	manufacturing workers (McMichael et al. 1976) and statistically nonsignificant
	increases were observed for combined lymphohematopoietic cancers
	and some specific lymphohematopoietic cancers in the Meinhardt and
	Matanoski cohorts, but the potentially confounding effects of butadiene
	and other exposures were not analyzed. Two nested case-control studies
	(using different types of analyses and exposure assessments and the
	same group of cases) from the Matanoski cohort attempted to evaluate
	the relative contribution of styrene and butadiene to lymphohematopoietic
	cancer mortality. Santos-Burgoa et al. (1992) found no significant
	excess risks for combined and specific lymphohematopoietic cancers
	and mean exposure after controlling for butadiene exposure. Matanoski
	et al. (1997) calculated risks for both average and cumulative exposure
	to styrene. Taking into account butadiene exposure, and demographic
	and employment variables in step-down regression analyses, these
	models found, for an average exposure of 1 ppm vs. no exposure, significant
	associations for all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined, lymphomas,
	and myeloma, but not leukemia. For cumulative exposure, significant
	positive associations between styrene exposure and combined lymphohematopoietic
	cancers, leukemia, and myeloma were found, with butadiene exposure
	dropping out of each of the final models except for leukemia. Specific
	lymphohematopoietic cancers have been studied more extensively in
	the Delzell cohort. With respect to leukemia, statistically significant
	increases have been reported among subgroups of workers with longer
	durations of employment and longer latency, with the highest cumulative
	exposure, and in certain specific job groups (Sathiakumar et al.
	2005, Delzell et al. 2006). Internal analyses by Delzell et al. involving
	single-chemical (styrene only), 2-chemical (styrene and butadiene),
	and 3-chemical (styrene, butadiene, and DMDTC) models of cumulative
	exposure have shown increased relative risks of leukemia with increasing
	cumulative styrene exposure. However, the response was attenuated
	when controlling for exposure to butadiene and was no longer apparent
	(RRs were less than or equal to one) after additionally controlling
	for DMDTC. Elevated risks for leukemia were also observed with increasing
	exposure to styrene peaks in single-chemical, 2-chemical and 3-chemical
	models (although it was attenuated somewhat in the 2- and 3-chemical
	models) (Graff et al. 2005, Delzell et al. 2006). No statistically
	significant increased risks were found for other lymphohematopoietic
	cancers in all employees of the Delzell cohort, but statistically
	significant risks of NHL and CLL combined were found among workers
	with higher exposure in an external (SMR) analysis, and in internal
	analyses among ever-hourly workers, ever-hourly workers with 10+
	years of employment and 20 to 29 years or 30 years since first hire,
	and among specific job groups. Risks of NHL or NHL and CLL combined
	appeared to increase with increasing cumulative styrene exposure;
	the risks increased when butadiene was added to the model, and were
	somewhat attenuated in models that included DMDTC. Exposure to butadiene
	did not appear to be related to NHL and CLL combined or NHL risk.
	[However, it should be noted that no trend analyses were performed
	on these data.] (Graff et al. 2005, Delzell et al. 2006). No associations
	were found for other types of lymphohematopoietic cancers and styrene
	exposure in the Delzell cohort. In the reinforced-plastics industry,
	among the highest-exposure groups, the total number of observed versus
	expected deaths or cases across the four cohorts were comparable
	for all lymphohematopoietic (52 observed vs. 52.8 expected), lymphomas
	(14 vs. 15.1), or leukemia (19 vs. 19.8), and were slightly higher
	than expected for Hodgkin's disease (11 observed vs. 7.9 expected)
	and multiple myeloma (4 vs. 3.4). Significantly increased risks for
	leukemia incidence were reported in the Danish study among workers
	with earlier first date of exposure, and who had worked at least
	10 years since first employment, but not for workers employed for
	1 year or more (Kolstad et al. 1994). In the European multi-country
	cohort (which overlaps with the Danish study), no excess of leukemia
	mortality was found, and no exposure-response relationships with
	cumulative or average exposure were observed, although a non-significant
	trend was observed with time since first exposure (Kogevinas et al.
	1994a). With respect to other lymphohematopoietic cancers, non-significantly
	increased risks for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were found in the Danish
	and European multi-country cohorts. Positive exposure-response relationships
	with average styrene exposure and time since first exposure was observed
	for lymphohematopoietic cancers (P = 0.019 and 0.012, respectively)
	and for malignant lymphoma (P = 0.052 and 0. 072, respectively) in
	the European multi-country cohort, but no relationship with cumulative
	exposure was observed (Kogevinas et al. 1994a). No excesses in mortality
	from any lymphohematopoietic cancers were observed in the two smaller
	cohort studies (Ruder et al. 2004 and Wong et al. 1994). In the styrene
	monomer and polymer industries, the risk of lymphohematopoietic malignancies
	was also increased in most of the studies (as well as the total number
	of observed cases across studies), but these workers might also have
	been exposed to benzene. Pancreatic cancer: Among the highest styrene-exposed
	group in the reinforced-plastics industry, there was an excess in
	the total number of observed cases of pancreatic cancer across the
	four cohort studies compared with the total number of expected cases
	[corresponding to an SMR of 1.77 (95 \% CI = 1.23 to 247)]. Increases
	in pancreatic cancer risk were observed in three of the four reinforced-plastics
	industry cohorts (one of which was statistically significant [Kolstad
	et al. 1995], and the other two of which were nonsignificant [Kogevinas
	et al. 1994a, Ruder et al. 2004]). The risk of pancreatic cancer
	was slightly higher among the Danish workers with longer term employment
	and earlier start date, and increased with cumulative exposure in
	the multi-plant cohort. No indications of exposure-response relationships
	were found in the smaller U.S. cohorts. Statistically nonsignificant
	increased risks were also observed in one study in the styrene monomer
	and polymer industry (Frentzel-Beyme et al. 1978), and among biomonitored
	workers (10 years after the first measurement) (Anttila et al. 1998).
	However, no increased risk of pancreatic cancer was reported among
	styrene-butadiene workers (Sathiakumar et al. 2005). Esophageal cancer:
	Among workers with high potential exposure to styrene, increases
	in esophageal cancer risk were reported in three of the four cohorts
	(statistically significant increases in mortality were observed among
	all exposed workers in the two U.S. studies of reinforced-plastics
	workers [Ruder et al. 2004, and Wong et al. 1994] and a statistically
	nonsignificant increase among a subset of laminators in the European
	cohort [Kogevinas et al. 1994a]). Risks were not elevated among the
	Danish reinforced-plastics workers (Kolstad et al. 1994). Across
	the industry, an approximately 2-fold excess of esophageal cancer
	was observed among high-exposed groups (laminators and others). A
	nonsignificant trend with cumulative exposure was reported in the
	European multi-country study. No increases in risk were reported
	among styrene-butadiene rubber workers or among styrene monomer and
	polymer workers. Other sites: Findings were less consistent for cancer
	at other sites. Significantly increased risks were observed for cancers
	of the lung, larynx, stomach, benign neoplasms, cervix and other
	female tumors, prostate, rectum, and urinary system in either a single
	study or two studies. There were some supporting exposure-response
	data for cancers of the urinary system and rectum. A significant
	increase in breast cancer mortality was observed in a case-control
	study of occupational exposures among adult females (Cantor et al.
	1995), although there was no evidence of increased risk between low-
	and high-exposure categories. An ecological study reported a significant
	increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer in the general population,
	but exposure estimates were based on environmental releases of styrene,
	which are the least precise measures of exposure. Studies in Experimental
	Animals The carcinogenicity of styrene in rats and mice has been
	investigated by several routes of exposure. Other relevant studies
	in experimental animals include studies of mixtures (beta-nitrostyrene
	and styrene) and studies of the major metabolite of styrene, styrene-7,8-oxide
	(styrene oxide). Mice: Three strains of mice were exposed to styrene
	by gavage. In male B6C3F1 mice, exposure to styrene for 5 days per
	week for 78 weeks was associated with a significantly increased incidence
	of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and carcinoma (combined) in high-dose
	(300 mg/kg) animals, and a significant positive dose-response trend
	was observed (NCI 1979a). NCI questioned the significance of these
	lung tumors because the incidence in the control group was unusually
	low compared with historical untreated controls, and only small numbers
	of vehicle historical controls were available from the same testing
	laboratory. [However, a larger number of vehicle (corn oil)-treated
	historical controls from this same time period (prior to 1979), with
	similar study duration, and from the same source as the styrene study
	were available from a different testing laboratory. Results from
	these historical vehicle controls indicated that the concurrent vehicle
	controls in the NCI study were not unusually low and the lung tumor
	incidence in the high-dose group was significantly increased compared
	with those historical controls.] There also was a significant dose-response
	trend for hepatocellular adenomas in female B6C3F1 mice, but no significant
	pair-wise comparisons were observed. The other gavage study included
	a single dose of styrene administered to pregnant dams on gestation
	day 17 and weekly exposures of the pups after weaning (Pomomarkov
	and Tomatis 1978). O20 mice (a strain with a high spontaneous incidence
	of lung tumors) were dosed at 1,350 mg/kg and C57Bl mice were dosed
	at 300 mg/kg. A significantly higher incidence and earlier onset
	of lung tumors (adenoma and carcinoma combined) occurred in both
	male and female O20 mice compared with vehicle controls. Tumor incidence
	was not significantly increased in C57Bl mice. Significantly increased
	incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar
	adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred in male CD-1 mice at inhalation
	exposure concentrations of 40 to 160 ppm over a period of 104 weeks
	and in female mice at exposure concentrations of 20, 40, and 160
	ppm over a period of 98 weeks (Cruzan et al. 2001). Female mice in
	the high-dose (160-ppm) group also had increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar
	carcinoma. No increased incidences of tumors were observed in female
	A/J mice (also a strain susceptible to lung tumors) treated with
	20 intraperitoneal injections of styrene over 7 weeks (total dose
	of 200 mumol [approximately 100 mg/kg b.w.]) and evaluated 20 weeks
	after the last injection (Brunnemann et al. 1992). Rats: Several
	of the studies in rats were limited because of short duration, high
	mortality, incomplete histopathology, or incomplete reporting. None
	of the carcinogenicity studies reviewed in rats showed evidence of
	lung tumors, and none of the gavage (NCI 1979a, Pomomarkov and Tomatis
	1978, Conti et al. 1988), or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection
	studies (Conti et al. 1988) reported an increased incidence in any
	tumor type. An oral gavage study in F344 rats (NCI 1979a) and an
	inhalation study in Sprague-Dawley rats (Cruzan et al. 1998) were
	the most robust and most completely reported carcinogenicity studies.
	Neither study showed an increase in tumor incidences in styrene-exposed
	rats, although Sprague-Dawley rats exhibited a negative trend in
	pituitary and mammary gland tumors and a positive trend for testicular
	interstitial-cell tumors. In another inhalation study in Sprague-Dawley
	rats, there was a dose-related increase in the incidences of malignant
	mammary gland tumors; treatment-related and statistically significant
	incidences of these tumors were seen in the top three dose groups
	(Conti et al. 1988). A drinking-water study did not report any dose-related
	carcinogenic effects (Beliles et al. 1985). However, statistical
	reanalyses of study data indicated a marginal increase in the incidence
	of mammary fibroadenoma in high-dose female rats and a significant
	dose-related trend. Another inhalation study (Jersey et al. 1978)
	[unpublished but reviewed in several published reports] indicated
	that styrene was associated with a statistically significant increase
	in incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma in the low- (600-ppm) but
	not high-dose (1000-ppm) group and a significant increase (when compared
	with historical but not concurrent controls) in the combined incidence
	of lymphosarcoma and leukemia in female rats in both the 600-ppm
	and 1000-ppm dose groups. The authors did not consider the mammary
	adenocarcinomas to be causally associated with styrene exposure because
	the incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma was low compared with historical
	controls and there was no incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma in
	the high-dose group. Elevated incidences of leukemia/lymphosarcoma
	were observed in both treatment groups of female Sprague Dawley rats
	in this inhalation study. Mixtures and Metabolite Studies: No increase
	in tumor incidence was observed in rats exposed by gavage (3 days
	per week) to a mixture of 70\% styrene and 30\% beta-nitrostyrene
	over 78 weeks (NCI 1979b), but an increased incidence of lung tumors
	was observed in male mice in the 175 mg/kg dose group, but not in
	the 350 mg/kg dose group exposed to this styrene/beta-nitrostyrene
	mixture. [However, because of poor survival of the high-dose male
	mice there were substantially fewer animals at risk for late-occurring
	tumors.] The styrene metabolite, styrene-7,8-oxide, was previously
	evaluated for carcinogenicity and is listed in the Report on Carcinogens
	[first listed in the 10th Report on Carcinogens, 2002] as reasonably
	anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on forestomach tumors
	in rats and mice and liver tumors in male mice. Absorption, Distribution,
	Metabolism, and Excretion: Styrene can be absorbed through inhalation,
	ingestion, or skin contact, but the most important route of exposure
	in humans in occupational settings is by inhalation, which results
	in rapid absorption and distribution of approximately 60\% to 70\%
	of inhaled styrene; the highest tissue concentrations are in subcutaneous
	fat. Food is also an important source of exposure for the general
	population. Metabolic activation of styrene results in formation
	primarily of the genotoxic metabolite styrene-7,8-oxide, which can
	be detoxified by glutathione conjugation or conversion to styrene
	glycol by microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Styrene is metabolized in
	both the liver and the lung, and the Clara cells in the lung are
	regarded as the major cell type in styrene activation following inhalation
	exposure. The initial step in styrene metabolism is catalyzed by
	cytochromes P450; CYP2E1 and Cyp2f2 are the predominant enzymes in
	humans and experimental animals. In animals, CYP2E1 predominates
	in liver, while Cyp2f2 is the primary enzyme in mouse lung. CYP2A13,
	CYP2F1, CYP2S1, CYP3A5, and CYP4B1 are preferentially expressed in
	the lung compared with liver in humans, and the human CYP2F1 has
	been shown to be capable of metabolizing styrene when expressed in
	vitro. Because styrene-7,8-oxide contains a chiral carbon, this and
	some subsequent styrene metabolites can exist as either R- or S-enantiomers.
	A second metabolic pathway through styrene-3,4-oxide results in formation
	of 4-vinylphenol, which has been detected in humans, rats, and mice
	in vivo, but the importance of 4-vinylphenol in styrene toxicity
	has not been well characterized. Almost all absorbed styrene is excreted
	as urinary metabolites, primarily mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic
	acid. Species differences exist among rats, mice, and humans in the
	metabolism and toxicity of styrene, which may be related, at least
	in part, to interspecies differences in the stereochemistry of metabolism.
	The R-enantiomer, which has been suggested by some reports to be
	more toxic than the S-form, has been reported to be produced in relatively
	larger amounts in mouse lung than in rat lung, but the difference
	was less pronounced when microsomal preparations were used. In mice,
	the R-isomer of styrene-7,8-oxide was significantly more hepatotoxic
	than the S-isomer; the toxicity of the R-isomer also was greater
	in the lung, but the difference was not statistically significant.
	Toxicity: Styrene exposure has been associated with numerous health
	effects in humans and laboratory animals. The acute toxicity of styrene
	is low to moderate with an oral LD50 of 320 mg/kg and an inhalation
	LC50 of 4,940 ppm (4-hour exposure) in mice and an oral LD50 of 5,000
	mg/kg and an inhalation LC50 of 2,770 ppm (2-hour exposure) in rats.
	The primary effects of acute exposure to styrene in experimental
	animals and humans include irritation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory
	tract and CNS effects. Drowsiness, listlessness, muscular weakness,
	and unsteadiness are common signs of systemic styrene intoxication.
	Several studies have reported effects on color vision, hearing threshold,
	reaction time, and postural stability following long-term occupational
	exposure to styrene at concentrations ranging from about 20 to 30
	ppm. Reports of ischemic heart disease and hepatic, renal, hematological,
	and immunological effects have been inconsistent. Human data are
	insufficient to determine whether styrene is a reproductive or developmental
	toxicant, but effects of styrene to increase serum prolactin levels
	in humans have been reported. Styrene toxicity in experimental animals
	is similar to that reported in humans. Exposure to styrene vapors
	can cause eye and respiratory tract irritation, CNS depression, and
	death. Clara cells are the main target of styrene pneumotoxicity,
	and the available data indicate increased susceptibility in the mouse.
	Glutathione depletion as a result of styrene exposures has been reported
	to be associated with damage to lung, liver, and kidney tissues.
	The cytotoxicity of styrene in the mouse lung, a tissue high in CYP2F
	isoforms, could be prevented by CYP2F inhibitors. Some studies have
	reported reproductive and developmental effects, but these effects
	were seen mostly at doses associated with maternal toxicity. Reported
	effects have included embryonic, fetal, and neonatal death, skeletal
	and kidney abnormalities, decreased birth weight, neurobehavioral
	abnormalities, and postnatal developmental delays. The possibility
	of polystyrene dimer and trimer extracts from food containers mimicking
	the physiological effects of estrogen have also been investigated,
	but with a mixture of positive and negative results. Genetic Damage:
	In vitro studies show that styrene-7,8-oxide forms DNA adducts and
	causes single-strand breaks in a dose-related manner. Several studies
	have shown a correlation between single-strand breaks and DNA adducts
	and indicate that the strand breaks, which are not generally regarded
	as significantly lethal or mutagenic lesions, are efficiently repaired
	within several hours after exposure has stopped. Adducts are formed
	primarily at the N7-, N2-, and O6-positions of guanine. N7-adducts
	are formed in the greatest amount but are the least persistent, while
	O6-adducts are formed in the least amount but are the most persistent.
	Styrene-7,8-oxide was mutagenic without metabolic activation in all
	in vitro mutagenicity test systems reported and caused mutations
	in some studies in the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Both styrene
	and styrene-7,8-oxide caused cytogenetic effects (sister chromatid
	exchange [SCE], chromosomal aberrations, and micronuclei) in human
	lymphocytes or other mammalian cells in vitro. DNA adducts have been
	detected in liver and lung cells of mice and rats exposed to styrene
	in vivo, although the levels varied across studies. The majority
	of studies in experimental animals demonstrated an effect of both
	styrene-7,8-oxide and styrene exposure on single-strand breaks, while
	both positive and negative results for cytogenetic or clastogenic
	effects of styrene were reported. DNA adducts, primarily N7- and
	O6-adducts, were reported in white blood cells in all studies of
	styrene-exposed workers employed mainly in hand-lamination plants.
	In most studies in workers, single-strand breaks showed exposure-related
	increases; however, two studies gave negative results. The limited
	data on mutation frequencies in HPRT and GPA in styrene-exposed workers
	are inconclusive. More than half the studies measuring chromosomal
	aberrations have reported an increase in chromosomal aberrations
	in styrene-exposed workers (or subgroups of workers), and several
	studies have reported a positive exposure-response relationship with
	styrene air levels or urinary metabolites. A meta-analysis of 22
	studies found a positive association between styrene exposure level
	and chromosomal aberration frequency when exposure levels were dichotomized
	as greater than or less than a threshold value of 30 ppm for an 8-hour
	time-weighted average. Studies of other cytogenetic markers in humans
	are conflicting. About half of the studies that evaluated micronucleus
	and SCE frequency in styrene workers were positive, and a few studies
	have reported significant dose-response relationships with styrene
	exposure. A meta-analysis of 10 micronucleus studies was inconclusive,
	and a meta-analysis of 14 SCE studies indicated a slight increase
	in SCE frequency but, again, was too small to be conclusive. A number
	of studies have been published on the possible modulating role of
	genetic polymorphisms, mainly in xenobiotic metabolism enzymes and
	DNA-repair genes, at the level of various biomarkers. Some authors
	have suggested that genetic susceptibility (probably at many loci)
	may be important in styrene-mediated genotoxicity. Mechanistic Data:
	The proposed mechanisms for the carcinogenicity of styrene include
	both genotoxic and epigenetic pathways. These mechanisms, which are
	not necessarily mutually exclusive, include: (1) metabolic conversion
	of styrene to styrene-7,8-oxide and subsequent induction of DNA damage
	in the target tissue and (2) cytotoxic effects of styrene metabolites
	in the mouse lung. A variety of DNA adducts (including some at base-pairing
	sites on nucleotides) induced by styrene and styrene-7,8-oxide has
	been identified in human cells, experimental animals, and occupationally
	exposed workers, but the covalent binding indices for both molecules
	are relatively low in rats and mice. The DNA damage induced by styrene
	exposure, including single-strand breaks, was found to correlate
	significantly with markers of styrene exposure in some studies of
	styrene workers. Styrene is mutagenic through the formation of styrene-7,8-oxide
	(in vitro). A number of studies reported a positive association between
	occupational exposure to styrene and the frequency of chromosomal
	aberrations, with some studies reporting exposure-response relationships.
	Some authors have suggested that polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes
	could put some individuals at higher risk for styrene genotoxicity
	or carcinogenicity. Many researchers have tried to explain why lung
	tumors were observed in mice but not in rats in long-term inhalation
	exposure studies. Some researchers have proposed that styrene exposure
	causes pulmonary hyperplasia in the mouse lung, which may play a
	role in the development of lung tumors. Effects of repeated styrene
	exposure observed in the lungs of mice, but not in rats, included
	focal crowding of bronchiolar cells, bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia,
	and bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia. The Harvard Center for Risk
	Analysis (Cohen et al. 2002) considered three factors as possible
	explanations for the greater susceptibility of mouse lung than rat
	lung to development of hyperplasia leading to tumors with exposure
	to styrene are: (1) the presence of the styrene-metabolizing cytochromes
	in mouse lung tissues, (2) greater formation of the R-enantiomer
	of styrene-7,8-oxide, and (3) the susceptibility of mouse lung tissue
	to glutathione depletion. However, they concluded that although toxicokinetic
	models generally predict higher rates of metabolism by mice and rats
	than by humans, the models do not consistently predict a difference
	between the rodent species. An alternative mechanism is that interspecies
	differences in styrene toxicity are most likely explained through
	CYP2F-generated metabolites (2f2 in mice, 2F4 in rats, and 2F1 in
	humans) in the mouse lung. This is based on data showing that most
	of the effects of cytotoxicity and tumor formation were seen in mouse
	respiratory tissues, which are high in CYP2F isoforms, and that CYP2F
	inhibitors prevented cytotoxicity. Moreover, metabolites formed from
	ring oxidation, including 4-vinylphenol, are about 6-fold higher
	in mice compared with rats, and 4-vinylphenol is more potent than
	styrene-7,8-oxide as a pneumotoxicant.},

	a 'forest' of 6,901 phylogenetic trees for prokaryotic genes revealed
	a consistent phylogenetic signal, particularly among 102 nearly universal
	trees, despite high levels of topological inconsistency, probably
	due to horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal transfers seemed to be

	Thus, the nearly universal trees might reflect a significant central

  pages = {R27},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping microbiologists
	understand the factors involved in gene innovation. Among these,
	the expansion and reduction of gene families appears to have a fundamental
	role in this, but the factors influencing gene family size are unclear.
	RESULTS: The relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes
	increases with genome size, largely due to the expansion of gene
	family size in large genomes. Bacteria undergoing genome reduction
	display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene
	families are reduced to one or a few members. Gene family size is
	also influenced by sequence divergence and physiological function.
	Large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they
	are probably older, and certain functions (such as metabolite transport
	mechanisms) are overrepresented in large families. The size of a
	given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of the same species
	and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families
	are vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer
	(HGT). CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable preservation of copy numbers in
	widely different ecotypes indicates a functional role for the different
	copies rather than simply a back-up role. When different genera are
	compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological
	specialization disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner
	and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports this view.
	HGT can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families,

  abstract = {Global surveys of genomes measure the usage of essential molecular
	parts, defined here as protein families, superfamilies or folds,
	in different organisms. Based on surveys of the first 20 completely
	sequenced genomes, we observe that the occurrence of these parts
	follows a power-law distribution. That is, the number of distinct
	parts (F) with a given genomic occurrence (V) decays as F=aV(-b),
	with a few parts occurring many times and most occurring infrequently.
	For a given organism, the distributions of families, superfamilies
	and folds are nearly identical, and this is reflected in the size
	of the decay exponent b. Moreover, the exponent varies between different
	organisms, with those of smaller genomes displaying a steeper decay
	(i.e. larger b). Clearly, the power law indicates a preference to
	duplicate genes that encode for molecular parts which are already
	common. Here, we present a minimal, but biologically meaningful model
	that accurately describes the observed power law. Although the model
	performs equally well for all three protein classes, we focus on
	the occurrence of folds in preference to families and superfamilies.
	This is because folds are comparatively insensitive to the effects
	of point mutations that can cause a family member to diverge beyond
	detectable similarity. In the model, genomes evolve through two basic
	operations: (i) duplication of existing genes; (ii) net flow of new
	genes. The flow term is closely related to the exponent b and can
	accommodate considerable gene loss; however, we demonstrate that
	the observed data is reproduced best with a net inflow, i.e. with
	more gene gain than loss. Moreover, we show that prokaryotes have
	much higher rates of gene acquisition than eukaryotes, probably reflecting
	lateral transfer. A further natural outcome from our model is an
	estimation of the fold composition of the initial genome, which potentially
	relates to the common ancestor for modern organisms. Supplementary

	and 974 nt and each had one open reading frame. RNA1 potentially
	encoded a 97.5 kDa protein carrying the GDD motif typical of RNA-dependent

	distantly related to known viral RdRps, with the closest similarity

	Narnaviridae. RNA2 encoded a 31.6 kDa protein which, expressed in
	bacteria as a His-tag fusion protein and in plants through agroinfiltration,
	reacted specifically with antibodies made against tubular structures
	found in the cytoplasm. The ORF2 product is significantly similar

	little is known about the precise mechanisms and the role of duplication
	divergence in the evolution of protein networks from the prokaryote
	and eukaryote domains. We developed a novel, model-based approach
	for Bayesian inference on biological network data that centres on
	approximate Bayesian computation, or likelihood-free inference. Instead
	of computing the intractable likelihood of the protein network topology,
	our method summarizes key features of the network and, based on these,
	uses a MCMC algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution of
	the model parameters. This allowed us to reliably fit a flexible
	mixture model that captures hallmarks of evolution by gene duplication
	and subfunctionalization to protein interaction network data of Helicobacter
	pylori and Plasmodium falciparum. The 80\% credible intervals for
	the duplication-divergence component are [0.64, 0.98] for H. pylori
	and [0.87, 0.99] for P. falciparum. The remaining parameter estimates
	are not inconsistent with sequence data. An extensive sensitivity
	analysis showed that incompleteness of PIN data does not largely
	affect the analysis of models of protein network evolution, and that
	the degree sequence alone barely captures the evolutionary footprints
	of protein networks relative to other statistics. Our likelihood-free
	inference approach enables a fully Bayesian analysis of a complex
	and highly stochastic system that is otherwise intractable at present.
	Modelling the evolutionary history of PIN data, it transpires that
	only the simultaneous analysis of several global aspects of protein
	networks enables credible and consistent inference to be made from
	available datasets. Our results indicate that gene duplication has
	played a larger part in the network evolution of the eukaryote than
	in the prokaryote, and suggests that single gene duplications with
	immediate divergence alone may explain more than 60\% of biological
	network data in both domains.},

  volume = {56},
  pages = {718--729},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {Gene duplication is commonly regarded as the main evolutionary path
	toward the gain of a new function. However, even with gene duplication,
	there is a loss-versus-gain dilemma: most newly born duplicates degrade
	to pseudogenes, since degenerative mutations are much more frequent
	than advantageous ones. Thus, something additional seems to be needed
	to shift the loss versus gain equilibrium toward functional divergence.
	We suggest that epigenetic silencing of duplicates might play this
	role in evolution. This study began when we noticed in a previous
	publication (Lynch M, Conery JS [2000] Science 291:1151-1155) that
	the frequency of functional young gene duplicates is higher in organisms
	that have cytosine methylation (H. sapiens, M. musculus, and A. thaliana)
	than in organisms that do not have methylated genomes (S. cerevisiae,
	D. melanogaster, and C. elegans). We find that genome data analysis
	confirms the likelihood of much more efficient functional divergence
	of gene duplicates in mammals and plants than in yeast, nematode,
	and fly. We have also extended the classic model of gene duplication,
	in which newly duplicated genes have exactly the same expression
	pattern, to the case when they are epigenetically silenced in a tissue-
	and/or developmental stage-complementary manner. This exposes each
	of the duplicates to negative selection, thus protecting from "pseudogenization."
	Our analysis indicates that this kind of silencing (i) enhances evolution
	of duplicated genes to new functions, particularly in small populations,
	(ii) is quite consistent with the subfunctionalization model when
	degenerative but complementary mutations affect different subfunctions
	of the gene, and (iii) furthermore, may actually cooperate with the
	DDC (duplication-degeneration-complementation) process.},

	The procedure was applied to comparing the orders of orthologous

	in the identification of 188 clusters of gene arrays, which included

	of the evolutionary history of organisms on the basis of full-scale
	comparison of their genomes. In addition to brute force, genome-wide
	analysis of alignments, rare genomic changes (RGCs) that are thought
	to comprise derived shared characters of individual clades are increasingly
	used in genome-wide phylogenetic studies. We propose a new type of
	RGCs designated RGC_CAMs (after Conserved Amino acids-Multiple substitutions),
	which are inferred using a genome-scale analysis of protein and underlying
	nucleotide sequence alignments. The RGC_CAM approach utilizes amino
	acid residues conserved in major eukaryotic lineages, with the exception
	of a few species comprising a putative clade, and selects for phylogenetic
	inference only those amino acid replacements that require 2 or 3
	nucleotide substitutions, in order to reduce homoplasy. The RGC_CAM
	analysis was combined with a procedure for rigorous statistical testing
	of competing phylogenetic hypotheses. The RGC_CAM method is shown
	to be robust to branch length differences and taxon sampling. When
	applied to animal phylogeny, the RGC_CAM approach strongly supports
	the coelomate clade that unites chordates with arthropods as opposed
	to the ecdysozoan (molting animals) clade. This conclusion runs against
	the view of animal evolution that is currently prevailing in the
	evo-devo community. The final solution to the coelomate-ecdysozoa
	controversy will require a much larger set of complete genome sequences
	representing diverse animal taxa. It is expected that RGC_CAM and

	multigene family that undergoes birth-and-death evolution. By analyzing
	the evolutionary relationships among internalins, a relatively large

	the unequal transmittal of gene duplicates during or subsequent to
	the speciation process. As such, in addition to providing the first

	number of exciting approaches to the modeling of evolutionary mechanisms
	within the genome. Separately, dynamical and statistical analyses
	of networks such as the World Wide Web and the social interactions
	existing between humans have shown that these networks can exhibit
	common fractal properties-including the property of being scale-free.
	This work attempts to bridge these two fields and demonstrate that
	the fractal properties of molecular networks are linked to the fractal
	properties of their underlying genomes. RESULTS: We suggest a stochastic
	model capable of describing the evolutionary growth of metabolic
	or signal-transduction networks. This model generates networks that
	share important statistical properties (so-called scale-free behavior)
	with real molecular networks. In particular, the frequency of vertices
	connected to exactly k other vertices follows a power-law distribution.
	The shape of this distribution remains invariant to changes in network
	scale: a small subgraph has the same distribution as the complete
	graph from which it is derived. Furthermore, the model correctly
	predicts that the frequencies of distinct DNA and protein domains
	also follow a power-law distribution. Finally, the model leads to
	a simple equation linking the total number of different DNA and protein
	domains in a genome with both the total number of genes and the overall
	network topology. AVAILABILITY: MatLab (MathWorks, Inc.) programs

	substitution rates, however, we still do not know whether such variability
	is due to species-specific trends at a genomic scale, or whether
	it can be attributed to the fluctuations inherent in any stochastic
	process. Here, we study the statistical properties of gene and protein-family

	sizes of these species are drawn from the same distribution. In addition,
	we find that for species classified in the same phylogenetic branch

	significantly more similar than for species in different branches.
	These two findings can be accounted for in terms of a dynamical birth,
	death, and innovation model that assumes identical protein-family

	results thus strongly suggest that the variability empirically observed

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Anoxybacillus have
	been found in diverse thermophilic habitats, such as geothermal hot
	springs and manure, and in processed foods such as gelatin and milk
	powder. Anoxybacillus flavithermus is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium
	found in super-saturated silica solutions and in opaline silica sinter.
	The ability of A. flavithermus to grow in super-saturated silica
	solutions makes it an ideal subject to study the processes of sinter
	formation, which might be similar to the biomineralization processes
	that occurred at the dawn of life. RESULTS: We report here the complete
	genome sequence of A. flavithermus strain WK1, isolated from the
	waste water drain at the Wairakei geothermal power station in New
	Zealand. It consists of a single chromosome of 2,846,746 base pairs
	and is predicted to encode 2,863 proteins. In silico genome analysis
	identified several enzymes that could be involved in silica adaptation
	and biofilm formation, and their predicted functions were experimentally
	validated in vitro. Proteomic analysis confirmed the regulation of
	biofilm-related proteins and crucial enzymes for the synthesis of
	long-chain polyamines as constituents of silica nanospheres. CONCLUSIONS:
	Microbial fossils preserved in silica and silica sinters are excellent
	objects for studying ancient life, a new paleobiological frontier.

	at identifying distant protein relationships than are searches that

	a PSSM and comparing it with a database of sequences is Position-Specific

	package, IMPALA, designed for the complementary procedure of comparing
	a single query sequence with a database of PSI-BLAST-generated PSSMs.
	We illustrate the use of IMPALA to search a database of PSSMs for
	protein folds, and one for protein domains involved in signal transduction.
	IMPALA's sensitivity to distant biological relationships is very
	similar to that of PSI-BLAST. However, IMPALA employs a more refined
	analysis of statistical significance and, unlike PSI-BLAST, guarantees
	the output of the optimal local alignment by using the rigorous Smith-Waterman
	algorithm. Also, it is considerably faster when run with a large
	database of PSSMs than is BLAST or PSI-BLAST when run against the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence related families of genes and proteins are common
	in bacterial genomes. In Escherichia coli they constitute over half
	of the genome. The presence of families and superfamilies of proteins
	suggest a history of gene duplication and divergence during evolution.
	Genome encoded protein families, their size and functional composition,
	reflect metabolic potentials of the organisms they are found in.
	Comparing protein families of different organisms give insight into
	functional differences and similarities. RESULTS: Equivalent enzyme
	families with metabolic functions were selected from the genomes
	of four experimentally characterized bacteria belonging to separate
	genera. Both similarities and differences were detected in the protein
	family memberships, with more similarities being detected among the
	more closely related organisms. Protein family memberships reflected
	known metabolic characteristics of the organisms. Differences in
	divergence of functionally characterized enzyme family members accounted
	for characteristics of taxa known to differ in those biochemical
	properties and capabilities. While some members of the gene families
	will have been acquired by lateral exchange and other former family
	members will have been lost over time, duplication and divergence
	of genes and functions appear to have been a significant contributor
	to the functional diversity of today's microbes. CONCLUSIONS: Protein
	families seem likely to have arisen during evolution by gene duplication
	and divergence where the gene copies that have been retained are
	the variants that have led to distinct bacterial physiologies and
	taxa. Thus divergence of the duplicate enzymes has been a major process

  abstract = {Recent investigations of high-throughput genomic and phenomic data
	have uncovered a variety of significant but relatively weak correlations
	between a gene's functional and evolutionary characteristics. In
	particular, essential genes and genes with paralogs have a slight
	propensity to evolve more slowly than nonessential genes and singletons,
	respectively. However, given the weakness and multiplicity of these
	associations, their biological relevance remains uncertain. Here,
	we show that existence of an essential paralog can be used as a specific
	and strong gauge of selection. We partition gene families in several
	genomes into two classes: those that include at least one essential
	gene (E-families) and those without essential genes (N-families).
	We find that weaker purifying selection causes N-families to evolve
	in a more dynamic regime with higher rates both of duplicate fixation
	and pseudogenization. Because genes in E-families are subject to
	significantly stronger purifying selection than those in N-families,
	they survive longer and exhibit greater sequence divergence. Longer
	average survival time also allows for divergence of upstream regulatory
	regions, resulting in change of transcriptional context among paralogs
	in E-families. These findings are compatible with differential division
	of ancestral functions (subfunctionalization) or emergence of novel
	functions (neofunctionalization) being the prevalent modes of evolution
	of paralogs in E-families as opposed to pseudogenization (nonfunctionalization),
	which is the typical fate of paralogs in N-families. Unlike other
	characteristics of genes, such as essentiality, existence of paralogs,
	or expression level, membership in an E-family or an N-family strongly
	correlates with the level of selection and appears to be a major

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many drugs of natural origin are hydrophobic and can pass
	through cell membranes. Hydrophobic molecules must be susceptible
	to active efflux systems if they are to be maintained at lower concentrations
	in cells than in their environment. Multi-drug resistance (MDR),
	often mediated by intrinsic membrane proteins that couple energy
	to drug efflux, provides this function. All eukaryotic genomes encode
	several gene families capable of encoding MDR functions, among which
	the ABC transporters are the largest. The number of candidate MDR
	genes means that study of the drug-resistance properties of an organism
	cannot be effectively carried out without taking a genomic perspective.
	RESULTS: We have annotated sequences for all 60 ABC transporters
	from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, and performed a phylogenetic
	analysis of these along with the 49 human, 30 yeast, and 57 fly ABC
	transporters currently available in GenBank. Classification according
	to a unified nomenclature is presented. Comparison between genomes
	reveals much gene duplication and loss, and surprisingly little orthology
	among analogous genes. Proteins capable of conferring MDR are found
	in several distinct subfamilies and are likely to have arisen independently
	multiple times. CONCLUSIONS: ABC transporter evolution fits a pattern
	expected from a process termed 'dynamic-coherence'. This is an unusual
	result for such a highly conserved gene family as this one, present
	in all domains of cellular life. Mechanistically, this may result
	from the broad substrate specificity of some ABC proteins, which
	both reduces selection against gene loss, and leads to the facile
	sorting of functions among paralogs following gene duplication.},

	activity propagation between the sub-networks. We statistically characterized
	the frequency of spontaneous appearance of the different types of

	an extension of the "boxing arena" model which was previously proposed
	to describe the ratio between the two activity modes in two coupled
	sub-networks. The additional new element in the "wrestling" model
	presented here is that the firing within each network is modeled
	by a time interval generator with similar intra-network Lévy distribution.
	We modeled the different burst-initiation zones' interaction by competition

	Estimation of the model parameters revealed similarity across different

  abstract = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and
	its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent
	interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological
	networks are 'scale free.' That is, their connections follow power-law
	distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many
	connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional
	regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow
	such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network
	of protein-protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts
	to draw biological inferences from general properties associated
	with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property
	is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have
	a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes.
	For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be
	lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality
	and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins
	can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network
	topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to
	environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory
	networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent
	correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy
	of experimental data. We argue that 'top-down' inferences of biological
	properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited
	utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more
	detailed information about a gene's location in a regulatory network,
	as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more
	meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically,
	we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene's
	connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its
	equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity
	and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent
	evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit
	consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show
	low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary
	runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive
	selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution
	of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

  title = {Comparative genomics of ParaHox clusters of teleost fishes: gene
	cluster breakup and the retention of gene sets following whole genome
	duplications.},
  journal = {BMC Genomics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {312},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary lineage leading to the teleost fish underwent
	a whole genome duplication termed FSGD or 3R in addition to two prior
	genome duplications that took place earlier during vertebrate evolution
	(termed 1R and 2R). Resulting from the FSGD, additional copies of
	genes are present in fish, compared to tetrapods whose lineage did
	not experience the 3R genome duplication. Interestingly, we find
	that ParaHox genes do not differ in number in extant teleost fishes
	despite their additional genome duplication from the genomic situation
	in mammals, but they are distributed over twice as many paralogous
	regions in fish genomes. RESULTS: We determined the DNA sequence
	of the entire ParaHox C1 paralogon in the East African cichlid fish
	Astatotilapia burtoni, and compared it to orthologous regions in
	other vertebrate genomes as well as to the paralogous vertebrate
	ParaHox D paralogons. Evolutionary relationships among genes from
	these four chromosomal regions were studied with several phylogenetic
	algorithms. We provide evidence that the genes of the ParaHox C paralogous
	cluster are duplicated in teleosts, just as it had been shown previously
	for the D paralogon genes. Overall, however, synteny and cluster
	integrity seems to be less conserved in ParaHox gene clusters than
	in Hox gene clusters. Comparative analyses of non-coding sequences
	uncovered conserved, possibly co-regulatory elements, which are likely
	to contain promoter motives of the genes belonging to the ParaHox
	paralogons. CONCLUSION: There seems to be strong stabilizing selection
	for gene order as well as gene orientation in the ParaHox C paralogon,
	since with a few exceptions, only the lengths of the introns and
	intergenic regions differ between the distantly related species examined.
	The high degree of evolutionary conservation of this gene cluster's
	architecture in particular - but possibly clusters of genes more
	generally - might be linked to the presence of promoter, enhancer
	or inhibitor motifs that serve to regulate more than just one gene.
	Therefore, deletions, inversions or relocations of individual genes
	could destroy the regulation of the clustered genes in this region.
	The existence of such a regulation network might explain the evolutionary
	conservation of gene order and orientation over the course of hundreds
	of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Another possible explanation
	for the highly conserved gene order might be the existence of a regulator
	not located immediately next to its corresponding gene but further
	away since a relocation or inversion would possibly interrupt this
	interaction. Different ParaHox clusters were found to have experienced
	differential gene loss in teleosts. Yet the complete set of these
	homeobox genes was maintained, albeit distributed over almost twice
	the number of chromosomes. Selection due to dosage effects and/or
	stoichiometric disturbance might act more strongly to maintain a
	modal number of homeobox genes (and possibly transcription factors
	more generally) per genome, yet permit the accumulation of other
	(non regulatory) genes associated with these homeobox gene clusters.},

  abstract = {Rates of phenotypic evolution derive from numerous interrelated processes
	acting at varying spatial and temporal scales and frequently differ
	substantially among lineages. Although current models employed in
	reconstructing ancestral character states permit independent rates
	for distinct types of transition (forward and reverse transitions
	and transitions between different states), these rates are typically
	assumed to be identical for all branches in a phylogeny. In this
	paper, I present a general model of character evolution enabling
	rate heterogeneity among branches. This model is employed in assessing
	the extent to which the assumption of uniform transition rates affects
	reconstructions of ancestral limb morphology in the scincid lizard
	clade Lerista and, accordingly, the potential for rate variability
	to mislead inferences of evolutionary patterns. Permitting rate variation
	among branches significantly improves model fit for both the manus
	and the pes. A constrained model in which the rate of digit acquisition
	is assumed to be effectively zero is strongly supported in each case;
	when compared with a model assuming unconstrained transition rates,
	this model provides a substantially better fit for the manus and
	a nearly identical fit for the pes. Ancestral states reconstructed
	assuming the constrained model imply patterns of limb evolution differing
	significantly from those implied by reconstructions for uniform-rate
	models, particularly for the pes; whereas ancestral states for the
	uniform-rate models consistently entail the reacquisition of pedal
	digits, those for the model incorporating among-lineage rate heterogeneity
	imply repeated, unreversed digit loss. These results indicate that
	the assumption of identical transition rates for all branches in
	a phylogeny may be inappropriate in modeling the evolution of phenotypic
	traits and emphasize the need for careful evaluation of phylogenetic
	tests of Dollo's law.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {5},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the purposes of phylogenetic inference from molecular
	data sets many different methods are currently offered as alternatives
	for researchers in phylogenetic systematics. The vast majority of
	these methods are based on specific topological assumptions relating
	to the resultant genealogical tree. Each of these has been shown
	to perform effectively in special conditions and for specific data
	sets while yielding less reliable results in other instances. Moreover,
	the majority of the methods include information from homoplastic
	characters in spite of a universally accepted agreement in their
	ineffectiveness for phylogenetic inference, which may often lead
	to inaccuracy and inconsistency. As an alternative to such methods,
	a strict mutational compatibility consensus tree building method
	as a universally applicable and reliable method is reported. RESULTS:
	The analysis of a data set from a previously published experimental
	phylogeny demonstrates the accuracy of the strict mutational compatibility
	consensus tree building method and illustrates its potential for
	obtaining unambiguous and precise results with full resolution. CONCLUSION:
	The universal applicability of a simplified compatibility method
	in its algorithmic form for phylogenetic inference is described.
	Firstly, dismissal of topological assumptions creates a general potential
	for agreement of inferred with true phylogeny. Second, exclusion
	of irregular characters from analysis repeatably enables construction
	of consistent phylogeny. Third, a direct calculation of bootstrap
	proportion values for individual nodes of the resulting tree is possible
	rather than their empirical estimation. Finally, guidance is given
	for empirical assessment of the sample size necessary for full genealogical
	resolution and significant bootstrap proportions. REVIEWERS: This

  abstract = {The soil nematodes Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans
	diverged from a common ancestor roughly 100 million years ago and
	yet are almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the same chromosome
	number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche.
	To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure
	and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality
	draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence.
	We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae
	genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have
	clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly
	detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae
	genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the
	noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species.
	The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence
	appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers.
	Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved
	in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in
	96\% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated
	at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost
	entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4\% of
	the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5\% of the C. elegans genome.
	Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were
	acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution.
	Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169
	protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared
	between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting,
	and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae
	gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve
	the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C.
	briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes.
	In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand
	the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes.},

  abstract = {Transcription networks have an unusual structure. In both prokaryotes
	and eukaryotes, the number of target genes regulated by each transcription
	factor, its out-degree, follows a broad tailed distribution. By contrast,
	the number of transcription factors regulating a target gene, its
	in-degree, follows a much narrower distribution, which has no broad
	tail. We constructed a model of transcription network evolution through
	trans- and cis-mutations, gene duplication and deletion. The effects
	of these different evolutionary processes on the network structure
	are enough to produce an asymmetrical in- and out-degree distribution.
	However, the parameter values required to replicate known in- and
	out-degree distributions are unrealistic. We then considered variation
	in the rate of evolution of a gene dependent upon its position in
	the network. When transcription factors with many regulatory interactions
	are constrained to evolve more slowly than those with few interactions,
	the details of the in- and out-degree distributions of transcription
	networks can be fully reproduced over a range of plausible parameter
	values. The networks produced by our model depend on the relative
	rates of the different evolutionary processes. By determining the
	circumstances under which the networks with the correct degree distributions
	are produced, we are able to assess the relative importance of the
	different evolutionary processes in our model during evolution.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolution of new complex biological behaviour tends to
	arise by novel combinations of existing building blocks. The functional
	and evolutionary building blocks of the proteome are protein domains,
	the function of a protein being dependent on its constituent domains.
	We clustered completely-sequenced proteomes of prokaryotes on the
	basis of their protein domain content, as defined by Pfam (release
	16.0). This revealed that, although there was a correlation between
	phylogeny and domain content, other factors also have an influence.
	This observation motivated an investigation of the relationship between
	an organism's lifestyle and the complement of domains and domain
	architectures found within its proteome. RESULTS: We took a census
	of all protein domains and domain combinations (architectures) encoded
	in the completely-sequenced proteobacterial genomes. Nine protein
	domain families were identified that are found in phylogenetically
	disparate plant-associated bacteria but are absent from non-plant-associated
	bacteria. Most of these are known to play a role in the plant-associated
	lifestyle, but they also included domain of unknown function DUF1427,
	which is found in plant symbionts and pathogens of the alpha-, beta-
	and gamma-Proteobacteria, but not known in any other organism. Further,
	several domains were identified as being restricted to phytobacteria
	and Eukaryotes. One example is the RolB/RolC glucosidase family,
	which is found only in Agrobacterium species and in plants. We identified
	the 0.5\% of Pfam protein domain families that were most significantly
	over-represented in the plant-associated Proteobacteria with respect
	to the background frequencies in the whole set of available proteobacterial
	proteomes. These included guanylate cyclase, domains implicated in
	aromatic catabolism, cellulase and several domains of unknown function.
	We identified 459 unique domain architectures found in phylogenetically
	diverse plant pathogens and symbionts that were absent from non-pathogenic
	and non-symbiotic relatives. The vast majority of these were restricted
	to a single species or several closely related species and so their
	distributions could be better explained by phylogeny than by lifestyle.
	However, several architectures were found in two or more very distantly
	related phytobacteria but absent from non-plant-associated bacteria.
	Many of the proteins with these unique architectures are predicted
	to be secreted. In Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato, those genes
	encoding genes with novel domain architectures tended to have atypical
	GC contents and were adjacent to insertion sequence elements and
	phage-like sequences, suggesting acquisition by horizontal transfer.
	CONCLUSIONS: By identifying domains and architectures unique to plant
	pathogens and symbionts, we highlighted candidate proteins for involvement
	in plant-associated bacterial lifestyles. Given that characterisation
	of novel gene products in vivo and in vitro is time-consuming and
	expensive, this computational approach may be useful for reducing
	experimental search space. Furthermore we discuss the biological
	significance of novel proteins highlighted by this study in the context
	of plant-associated lifestyles.},

	composed of tandemly arranged genes including four polymorphic rap-1a

	rap-1 polymorphism reflects recombination and gene conversion and
	results in multiple RAP-1 proteins with unique B- and T-cell epitopes.
	Is this complex locus structure and recombination a required feature
	of the rap-1 gene family among Babesia species? We addressed this
	question by analysis of the rap-1 locus in B. bovis. Sequence analysis
	of an 11 kb genomic clone representing the B. burn rap-1 locus revealed
	only two identical and continuous rap-1a gene copies, rap 1a-1 and
	rap-1a-2, located in a similar head to tail orientation. Using the
	conserved ig gene as a marker for the 3' boundary of the rap-1 locus,
	we conclude that divergent rap-1b and rap-1c genes, present in B.
	bigemina, are not similarly cis-linked to the B. bovis rap-1 locus.
	Analysis of the rap-1a genes 1 and 2 from each of multiple B. bovis
	strains from North and South America demonstrated RAP-1 size conservation
	with very limited amino acid sequence variation. The results suggest
	that the simple two gene arrangement in the B. bovis rap-1 gene family
	was generated by gene duplication and, in contrast to the B. bigemina
	rap-1 locus, both genes evolved together using homogenization mechanisms
	with point mutation as the single mechanism for gene variation. Three
	discontinuous non-rap-1 genes are closely cis-linked to the B. bovis
	rap-1 locus and the presence of multiple introns in these genes may
	limit rap-1 gene variation due to unequal crossing over. The different
	mechanisms likely involved in the evolution of the rap-1 family in

	and antigenic polymorphism in the B. bigemina RAP-1 molecules as

	Previous studies have shown that some individuals are more likely

	they possess. One challenge for all group members, however, is to
	satisfy their needs. In many situations, we do not yet know how individuals
	within groups distribute leadership decisions between themselves
	in order to satisfy time-varying individual requirements. To gain
	insight into this problem, we build a dynamic model where group members
	have to satisfy different needs but are not aware of each other's
	needs. Data about needs of animals come from real data observed in
	macaques. Several studies showed that a collective movement may be
	initiated by a single individual. This individual may be the dominant
	one, the oldest one, but also the one having the highest physiological
	needs. In our model, the individual with the lowest reserve initiates
	movements and decides for all its conspecifics. This simple rule
	leads to a viable decision-making system where all individuals may
	lead the group at one moment and thus suit their requirements. However,
	a single individual becomes the leader in 38\% to 95\% of cases and
	the leadership is unequally (according to an exponential law) distributed
	according to the heterogeneity of needs in the group. The results
	showed that this non-linearity emerges when one group member reaches
	physiological requirements, mainly the nutrient ones - protein, energy
	and water depending on weight - superior to those of its conspecifics.
	This amplification may explain why some leaders could appear in animal

	The OS-E and OS-F genes are the two phylogenetically closest members
	of this family in the D. melanogaster genome. In this species, these
	genes are arranged in the same genomic cluster and likely arose by
	tandem gene duplication, the major mechanism proposed for the origin
	of new members in this olfactory-system family. RESULTS: We have
	analyzed the genomic cluster encompassing OS-E and OS-F genes (Obp83
	genomic region) to determine the role of the functional divergence
	and molecular adaptation on the Obp family size evolution. We compared
	nucleotide and amino acid variation across 18 Drosophila and 4 mosquito
	species applying a phylogenetic-based maximum likelihood approach
	complemented with information of the OBP three-dimensional structure
	and function. We show that, in spite the OS-E and OS-F genes are
	currently subject to similar and strong selective constraints, they
	likely underwent divergent evolution. Positive selection was likely
	involved in the functional diversification of new copies in the early
	stages after the gene duplication event; moreover, it might have
	shaped nucleotide variation of the OS-E gene concomitantly with the
	loss of functionally related members. Besides, molecular adaptation
	likely affecting the functional OBP conformational changes was supported
	by the analysis of the evolution of physicochemical properties of
	the OS-E protein and the location of the putative positive selected
	amino acids on the OBP three-dimensional structure. CONCLUSION: Our
	results support that positive selection was likely involved in the
	functional differentiation of new copies of the OBP multigene family

	it might shape variation of some members of the family concomitantly

	the function of gene families of which the size is considerably larger
	in extant pathogens than in non-pathogens could be related to pathogenicity
	traits. However, by only comparing gene inventories in extant species,
	no insights can be gained into the evolutionary process that gave
	rise to these larger family sizes in pathogens. Moreover, most studies
	which consider gene families in extant species only tend to explain
	observed differences in gene family sizes by gains rather than by
	losses, hereby largely underestimating the impact of gene loss during
	genome evolution. RESULTS: In our study we used a selection of recently
	published genomes of Ascomycetes to analyze how gene family gains,
	duplications and losses have affected the origin of pathogenic traits.
	By analyzing the evolutionary history of gene families we found that
	most gene families with an enlarged size in pathogens were present
	in an ancestor common to both pathogens and non-pathogens. The majority
	of these families were selectively maintained in pathogenic lineages,
	but disappeared in non-pathogens. Non-pathogen-specific losses largely
	outnumbered pathogen-specific losses. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
	most of the proteins for pathogenicity were already present in the
	ancestor of the Ascomycete lineages we used in our study. Species
	that did not develop pathogenicity seemed to have reduced their genetic
	complexity compared to their ancestors. We further show that expansion
	of gained or already existing families in a species-specific way
	is important to fine-tune the specificities of the pathogenic host-fungus

	In addition, negative selection on the total number of genes (copy

	approximation is used to obtain formulas for the average numbers
	of different alleles, genes without pseudogene mutations, and pseudogenes
	assuming that mutation rates and duplication/deletion rates are all
	very small. Computer simulation shows that the approximation works

	rates are all small compared to 1. However, as they become large,
	the approximation underestimates gene numbers, especially the number
	of pseudogenes. Based on the approximation, the following was found:
	(1) Gene redundancy measured by the average number of redundant genes
	decreases as advantageous selection becomes stronger. (2) The number
	of different genes can be approximately described by a linear pure-birth
	process and thus has a coefficient of variation around 1. (3) The
	birth rate is an increasing function of population size without copy
	number selection, but not necessarily so otherwise. (4) Copy number
	selection drastically decreases the number of pseudogenes. Available
	data of mutation rates and duplication/deletion rates suggest much
	faster increases of gene numbers than those observed in the evolution
	of currently existing multigene families. Various explanations for
	this discrepancy are discussed based on our approximate analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: C2H2 zinc finger genes (C2H2-ZNF) constitute the largest
	class of transcription factors in humans and one of the largest gene
	families in mammals. Often arranged in clusters in the genome, these
	genes are thought to have undergone a massive expansion in vertebrates,
	primarily by tandem duplication. However, this view is based on limited
	datasets restricted to a single chromosome or a specific subset of
	genes belonging to the large KRAB domain-containing C2H2-ZNF subfamily.
	RESULTS: Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the evolution
	of the C2H2-ZNF family in mammals. We assembled the complete repertoire
	of human C2H2-ZNF genes (718 in total), about 70\% of which are organized
	into 81 clusters across all chromosomes. Based on an analysis of
	their N-terminal effector domains, we identified two new C2H2-ZNF
	subfamilies encoding genes with a SET or a HOMEO domain. We searched
	for the syntenic counterparts of the human clusters in other mammals
	for which complete gene data are available: chimpanzee, mouse, rat
	and dog. Cross-species comparisons show a large variation in the
	numbers of C2H2-ZNF genes within homologous mammalian clusters, suggesting
	differential patterns of evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of selected
	clusters reveals that the disparity in C2H2-ZNF gene repertoires
	across mammals not only originates from differential gene duplication
	but also from gene loss. Further, we discovered variations among
	orthologs in the number of zinc finger motifs and association of
	the effector domains, the latter often undergoing sequence degeneration.
	Combined with phylogenetic studies, physical maps and an analysis
	of the exon-intron organization of genes from the SCAN and KRAB domains-containing
	subfamilies, this result suggests that the SCAN subfamily emerged
	first, followed by the SCAN-KRAB and finally by the KRAB subfamily.
	CONCLUSION: Our results are in agreement with the "birth and death
	hypothesis" for the evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes, but also show that
	this hypothesis alone cannot explain the considerable evolutionary
	variation within the subfamilies of these genes in mammals. We, therefore,
	propose a new model involving the interdependent evolution of C2H2-ZNF
	gene subfamilies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome
	sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and
	the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification
	of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on
	orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework
	for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation
	of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. RESULTS: We describe
	here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation
	of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced
	genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction
	of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which
	we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The COG collection
	currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and
	comprise 75\% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes
	of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs)
	include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode
	Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
	Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular
	microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG
	set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838
	proteins, or approximately 54\% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655
	gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes
	with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could
	be included into the KOGs; addition of new eukaryotic genomes is
	expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic
	genomes with KOGs. Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals
	a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting
	of approximately 20\% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the
	KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set
	(approximately 1\% of the COGs). In part, this difference is probably
	due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could
	also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and
	the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. CONCLUSION:
	The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes
	and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional
	annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex
	eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

	quartet GRIN2 genes and the third-round fish-specific genome duplication
	generated extra copies of fish GRIN2 genes. In addition, in-depth

  abstract = {The MADS-box encodes a novel type of DNA-binding domain found so far
	in a diverse group of transcription factors from yeast, animals,
	and seed plants. Here, our first aim was to evaluate the primary
	structure of the MADS-box. Compilation of the 107 currently available
	MADS-domain sequences resulted in a signature which can strictly
	discriminate between genes possessing or lacking a MADS-domain and
	allowed a classification of MADS-domain proteins into several distinct
	subfamilies. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of known eukaryotic
	MADS-box genes, which is the first comprising animal as well as fungal
	and plant homologs, showed that the vast majority of subfamily members
	appear on distinct subtrees of phylogenetic trees, suggesting that
	subfamilies represent monophyletic gene clades and providing the
	proposed classification scheme with a sound evolutionary basis. A
	reconstruction of the history of the MADS-box gene subfamilies based
	on the taxonomic distribution of contemporary subfamily members revealed
	that each subfamily comprises highly conserved putative orthologs
	and recent paralogs. Some subfamilies must be very old (1,000 MY
	or more), while others are more recent. In general, subfamily members
	tend to share highly similar sequences, expression patterns, and
	related functions. The defined species distribution, specific function,
	and strong evolutionary conservation of the members of most subfamilies
	suggest that the establishment of different subfamilies was followed
	by rapid fixation and was thus highly advantageous during eukaryotic
	evolution. These gene subfamilies may have been essential prerequisites
	for the establishment of several complex eukaryotic body structures,
	such as muscles in animals and certain reproductive structures in
	higher plants, and of some signal transduction pathways. Phylogenetic
	trees indicate that after establishment of different subfamilies,
	additional gene duplications led to a further increase in the number
	of MADS-box genes. However, several molecular mechanisms of MADS-box
	gene diversification were used to a quite different extent during
	animal and plant evolution. Known plant MADS-domain sequences diverged
	much faster than those of animals, and gene duplication and sequence
	diversification were extensively used for the creation of new genes
	during plant evolution, resulting in a relatively large number of
	interacting genes. In contrast, the available data on animal genes
	suggest that increase in gene number was only moderate in the lineage
	leading to mammals, but in the case of MEF2-like gene products, heterodimerization
	between different splice variants may have increased the combinatorial
	possibilities of interactions considerably. These observations demonstrate
	that in metazoan and plant evolution, increased combinatorial possibilities
	of MADS-box gene product interactions correlated with the evolution
	of increasingly complex body plans.},

  volume = {8},
  pages = {467},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the analysis of networks we frequently require the
	statistical significance of some network statistic, such as measures
	of similarity for the properties of interacting nodes. The structure
	of the network may introduce dependencies among the nodes and it
	will in general be necessary to account for these dependencies in
	the statistical analysis. To this end we require some form of Null
	model of the network: generally rewired replicates of the network
	are generated which preserve only the degree (number of interactions)
	of each node. We show that this can fail to capture important features
	of network structure, and may result in unrealistic significance
	levels, when potentially confounding additional information is available.
	METHODS: We present a new network resampling Null model which takes
	into account the degree sequence as well as available biological
	annotations. Using gene ontology information as an illustration we
	show how this information can be accounted for in the resampling
	approach, and the impact such information has on the assessment of
	statistical significance of correlations and motif-abundances in
	the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction network. An algorithm,
	GOcardShuffle, is introduced to allow for the efficient construction
	of an improved Null model for network data. RESULTS: We use the protein
	interaction network of S. cerevisiae; correlations between the evolutionary
	rates and expression levels of interacting proteins and their statistical
	significance were assessed for Null models which condition on different
	aspects of the available data. The novel GOcardShuffle approach results
	in a Null model for annotated network data which appears better to
	describe the properties of real biological networks. CONCLUSION:
	An improved statistical approach for the statistical analysis of
	biological network data, which conditions on the available biological
	information, leads to qualitatively different results compared to
	approaches which ignore such annotations. In particular we demonstrate
	the effects of the biological organization of the network can be
	sufficient to explain the observed similarity of interacting proteins.},

  abstract = {The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model
	organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic
	strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly
	(re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli
	strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related
	species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within
	the approximately 18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found
	approximately 2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination
	rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically
	and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the
	phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one
	group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we
	inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying
	functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an
	important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group
	B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal
	virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development
	of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E.
	coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the
	chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or
	tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher
	rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by
	a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination
	at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure

  abstract = {Inferring the gene content of ancestral genomes is a fundamental challenge
	in molecular evolution. Due to the statistical nature of this problem,
	ancestral genomes inferred by the maximum likelihood (ML) or the
	maximum-parsimony (MP) methods are prone to considerable error rates.
	In general, these errors are difficult to abolish by using longer
	genomic sequences or by analyzing more taxa. This study describes
	a new approach for improving ancestral genome reconstruction, the
	ancestral coevolver (ACE), which utilizes coevolutionary information
	to improve the accuracy of such reconstructions over previous approaches.
	The principal idea is to reduce the potentially large solution space
	by choosing a single optimal (or near optimal) solution that is in
	accord with the coevolutionary relationships between protein families.
	Simulation experiments, both on artificial and real biological data,
	show that ACE yields a marked decrease in error rate compared with
	ML or MP. Applied to a large data set (95 organisms, 4873 protein
	families, and 10,000 coevolutionary relationships), some of the ancestral
	genomes reconstructed by ACE were remarkably different in their gene
	content from those reconstructed by ML or MP alone (more than 10\%
	in some nodes). These reconstructions, while having almost similar
	likelihood/parsimony scores as those obtained with ML/MP, had markedly
	higher concordance with the coevolutionary information. Specifically,
	when ACE was implemented to improve the results of ML, it added a
	large number of proteins to those encoded by LUCA (last universal
	common ancestor), most of them ribosomal proteins and components
	of the F(0)F(1)-type ATP synthase/ATPases, complexes that are vital
	in most living organisms. Our analysis suggests that LUCA appears
	to have been bacterial-like and had a genome size similar to the
	genome sizes of many extant organisms.},

	and whole-genome duplications (WGDs), and thus, their study helps
	to understand whether WGDs have also had a significant influence
	on protein network evolution. Here we investigate the evolution of
	the interaction network in the well-studied MADS domain MIKC-type
	proteins, a TF family which plays an important role in both the vegetative
	and the reproductive phases of plant life. We combine phylogenetic
	reconstruction, protein domain analysis, and interaction data from
	different species. We show that, unlike previously analyzed interaction
	networks, the MIKC-type protein network displays a characteristic
	topology, with overall high inter-subfamily connectivity, shared
	interactors between paralogs, and conservation of interaction patterns
	across species. The evaluation of the number of MIKC-type proteins
	at key time points throughout the evolution of land plants in the
	lineage leading to Arabidopsis suggested that most duplicates were
	retained after each round of WGD. We provide evidence that an initial
	network, formed by 9-11 homodimerizing proteins interacting with
	each other, existed in the common ancestor of all seed plants. This
	basic structure has been conserved after each round of WGD, adding
	layers of paralogs with similar interaction patterns. We thus present
	the first model where we can show that a network of eukaryotic TFs
	has evolved via rounds of WGD. Furthermore, we found that in subfamilies
	in which the K domain is most diverged, the interactions with other
	subfamilies have been largely lost. We discuss the possibility that
	such a high proportion of genes were retained after each WGD because
	of their capacity to form higher order complexes involving proteins
	from different subfamilies. The simultaneous duplications allowed
	for the conservation of the quantitative balance between the constituents

  abstract = {Protein domains represent the basic evolutionary units that form proteins.
	Domain duplication and shuffling by recombination are probably the
	most important forces driving protein evolution and hence the complexity
	of the proteome. While the duplication of whole genes as well as
	domain-encoding exons increases the abundance of domains in the proteome,
	domain shuffling increases versatility, i.e. the number of distinct
	contexts in which a domain can occur. Here, we describe a comprehensive,
	genome-wide analysis of the relationship between these two processes.
	We observe a strong and robust correlation between domain versatility
	and abundance: domains that occur more often also have many different
	combination partners. This supports the view that domain recombination
	occurs in a random way. However, we do not observe all the different
	combinations that are expected from a simple random recombination
	scenario, and this is due to frequent duplication of specific domain
	combinations. When we simulate the evolution of the protein repertoire
	considering stochastic recombination of domains followed by extensive
	duplication of the combinations, we approximate the observed data
	well. Our analyses are consistent with a stochastic process that
	governs domain recombination and thus protein divergence with respect
	to domains within a polypeptide chain. At the same time, they support
	a scenario in which domain combinations are formed only once during
	the evolution of the protein repertoire, and are then duplicated
	to various extents. The extent of duplication of different combinations
	varies widely and, in nature, will depend on selection for the domain
	combination based on its function. Some of the pair-wise domain combinations
	that are highly duplicated also recur frequently with other partner
	domains, and thus represent evolutionary units larger than single
	protein domains, which we term "supra-domains".},

  abstract = {Sheltered from deleterious mutations, genes with overlapping or partially
	redundant functions may be important sources of novel gene functions.
	While most partially redundant genes originated in gene duplications,
	it is much less clear why genes with overlapping functions have been
	retained, in some cases for hundreds of millions of years. A case
	in point is the many partially redundant genes in vertebrates, the
	result of ancient gene duplications in primitive chordates. Their
	persistence and ubiquity become surprising when it is considered
	that duplicate and original genes often diversify very rapidly, especially
	if the action of natural selection is involved. Are overlapping gene
	functions perhaps maintained because of their protective role against
	otherwise deleterious mutations? There are two principal objections
	against this hypothesis, which are the main subject of this article.
	First, because overlapping gene functions are maintained in populations
	by a slow process of "second order" selection, population sizes need
	to be very high for this process to be effective. It is shown that
	even in small populations, pleiotropic mutations that affect more
	than one of a gene's functions simultaneously can slow the mutational
	decay of functional overlap after a gene duplication by orders of
	magnitude. Furthermore, brief and transient increases in population
	size may be sufficient to maintain functional overlap. The second
	objection regards the fact that most naturally occurring mutations
	may have much weaker fitness effects than the rather drastic "knock-out"
	mutations that lead to detection of partially redundant functions.
	Given weak fitness effects of most mutations, is selection for the
	buffering effect of functional overlap strong enough to compensate
	for the diversifying force exerted by mutations? It is shown that
	the extent of functional overlap maintained in a population is not
	only independent of the mutation rate, but also independent of the
	average fitness effects of mutation. These results are discussed
	with respect to experimental evidence on redundant genes in organismal
	development.},

	Models in which conversion frequencies decrease as genes diverge
	are examined to determine conditions under which genes can "escape"
	further conversion and hence escape from a gene family. A review
	of results from various recombination systems suggests two classes
	of sequence-dependence models: (1) the "k-hit" model in which conversion
	is completely inactivated by a few (k) mutational events, such as
	the insertion of a mobile element, and (2) more general models where
	conversion frequency gradually declines as genes diverge through
	the accumulation of point mutants. Exact analysis of the k-hit model
	is given and an approximate analysis of a more general sequence-dependent
	model is developed and verified by computer simulation. If mu is
	the per nucleotide mutation rate, then neutral duplicated genes diverging
	through point mutants are likely to escape conversion provided 2
	mu/lambda much greater than 0.1, where lambda is the conversion rate
	between identical genes. If 2 mu/lambda much less than 0.1, the expected
	number of conversions before escape increases exponentially so that,
	for biological purposes, the genes never escape conversion. For single
	mutational events sufficient to block further conversions, occurring
	at rate nu per copy per generation, many conversions are expected
	if 2 nu/lambda much less than 1, while the genes essentially evolve
	independently if 2 nu/lambda much greater than 1. Implications of
	these results for both models of concerted evolution and the evolution
	of new gene functions via gene duplication are discussed.},

	on a much faster time scale than the introduction of new alleles

	the fixation of a new allele throughout a multigene family for a
	wide class of selection functions with biased gene conversion is

  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {40},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proteins show a broad range of evolutionary rates. Understanding
	the factors that are responsible for the characteristic rate of evolution
	of a given protein arguably is one of the major goals of evolutionary
	biology. A long-standing general assumption used to be that the evolution
	rate is, primarily, determined by the specific functional constraints
	that affect the given protein. These constrains were traditionally
	thought to depend both on the specific features of the protein's
	structure and its biological role. The advent of systems biology
	brought about new types of data, such as expression level and protein-protein
	interactions, and unexpectedly, a variety of correlations between
	protein evolution rate and these variables have been observed. The
	strongest connections by far were repeatedly seen between protein
	sequence evolution rate and the expression level of the respective
	gene. It has been hypothesized that this link is due to the selection
	for the robustness of the protein structure to mistranslation-induced
	misfolding that is particularly important for highly expressed proteins
	and is the dominant determinant of the sequence evolution rate. RESULTS:
	This work is an attempt to assess the relative contributions of protein
	domain structure and function, on the one hand, and expression level
	on the other hand, to the rate of sequence evolution. To this end,
	we performed a genome-wide analysis of the effect of the fusion of
	a pair of domains in multidomain proteins on the difference in the
	domain-specific evolutionary rates. The mistranslation-induced misfolding
	hypothesis would predict that, within multidomain proteins, fused
	domains, on average, should evolve at substantially closer rates
	than the same domains in different proteins because, within a mutlidomain
	protein, all domains are translated at the same rate. We performed
	a comprehensive comparison of the evolutionary rates of mammalian
	and plant protein domains that are either joined in multidomain proteins
	or contained in distinct proteins. Substantial homogenization of
	evolutionary rates in multidomain proteins was, indeed, observed
	in both animals and plants, although highly significant differences
	between domain-specific rates remained. The contributions of the
	translation rate, as determined by the effect of the fusion of a
	pair of domains within a multidomain protein, and intrinsic, domain-specific
	structural-functional constraints appear to be comparable in magnitude.
	CONCLUSION: Fusion of domains in a multidomain protein results in
	substantial homogenization of the domain-specific evolutionary rates
	but significant differences between domain-specific evolution rates
	remain. Thus, the rate of translation and intrinsic structural-functional
	constraints both exert sizable and comparable effects on sequence
	evolution.},

	examination of the domain architecture of aaRSs using sequence profile
	searches delineated a network of partially conserved domains that
	is even more elaborate than previously suspected. Several unexpected
	evolutionary connections were identified, including the apparent
	origin of the beta-subunit of bacterial GlyRS from the HD superfamily
	of hydrolases, a domain shared by bacterial AspRS and the B subunit
	of archaeal glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferases, and another previously
	undetected domain that is conserved in a subset of ThrRS, guanosine
	polyphosphate hydrolases and synthetases, and a family of GTPases.
	Comparison of domain architectures and multiple alignments resulted
	in the delineation of synapomorphies-shared derived characters, such
	as extra domains or inserts-for most of the aaRSs specificities.
	These synapomorphies partition sets of aaRSs with the same specificity
	into two or more distinct and apparently monophyletic groups. In
	conjunction with cluster analysis and a modification of the midpoint-rooting
	procedure, this partitioning was used to infer the likely root position
	in phylogenetic trees. The topologies of the resulting rooted trees
	for most of the aaRSs specificities are compatible with the evolutionary
	"standard model" whereby the earliest radiation event separated bacteria
	from the common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes as opposed to
	the two other possible evolutionary scenarios for the three major
	divisions of life. For almost all aaRSs specificities, however, this
	simple scheme is confounded by displacement of some of the bacterial
	aaRSs by their eukaryotic or, less frequently, archaeal counterparts.
	Displacement of ancestral eukaryotic aaRS genes by bacterial ones,
	presumably of mitochondrial origin, was observed for three aaRSs.
	In contrast, there was no convincing evidence of displacement of
	archaeal aaRSs by bacterial ones. Displacement of aaRS genes by eukaryotic
	counterparts is most common among parasitic and symbiotic bacteria,
	particularly the spirochaetes, in which 10 of the 19 aaRSs seem to
	have been displaced by the respective eukaryotic genes and two by
	the archaeal counterpart. Unlike the primary radiation events between
	the three main divisions of life, that were readily traceable through
	the phylogenetic analysis of aaRSs, no consistent large-scale bacterial
	phylogeny could be established. In part, this may be due to additional
	gene displacement events among bacterial lineages. Argument is presented
	that, although lineage-specific gene loss might have contributed
	to the evolution of some of the aaRSs, this is not a viable alternative
	to horizontal gene transfer as the principal evolutionary phenomenon

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome comparisons have revealed major lateral gene transfer
	between the three primary kingdoms of life - Bacteria, Archaea, and
	Eukarya. Another important evolutionary phenomenon involves the evolutionary
	mobility of protein domains that form versatile multidomain architectures.
	We were interested in investigating the possibility of a combination
	of these phenomena, with an invading gene merging with a pre-existing
	gene in the recipient genome. RESULTS: Complete genomes of fifteen
	bacteria, four archaea and one eukaryote were searched for interkingdom
	gene fusions (IKFs); that is, genes coding for proteins that apparently
	consist of domains originating from different primary kingdoms. Phylogenetic
	analysis supported 37 cases of IKF, each of which includes a 'native'
	domain and a horizontally acquired 'alien' domain. IKFs could have
	evolved via lateral transfer of a gene coding for the alien domain
	(or a larger protein containing this domain) followed by recombination
	with a native gene. For several IKFs, this scenario is supported
	by the presence of a gene coding for a second, stand-alone version
	of the alien domain in the recipient genome. Among the genomes investigated,
	the greatest number of IKFs has been detected in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
	where they are almost always accompanied by a stand-alone alien domain.
	For most of the IKF cases detected in other genomes, the stand-alone
	counterpart is missing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of comparative genome
	analysis show that IKF formation is a real, but relatively rare,
	evolutionary phenomenon. We hypothesize that IKFs are formed primarily
	via the proposed two-stage mechanism, but other than in the Actinomycetes,
	in which IKF generation seems to be an active, ongoing process, most
	of the stand-alone intermediates have been eliminated, perhaps because
	of functional redundancy.},

  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {14},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The origin of the translation system is, arguably, the
	central and the hardest problem in the study of the origin of life,
	and one of the hardest in all evolutionary biology. The problem has
	a clear catch-22 aspect: high translation fidelity hardly can be
	achieved without a complex, highly evolved set of RNAs and proteins
	but an elaborate protein machinery could not evolve without an accurate
	translation system. The origin of the genetic code and whether it
	evolved on the basis of a stereochemical correspondence between amino
	acids and their cognate codons (or anticodons), through selectional
	optimization of the code vocabulary, as a "frozen accident" or via
	a combination of all these routes is another wide open problem despite
	extensive theoretical and experimental studies. Here we combine the
	results of comparative genomics of translation system components,
	data on interaction of amino acids with their cognate codons and
	anticodons, and data on catalytic activities of ribozymes to develop
	conceptual models for the origins of the translation system and the
	genetic code. RESULTS: Our main guide in constructing the models
	is the Darwinian Continuity Principle whereby a scenario for the
	evolution of a complex system must consist of plausible elementary
	steps, each conferring a distinct advantage on the evolving ensemble
	of genetic elements. Evolution of the translation system is envisaged
	to occur in a compartmentalized ensemble of replicating, co-selected
	RNA segments, i.e., in a RNA World containing ribozymes with versatile
	activities. Since evolution has no foresight, the translation system
	could not evolve in the RNA World as the result of selection for
	protein synthesis and must have been a by-product of evolution drive
	by selection for another function, i.e., the translation system evolved
	via the exaptation route. It is proposed that the evolutionary process
	that eventually led to the emergence of translation started with
	the selection for ribozymes binding abiogenic amino acids that stimulated
	ribozyme-catalyzed reactions. The proposed scenario for the evolution
	of translation consists of the following steps: binding of amino
	acids to a ribozyme resulting in an enhancement of its catalytic
	activity; evolution of the amino-acid-stimulated ribozyme into a
	peptide ligase (predecessor of the large ribosomal subunit) yielding,
	initially, a unique peptide activating the original ribozyme and,
	possibly, other ribozymes in the ensemble; evolution of self-charging
	proto-tRNAs that were selected, initially, for accumulation of amino
	acids, and subsequently, for delivery of amino acids to the peptide
	ligase; joining of the peptide ligase with a distinct RNA molecule
	(predecessor of the small ribosomal subunit) carrying a built-in
	template for more efficient, complementary binding of charged proto-tRNAs;
	evolution of the ability of the peptide ligase to assemble peptides
	using exogenous RNAs as template for complementary binding of charged
	proteo-tRNAs, yielding peptides with the potential to activate different
	ribozymes; evolution of the translocation function of the protoribosome
	leading to the production of increasingly longer peptides (the first
	proteins), i.e., the origin of translation. The specifics of the
	recognition of amino acids by proto-tRNAs and the origin of the genetic
	code depend on whether or not there is a physical affinity between
	amino acids and their cognate codons or anticodons, a problem that
	remains unresolved. CONCLUSION: We describe a stepwise model for
	the origin of the translation system in the ancient RNA world such
	that each step confers a distinct advantage onto an ensemble of co-evolving
	genetic elements. Under this scenario, the primary cause for the
	emergence of translation was the ability of amino acids and peptides
	to stimulate reactions catalyzed by ribozymes. Thus, the translation
	system might have evolved as the result of selection for ribozymes
	capable of, initially, efficient amino acid binding, and subsequently,
	synthesis of increasingly versatile peptides. Several aspects of
	this scenario are amenable to experimental testing.},

	with identical distributions of evolutionary rates among genes that

	of the distributions of the propensities for gene loss (PGL). This
	model predicts that genes of different ages, that is, genes with
	homologs detectable at different phylogenetic depths, substantially
	differ in those variables that correlate with PGL. We computationally
	partition protein-coding genes from humans, flies, and Aspergillus
	fungus into age classes, and show that genes of different ages retain
	the universal log-normal distribution of evolutionary rates, with
	a shift toward higher rates in "younger" classes but also with a
	substantial overlap. The only exception involves human primate-specific
	genes that show a heavy tail of rapidly evolving genes, probably
	owing to gene annotation artifacts. As predicted, the gene age classes
	differ in characteristics correlated with PGL. Compared with "young"
	genes (e.g., mammal-specific human ones), "old" genes (e.g., eukaryote-specific),
	on average, are longer, are expressed at a higher level, possess
	a higher intron density, evolve slower on the short time scale, and
	are subject to stronger purifying selection. Thus, genome evolution
	fits a simple model with approximately uniform rates of gene gain
	and loss, without major bursts of genomic innovation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple complete genome sequences
	from diverse taxa prompts the development of new phylogenetic approaches,
	which attempt to incorporate information derived from comparative
	analysis of complete gene sets or large subsets thereof. Such attempts
	are particularly relevant because of the major role of horizontal
	gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss, at least in the evolution
	of prokaryotes. RESULTS: Five largely independent approaches were
	employed to construct trees for completely sequenced bacterial and
	archaeal genomes: i) presence-absence of genomes in clusters of orthologous
	genes; ii) conservation of local gene order (gene pairs) among prokaryotic
	genomes; iii) parameters of identity distribution for probable orthologs;
	iv) analysis of concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins; v)
	comparison of trees constructed for multiple protein families. All
	constructed trees support the separation of the two primary prokaryotic
	domains, bacteria and archaea, as well as some terminal bifurcations
	within the bacterial and archaeal domains. Beyond these obvious groupings,
	the trees made with different methods appeared to differ substantially
	in terms of the relative contributions of phylogenetic relationships
	and similarities in gene repertoires caused by similar life styles
	and horizontal gene transfer to the tree topology. The trees based
	on presence-absence of genomes in orthologous clusters and the trees
	based on conserved gene pairs appear to be strongly affected by gene
	loss and horizontal gene transfer. The trees based on identity distributions
	for orthologs and particularly the tree made of concatenated ribosomal
	protein sequences seemed to carry a stronger phylogenetic signal.
	The latter tree supported three potential high-level bacterial clades,:
	i) Chlamydia-Spirochetes, ii) Thermotogales-Aquificales (bacterial
	hyperthermophiles), and ii) Actinomycetes-Deinococcales-Cyanobacteria.
	The latter group also appeared to join the low-GC Gram-positive bacteria
	at a deeper tree node. These new groupings of bacteria were supported
	by the analysis of alternative topologies in the concatenated ribosomal
	protein tree using the Kishino-Hasegawa test and by a census of the
	topologies of 132 individual groups of orthologous proteins. Additionally,
	the results of this analysis put into question the sister-group relationship
	between the two major archaeal groups, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota,
	and suggest instead that Euryarchaeota might be a paraphyletic group
	with respect to Crenarchaeota. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, the
	extensive horizontal gene flow and lineage-specific gene loss notwithstanding,
	extension of phylogenetic analysis to the genome scale has the potential
	of uncovering deep evolutionary relationships between prokaryotic

	in the seasonal evolution of influenza A virus.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {34},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin
	(HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of rapid evolutionary
	change under positive selection in which amino acid replacements
	are fixed by virtue of their effect on antigenicity, enabling the
	virus to evade immune surveillance. RESULTS: We performed phylogenetic
	analyses of the recently obtained large and relatively unbiased samples
	of the HA sequences from 1995-2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1
	subtypes of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the
	evolution of H3N2 HA includes long intervals of generally neutral
	sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change
	("stasis" periods) that are characterized by an excess of synonymous
	over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of association of
	amino acid replacements with epitope regions, and slow extinction
	of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods of stasis are punctuated
	by shorter intervals of rapid evolution under positive selection
	during which new dominant lineages quickly displace previously coexisting
	ones. The preponderance of positive selection during intervals of
	rapid evolution is supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid
	replacements in the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements
	in the rest of the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals
	showed a much more uniform distribution of replacements over the
	HA molecule, with a statistically significant difference in the rate
	of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions
	between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino acid
	replacements - the same amino acid substitution occurring independently
	in different lineages - were also detected in H3N2 HA. These parallel
	mutations were, largely, associated with periods of rapid fitness
	change, indicating that there are major limitations on evolutionary
	pathways during antigenic change. The finding that stasis is the
	prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution suggests that antigenic changes
	that lead to an increase in fitness typically result from epistatic
	interactions between several amino acid substitutions in the HA and,
	perhaps, other viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due
	to increased fitness emerge from low frequency strains thanks to
	the last amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements
	required to produce a significant antigenic change; no subset of
	substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic change
	and corresponding fitness increase. In contrast to H3N2, no clear
	intervals of evolution under positive selection were detected for
	the H1N1 HA during the same time span. Thus, the ascendancy of H1N1
	in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the drop in the relative
	fitness of the previously prevailing H3N2 lineages as the fraction
	of susceptible hosts decreases during the stasis intervals. CONCLUSION:
	We show that the common view of the evolution of influenza virus
	as a rapid, positive selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete.
	Rather, the interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist
	of extended intervals of stasis, which are characterized by neutral
	sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid fitness
	increase when evolutionary change is driven by positive selection.
	These observations have implications for influenza surveillance and
	vaccine formulation; in particular, the possibility exists that parallel
	amino acid replacements could serve as a predictor of new dominant
	strains. REVIEWERS: Ron Fouchier (nominated by Andrey Rzhetsky),

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene conversion causes a non-reciprocal transfer of genetic
	information between similar sequences. Gene conversion can both homogenize
	genes and recruit point mutations thereby shaping the evolution of
	multigene families. In the rice genome, the large number of duplicated
	genes increases opportunities for gene conversion. RESULTS: To characterize
	gene conversion in rice, we have defined 626 multigene families in
	which 377 gene conversions were detected using the GENECONV program.
	Over 60\% of the conversions we detected were between chromosomes.
	We found that the inter-chromosomal conversions distributed between
	chromosome 1 and 5, 2 and 6, and 3 and 5 are more frequent than genome
	average (Z-test, P < 0.05). The frequencies of gene conversion on
	the same chromosome decreased with the physical distance between
	gene conversion partners. Ka/Ks analysis indicates that gene conversion
	is not tightly linked to natural selection in the rice genome. To
	assess the contribution of segmental duplication on gene conversion
	statistics, we determined locations of conversion partners with respect
	to inter-chromosomal segment duplication. The number of conversions
	associated with segmentation is less than ten percent. Pseudogenes
	in the rice genome with low similarity to Arabidopsis genes showed
	greater likelihood for gene conversion than those with high similarity
	to Arabidopsis genes. Functional annotations suggest that at least
	14 multigene families related to disease or bacteria resistance were
	involved in conversion events. CONCLUSION: The evolution of gene
	families in the rice genome may have been accelerated by conversion
	with pseudogenes. Our analysis suggests a possible role for gene
	conversion in the evolution of pathogen-response genes.},

  pages = {research0024},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene fusions can be used as tools for functional prediction
	and also as evolutionary markers. Fused genes often show a scattered
	phyletic distribution, which suggests a role for processes other
	than vertical inheritance in their evolution. RESULTS: The evolutionary
	history of gene fusions was studied by phylogenetic analysis of the
	domains in the fused proteins and the orthologous domains that form
	stand-alone proteins. Clustering of fusion components from phylogenetically
	distant species was construed as evidence of dissemination of the
	fused genes by horizontal transfer. Of the 51 examined gene fusions
	that are represented in at least two of the three primary kingdoms
	(Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota), 31 were most probably disseminated
	by cross-kingdom horizontal gene transfer, whereas 14 appeared to
	have evolved independently in different kingdoms and two were probably
	inherited from the common ancestor of modern life forms. On many
	occasions, the evolutionary scenario also involves one or more secondary
	fissions of the fusion gene. For approximately half of the fusions,
	stand-alone forms of the fusion components are encoded by juxtaposed
	genes, which are known or predicted to belong to the same operon
	in some of the prokaryotic genomes. This indicates that evolution
	of gene fusions often, if not always, involves an intermediate stage,
	during which the future fusion components exist as juxtaposed and
	co-regulated, but still distinct, genes within operons. CONCLUSION:
	These findings suggest a major role for horizontal transfer of gene
	fusions in the evolution of protein-domain architectures, but also
	indicate that independent fusions of the same pair of domains in
	distant species is not uncommon, which suggests positive selection

	genomic complexity and diversity of primate E2 proteomic function.
	The evolutionary processes of human E2 gene structure during expansions
	were accompanied by exon duplication and exonization of intronic

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA sequences are extensively used as genetic
	markers not only for studies of population or ecological genetics,
	but also for phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. Complete mt-sequences
	can reveal information about gene order and its variation, as well
	as gene and genome evolution when sequences from multiple phyla are
	compared. Mitochondrial gene order is highly variable among mollusks,
	with bivalves exhibiting the most variability. Of the 41 complete
	mt genomes sequenced so far, 12 are from bivalves. We determined,
	in the current study, the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of
	Crassostrea hongkongensis. We present here an analysis of features
	of its gene content and genome organization in comparison with two
	other Crassostrea species to assess the variation within bivalves
	and among main groups of mollusks. RESULTS: The complete mitochondrial
	genome of C. hongkongensis was determined using long PCR and a primer
	walking sequencing strategy with genus-specific primers. The genome
	is 16,475 bp in length and contains 12 protein-coding genes (the
	atp8 gene is missing, as in most bivalves), 22 transfer tRNA genes
	(including a suppressor tRNA gene), and 2 ribosomal RNA genes, all
	of which appear to be transcribed from the same strand. A striking
	finding of this study is that a DNA segment containing four tRNA
	genes (trnk1, trnC, trnQ1 and trnN) and two duplicated or split rRNA
	gene (rrnL5' and rrnS) are absent from the genome, when compared
	with that of two other extant Crassostrea species, which is very
	likely a consequence of loss of a single genomic region present in
	ancestor of C. hongkongensis. It indicates this region seem to be
	a "hot spot" of genomic rearrangements over the Crassostrea mt-genomes.
	The arrangement of protein-coding genes in C. hongkongensis is identical
	to that of Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea virginica, but higher
	amino acid sequence identities are shared between C. hongkongensis
	and C. gigas than between other pairs. There exists significant codon
	bias, favoring codons ending in A or T and against those ending with
	C. Pair analysis of genome rearrangements showed that the rearrangement
	distance is great between C. gigas-C. hongkongensis and C. virginica,
	indicating a high degree of rearrangements within Crassostrea. The
	determination of complete mt-genome of C. hongkongensis has yielded
	useful insight into features of gene order, variation, and evolution
	of Crassostrea and bivalve mt-genomes. CONCLUSION: The mt-genome
	of C. hongkongensis shares some similarity with, and interesting
	differences to, other Crassostrea species and bivalves. The absence
	of trnC and trnN genes and duplicated or split rRNA genes from the
	C. hongkongensis genome is a completely novel feature not previously
	reported in Crassostrea species. The phenomenon is likely due to
	the loss of a segment that is present in other Crassostrea species
	and was present in ancestor of C. hongkongensis, thus a case of "tandem
	duplication-random loss (TDRL)". The mt-genome and new feature presented
	here reveal and underline the high level variation of gene order
	and gene content in Crassostrea and bivalves, inspiring more research
	to gain understanding to mechanisms underlying gene and genome evolution
	in bivalves and mollusks.},

	The precise nature of the archaeo-eukaryotic relationship remains
	uncertain, and it has been variously argued that eukaryotic informational

	through ortholog detection and phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic
	hypothesis testing using constrained trees, combined with a systematic
	search for shared derived characters in the form of homologous inserts
	in conserved proteins, indicate that, for the majority of these genes,
	the preferred tree topology is one with the eukaryotic branch placed
	outside the extant diversity of archaea although small subsets of
	genes show crenarchaeal and euryarchaeal affinities. Thus, the archaeal
	genes in eukaryotes appear to descend from a distinct, ancient, and

  title = {The origins of phagocytosis and eukaryogenesis.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phagocytosis, that is, engulfment of large particles by
	eukaryotic cells, is found in diverse organisms and is often thought
	to be central to the very origin of the eukaryotic cell, in particular,
	for the acquisition of bacterial endosymbionts including the ancestor
	of the mitochondrion. RESULTS: Comparisons of the sets of proteins
	implicated in phagocytosis in different eukaryotes reveal extreme
	diversity, with very few highly conserved components that typically
	do not possess readily identifiable prokaryotic homologs. Nevertheless,
	phylogenetic analysis of those proteins for which such homologs do
	exist yields clues to the possible origin of phagocytosis. The central
	finding is that a subset of archaea encode actins that are not only
	monophyletic with eukaryotic actins but also share unique structural
	features with actin-related proteins (Arp) 2 and 3. All phagocytic
	processes are strictly dependent on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton
	and the formation of branched filaments for which Arp2/3 are responsible.
	The presence of common structural features in Arp2/3 and the archaeal
	actins suggests that the common ancestors of the archaeal and eukaryotic
	actins were capable of forming branched filaments, like modern Arp2/3.
	The Rho family GTPases that are ubiquitous regulators of phagocytosis
	in eukaryotes appear to be of bacterial origin, so assuming that
	the host of the mitochondrial endosymbiont was an archaeon, the genes
	for these GTPases come via horizontal gene transfer from the endosymbiont
	or in an earlier event. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest
	a hypothetical scenario of eukaryogenesis under which the archaeal
	ancestor of eukaryotes had no cell wall (like modern Thermoplasma)
	but had an actin-based cytoskeleton including branched actin filaments
	that allowed this organism to produce actin-supported membrane protrusions.
	These protrusions would facilitate accidental, occasional engulfment
	of bacteria, one of which eventually became the mitochondrion. The
	acquisition of the endosymbiont triggered eukaryogenesis, in particular,
	the emergence of the endomembrane system that eventually led to the
	evolution of modern-type phagocytosis, independently in several eukaryotic
	lineages.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) comprise
	an apparently monophyletic class of viruses that infect a broad variety
	of eukaryotic hosts. Recent progress in isolation of new viruses
	and genome sequencing resulted in a substantial expansion of the
	NCLDV diversity, resulting in additional opportunities for comparative
	genomic analysis, and a demand for a comprehensive classification
	of viral genes. RESULTS: A comprehensive comparison of the protein
	sequences encoded in the genomes of 45 NCLDV belonging to 6 families
	was performed in order to delineate cluster of orthologous viral
	genes. Using previously developed computational methods for orthology
	identification, 1445 Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Groups
	(NCVOGs) were identified of which 177 are represented in more than
	one NCLDV family. The NCVOGs were manually curated and annotated
	and can be used as a computational platform for functional annotation
	and evolutionary analysis of new NCLDV genomes. A maximum-likelihood
	reconstruction of the NCLDV evolution yielded a set of 47 conserved
	genes that were probably present in the genome of the common ancestor
	of this class of eukaryotic viruses. This reconstructed ancestral
	gene set is robust to the parameters of the reconstruction procedure
	and so is likely to accurately reflect the gene core of the ancestral
	NCLDV, indicating that this virus encoded a complex machinery of
	replication, expression and morphogenesis that made it relatively
	independent from host cell functions. CONCLUSIONS: The NCVOGs are
	a flexible and expandable platform for genome analysis and functional
	annotation of newly characterized NCLDV. Evolutionary reconstructions
	employing NCVOGs point to complex ancestral viruses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Members of the C-type lectin domain (CTLD) superfamily
	are metazoan proteins functionally important in glycoprotein metabolism,
	mechanisms of multicellular integration and immunity. Three genome-level
	studies on human, C. elegans and D. melanogaster reported previously
	demonstrated almost complete divergence among invertebrate and mammalian
	families of CTLD-containing proteins (CTLDcps). RESULTS: We have
	performed an analysis of CTLD family composition in Fugu rubripes
	using the draft genome sequence. The results show that all but two
	groups of CTLDcps identified in mammals are also found in fish, and
	that most of the groups have the same members as in mammals. We failed
	to detect representatives for CTLD groups V (NK cell receptors) and
	VII (lithostathine), while the DC-SIGN subgroup of group II is overrepresented
	in Fugu. Several new CTLD-containing genes, highly conserved between
	Fugu and human, were discovered using the Fugu genome sequence as
	a reference, including a CSPG family member and an SCP-domain-containing
	soluble protein. A distinct group of soluble dual-CTLD proteins has
	been identified, which may be the first reported CTLDcp group shared
	by invertebrates and vertebrates. We show that CTLDcp-encoding genes
	are selectively duplicated in Fugu, in a manner that suggests an
	ancient large-scale duplication event. We have verified 32 gene structures
	and predicted 63 new ones, and make our annotations available through
	a distributed annotation system (DAS) server http://anz.anu.edu.au:8080/Fugu_rubripes/
	and their sequences as additional files with this paper. CONCLUSIONS:
	The vertebrate CTLDcp family was essentially formed early in vertebrate
	evolution and is completely different from the invertebrate families.
	Comparison of fish and mammalian genomes revealed three groups of
	CTLDcps and several new members of the known groups, which are highly
	conserved between fish and mammals, but were not identified in the
	study using only mammalian genomes. Despite limitations of the draft
	sequence, the Fugu rubripes genome is a powerful instrument for gene
	discovery and vertebrate evolutionary analysis. The composition of

  abstract = {Plants have evolved diverse adaptive mechanisms that enable them to

	may have strongly influenced evolutionary changes at levels ranging
	from molecular to morphological. Previous studies on these phenomena
	have focused on the adaptive evolution of stress-related orthologous
	genes in specific lineages. However, heterogenetic evolution of the
	paralogous genes following duplication has only been examined in
	a very limited number of stress-response gene families. The COR15
	gene encodes a low molecular weight protein that plays an important
	role in protecting plants from cold stresses. Although two different
	copies of this gene have been found in the model species, Arabidopsis
	thaliana, evolutionary patterns of this small gene family in plants
	have not been previously explored. In this study, we cloned COR15-like
	sequences and performed evolutionary analyses of these sequences
	(including those previously reported) in the highly cold-tolerant
	Draba lineage and related lineages of Brassicaceae. Our phylogenetic
	analyses indicate that all COR15-like sequences clustered into four
	clades that corresponded well to the morphological lineages. Gene
	conversions were found to have probably occurred before/during the
	divergence of Brassica and Draba lineage. However, repeated, independent
	duplications of this gene have occurred in different lineages of
	Brassicaceae. Further comparisons of all sequences suggest that there
	have been significant inter-lineage differences in evolutionary rates
	between the duplicated and original genes. We assessed the likelihood
	that the differences between two well-supported gene subfamilies
	that appear to have originated from a single duplication, COR15a
	and COR15b, within the Draba lineage have been driven by adaptive
	evolution. Comparisons of their non-synonymous/synonymous substitution
	ratios and rates of predicted amino acid changes indicate that these
	two gene groups are evolving under different selective pressures
	and may be functionally divergent. This functional divergence was
	confirmed by comparing site-specific shifts in evolution indexes
	of the two groups of predicted proteins. The evidence of differential

  number = {16},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cellular networks usually consist of numerous chemical
	species, such as DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules, etc. Different
	biological tasks are generally performed by complex interactions
	of these species. As these interactions can rarely be directly measured,
	it is widely recognized that causal relationship identification is
	essential in understanding biological behaviors of a cellular network.
	Challenging issues here include not only the large number of interactions
	to be estimated, but also many restrictions on probing signals. The
	purposes of this study are to incorporate power law in cellular network
	identification, in order to increase accuracy of causal regulation
	estimations, especially to reduce false positive errors. RESULTS:
	Two identification algorithms are developed that can be efficiently
	applied to causal regulation identification of a large-scale network
	from noisy steady-state experiment data. A distinguished feature
	of these algorithms is that power law has been explicitly incorporated
	into estimations, which is one important structural property that
	most large-scale cellular networks approximately have. Under the
	condition that parameters of the power law are known and measurement
	errors are Gaussian, a likelihood maximization approach is adopted.
	The developed estimation algorithms consist of three major steps.
	At first, angle minimization between subspaces is utilized to identify
	chemical elements that have direct influences on a prescribed chemical
	element, under the condition that the number of direct regulations
	is known. Second, interference coefficients from prescribed chemical
	elements are estimated through likelihood maximization with respect
	to measurement errors. Finally, direct regulation numbers are identified
	through maximizing a lower bound of an overall likelihood function.
	These methods have been applied to an artificially constructed linear
	system with 100 elements, a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
	model with 103 chemical elements, some DREAM initiative in silico
	data and some in vivo data. Compared with the widely adopted total
	least squares (TLS) method, computation results show that parametric
	estimation accuracy can be significantly increased and false positive
	errors can be greatly reduced. AVAILABILITY: The Matlab files for
	the methods are available at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/ylwang/Matlabfiles_CNI.zip.},

	process.},
  journal = {BMC Syst Biol},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {13},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein translation is a multistep process which can be
	represented as a cascade of biochemical reactions (initiation, ribosome
	assembly, elongation, etc.), the rate of which can be regulated by
	small non-coding microRNAs through multiple mechanisms. It remains
	unclear what mechanisms of microRNA action are the most dominant:
	moreover, many experimental reports deliver controversial messages
	on what is the concrete mechanism actually observed in the experiment.
	Nissan and Parker have recently demonstrated that it might be impossible
	to distinguish alternative biological hypotheses using the steady
	state data on the rate of protein synthesis. For their analysis they
	used two simple kinetic models of protein translation. RESULTS: In
	contrary to the study by Nissan and Parker, we show that dynamical
	data allow discriminating some of the mechanisms of microRNA action.
	We demonstrate this using the same models as developed by Nissan
	and Parker for the sake of comparison but the methods developed (asymptotology
	of biochemical networks) can be used for other models. We formulate
	a hypothesis that the effect of microRNA action is measurable and
	observable only if it affects the dominant system (generalization
	of the limiting step notion for complex networks) of the protein
	translation machinery. The dominant system can vary in different
	experimental conditions that can partially explain the existing controversy
	of some of the experimental data. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the
	transient protein translation dynamics shows that it gives enough

	mechanism of microRNA action on protein translation. For multiscale
	systems only that action of microRNA is distinguishable which affects
	the parameters of dominant system (critical parameters), or changes
	the dominant system itself. Dominant systems generalize and further
	develop the old and very popular idea of limiting step. Algorithms
	for identifying dominant systems in multiscale kinetic models are
	straightforward but not trivial and depend only on the ordering of
	the model parameters but not on their concrete values. Asymptotic
	approach to kinetic models allows putting in order diverse experimental
	observations in complex situations when many alternative hypotheses

  abstract = {A two-step process, previously considered in the literature, and here
	named coadaptational drive, is deemed to be largely responsible for
	both increases in the complexity of transcriptional control and increases
	in the total gene number, along lines of descent leading to more
	complex organisms. Coadaptational drive consists in a succession
	of modifications in the interaction among informational macromolecules,
	namely, structural decay spread by genetic drift and repair spread
	by selection. Increased genetic complexity, drawing on the opportunities
	offered by gene duplication, may be considered to be a secondary
	effect of such processes of decay and repair. The evolution toward
	higher regulatory complexity is thus considered to be obligatorily
	founded in part on random genetic drift. Increases in this complexity
	would represent primarily a trend intrinsic to the internal molecular
	environment, with the external environment having only to concur.
	Direct selection of mutations that increase complexity without the
	intervention of a phase of genetic drift is acknowledged likely to
	be a significant process as well, but it is claimed that a sequence
	of events of direct selection cannot be unlimited and will eventually
	stall, and that the roots of such a sequence ultimately are to be
	traced to an episode of coadaptational drive. Controller gene diseases,
	mostly mild, therefore seem to be essential for the evolution of
	increased biological complexity. The attempt is made to show or to
	confirm that (i) a conservative force (repair) provides a mechanism
	for the generation of novelty, (ii) a prominent part of selection,
	counterpart to Darwinian selection, originates from the internal
	environment and derives from the mechanics of genomic processes,
	and (iii) this selection is at times directional and leads to increases
	in complexity.},
