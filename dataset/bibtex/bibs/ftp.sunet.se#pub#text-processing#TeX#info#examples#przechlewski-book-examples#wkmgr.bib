 abstract = " Information technology (IT) acceptance research has
 yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance
 determinants.  In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance
 literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically
 compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a
 unified theory that integrates elements across the eight models, and
 (4) empirically validate the unified model.  The eight models
 reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance
 model, a motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model
 combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned
 behavior, a model of PC utilization, innovation diffusion theory, and
 social cognitive theory.  Using data from four organizations over a
 six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models
 explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user
 intentions to use information technology.  Next, a unified theory,
 called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
 (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and
 usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships.  UTAUT was
 then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight
 individual models (69\% adjusted-R2).  UTAUT was then confirmed with
 data from two new organizations with similar results (70\%
 adjusted-R2).  UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing
 to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions
 and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to
 proactively design interventions (including training, marketing,
 etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to
 adopt and use new systems.  The paper also makes several
 recommendations for future research including developing a deeper
 understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining
 measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding
 the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.",

 abstract = "Purpose -- This paper is the second of two concerned with
 a meta-analysis of the technology acceptance model (TAM). This part
 aims to present a rigorous and quantitative meta-analytic review of
 569 findings from 95 TAM studies as a basis for identifying gaps and
 providing guidelines for implementation management and conduct of
 future research. The paper also seeks to investigate the potential
 impact of methodological characteristics on the meta-analytic
 findings.  Design/methodology/approach -- The approach consists of
 meta-analysis following Hedges and Olkin's procedures,
 moderator-analysis using homogeneity Q-values, analogue to ANOVA and
 weighted regression method.  Findings -- The dominant focus in
 empirical investigations of the TAM has been on modelling intention
 for its effect on self-reported usage behaviour, while the
 attitudinal construct has been neglected. This raises three
 questions: whether the exclusion of attitude from the TAM is
 beneficial for understanding of technology usage behaviour in
 mandatory settings; whether the revised TAM holds equally for
 mandatory and voluntary settings; and whether the emphasis on
 measuring intentions and self-report use rather than actual usage is
 warranted. An additional question answered in the meta-analysis is
 about the relative importance of PU and PEOU.  Originality/value --
 The paper provides a rigorous meta-analysis to progress towards a
 unified view of the TAM. ",
