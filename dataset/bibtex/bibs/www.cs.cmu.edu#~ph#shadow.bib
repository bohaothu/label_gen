A shadow determination accelerator for ray tracing is
presented. It is built on top of the uniform voxel
traversal grid structure. The accelerator proves to be
rather efficient, requires little additional memory and
the worst case scenario per shadow determination just
reduces down to traditional voxel traversal. It can
also be extended to model linear, area lights, as well
as atmospheric shadows.

ABSTRACT={
Essential to realistic and visually appealing images,
shadows are difficult to compute in most display
environments. This survey characterizes the various
types of shadows. It also describes most existing
shadow algorithms and discusses their complexities,
advantages, and shortcomings. We examine hard shadows,
soft shadows, shadows of transparent objects, and
shadows for complex modeling primitives. For each type,
we examine shadow algorithms within various rendering
techniques. This survey attempts to provide readers
with enough background and insight on the various
methods to allow them to choose the algorithm best
suited to their needs. We also hope that our analysis
will help identify the areas that need more research
and point to possible solutions.

                      shadow generation algorithm for static polygonal
                      environments illuminated by movable point light
                      sources. The algorithm can be easily implemented on any
                      graphics system that provides fast polygon
                      scan-conversion and achieves near real-time performance
                      for environments of modest size. It combines elements
                      of two kinds of current shadow generation algorithms:
                      two-pass object-precision approaches and shadow volume
                      approaches. This algorithm is an example of a new
                      paradigm for shadow generation. Previously, the
                      shadowing the problem can be viewed as solving the
                      visible-surface problem from the point of view of a
                      point light source. Another way to look at them, is
                      from a geometric modeling point of view. By creating
                      shadow volumes and then classifying polygons
                      analytically against it, shadows can also be computed.
                      Several optimizations are discussed. A way of reducing
                      the amount of polygon fragmentation is shown by
                      coalescing the fragments on the fly. Two methods of
                      parallelizing the algorithm is presented. One method
                      determines shadow fragments in parallel for a given
                      light source. And more importantly, a method to handle
                      shadowing from multiple point light sources independent
                      of the number of light sources on workstations with
                      alpha blending capabilities is described. Finally this
                      algorithm has been extended to generate soft shadows by
                      modeling area light sources. By initially meshing the
                      scene into penumbra/umbra regions, and by adaptively
                      meshing the penumbra regions with concentric contours
                      similiar in shape to the outer penumbra region and by
                      applying the point light source shadow algorithm to
                      compute what fraction of an area light source is seen
                      by a point to be rendered in the interior of the
                      penumbra region and finally, by smooth shading the
                      results, fuzzy shadows can be rendered. The future work
                      section talks about combining all of the above to
                      produce higher quality shadows in radiosity
                      environments through adaptive meshing of the scene
                      along penumbra/umbra boundaries via the area light
                      source shadow algorithm and through analytically
                      computing form-factors via the point light source
                      shadow algorithm. Pseudocode is provided along with
                      pictures and timings from an interactive
                      implementation.",

       abstract =     "Rapid developments in the design of algorithms for
                      rendering globally illuminated scenes have taken place
                      in the past five years. Net energy methods such as
                      radiosity algorithms have become effective at
                      computing the energy balance for scenes containing
                      diffusely reflecting objects. Such methods first break
                      up a scene description into a large set of elements, or
                      possibly several levels of elements. Energy transfers
                      among these elements are then determined using a
                      variety of means. While much progress has been made in
                      the design of energy transfer algorithms, little or no
                      attention has been paid to the proper generation of the
                      mesh of surface elements. This dissertation presents a
                      technique for adaptively creating a mesh of surface
                      elements as the energy transfers are computed. The
                      method allows large numbers of small elements to be
                      placed at parts of the scene where the most active
                      energy transfers occur without requiring that other
                      parts of the scene be subdivided needlessly to the same
                      degree. As a result, the computational effort in the
                      energy transfer computations can be concentrated where
                      it has the most effect. Since the sources of direct and
                      indirect illumination in the scene are polygonal
                      elements, the effects of light sources with finite area
                      must be computed. Most methods simplify the problem by
                      approximating the area source with a collection of

                      model illumination from polygonal light sources

                      smooth-shaded polygonal facets that may be rendered
                      from any viewing position. Binary Space Partitioning
                      trees are used to compute umbra and penumbra boundaries
                      efficiently. Fast analytic techniques are developed
                      for illumination calculations. Numerical optimization
                      methods ensure that the shading function is sampled
                      finely enough to find all significant illumination
                      gradations. Illumination calculations are optimized to
                      concentrate computational effort on parts of the scene
                      where they are most needed.",

                      synthesis, the ultimate goal is to produce a picture
                      indistinguishable from a photograph of a real
                      environment. A particularly powerful technique for
                      simulating light reflection---an important element in
                      creating this realism---is called ray tracing. This
                      method produces images of excellent quality, but
                      suffers from lengthy computation time that limits its
                      practical use. \\ This article presents a new method to
                      reduce shadow testing time during ray tracing. The
                      technique involves generating light buffers, each of
                      which partition the environment with respect to an
                      individual light source. These partition descriptions
                      are then used during shadow testing to quickly
                      determine a small subset of objects that may have to be
                      tested for intersection. \\ The results of timing tests
                      illustrate the beneficial performance of these
                      techniques. The tests compare the standard ray-tracing
                      algorithm to light buffers of varying resolution.",

       abstract =     "In this paper we discuss an approach for solving the
                      problem of interactively viewing a polyhedral scene.
                      Interactive viewing is the computation and display of
                      an interactively controlled sequence of views of a
                      scene corresponding to a viewer's movement along a
                      continuous viewpath. We present an algorithm for
                      generating such views with hidden-lines removed, and
                      consider extensions to solve the problem of generating
                      views with hidden-surfaces removed. The method relies
                      on a precomputation phase which constructs the {\it
                      aspect representation}, or asp. This representation can
                      be used to interactively view a polyhedral scene at
                      video rates with hidden-lines or surfaces removed. The
                      method exploits {\it viewpath coherence}, a form of
                      frame-to-frame coherence present in such a sequence of
                      views. The display of polyhedral line drawings with
                      hidden lines removed makes use of the topology of the
                      image line drawing and the pre-ordering of visual
                      events which change that topology. This approach is
                      extended to interactive viewing with hidden-surfaces
                      removed and with shading, shadows, and multiple light
                      sources. The set of object resolution polygons
                      representing the visible faces and the shadow polygons
                      for a single frame can be computed efficiently from the
                      previous frame using the asp. The hidden-line and
                      hidden-surface algorithms are closely related via the
                      asp. Interactive viewing with hidden-lines removed is
                      shown to be about as fast as the interactive display of
                      a wire-frame scene. The primary on-line cost of
                      hidden-surface interactive viewing is the cost
                      associated with scan converting the visible surfaces
                      and shadow polygons.",

ABSTRACT={
The hemicube estimates of form factors are based on a finite set of
sample directions. We obtain several optimal arrangements of sample
directions, which minimize the variance of these estimates. They are
based on changing the size or shape of the pixels or the shape of the
hemicube, or using non-uniform pixel grids. The best reduces the
variance by 43%.

The variance calculation is based on the assumption that the errors in
the estimate are caused by the projections of single polygon edges, and
that the positions and orientations of these edges are random. This
replaces the infinite dimensional space of possible environments by the
two dimensional space of great circles on the unit sphere, making the
numerical variance minimization possible.

ABSTRACT={
We propose a new feedback technique for 3D interaction in augmented
reality using penumbrae which the objects cast. Rather than generating
a real penumbra, which is computationally expensive, a fast, simplified
algorithm is employed, which also is better suited for position
feedback purposes. User studies show that 1) compared to orthographic
shadow projections, 3D spatial recognition and placement tasks are
substantially faster with our penumbrae, and 2) the users feel the
feedback to be more natural, which is especially important in augmented
reality.
