 abstract={ We say that a $C^*$-algebra $X$ has the approximate $n$-th root property ($n\geq 2$) if for every $a\in X$ with $\|a\|\leq 1$ and every $\varepsilon >0$ there exists $b\in X$ such that $\|b\|\leq 1$ and $\|a-b^n\|<\varepsilon $. Some properties of commutative and non-commutative $C^*$-algebras having the approximate $n$-th root property are investigated. In particular, it is shown that there exists a non-commutative (respectively, commutative) separable unital \break $C^*$-algebra $X$ such that any other (commutative) separable unital $C^*$-algebra is a quotient of $X$. Also we illustrate a commutative $C^*$-algebra, each element of which has a square root such that its maximal ideal space has infinitely generated first {\v C}ech cohomology. }

 abstract={Marshall's abstract theory of spaces of orderings is a powerful tool in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms. We develop an abstract theory for semiorderings, developing a notion of a space of semiorderings which is a prespace of orderings. It is shown how to construct all finitely generated spaces of semiorderings. The morphisms between such spaces are studied, generalising the extension of valuations for fields into this context. An important invariant for studying Witt rings is the covering number of a preordering. Covering numbers are defined for abstract preorderings and related to other invariants of the Witt ring. }

 abstract={ The Jacobson group of a ring $R$ (denoted by $\cJ =\cJ (R)$) is the normal subgroup of the group of units of $R$ (denoted by $G(R)$) obtained by adding 1 to the Jacobson radical of $R$ $\bigl (J(R)\bigr )$. Coleman and Easdown in 2000 showed that the Jacobson group is complemented in the group of units of any finite commutative ring and also in the group of units of a $n\times n$ matrix ring over integers modulo $p^s$, when $n=2$ and $p=2,3$, but it is not complemented when $p\ge 5$. In 2004 Wilcox showed that the answer is positive also for $n=3$ and $p=2$, and negative in all the remaining cases. In this paper we offer a different proof for Wilcox's results and also generalise the results to a matrix ring over an arbitrary finite commutative ring. We show this by studying the generators and relations that define a matrix ring over a field. We then proceed to examine the complementation of the Jacobson group in the matrix rings over graded rings and prove that complementation depends only on the 0-th grade. }
