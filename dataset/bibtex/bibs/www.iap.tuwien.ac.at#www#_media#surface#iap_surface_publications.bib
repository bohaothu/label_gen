	title = {Metal-related gate sinking due to interfacial oxygen layer in {Ir/InAlN} high electron mobility transistors},
	volume = {96},
	doi = {10.1063/1.3458700},
	abstract = {We report on an annealing-induced ``gate sinking'' effect in a 2-nm-thin {In0.17Al0.83N/AlN} barrier high electron mobility transistor with {Ir} gate. Investigations by transmission electron microscopy linked the effect to an oxygen containing interlayer between the gate metal and the {InAlN} layer and revealed diffusion of oxygen into iridium during annealing. Below 700\,{$^\circ$C}  the diffusion is inhomogeneous and seems to occur along grain boundaries, which is consistent with the capacitance-voltage analysis. Annealing at 700\,{$^\circ$C} increased the gate capacitance over a factor 2, shifted the threshold voltage from +0.3 to +1\ {V} and increased the transconductance from 400 to 640 {mS/mm}},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.82.235401},
	abstract = {We have grown {22-ML-thick} Fe films on a Cu(100) single crystal. The films were stabilized in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) $\gamma{}$ phase by adsorption of carbon monoxide during growth, preventing the transformation to the body-centered-cubic (bcc) $\alpha{}$ phase. A structural transformation of these films from fcc to bcc can be induced by Ar$^+$ ion irradiation. Scanning-tunneling microscopy images show the nucleation of bcc crystallites, which grow with increasing Ar+ ion dose and eventually result in complete transformation of the film to bcc. Surface magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements confirm the transformation of the Fe film from paramagnetic (fcc) to ferromagnetic (bcc) with an in-plane easy axis. The transformation can also be observed by low-energy electron diffraction. We find only very few nucleation sites of the bcc phase and argue that nucleation of the bcc phase happens under special circumstances during resolidification of the molten iron in the thermal spike after ion impact. Intermixing with the Cu substrate impedes the transformation. We also demonstrate the transformation of films coated with Au to protect them from oxidation at ambient conditions.},

The capture and release of a proton caused individual molecules to switch between mobile and immobile states within a measurement period of minutes. Density functional theory calculations showed that the transfer of hydrogen from surface hydroxyls to the molecule and its interaction with surface hydroxyls substantially lowered the activation barrier for rotational motion across the surface.

We combined in situ surface x-ray diffraction with scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and density-functional theory calculations. We find that the two-dimensional epitaxial surface oxide layer exhibits a p2mm symmetry with an additional mirror plane as compared to the bulk oxide. The surface oxide layer is found to form under metastable conditions at an oxygen chemical potential $\sim{}$1.6 {eV} above the stability limit for bulk {$\beta{}$-Ga2O3.} The formation of the bulk oxide is kinetically hindered by the presence of the oxygen-terminated surface oxide, which most likely hampers dissociative oxygen chemisorption. We observe that below 620 K, the surface oxide is surprisingly stable at 1 bar oxygen pressure. Substrate faceting accompanies the bulk oxide formation at temperatures higher than 1020 K.},

Theoretical calculations of water adsorption on anatase (101) surfaces containing subsurface oxygen vacancies or titanium interstitials show a strong selectivity for water binding to sites in the vicinity of the subsurface defects. Moreover, the water adsorption energy at these sites is considerably higher than that on the stoichiometric surface, thus giving an explanation for the experimental observations.

The adsorption of azobenzene {(C6H5N$=$NH5C6)} and aniline {(C6H5NH$_2$)} on two single-crystalline {TiO$_2$} surfaces, anatase (101) and rutile (110), has been investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy {(STM),} low energy electron diffraction {(LEED),} and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy {(XPS).} While azobenzene adsorbs as an intact molecule at low coverages, ordered overlayers of phenyl imide {(C6H5N)} form at saturation coverage, indicating that {TiO$_2$} surfaces cleave the {N$=$N} bond even without the presence of Au. The same superstructures, p(1 $\times$ 2) on anatase and c(2 $\times$ 2) on rutile, form upon adsorption of aniline, suggesting the formation of the same, or a very similar, reaction intermediate. These results suggest that the main role of the supported Au in catalytic aniline $\leftrightarrow{}$ azobenzene conversion is the activation of {O$_2$/H$_2$} for de/hydrogenation reactions.},

Additional nuclei are formed at high ion energies ($\greaterequivlnt{}$200 {eV)} by adatoms created by the impinging ions. For heteroepitaxy, the island density is also increased by intermixing (deposited material implanted in the surface), creating an inhomogeneous potential energy surface for diffusing atoms.

	abstract = {Using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, we show that a thin {RhO$_2$} surface oxide film forms prior to the bulk {Rh2O3} corundum oxide on all close-packed single crystal {Rh} surfaces. Based on previous reports, we argue that the {RhO$_2$} surface oxide also forms on vicinal {Rh} surfaces as well as on {Rh} nanoparticles. The detailed structure of this film was previously determined using {UHV} based techniques and density functional theory. In the present paper, we also examine the structure of the bulk {Rh2O3} corundum oxide using surface X-ray diffraction. Being armed with this structural information, we have explored the {CO} oxidation reaction over Rh(111), Rh(100) and {Pt25Rh75(100)} at realistic pressures using in situ surface X-ray diffraction and online mass spectrometry. In all three cases we find that an increase of the {CO$_2$} production coincides with the formation of the thin {RhO$_2$} surface oxide film. In the case of {Pt25Rh75(100),} our measurements demonstrate that the formation of bulk {Rh2O3} corundum oxide poisons the reaction, and argue that this is also valid for all other {Rh} surfaces. Our study implies that the {CO} oxidation reaction over {Rh} surfaces at realistic conditions is insensitive to the exact {Rh} substrate orientation, but is rather governed by the formation of a specific surface oxide phase.},

	abstract = {The interaction of water with metal oxide surfaces is of fundamental importance to various fields of science, ranging from geophysics to catalysis and biochemistry. In particular, the discovery that {TiO$_2$} photocatalyses the dissociation of water has triggered broad interest and intensive studies of water adsorption on {TiO$_2$} over decades. So far, these studies have mostly focused on the (110) surface of the most stable polymorph of {TiO$_2$,} rutile, whereas it is the metastable anatase form that is generally considered photocatalytically more efficient. The present combined experimental (scanning tunnelling microscopy) and theoretical (density functional theory and first-principles molecular dynamics) study gives atomic-scale insights into the adsorption of water on anatase (101), the most frequently exposed surface of this {TiO$_2$} polymorph. Water adsorbs as an intact monomer with a computed binding energy of 730 {meV.} The charge rearrangement at the molecule\textendash{}anatase interface affects the adsorption of further water molecules, resulting in short-range repulsive and attractive interactions along the [010] and [11-1]/[1-1-1] directions, respectively, and a locally ordered (2$\times$2) superstructure of molecular water.},

	abstract = {Adsorbate-induced band gap states in semiconductors are of particular interest due to the potential of increased light absorption and photoreactivity. A combined theoretical and experimental {(STM,} photoemission) study of the molecular-scale factors involved in the formation of gap states in {TiO$_2$} is presented. Using the organic catechol on rutile {TiO$_2$(110)} as a model system, it is found that the bonding geometry strongly affects the molecular electronic structure. At saturation catechol forms an ordered 4 $\times$ 1 overlayer. This structure is attributed to catechol adsorbed on rows of surface {Ti} atoms with the molecular plane tilted from the surface normal in an alternating fashion. In the computed lowest-energy structure, one of the two terminal {OH} groups at each catechol dissociates and the {O} binds to a surface {Ti} atom in a monodentate configuration, whereas the other {OH} group forms an H-bond to the next catechol neighbor. Through proton exchange with the surface, this structure can easily transform into one where both {OH} groups dissociate and the catechol is bound to two surface {Ti} in a bidentate configuration. Only bidendate catechol introduces states in the band gap of {TiO$_2$.}},

The model that is (by far) energetically most stable shows also the best agreement with {SXRD} data. Calculated {STM} images agree with the experimental ones for appropriate tunneling conditions.

The new surface structure exhibits two different types of undercoordinated oxygen and titanium atoms, and is, in its stoichiometric form, predicted to be rather inert towards the adsorption of probe molecules.},

The attractive interaction is proposed to be caused by the coupling of pi bonding electrons and the repulsive interaction is possibly mediated by substrate.},

For {Fe/Cu(100),} bcc-like (nanomartensitic) structures are found in roughly the same thickness range for {PLD} and {TD} films but occupy a lower fraction of the films when deposited by {PLD.} The situation is different for thin {Fe/Cu(111)} films, where {PLD} films exhibit a higher bcc-like fraction, especially in islands of two monolayers thickness.

The experiments have been performed in ultrahigh vacuum at relatively low laser power. For measuring the spectra of the neutrals, a cross-beam electron source for postionization and electric as well as magnetic fields for repelling the ions are employed. Nevertheless, measurements of neutral particles are restricted to low plasma densities due to electrostatic shielding within the plasma, leading to an inefficient deflection of charged particles by electrostatic and magnetic fields. Test measurements have been performed by utilizing the {TOF} spectrometer as a pressure gauge and also by chopping the electron beam, running the {TOF} spectrometer as a residual gas mass spectrometer. The spectra of the laser-ablated plasmas have shown plasma conditions with a Debye length of approximately 10{\textasciicircum}-4  m, densities of 10{\textasciicircum}15\textendash{}10{\textasciicircum}16  m{\textasciicircum}-3 and ion energies up to 150  {eV.} Neutral spectra have shown an unexpectedly low fraction of neutrals (10{\textasciicircum}-3\textendash{}10{\textasciicircum}-4) and hyperthermal energies up to several 10 {eV,} possibly contributed by recombination of ions and electrons in the plasma.

On the clean surface, Au shows a strong tendency to form large clusters that nucleate on step edges. A preference for adsorption at type D-(112) steps is observed, which is probably a result of kinetic effects. For {Pt}, clusters as small as monomers are observed on the terraces, in agreement with the predicted large binding energy of 2.2 {eV.} Step edges play a less important role than in the case of Au.

The investigation combines traditional electron based {UHV} techniques such as high resolution core level spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy with in situ surface x-ray diffraction, and ab initio simulations. In this way, we show that the {O} atoms preferentially adsorb at the step edges at oxygen pressures below 10(-6) mbar and that the (553) surface is preserved. In the pressure range between 10(-6) and 1 mbar and at a sample temperature of 300-400 degrees C, a surface oxide forms and rearranges the (553) surface facets and forming (332) facets. Most of the surface oxide can be described as a {PdO(101)} plane, similar to what has been found previously on other {Pd} surfaces. However, in the present case, the surface oxide is reconstructed along the step edges, and the stability of this structure is discussed. In addition, the ($\surd{}$6 x $\surd{}$6) {Pd5O4} surface oxide can be observed on (111) terraces larger than those of the (332) terraces.

	abstract = {Rutile {TiO$_2$(1} 1 0) single crystals have been doped by nitrogen-ion implantation. The change in the valence band and in the core level peak shapes are characterized by photoemission spectroscopy. Surface morphologies are characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy. N-dopants are observed to be in a 3- charge state and to substitute for O-anions in the {TiO$_2$} lattice for N-concentrations up to $\approx$5\% of the anions. The higher valency of the N-dopants compared to the host O-anions is proposed to be compensated by the formation of O-vacancies and/or Ti-interstitials. Two chemically shifted components arise in the Ti-2p core level upon N-doping. These components, shifted by 0.9 {eV} and 2.1 {eV,} are assigned to Ti-bound to N-ligands and possibly due to O-vacancies in the lattice. The Ti-3d band gap state observed in {UPS} is initially suppressed upon room temperature N-implantation and recovers a similar intensity as for undoped {TiO$_2$} samples upon annealing. This indicates that electrons left behind upon creation of O-vacancies are filling the N-2p level rather than Ti-3d states. The filled N-2p state is found at the top of the {TiO2} valence band and is believed to be responsible for the band gap narrowing of N-doped {TiO2} that shifts the photoactivity of {TiO2} into the visible spectrum.},

We have also studied the clusters after annealing to 300 degrees C and {Pd} clusters deposited at 300 degrees C. Mixed {Co-Pd} clusters obtained by sequential deposition at room temperature were also studied. Pure {Co} deposited at room temperature forms a single type of clusters, most or all of them with close-packed planes parallel to the oxide surface. Their shape can be approximated by truncated spheres with a high contact angle of 115-125 degrees. These clusters are stable upon annealing up to 300 degrees C. {Pd} clusters deposited at room temperature grow in two different modes. At the reflection domain boundaries the clusters grow in their thermodynamically favorable shape. The clusters do not have a single crystallographic orientation and their shape can be approximated by a truncated sphere with a high contact angle of about 110 degrees, especially at very low coverages (below 0.05 {ML).} At the antiphase domain boundaries. the {Pd} clusters grow in (1 11) orientation and on some of them small (111) facets appear at their tops already at low coveraizes. For higher coverages of {Pd}, the majority of {Pd} clusters are rather flat with a large Pd(111) facet on top. The clusters' shape at the antiphase domain boundaries differs from the thermodynamically favorable one, due to kinetic limitations, especially at higher coverages. Annealing the {Pd} clusters to 300 degrees C leads to re-structuring of these {Pd} clusters. They transform into higher and more rounded clusters and a thin disordered alumina film is formed on top of the clusters. When {Pd} is deposited at 300 degrees C, about 16\% of the {Pd} clusters have a steep slope and rounded tops. The rest of the {Pd} forms lower clusters, goes subsurface and is covered by a disordered alumina film. When {Co} and {Pd} are deposited sequentially, {Pd} covers the {Co} clusters forming a shell. The resulting mixed clusters are still truncated spheres with a lowered contact angle. For deposition in the reverse order (first {Pd} and then {Co}) we found that {Co} forms an alloy with {Pd} already at room temperature.},

Simulated and measured {STM} images are in excellent agreement, indicating that the structural models are correct.

Density functional theory calculations show that {Fe-Ni} alloy surfaces are buckled with the {Fe} atoms slightly shifted outwards and the {Ni} atoms inwards. This is consistent with the observation that the atoms in the surface layer can be chemically distinguished in the {STM} image: brighter spots (corrugation maxima with increased apparent height) indicate iron atoms, darker ones nickel atoms. This chemical contrast reveals a c(2$\times$2) chemical order (50\% {Fe}) with frequent {Fe}-rich defects on the {Fe64Ni36(001)} surface. The calculations also indicate that subsurface composition fluctuations may additionally modulate the apparent height of the surface atoms. The {STM} images show that this effect is pronounced compared to the surfaces of other disordered alloys, which suggests that some chemical order and corresponding concentration fluctuations exist also in the subsurface layers of Invar alloy. In addition, detailed electronic structure calculations allow us to identify the nature of a distinct peak below the Fermi level observed in the tunneling spectra. This peak corresponds to a surface resonance band which is particularly pronounced in iron-rich surface regions and provides a second type of chemical contrast with less spatial resolution but one that is essentially independent of the subsurface composition.},

In a two-step process, hydrogen saturates first the bridging oxygen atoms to form {(ObrH)} species and subsequently part of these {ObrH} groups move to the undercoordinated Ru atoms where they form adsorbed water.

Reduction starts in very few sites, almost exclusively in stepped areas. One can also initiate the reduction process by deliberately creating defects with the {STM} tip allowing us to examine the reduction kinetics in detail. Depending on the size of the reduced area and the hydrogen pressure, two growth regimes were found. At low H$_2$ pressures or small reduced areas, the reduction rate is limited by hydrogen adsorption on the reduced area. For large reduced areas, the reduction rate is limited by the processes at the border of the reduced area. Since a near-random distribution of the reduction nuclei was found and the reduction process at defects starts at a random time, one can use {JohnsonMehlAvramiKolmogoroff} {(JMAK)} theory to describe the process of reduction.

B 47, 10785 (1993)] provide us with sufficient detail to deduce the film structure. Two growth regimes are considered: (1) films with 1\textendash{}2 monolayer average thickness grown near 200 K, which nucleate as bcc-like bilayer islands: Larger islands show bcc-like fringes coexisiting with an fcc center domain; i.e., the bcc-like phase is stable only within a certain distance to a step edge. The presence of a bcc-like bilayer phase provides a straightforward explanation for the ferromagnetism previously observed in these films. In addition we find that the bcc-like phase can be promoted by {H} adsorption at 80  K. The bcc domains form "displacement vortex" structures to simultaneously minimize film stress and interface energy. (2) In films grown at room temperature, between pseudomorphic fcc areas, we observe a more ideal but still strained bcc phase in regions with a local thickness of at least 4 monolayers. Also in this growth regime, the fcc-bcc transformation is facilitated by step edges, which are abundant due to the imperfect layer-by-layer growth.},

	abstract = {Growth and decomposition of the {Pd$_5$O$_4$} surface oxide on Pd(111) were studied at sample temperatures between 573 and 683 K and O$_2$ gas pressures between 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-7{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 6 $\times$ 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mbar, by means of an effusive O$_2$ beam from a capillary array doser, scanning tunnelling microscopy {(STM)} and thermal desorption spectrometry {(TDS).} Exposures beyond the p(2 $\times$ {2)O} adlayer (saturation coverage 0.25) at 683 K (near thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to {Pd5O4} surface oxide formation) lead to incorporation of additional oxygen into the surface. To initiate the incorporation, a critical pressure beyond the thermodynamic stability limit of the surface oxide is required. This thermodynamic stability limit is near 8.9 $\times$ 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mbar at 683 K, in good agreement with calculations by density functional theory. A controlled kinetic study was feasible by generating nuclei by only a short O$_2$ pressure pulse and then following further growth kinetics in the lower (10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mbar) pressure range. Growth of the surface oxide layer at a lower temperature (573 K) studied by {STM} is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity. Among various metastable local structures, a seam of disordered oxide formed at the step edges is a common structural feature characteristic of initial oxide growth. Further oxide nucleation appears to be favoured along the interface between the p(2 $\times$ {2)O} structure and these disordered seams. Among the intermediate phases one specifically stable phase was detected both during growth and decomposition of the {Pd$_5$O$_4$} layer. It is hexagonal with a distance of about 0.62 nm between the protrusions. Its well-ordered form is a ($\surd{}$67 x {$\surd{}$67)R12.1$^\circ$} superstructure. Isothermal decay of the {Pd$_5$O$_4$} oxide layer at 693 K involves at first a rearrangement into the  ($\surd{}$67 x {$\surd{}$67)R12.1$^\circ$} structure, indicating its high-temperature stability. This structure can break up into small clusters of uniform size and leaves a free metal surface area covered by a p(2 $\times$ {2)O} adlayer. The rate of desorption increases autocatalytically with increasing phase boundary metal-oxide. We propose that at close-to-equilibrium conditions (693 K) surface oxide growth and decay occur via this intermediate structure.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the formation of thin, well-ordered but complex surface oxides on late transition metals has been discovered. The driving force for this line of research has been the strong incentive to increase the partial pressure of oxygen from ultra-high vacuum to conditions more relevant for heterogeneous catalysis. Here we review the present status of the research field. Compared to oxygen adatom superstructures, the structure of the surface oxides has proven to be extremely complex, and the investigations have therefore relied on a combination of several experimental and theoretical techniques. The approach to solving the structures formed on close-packed surfaces of {Pd} and {Rh} is presented in some detail. Focusing on the structures found, we show that the surface oxides share some general properties with the corresponding bulk oxides. Nevertheless, of all surface oxide structures known today, only the two-dimensional surface oxides on Pd(100) and {Pt}(110) have the same lattice as the bulk oxides {(PdO} and {PtO,} respectively). In addition to two-dimensional oxides, including the {O-Rh-O} trilayers found on {Rh}, one-dimensional oxides were observed at ridges or steps of open surfaces such as (110) or vicinal surfaces. Finally, we briefly report on a few studies of the reactivity of surface oxides with well-known structure.},

Density functional theory calculations predict dissociation of water on the stoichiometric {(Sn(IV))} surface but only weak molecular adsorption on the reduced {Sn(II)} surface. These predictions are in agreement with {ARUPS} measurements that show that at 160 K no water adsorbs on the reduced surface but adsorbs dissociatively on the stoichiometric surface.

Ultraviolet photoemission experiments show that water is adsorbed in molecular form at a sample temperature of 110 K. At the same time, the presence of a 3sigma state in the photoemission spectra and work function measurements indicate a significant amount of hydroxyls within the first monolayer of water. At room temperature, scanning tunneling microscopy {(STM)} suggests that dissociated water is present, and about 30\% of the surface active sites are hydroxylated. These findings are well explained by total energy density functional theory calculations and {CarParrinello} molecular dynamics simulations for water adsorption on the titanyl model of {TiO$_2$(011)-(21).} The theoretical results show that a mixed molecular/dissociative layer is the most stable configuration in the monolayer regime at low temperatures, while complete dissociation takes place at 250 K.

The film is a wide-gap insulator, although the overall stoichiometry of the film is not {Al2O3} but {Al10O13.} We propose that the same building blocks can be found on the surfaces of bulk oxides, such as the reduced corundum (0001) surface.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of a series of sulfated zirconia catalysts was optimized using the isomerization of n-butane as a reaction probe. The normality of the {H$_2$SO4} solution used in the sulfation step was found to be the most important variable. A systematic change in the concentration of the {H$_2$SO4} solution showed that the optimum acid concentration was 0.25 {N}. When a catalyst prepared with this acid concentration was used, the conversion of n-butane at 200 {$^\circ$C} was 35\% at 5 min t-o-s. This was close to the thermodynamic equilibrium value of 56\% conversion. This maximum was coincident with a catalyst with the highest specific surface area. An increase in the concentration of the {H$_2$SO4} solution above 0.25 {N} resulted in a decrease in both surface area and zirconia crystallinity. {XPS} studies showed a linear relationship between the {H$_2$SO4} solution concentration and the surface sulfur concentration. Bulk concentrations were determined by elemental analysis. The surface area increased to a maximum for a {H$_2$SO4} concentration of 0.25 {N}, while the concentration of bulk sulfur continued to increase when the acid concentration was progressively increased to 2.00 {N}. The use of a mordenite trap in the reactant stream resulted in an increase in n-butane conversion and a decrease in the rate of catalyst deactivation. {XPS} studies showed that the sulfur was present as sulfate species and that the oxidation state was not affected by the reaction.},

The island density decreases upon heating to 700 K. Small amounts of {Cr} are incorporated in the Ru substrate at this temperature. For higher {Cr} coverages (2 {ML),} three-dimensional growth is observed at 300 K. Annealing this {Cr} layer to 500 and 700 K leads to the formation of {Cr} islands (4-5 layers high) with an elongated shape and bcc(110) structure with a pseudomorphic {Cr} monolayer covering the remaining substrate. As shown by atomically resolved images, the {Cr} bcc(110) islands have {Kurdjumov-Sachs} orientation with respect to the Ru(0001) substrate. After annealing at 1000 K, the formation of a hexagonal, chemically disordered {CrRu} alloy is observed, in agreement with a previous study {[Engelhardt} et al., Surf. Sci. 512 (2002) 107]. The room-temperature {STM} investigation of {CO} adsorption on the {CrRu} alloy with approx. 34\% {Cr} in the first layer shows that adsorbed molecular {CO} resides only on Ru atoms, not on {Cr}, mostly in an on-top geometry. The {CO} occupation of Ru sites increases slightly with the number of neighbouring {Cr} atoms, indicating a weak ligand effect. We also find indications that the few threefold hollow sites surrounded by three {Cr} atoms become occupied by atomic {C} or {O}, due to dissociation of a small fraction of the adsorbed {CO} molecules; thus, we cannot unambiguously determine whether molecular {CO} can bind to these threefold sites at room temperature.},

Transitions from stoichiometric to reduced surface phases have been observed at 440\textendash{}520  K, 610\textendash{}660  K, and 560\textendash{}660  K for the {SnO$_2$} (110), (100), and (101) surfaces, respectively. Density functional theory has been employed to assess the oxidation state and stability of different surface structures and compositions at various oxygen chemical potentials. The reduction of the {SnO$_2$} surfaces is facilitated by the dual valency of {Sn}, and for all three surfaces a transition from {Sn(IV)} to {Sn(II)} is observed. For the (100) and (101) surfaces, theory supports the experimental observations that the phase transitions are accomplished by removal of bridging oxygen atoms from a stoichiometric {SnO$_2$} surface, leaving a {SnO} surface layer with a 1$\times$1 periodicity. For the (110) surface the lowest energy surface under reducing conditions was predicted for a model with a {SnO} surface layer with all bridging oxygen and every second row of in-plane oxygen atoms removed. Ab initio atomistic thermodynamic calculations predict the phase transition conditions for the (101) surface, but there are significant differences with the experimentally observed transition temperatures for the (110) and (100) surfaces. This discrepancy between experiment and thermodynamic equilibrium calculations is likely because of a dominant role of kinetic processes in the experiment. The reduction of surface {Sn} atoms from a {Sn(IV)} to a {Sn(II)} valence state results in filling of the Sn-5s states and, consequently, the formation of {Sn} derived surface states for all three investigated surfaces. The dispersion of the surface states for the reduced (101) surface was determined and found to be in good agreement with the {DFT} results. For the (110) surface, the 4$\times$1 reconstruction that forms after sputter and annealing cycles was also investigated. For this surface, states that span almost the entire band gap were observed. Resonant photoemission spectroscopy identified all the surface states on the reduced {SnO$_2$} surfaces as {Sn} derived.},

	abstract = {The study of tin oxide is motivated by its applications as a solid state gas sensor material, oxidation catalyst, and transparent conductor. This review describes the physical and chemical properties that make tin oxide a suitable material for these purposes. The emphasis is on surface science studies of single crystal surfaces, but selected studies on powder and polycrystalline films are also incorporated in order to provide connecting points between surface science studies with the broader field of materials science of tin oxide. The key for understanding many aspects of {SnO$_2$} surface properties is the dual valency of Sn. The dual valency facilitates a reversible transformation of the surface composition from stoichiometric surfaces with Sn4+ surface cations into a reduced surface with Sn2+ surface cations depending on the oxygen chemical potential of the system. Reduction of the surface modifies the surface electronic structure by formation of {Sn} 5s derived surface states that lie deep within the band gap and also cause a lowering of the work function. The gas sensing mechanism appears, however, only to be indirectly influenced by the surface composition of {SnO$_2$.} Critical for triggering a gas response are not the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or ionosorbed) oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge. Band bending induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal. In most applications tin oxide is modified by additives to either increase the charge carrier concentration by donor atoms, or to increase the gas sensitivity or the catalytic activity by metal additives. Some of the basic concepts by which additives modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties of {SnO$_2$} are discussed and the few surface science studies of doped {SnO$_2$} are reviewed. Epitaxial {SnO$_2$} films may facilitate the surface science studies of doped films in the future. To this end film growth on titania, alumina, and {Pt}(111) is reviewed. Thin films on alumina also make promising test systems for probing gas sensing behavior. Molecular adsorption and reaction studies on {SnO$_2$} surfaces have been hampered by the challenges of preparing well-characterized surfaces. Nevertheless some experimental and theoretical studies have been performed and are reviewed. Of particular interest in these studies was the influence of the surface composition on its chemical properties. Finally, the variety of recently synthesized tin oxide nanoscopic materials is summarized.},

At a coverage of 0.25 {ML,} the surface is completely covered by the surface alloy and alloy islands. The (2 $\times$ 2) structure is equivalent to a (111)-plane of {CeRh3,} contracted by 6\%. Annealing a 1 {ML} thick Ce layer leads to a flat surface consisting of different rotational domains of {CeRh3(100).} The {Rh} needed for alloy formation comes from 50 \AA{} deep pits in the substrate. Finally we show that {LEIS} (low energy ion scattering) is not suitable for the characterization of Ce and {CeRh} films due to strong effects of neutralization.},

Evaporation of {V} in an oxygen background at elevated sample temperature (250 {$^\circ$C)} results in the formation of a nonperiodic honeycomb-like structure growing from the steps, which starts to transform into an ordered phase at a vanadium coverage of $\approx{}$0.2 {ML} (monolayer). At 0.31 {ML} the entire surface is covered by this well-ordered open (4$\times$4) structure. Annealing this structure in H$_2$ atmosphere transforms the phase into a {V2O3} surface oxide with (2$\times$2) periodicity, whose optimal coverage is reached at 0.5 {ML} vanadium. Models for both ordered structures have been suggested before on the basis of ab initio density-functional theory {(DFT)} calculations and molecular-dynamics simulations and these models are now unambiguously confirmed by quantitative low-energy electron-diffraction {(LEED)} analyses. In the (4$\times$4) phase, the {V} atoms are surrounded by four oxygen atoms in an unusual tetrahedral coordination leading to a {V5O14} stoichiometry. This tetrahedral coordination allows the oxide to adopt open loosely packed two-dimensional {(2D)} and {1D} structures, which are stabilized by the surface-oxide interface energy.

The terraces exhibit a high density of defects. Annealing to 810 K results in the loss of surface oxygen but the surface retains a 1 $\times$ 1 periodicity. Steps of less than monolayer-height, however, indicate that a significant reordering of the surface atoms occurs already at this temperature. Annealing to higher temperature or preparation of the surface by sputtering and vacuum annealing always results in a superstructure in the diffraction pattern and a low {[O]/[Sn]} ratio in {ISS.} For annealing temperatures between 920 and 1050 K co-existence of c(2 $\times$ 2) and 4 $\times$ 1 reconstructed domains is observed. In this regime small adislands are always present at the surface; extended terraces were imaged by {STM} with a 4 $\times$ 1 periodicity. This implies that the c(2 $\times$ 2)-structure is associated with adislands at the surface. Annealing to 1100 K resulted in the formation of a 4 $\times$ 1 surface only. This surface exhibits terraces with meandering step edges and antiphase domain boundaries of the 4 $\times$ 1 surface structure. A new model for this reconstruction is proposed including {Sn} atoms occupying interstitial surface sites. Annealing to 1180 K results in the fragmentation of the 4 $\times$ 1 structure and the surface looses its long-range order. This causes a 1 $\times$ 1 {LEED} pattern originating from the underlying substrate.

Complex surface reconstructions and surface oxides, in particular, often exhibit complicated atomic arrangements, which are difficult to resolve with traditional experimental methods, such as low energy electron diffraction {(LEED),} surface X-ray diffraction {(SXRD)} or scanning tunnelling microscopy {(STM)} alone. Therefore, ab initio density functional calculations are used as a supplement to the experimental techniques, but even then the structural determination usually relies on a simple trial and error procedure, in which conceivable models are first constructed and then tested for their stability in ab initio calculations. An exhaustive search of the configuration space is usually difficult and requires a significant human effort. Solutions to this problem, such as simulated annealing, have long been known, but are usually considered to be too time-consuming in combination with first principles methods. In this work, we show that ab initio density functional codes are now sufficiently fast to perform extensive finite temperature molecular dynamics. The merits of this approach are exemplified for two cases, for a complex two-dimensional surface oxide on Pd(111), and for the oxygen induced c(6$\times$2) reconstruction of V(110).},

techniques. Recently, {TiO$_2$} has also been used to refine computational ab initio approaches and to calculate properties of adsorption systems. Scanning
tunneling microscopy {(STM)} studies have shown that the surface structure of {TiO$_2$(110)} is more complex than originally anticipated. The reduction state of the sample, i.e. the number and type of bulk defects,
as well as the surface treatment (annealing in vacuum vs. annealing in oxygen), can give rise to different structures, such
as two different (1$\times$2) reconstructions, a `rosette' overlayer, and crystallographic shear planes. Single point defects can
be identified with {STM} and influence the surface chemistry in a variety of ways; the adsorption of water is discussed as one
example. The growth of a large number of different metal overlayers has been studied on {TiO$_2$(110).} Some of these studies have been instrumental in furthering the understanding of the `strong metal support interaction'
between {group-VIII} metals and {TiO$_2$,} as well as low-temperature oxidation reactions on {TiO$_2$-supported} nanoscopic gold clusters. The growth morphology, interfacial oxidation/reduction reaction, thermal stability, and
geometric structure of ultra-thin metal overlayers follow general trends where the most critical parameter is the reactivity

This is in reasonable agreement with a value of 4.15 sulfur atoms/nm2 based on sulfur analysis on the assumption that all of the sulfur was located at the surface. These results suggest that most, if not all, of the sulfur is near or at the surface. When charging was taken into account, we observed that the oxidation state of sulfur did not change following catalyst deactivation during the isomerization of n-butane. We also determined that the entire inventory of sulfur was present as {SO42-.} These results reinforce previous studies suggesting that catalyst deactivation occurs as the result of carbon deposition and not a change in the oxidation state of sulfur.},

	abstract = {The interaction of water and methanol with well-defined (1 1) terminated surfaces of {anatase-TiO$_2$(101)} were investigated with temperature-programmed desorption {(TPD)} and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {(XPS).} For water, three desorption states were observed in the {TPD} spectra at 160, 190, and 250 K. The three desorption peaks were assigned to multilayer water, water adsorbed to 2-fold-coordinated {O}, and water adsorbed to 5-fold-coordinated {Ti}, respectively. The {TPD} spectra for methanol were more complicated. For methanol, five desorption peaks were observed in the {TPD} spectra at 135, 170, 260, 410, and 610 K. The five desorption peaks were assigned to multilayer methanol, methanol adsorbed to 2-fold-coordinated {O}, methanol adsorbed to 5-fold-coordinated {Ti}, methoxy adsorbed to 5-fold-coordinated {Ti}, and methoxy adsorbed to {Ti} at step edges, respectively. The {XPS} results indicated that the adsorbed water and methanol were predominantly bound to the surface in a molecular state, with no evidence for dissociation. Furthermore, the {O} 1s core-level binding energies for water and methanol were found to shift to an 0.75 {eV} lower binding energy for coverages before multilayer desorption is observed in the {TPD} spectra. The {O} 1s core-level binding-energy shift appears to be linear in this region and corresponds to water and methanol bonding to {Ti} cation and {O} anion sites on the surface. The {C} 1s core-level binding energy for methanol was found to remain approximately constant in the same coverage regime.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0167-5729(02)00100-0},
	abstract = {Titanium dioxide is the most investigated single-crystalline system in the surface science of metal oxides, and the literature on rutile (1 1 0), (1 0 0), (0 0 1), and anatase surfaces is reviewed. This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical fields where {TiO$_2$} is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed. Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile (1 1 0). The surface structure of rutile (1 1 0) is discussed in some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallographic shear {planes--CSPs)} are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy {(STM).} The controversy about the correct model for the (1$\times$2) reconstruction appears to be settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different {TiO$_2$(1} 1 0) surfaces are given. The structure of the {TiO$_2$(1} 0 0)-(1$\times$1) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1$\times$3) reconstruction are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) surfaces are included.
The electronic structure of stoichiometric {TiO$_2$} surfaces is now well understood. Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface spectroscopies. The vibrational structure is dominated by strong {Fuchs-Kliewer} phonons, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectra often need to be deconvoluted in order to render useful information about adsorbed molecules.
The growth of metals {(Li,} {Na}, K, Cs, Ca, {Al}, {Ti}, {V}, Nb, {Cr}, {Mo}, {Mn}, {Fe}, {Co}, {Rh}, {Ir}, {Ni}, {Pd}, {Pt}, {Cu}, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides on {TiO$_2$} is reviewed. The tendency to [`]wet' the overlayer, the growth morphology, the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial oxidation/reduction reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen being the most decisive factor. Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures at low coverages. Recent progress in understanding the surface structure of metals in the [`]strong-metal support interaction' {(SMSI)} state is summarized.
Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorganic molecules {(H$_2$,} O$_2$, {H$_2$O,} {CO,} {CO$_2$,} N2, {NH3,} {NOx,} sulfur- and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application of {TiO$_2$-based} systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on {UHV-based} photocatalytic studies are summarized.
The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of {TiO$_2$-based} surface science for the future.},

When hydrogen is present, the reconstruction is lifted, and hydroxyl groups stabilize the ideal otherwise unreconstructed surface. The transition between the unreconstructed hydroxyl covered surface and the triangular shaped features occurs abruptly; {OH} groups lift the reconstruction, but their adsorption is energetically unfavorable on the triangularly reconstructed surface.},

Isolated impurities shift the surface state 0.05 {eV} upwards in energy and broaden the peak observed in {dI/dV.} No significant influence of monoatomic steps on the surface state could be observed. For tunneling resistances down to about 1 {MOhm} the surface state is unaffected by the tip of the {STM.} A surface state is detected around +0.75 {eV} in small c(2x2) patches which are observed at higher carbon (and oxygen) coverages. The oxygen induced (1x5) reconstruction of V(001) shows a peak at similar energy (+0.63 {eV)} in the areas with {O} and {C} atoms in fourfold hollow sites and a peak around +0.91 {eV} above the rows of bridge-site oxygen. Ab-initio band structure calculations confirm the existence of a surface state of dz2 symmetry with an energy close to that observed experimentally on clean V(001). This agreement provides strong evidence that the V(001) surface is not magnetic (at least at room temperature) as predicted by the calculations.

The surface oxygen inhibits hydrogen adsorption, and readily reacts with {CO} at 300-500 K. For large and crystalline {Pd} particles, the system exhibits adsorption-desorption properties which are very similar to those of the Pd(111) single crystal surface.

Upon deposition of {Pd} in the submonolayer range, it was possible to stabilize single {Pd} adatoms and small clusters at {RT.} Annealing such a surface at 200 {$^\circ$C} leads to the formation of rectangular {Pd} islands (size $\approx{}$40$\times$40 \AA{}2) and to the compression of the initial {C} and {O} adlayer in the areas between the Pd. For higher {Pd} coverages we found that oxygen acts as an anti-surfactant, shifting the onset of second layer growth dramatically. The reason for the change of the growth mode of {Pd} on V(100) from {Stranski\textendash{}Krastanov} to a {Volmer\textendash{}Weber-type} growth in the presence of oxygen can be found in a higher free energy of the film/substrate interface compared to the clean surface.},

Experimental photoemission data indicate a quenching of the oxygen-vacancy-related defect state upon chlorine adsorption at room temperature, in agreement with the theoretical results. Chlorine atoms appear as bright, extended spots in experimental empty-states {STM} images. Calculations of density-of-states contours indicate that {Ti} states underneath the {Cl} atoms are predominantly responsible for the tunneling current.

	abstract = {Scanning tunneling microscopy with atomic resolution and chemical contrast offers unique possibilities in studying segregation and chemical ordering of alloy surfaces. Chemical contrast in {STM} can have three different reasons, (a) true topographic effects, (b) different density of states of the alloy constituents, and (c) tip-sample interaction depending on the chemical identity of the atom imaged.
The composition and chemical order on surfaces is determined by an interplay of ordering and segregation. If the chemical ordering is weak, segregation is mainly determined by the differences in surface energies. On the surfaces of alloys with a strong tendency towards ordering, segregation and ordering can either compete, e.g., in cases where preserving the bulk chemical order requires the surface to assume the bulk composition, or ordering can enhance segregation, e.g. in cases where bulk ordering allows a pure-metal termination. In cases where only short-range chemical ordering occurs at the surface, the trends in surface chemical ordering were found to correspond well to the ordering tendency observed in the bulk.
We also show that the study of surface composition and chemical order is essential for understanding adsorption on alloy surface. Even weak ordering can lead to significant changes in the availability of some adsorption sites. We could also obtain {STM} images of an alloy surface with chemical contrast and images of adsorbates in the same surface area, revealing the chemical structure of adsorption sites. We could thereby demonstrate the ligand effect, i.e., the dependence of adsorption strength on the atoms neighbouring an adsorption site.},

	abstract = {Ruthenium dioxide {(RuO$_2$)} reveals unique and promising redox properties, making {RuO$_2$} a potential candidate for a versatile oxidation catalyst. Recently Zhang and Kisch reported, for instance, that {RuO$_2$} is a robust and efficient catalyst for room temperature {(RT)} oxidation of {CO} by humid air; recall that typical metal oxides do not tolerate humidity. In this contribution we present scanning tunneling microscopy {(STM)} data which directly image the catalytically important processes occurring on the {RuO$_2$(110)} surface after exposing the pristine surface to {CO} and O$_2$. These data are complemented by density functional theory {(DFT)} calculations.

The following processes are governing the catalytic activity of {RuO$_2$} on atomic scale. The reactants from the gas phase encounter strongly binding adsorption sites on the {RuO$_2$(110)} surface in the form of the under-coordinated Ru atoms. For instance, {CO} adsorbs on the stoichiometric {RuO$_2$(110)} surface by 1.2 {eV} (over the {1f-cus-Ru),} while on the reduced {RuO$_2$(110)} surface the {CO} binding energies are 1.61 {eV} and 1.85 {eV} for adsorption over {1f-cus-Ru} and {2f-cus-Ru} atoms, respectively. The {RuO$_2$} surface provides an active oxygen species to react with {CO,} i.e. the under-coordinated (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms Obr. The recombination of adsorbed {CO} with Obr creates vacancies, which are identified with {STM.} At {RT,} oxygen molecules from the gas phase can efficiently dissociate on {RuO$_2$(110)} via the molecular precursor state. This leads to weakly held {O} atoms, which are grouped in pairs as imaged with {STM.} It is argued that the weakly held oxygen plays an important role in replenishing the consumed (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms on the (partially) reduced {RuO$_2$(110)} surface.},

However, this ordering, preferred over {Ti/O/Pt} by 2.9 {eV/Ti\textendash{}O} unit, produces {\textgreater}10\% stress. This explains a complex structure, seen using {STM,} of {TiOx} bilayers encapsulating {Pt}(111) nanofacets: the energetics of stress relief is about ten times that of differences in the various possible {O/Ti/Pt(111)}-layer site occupations, thus favoring dislocation formation. A structure is found that is stable. It consists of a series of linear misfit dislocations at the relatively weak {Ti/Pt} interface that are 6/7 {Ti/Pt} rows wide. In addition, strong interactions at the {O/Ti} interface and O-layer strain also cause the {Ti/Pt} interface to abruptly change from hcp- to fcc-site {Ti}, producing linear \textquotedblleft{}canyons\textquotedblright{} {(Ti/Pt} dislocation cores occur between these stripes). Furthermore, alternating hcp- and fcc-site triangles, each with ten O-atoms, are separated by bridging {O} in an abrupt {O/Ti} misfit dislocation, thus producing a zigzag pattern. The above dislocations release strain along both the x- and y-directions in the surface plane. However, we have been unable to find a stable structure if the zigzag ends consist of {O}, but stability is found if they consist of {Ti}. Finally, reverse bias {STM} images indicate the ends might indeed different than the line portions of the zigzag features.},

We therefore explain the room-temperature results by part of the oxygen pairs remaining or becoming nearest neighbors, whereas others separate by diffusion and their oxygen atoms attach to other pairs or groups, forming the larger groups found.

Interlayer diffusion, i.e. mass transport between different terraces, is known to be an essential process for obtaining layer-by-layer growth, avoiding formation of three-dimensional {(3D)} islands when growing thin films. We present experimental results for the growth of cobalt on {Pt}(111), which demonstrate the importance of kinks and corners for interlayer diffusion. We show that {Co} grows two-dimensionally as long as strain caused by the {Pt-Co} interface keeps the step edges rough, with a high kink density, and then transforms to {3D} growth with straight steps. The results for growth with adsorbed carbon monoxide show that {CO} acts as a surfactant, causing two-dimensional growth unless heterogeneous nucleation occurs. Again, this process is related to roughening of the steps, being a new mechanism for the action of a surfactant. A scanning tunneling microscopy study at the atomic scale confirms the fact that step descent happens only at kinks and (concave) corners, and in conjunction with simulations allows us to identify some of the relevant atomic-exchange processes. We finally argue that the dependence of the growth mode on the step morphology, together with straightening of the steps by step\textendash{}step interaction, can lead to an instability of the growth mode.},

Low-energy {He}$^+$ ion scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy were additionally employed to characterize the x = 0.15 sample. The equilibrium structures developing with increasing bulk {Al} content can be consistently explained by the interplay between {Al} surface segregation and ordering processes which are controlled by atomic interactions similar to those in the bulk. These interactions divide the process of {Al} segregation to the very surface into two steps whereby {Al} atoms occupy sites of two different sublattices of c(2x2) periodicity with different probability. While one sublattice is already completely filled at low bulk {Al} concentration, the other sublattice fills only gradually with increasing bulk {Al} content. The local order in deeper layers is consistent with the bulk phase diagram.},

Upon heating to {$\approx$120$^\circ$C,} 80\% of the sulfur desorbs and the {S} 2p peak position changes from 164.3$\pm{}$0.1 to 162.5$\pm{}$0.1 {eV.} This peak shift corresponds to a change of the adsorption site to the position of the bridging oxygen atoms of {TiO$_2$(1} 1 0). Further heating causes little change in {S} coverage and {XPS} binding energies, up to a temperature of {$\approx$430$^\circ$C} where most of the {S} desorbs and the {S} 2p peak shifts back to higher binding energy. Sulfur adsorption at {150$^\circ$C,} {200$^\circ$C,} and {300$^\circ$C} leads to a rich variety of structures and adsorption sites as observed with {LEED} and {STM.} At low coverages, sulfur occupies the position of the bridging oxygen atoms. At {200$^\circ$C} these {S} atoms arrange in a (3$\times$1) superstructure. For adsorption between {300$^\circ$C} and {400$^\circ$C} a (3$\times$3) and (4$\times$1) {LEED} pattern is observed for intermediate and saturation coverage, respectively. Adsorption at elevated temperature reduces the substrate as indicated by a strong Ti3+ shoulder in the {XPS} {Ti} 2p3/2 peak, with up to 15.6\% of the total peak area for the (4$\times$1) structure. {STM} of different coverages adsorbed at {400$^\circ$C} indicates structural features consisting of two single {S} atoms placed next to each other along the [0 0 1] direction at the position of the in-plane oxygen atoms.

	abstract = {Adsorption of sulfur on {TiO2(110)} at room temperature {(RT)} and {350$^\circ$C} has been studied with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. A {TiO2(110)} (1$\times$1) surface with a small amount of oxygen vacancies was prepared by sputtering and annealing in ultrahigh vacuum. Oxygen vacancies induce a defect state that pins the Fermi level just below the conduction-band minimum. Sulfur adsorption at room temperature leads to the disappearance of this vacancy-related band-gap state, indicating that the surface oxygen vacancies are filled by sulfur. Sulfur-induced valence-band features are identified at binding energies of 3.4 and 8 {eV.} Adsorption of {S} at {350$^\circ$C} forms a (4$\times$1) superstructure at high coverages [$\approx{}$0.9 monolayer {(ML)]} that is visible with low-energy electron diffraction. In a previously proposed model for this superstructure, sulfur replaces half of the in-plane oxygen atoms and all the bridging oxygen atoms are removed. In agreement with this model, the oxygen 2s peak is decreased significantly and the defect state is increased. Two additional valence features are observed: one at 2.7 {eV} and one at 3.9 {eV.} Due to those features the band gap vanishes. In resonant photoemission, these features show a similar, but weaker, resonance profile than the vacancy-related defect state. Hybridized Ti-derived states extend across the whole valence-band region. Generally, a higher resonant photon energy is found for valence-band states with lower binding energies, indicating mainly 3p-4s transitions in the upper valence band. Adsorption of sulfur reduces the strength of the resonances.},

This chemical contrast has been confirmed by simulations with an {FLAPW} {(Full} Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Waves) ab-initio computer code based on density functional theory. By the help of this contrast between {Pt} and {Co} atoms in {STM} constant current images it is shown that in the early stages of submonolayer growth {Co} is incorporated into the {Pt} surface, thereby forming dislocation lines. We were also able to demonstrate that {Co} atoms descend from the upper terrace to the lower one by an exchange diffusion process with the {Pt} atoms at the step edges. It is shown that this interlayer diffusion does not take place at straight steps, but rather at corners or kinks. The first completed {Co} monolayer {(ML)} is almost pseudomorphic {(Co} in the {Pt} fcc lattice sites) with a high density of defects due to the lattice mismatch. The second layer exhibits a moir\'{e} structure, with the {Co} in-plane lattice distance close to that of bulk Co. The step edges which are very rough at a coverage of two monolayers become smoother with increasing {Co} deposition. The growth mode is two-dimensional (layer-by-layer) around two to three monolayers and changes afterward into three-dimensional growth (island growth). We observe that the change of the step edge morphology is also correlated to this change from {2D} to {3D} growth mode. The reason for the {2D} growth at the beginning is attributed to the strained interface between the {Co} overlayer and the {Pt}(111) surface which hinders the formation of straight steps. Therefore, many kinks and corners are formed, increasing the probability for interlayer diffusion by the above mentioned exchange process. With increasing number of layers the strain decreases, steps become smoother, interlayer diffusion decreases and therefore island growth develops. Up to the highest coverage (15 {ML)} studied the growth is characterised by a mainly twinned fcc-like stacking. Only a small amount of hcp stacking has been observed. Further experiments showed that preadsorption of carbon monoxide acts as a surfactant which extends the layer-by-layer growth up to higher {Co} coverages.},

Scanning Tunneling Microscopy {(STM)} images with atomic-scale resolution, in combination with area-averaging surface spectroscopies, is an ideal tool to study local surface defects and their relationship to surface reactivity. We report {STM} results on {TiO2(110)} surfaces which show the surprising influence of bulk defects on surface properties. The reduced crystals used in this and other surface science studies contain {Ti} interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Re-oxidation at elevated temperatures results in the growth of additional {TiO2} layers with {Ti} coming from the bulk of the crystal and {O} from the gas phase. This often result in partially incomplete surface structures with many undercoordinated atoms. The desorption behavior of elemental {S}, dosed at room temperature, depends on the reduction state of the sample. This is explained by a mechanism where desorption from a weakly-bound precursor state competes with the availability of new adsorption sites in the form of oxygen vacancies which migrate from the bulk to the surface.},

More direct evidence is given by {STM} images which exhibit parallel {Pt} and {Co} monoatomic chains a few lattice constants long and an apparent height difference of about 0.2 \AA{} for {Pt} and {Co} sites. {LEED} shows that the {Pt} sublattice in the top layer actually resides 0.1 \AA{} above the {Co} one. Otherwise the surface is bulklike, with weak relaxations of interlayer distances. The use of a chemically ordered model for the {LEED} analysis, in which sublattice occupancies are optimised, results in a remarkable improvement of the fit with experiment as compared to a totally random distribution; however, most interestingly, it does not modify the average layer concentration profile versus depth (55, 5 and 35 at\% {Pt} respectively for the three outermost layers). The distortions needed for the tetragonal L1\_0 phase with respect to the fcc L1\_2 phase explains why chemical order does not extend over larger domains. Finally, both techniques yield complementary pictures and quite consistent results as to the top layer content and chemical order.},

The measured low energy ion spectra do not only reproduce the calculated first-layer composition of the {LEED} analysis, they also show a less pronounced {Pt} segregation at temperatures around {750$^\circ$C,} and eventually a reversed {Pt} segregation above {750$^\circ$C,} i.e. {Co} enrichment of the {Pt90Co10(110)} surface with respect to the bulk concentration.

Rutile {TiO2(110)} specimens were cut from the same crystal and were heated in a furnace to different temperatures which resulted in different states of reduction (colors of the crystals). After characterization of the bulk defects with electron paramagnetic resonance {(EPR),} the specimens were studied with scanning tunneling microscopy {(STM),} low-energy {He}$^+$ ion scattering {(LEIS),} and work function measurements. {EPR} reveals that darker rutile crystals exhibit higher concentrations of extended Ti3+ related bulk defects such as crystallographic shear planes {(CSP),} with a decrease in substitutional and interstitial defects as compared to lighter crystals. Surface structures with (1 2) features are preferably formed upon {UHV} annealing on these darker crystals. {LEIS} measurements show that all of the crystals' (110) surfaces are reoxidized upon annealing in {18O2} (573 K, 1 10-6 mbar, 10 min) and that the {18O} surface content is proportional to the bulk reduction state. {UVvisible} adsorption spectra and resistivity measurements also scale with the reduction states of crystals.

Annealing in oxygen induces additional metastable structures, i.e., {TiO2} clusters on blue crystals and rosette networks on dark blue crystals.},

Evidence for a vacancy-induced lateral relaxation of the adjacent octahedral iron ions is presented. Further annealing in ultrahigh vacuum causes a transformation to either a (1$\times$n) or a The ($\surd{}$2 $\times$ {$\surd{}$2)R45$^\circ$} structure. These surfaces can be reproducibly transformed back to the The ($\surd{}$2 $\times$ {$\surd{}$2)R45$^\circ$} reconstruction by annealing in oxygen.

	abstract = {We have examined the interaction of molecular oxygen with the {TiO2(110)} surface using temperature-programmed desorption {(TPD),} isotopic labeling studies, sticking probability measurements, and electron energy loss spectroscopy {(ELS).} Molecular oxygen does not adsorb on the {TiO2(110)} surface in the temperature range between 100 and 300 K unless surface oxygen vacancy sites are present. These vacancy defects are generated by annealing the crystal at 850 K, and can be quantified reliably using water {TPD.} Adsorption of O2 at 120 K on a {TiO2(110)} surface with 8\% oxygen vacancies (about 4*10{\textasciicircum}13 sites/cm2) occurs with an initial sticking probability of 0.5-0.6 that diminishes as the surface is saturated. The saturation coverage at 120 K, as estimated by {TPD} uptake measurements, is approximately three times the surface vacancy population. Coverage-dependent {TPD} shows little or no O2 desorption below a coverage of 4*10{\textasciicircum}13 molecules/cm2 (the vacancy population), presumably due to dissociative filling of the vacancy sites in a 1:1 ratio. Above a coverage of 4*10{\textasciicircum}13 molecules/cm2, a first-order O2 {TPD} peak appears at 410 K. Oxygen molecules in this peak do not scramble oxygen atoms with either the surface or with other coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Sequential exposures of {16O2} and {18O2} at 120 K indicate that each adsorbed O2 molecule, irrespective of its adsorption sequence, has equivalent probabilities with respect to its neighbors to follow the two channels (molecular and dissociative), suggesting that O2 adsorption is not only precursor-mediated, as the sticking probability measurements indicate, but that all O2 molecules reside in this precursor state at 120 K. This precursor state may be associated with a weak 145 K O2 {TPD} state observed at high O2 exposures. {ELS} measurements suggest charge transfer from the surface to the O2 molecule based on disappearance of the vacancy loss feature at 0.8 {eV,} and the appearance of a 2.8 {eV} loss that can be assigned to an adsorbed O2- species based on comparisons with {TiO2} inorganic complexes in the literature. Utilizing results from recent spin-polarized {DFT} calculations in the literature, we propose a model where three O2 molecules are bound in the vicinity of each vacancy site at 120 K. For adsorption temperatures above 150 K, the dissociation channel completely dominates and the surface adsorbs oxygen in a 1:1 ratio with each vacancy site. {ELS} measurements indicate that the vacancies are filled, and the remaining oxygen adatom, which is apparent in {TPD,} is transparent in {ELS.} On the basis of the variety of oxygen adsorption states observed in this study, further work is needed in order to determine which oxygen-related species play important roles in chemical and photochemical oxidation processes on {TiO2} surfaces.},

As the same strong surface enrichment in {Pt} was found in a previous study on the (100) and (111) surface of the same bulk composition, this means that in contrast to {Pt-Ni} and {Pt-Co} alloys, for {Pt25Rh75} alloys the segregation behavior is not influenced extensively by the surface orientation. In addition to the structure analysis by {LEED} we performed {LEIS} experiments to determine the temperature induced changes of the surface composition and structure. Since the {Pt} segregation is less pronounced at elevated temperature, the surface reveals a temperature induced deconstruction of the (1x2) structure around {750$^\circ$C,} resulting in an fcc(110) (1x1) surface at high temperature. Temperature dependent measurements further show a hysteresis-like behavior of the top-layer composition, which is attributed to an enhanced {Pt} segregation on the (1x2) reconstructed surface.},

	abstract = {Chemical information with spatial atomic resolution on multicomponent surfaces (especially alloys) can be achieved by {STM} (scanning tunnelling microscopy) with constant current imaging. Therefore {STM} can not only be used for determination of the crystallographic structure of single crystal surfaces but also for finding the chemical composition of bimetallic surfaces. This possibility makes the {STM} a unique instrument to find out the local chemical structure of multicomponent surfaces on an atomic scale. This ability can be used for studying in great detail segregation processes on metal surfaces. Examples of chemical discrimination between different metals on low index single crystal surfaces of bulk alloys we have seen so far are {PtNi,} {PtRh,} {PtCo,} {PtAu} and {AgPd.} For surfaces where the identification of the alloy constituents in the {STM} images is ambiguous (e.g., because of unknown or equal concentrations), it will be shown how ab initio calculations of the electron density of states using the {FLAPW} (full potential linearized augmented plane waves) method can help to interpret constant current {STM} topographs just by following the simple theory of {Tersoff-Hamann.} On the other hand, tip changes (e.g., adsorbates) can strongly influence the chemical contrast on constant current {STM} images.},

The {Pt} concentration grows continuously on {Pt25Rh75(111)} until {1000$^\circ$C,} whereas it reaches a maximum enrichment around {500$^\circ$C} on {Pt25Rh75(100)} and decreases thereafter. This contrasting behavior results solely from the kinetic limitation in the low-temperature regime, and is not due to energetic reasons. From temperature-dependent composition profiles we determine the segregation kinetics as well as the annealing temperature necessary for thermodynamic equilibration. We find that an equilibrium is acquired on the {Pt25Rh75(100)} surface by the interchange of {Pt} and {Rh} atoms within the near-surface layers, and on the {Pt25Rh75(111)} surface by a diffusion of {Pt} atoms from bulk to the near-surface region. The latter leads to an overall {Pt} enrichment of several layers, and is only observed after annealing at {1100$^\circ$C.} The presence of carbon contamination on the {Pt25Rh75(100)} surface causes a significant reduction of the {Pt} segregation.

For a limited coverage range from 1.5 to 3.0 {ML} and an annealing temperature of 800 K, a spatial self-organization takes place on the bimetallic surface, forming a highly ordered hexagonal superstructure. The scanning tunnel microscope contrast of the superstructure is sensitive to the bias voltage, resulting in different patterns: either a mosaic structure and/or a network consisting of one-atom-wide lines. Relative to the {Pt}(111) surface, the superstructure has a {($\surd{}$39$\times$$\surd{}$39)R16.1$^\circ$} unit cell with a dimension of 17.3 \AA{}.

	abstract = {The rutile {TiO2(110)} (1x1) surface is considered the prototypical 'well-defined' system in the surface science of metal oxides. Its popularity results partly from two experimental advantages: (i) bulk-reduced single crystals do not exhibit charging, and (ii) stoichiometric surfaces, as judged by electron spectroscopies, can be prepared reproducibly by sputtering and annealing in oxygen. We present results that show that this commonly applied preparation procedure may result in a surface structure that is by far more complex than generally anticipated. Flat, (1x1)-terminated surfaces are obtained by sputtering and annealing in ultrahigh vacuum. When re-annealed in oxygen at moderate temperatures (470-660 K), irregular networks of partially connected, pseudohexagonal rosettes (6.5x6 \AA{} wide), one-unit cell wide strands, and small ($\approx{}$tens of \AA{}) (1x1) islands appear. This new surface phase is formed through reaction of oxygen gas with interstitial {Ti} from the reduced bulk. Because it consists of an incomplete, kinetically limited (1x1) layer, this phenomenon has been termed 'restructuring'. We report a combined experimental and theoretical study that systematically explores this restructuring process. The influence of several parameters (annealing time, temperature, pressure, sample history, gas) on the surface morphology is investigated using {STM.} The surface coverage of the added phase as well as the kinetics of the restructuring process are quantified by {LEIS} and {SSIMS} measurements in combination with annealing in {18O-enriched} gas. Atomic models of the essential structural elements are presented and are shown to be stable with first-principles density functional calculations. The effect of oxygen-induced restructuring on surface chemistry and its importance for {TiO2} and other bulk-reduced oxide materials is briefly discussed.},

We present a {LEED} {I(E)} analysis of {Pt25Rh75(100)} confirming the shifted-row model and find that oxygen resides in threefold-coordinated sites on both sides of the shifted rows. The adsorbate occupies those of the threefold-coordinated sites that are directly separated by the metal atom in the shifted row. Further {I(E)} calculations exclude the alternative threefold-coordinated adsorption site beside the shifted row as well as the fourfold-coordinated site symmetrically in between the shifted rows. We achieve a Pendry R-factor of 0.14 for the best-fit structure. Oxygen has equal bond lengths to its three metal neighbours, amounting to 1.95 \AA{}. The first substrate layer relaxes outward by 8.8\% of the bulk value to 2.08 \AA{}, but we do not observe any significant relaxations of deeper layer spacings. The shifted rows pop out of the surface by 0.38 \AA{}. After determination of the oxygen adsorption site with {LEED,} we examine local adsorption structures on {Pt25Rh75(100)} at low oxygen coverage with {STM.} We resolve the shifted rows in real-space, and for special tip conditions, we find maxima of apparent height at in-plane positions that coincide with the oxygen position as established by quantitative {LEED.} We determine chemical-composition depth-profiles by quantitative {LEED} for three surface preparations occurring during sample preparation. While the first substrate layer of clean and annealed {Pt25Rh75(100)} is enriched in {Pt} (76\%) as compared to the bulk value (25\%), that in {p(3$\times$1)-O/Pt25Rh75(100)} is enriched in {Rh} (90\%). Oxygen adsorption at a moderate temperature {(600$^\circ$C)} and formation of the p(3$\times$1) structure reverse segregation on {Pt25Rh75(100).} Finally, oxygen can be removed at room temperature by exposure of the surface to hydrogen.

	abstract = {Annealing {TiO2(110)} in vacuum at high temperature (above about 800 K) generates oxygen vacancy sites that are associated with reduced surface cations. Numerous studies have shown that these sites can be oxidized by exposure to molecular oxygen, but the mechanism and temperature dependence of this oxidation process are not well understood. We present results that suggest low temperature ({\textless}600 K) O2 exposure oxidizes oxygen vacancies but also leaves oxygen-containing species on the surface that we propose are oxygen adatoms. The presence of these oxygen adatoms is evident in the temperature-programmed desorption {(TPD)} spectrum of water. Oxidizing the vacuum annealed surface at 700 K produces a fully oxidized {TiO2(110)} surface that gives a single monolayer {TPD} state for water at 270 K. Exposing the vacuum annealed surface to O2 at temperatures between 90 and 600 K followed by water adsorption at 90 K results in a new water {TPD} state 25 K higher in temperature. Similar results were obtained using ammonia instead of water. Isotopic labeling experiments, in which the vacuum annealed surface was dosed with at 135 K followed by at 135 K, indicate that the new water {TPD} state results from recombinative desorption, whereas no such effect is observed for the surface exposed to at 700 K. The effect on water is also absent in {TPD} if the low temperature O2 treated surface is heated to 600 K prior to water adsorption at 90 K, suggesting that the oxygen adatoms desorb from the surface or diffuse into the bulk. We propose that at low temperatures, O2 dissociates at oxygen vacancies filling each defect site with one {O} atom and depositing a second {O} adatom at a five-coordinate Ti4+ site or that O2 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups resulting in O2 dissociation and the presence of the {O} adatom. The new dissociative water chemistry results from the interaction of water molecules with these oxygen adatoms. After high temperature ({\textgreater}600 K) O2 exposure, no dissociative water chemistry is observed, suggesting that these oxygen adatoms are not present on the surface. The presence of surface {O} adatoms may explain inconsistencies in the literature regarding the reactivity of water, and potentially other species, on {TiO2(110).} These results also detail the importance of sample preparation techniques on the chemistry which can occur at a solid surface.},

The surface was prepared by sputtering and annealing in an ultrahigh vacuum {(UHV).} After annealing to 1100 K in {UHV,} a (1$\times$1) surface with a terrace width of $\approx$100 \AA{} is obtained. The terraces are separated by monoatomic step edges running predominantly parallel to {\textless}001{\textgreater} and type directions. Approximately half of the {\textless}001{\textgreater}-type steps have a kinked appearance that is attributed to a (4$\times$1)-reconstructed step edge. Atomic models for autocompensated step edges are presented. Oxygen vacancies (point defects) in the bridging oxygen rows are created by the high-temperature anneal in {UHV.} In {STM} images, these oxygen vacancies appear as bright features centered on dark rows. Their density is 7$\pm{}$3\% per surface unit cell and is reduced upon exposure to molecular oxygen at room temperature. Dark features on bright rows are also seen; these are not affected by molecular oxygen and are tentatively assigned to subsurface defects. Hydroxyl groups from spurious water in the oxygen gas stream are observed to adsorb dissociatively at step edges and on the in-plane {Ti} rows on the terraces. The appearance of the surface oxygen vacancies depends on the state of the {STM} tip; asymmetric tips skew the appearance of the point defects and may even render images where they are invisible. Tip changes occur frequently, especially when the surface has been exposed to oxygen, and may lead to images that are hard to interpret. The "normal" tip state where the vacancies appear as bright spots connecting bright rows can be regained reproducibly by scanning with a high (up to +10 V) tip voltage; the tip is then possibly covered with substrate material. The oxygen vacancies show strong interactions with the {STM} tip, i.e. tip-induced oxidation and mobility. These interactions depend strongly on the state of the tip, and are enhanced by the presence of oxygen in the ambient. A model for the tip-induced oxidation is presented where oxygen atoms hop between the tip and sample to explain these effects.},

Comparison of the photoemission valence band spectra with the calculated density of states indicates that the {CrOx} initially grows in a cubic spinel {Cr3O4} structure. Beyond $\approx$ 0.2 monolayers, the metallic behavior of the {CrOx} overlayer begins a transformation to an insulating state. The measured valence emission for the p(2 $\times$ 2) phase beyond $\approx$ 0.2 monolayers is more consistent with either a {gamma-Cr2O3(111)} overlayer or possibly a reconstructed {Cr2O3(0001)} overlayer.},

We achieved a Pendry R-factor of 0.16 for the best-fit structure. Nitrogen resides at a vertical distance of 0.36 \AA{} above the first chromium layer. The interlayer spacing between the first and the second chromium layer is expanded to 1.55 \AA{} (7.5\% with respect to the bulk value of 1.44 \AA{}). The interlayer spacing between the second and the third layer is contracted to 1.41 \AA{}. The second chromium layer is buckled (0.13 \AA{}). The second-layer chromium atom beneath a nitrogen atom resides deeper in the bulk.

At 300 K, {H$_2$S} completely decomposes on polycrystalline chromium producing a chemisorbed layer of {S} that attenuates the {Cr} 3d valence features. No evidence was found for the formation of {CrSx} species. The dissociation of {H$_2$S} on {Cr3O4} and {Cr2O3} films at room temperature produces a decrease of 0.3\textendash{}0.8 {eV} in the work function of the surface and significant binding-energy shifts (0.2\textendash{}0.6 {eV)} in the {Cr} 3p core levels and {Cr} 3d features in the valence region. The rate of dissociation of {H$_2$S} increases following the sequence: {Cr2O3{\textless}Cr3O4{\textless}Cr.} For chromium, the density of states near the Fermi level is large, and these states offer a better match in energy for electron acceptor or donor interactions with the frontier orbitals of {H$_2$S} than the valence and conduction bands of the chromium oxides. This leads to a large dissociation probability for {H$_2$S} on the metal, and a low dissociation probability for the molecule on the oxides. In the case of {Cr3O4} and {Cr2O3,} there is a correlation between the size of the band gap in the oxide and its reactivity toward {H$_2$S.} The uptake of sulfur by the oxides significantly increases when they are "promoted" with gold. The {Au/Cr2O3} surfaces exhibit a unique electronic structure in the valence region and a larger ability to dissociate {H$_2$S} than polycrystalline Au or pure {Cr2O3.} The results of ab initio {SCF} calculations for the adsorption of {H$_2$S} on {AuCr4O6} and {AuCr10O15} clusters show a shift of electrons from the gold toward the oxide unit that enhances the strength of the {Au(6s){\textless}--{\textgreater}H$_2$S(5a1,2b1)} bonding interactions and facilitates the decomposition of the molecule.},

This was revealed by atomically resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy {(STM).} From low energy ion scattering measurements it becomes clear that the formation of the pseudo hexagonal structure leads to strong amplification of {Pt} segregation. Chemically resolved {STM} on the atomic scale shows that {Pt} prefers the highly coordinated four-fold hollow sites in the pseudo hexagonal structures and {Ni} is pushed into nearly on-top or bridge sites. Therefore the strong tendency of {Pt} to increase its coordination is proposed as the driving force of the reconstructions.

The apparent composition and stability of these surface alloys are dependent upon the amount of {Cr} deposited initially.

The onset of this effect was clearly seen by {STM} at room temperature for samples raised above 400\textendash{}430 {$^\circ$C.} It appears that the annealing process causes the migration of {Mg} from the substrate entirely through the {Fe3O4} lattice, and that the migration tends to fill the surface layer first, with lower layers filling as anneal time is increased. Upon detection of this effect, several complementary sample analysis techniques were employed to determine the extent of the changes observed. X-ray diffraction studies indicate shifts in the lattice constant from the cubic constant of magnetite, {Fe3O4,} (8.396 \AA{}), which is already strained in thin-film growth on a substrate, further toward the cubic lattice constant of magnesioferrite, {MgFe2O4,} (8.375 \AA{}) in order to accommodate the {Mg} that has migrated to the surface. Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry studies reveal a significant change in the magnetic behavior of the film and large decreases in the saturation moment, remanence, and coercive field. The Verwey transition is greatly altered in these films after the annealing sequence. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of the films confirm the presence of magnesium in the uppermost layers of the film, and indicate a concentration gradient, with the highest concentrations of magnesium in the surface layer. X-ray fluorescence in scanning electron microscopy qualitatively indicate the presence of magnesium throughout the film, consistent with migration of the magnesium from the substrate. These results are compared with those on an unannealed {Fe3O4} film of the same thickness and growth parameters, which shows no magnesium migration into the film during growth up to substrate temperatures of 300 {$^\circ$C.}},

The films were grown by {Cr} vapor deposition under an oxygen background pressure of 2 $\times$ 10-6 mbar and a sample temperature of 600 K. The growth, structure and thermal properties of the resulting overlayers have been studied using a combination of {ISS,} {XPS,} {LEED} and {STM.} During the initial stage of growth, the film nucleates at {Pt} step edges, and grows in a step-flow mode. For the first two monolayers, a well-ordered p(2 $\times$ 2) structure is observed and attributed to the epitaxial growth of metastable {Cr3O4.} At higher coverage, a ([radical sign]3 $\times$ [radical {sign]3)R30$^\circ$} structure appears, due to the formation of the stable {Cr2O3} phase. After heating in vacuum to about 700 K, the p(2 $\times$ 2) film begins to decompose and agglomerate, and finally becomes a ([radical sign]3 $\times$ [radical {sign]3)R30$^\circ$} overlayer. The latter is stable up to the highest temperature used in these studies (1000 K), although at this temperature it also shows dewetting and further clustering.},

Only for alkali halides {(LiF,} {NaCl)} and to some extent for {SiO2} potential sputtering (enhancement of the sputter yield with increasing charge state of the primary ion) has been observed. All other targets showed normal collision induced sputtering. From that result it is obvious that the mechanisms for sputtering can not be explained by the Coulomb explosion model, because in this model insulators like {MgO} and semiconductors like Si and {GaAs} should also show charge state dependence of the sputtering yield. Alkali halides and {SiO2} are materials which are known for strong electron phonon coupling where electronic excitations in the valence band are localized by formation of self trapped excitons {(STE)} and/or self trapped holes {(STH).} During bombardment with highly charged ions the neutralization process in front of, at and below the surface causes the formation of {STE} and/or {STH.} Therefore the potential sputtering can be explained as a defect mediated sputtering process which is well known in electron stimulated desorption {(ESD)} where the decay of {STH} and/or {STE} into different colour centers leads at the end to the desorption of neutralized anions. The also created neutral cations are either evaporated (as it is the case for the alkali halides) or have to be removed by momentum transfer by the impinging projectiles. Therefore it is very likely that in the case of {SiO2} for very low impact energy mainly only oxygen is enhanced sputtered, the surface is enriched in Si and the potential sputtering effect decreases with increasing ion dose.},

Because {Ti} is highly reactive  towards oxygen, titanium oxides are formed readily when {Ti} is  exposed to an atmosphere containing water or oxygen. The oxidation behavior of the metal is of interest for the properties of protective coatings. Although accurate knowledge of the {XPS} binding energies of different oxidation states is necessary for {XPS} investigations of titanium oxides, a recent review of the 16 literature data of the binding energy of {Ti} 2p3/2 from Ti4 +  showed wide scatter of the reported values with a mean of 458.7 {eV} and a standard deviation of 1.3 {eV} {[J.} Mayer, E.

Scanning tunneling microscopy results obtained in the strain field of dislocations on {PtxNi1-x(110)} surfaces show a (2$\times$1) superstructure of alternating {Pt} and {Ni} atoms in some regions close to the dislocation core. In other regions, the apparent height of all surface atoms is equal, in agreement with low energy ion scattering results yielding a surface concentration of almost 100\% Ni. This indicates that the strain present in the vicinity of dislocations influences both the surface composition and chemical order. The experimental results are compared to simulation calculations of chemical ordering and segregation, using embedded atom method potentials and linear elasticity theory. The simulations indicate that the (2$\times$1) superstructure is due to an L10 ordered phase in regions where the tetragonal distortion of the L10 phase with respect to the cubic substrate can alleviate stress. It is argued that this dislocation-induced ordering can immobilize dislocations.},

All three superstructures are formed by substitution of every nth row of {Cu} atoms (n=4, 5, and 9) in the [001] direction by {Pb} atoms. The {Pb} atoms in between are lined up in the [1\textasciimacron{}10] direction. The p(4$\times$1) structure appears in two different modifications: one with substitutional rows of {Pb} atoms and one with a simple overlayer structure without substituted rows of {Cu} atoms. Alternating succession of these two modifications results in p(12$\times$1) domains. It is further shown that the p(9$\times$1) structure is not a succession of p(4$\times$1) and p(5$\times$1) but a superstructure on its own. The p(5$\times$1) structure proposed here agrees with previous x-ray-diffraction data at least as well as the quasihexagonal model proposed earlier. We have, in addition, identified the nature of the phase that has been described incommensurate obtained by desorption of {Pb} upon annealing above 600 K.},

Si substitutes surface {Fe} atoms on both faces and forms ordered surface alloys, whereas {P} occupies hollow sites on the surface.

The (110) surface, on the other hand, is characterized by a c(1 $\times$ 3) Si superstructure. Due to the anisotropy of this surface the {P/Si} exchange proceeds by the formation of silicon coverage decreasing domain boundaries within the silicon structure, which are simultaneously occupied by {P} atoms.

The electronic and geometric structure, growth mode, interface formation, and thermal stability of metal films are discussed. The strength of the oxidation/reduction reaction at the interface, the wetting ability and the tendency to form a disordered layer are all related to the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen.

A comparison between bulk acoustic wave {(BAW)} and surface acoustic wave {(SAW)} resonators with respect to their primary sensitivity functions and principal capabilities for sensor applications is given and the importance of recent investigations on Lamb wave and horizontal polarized shear wave {(HPLW)} interdigital transducer {(IDT)} resonators is acknowledged. The importance of mode purity for high dynamic range sensors based on resonators and some aspects of the demand on specialized electronics are emphasized.

Near the expected saturation coverage a substitutional {c(1$\times$3)Si} superstructure weakly disordered by $langle$110$rangle$ aligned domain boundaries was observed. Their arrangement is equivalent to the incommensurate domain-wall structures of chemisorption systems like {H/Fe(110),} which allow a continuous increase of the surface coverage by successive insertion of equidistantly arranged heavy domain walls. Our observations suggest a possible increase of the silicon coverage above the 33.3\% of the perfect c(1$\times$3) structure at least up to 40\% corresponding to a {c(1$\times$5)Si} commensurate domain-wall structure. Correlation analysis of the disordered phase at 15\% coverage, obtained by short annealing, allows a qualitative determination of the interaction forces among individual silicon atoms on the surface, yielding attraction of third-nearest neighbors and repulsion of nearest neighbors.},

Therefore, one must find the solution of an inverse problem, which is done by minimizing the mean square deviation between the measured and the reconstructed image using entropy as a regularization functional. This nonlinear method is shown to be superior to linear filters such as the Wiener filter in that the solution carries as minimal information as is necessary to fit the data and is not constrained to low frequencies. On metals, where atomically resolved {STM} images show mainly geometrical information, the centers of mass of the resulting peaks are taken as the atomic positions which are compared to those estimated visually from the {STM} images.

	abstract = {The adsorption, desorption and decomposition of {PH3,} {PF3} and {PCl3} on Ru(0001) have been studied by soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {(SXPS)} using synchrotron radiation. Due to large chemical shifts in the {P} 2p core levels, different phosphorus containing surface species can be identified. We find that {PF3} adsorbs molecularly on Ru(0001) at 80 and 300 K. At 80 K, {PH3} saturates the surface with one layer of atomic hydrogen, elemental phosphorus, subhydride (i.e., {PHx} (0 {\textless} x {\textless} 3)) and {PH3,} with a total phosphorus coverage of 0.4 {ML.} At 300 K, {PH3} decomposes into atomic hydrogen and elemental phosphorus with a phosphorus coverage of 0.8 {ML.} At 80 K, {PCl3} adsorbs dissociatively into atomic chlorine, elemental phosphorus, {PCl} and possibly {PCl2} and {PCl3} in the first monolayer. Formation of multilayers of {PCl3} is observed at 80 K. At 300 K, {PCl3} adsorbs dissociatively as atomic chlorine and elemental phosphorus with a saturation phosphorus coverage of 0.1 {ML.} The variation in total phosphorus uptake at 300 K from {PX3} {(X} = {H}, {F} and {Cl)} adsorption is a result of competition between site blocking by dissociation fragments and displacement reactions. Annealing surfaces with adsorbed phosphorus to 1000 K results in formation of {RuzP} ( z = 1 or 2), which is manifested by the chemical shifts in the P2p core level, as well as the {P} {LVV} Auger transition. The recombination of adsorbed phosphorus and adsorbed X (x = {H}, {F} and {Cl)} from decomposition is also observed, but is a minor reaction channel on the surface. Thermochemical data are used to analyze the different stabilities of {PX3} at 300 K, namely, {PF3} adsorbs molecularly and {PH3} and {PCl3} dissociate completely. First, we compare the heat of molecular adsorption and the heat of dissociative adsorption of {PX3} on Ru(0001), using an enthalpy approach, and find results consistent with experimental observations. Second, we compare the total bond energy difference between molecular adsorption and complete dissociation of {PX3} on Ru(0001). In particular, we apply Shustorovich's bond-order {conservation-Morse} potential {(BOC-MP)} method to estimate the heat of adsorption for {PH3} and {PCl3} and the bond energies of the relaxed {P-X} bonds of the adsorbed {PX3} on the surface. The bond strength difference among the relaxed {P-X} bonds (i.e., the relaxed {P-F} bond () is much stronger than either the relaxed {P-H} bond () or the relaxed {P-Cl} bond ()) suggests that {PF3} is more stable than {PH3} and {PCl3} on Ru(0001) at 300 K. These values are used to evaluate the total bond energy differences between molecular adsorption and complete dissociation for each of the {PX3,} and the results agree with the experimental trends.},

	abstract = {The influence of the potential energy of singly and doubly charged rare gas ions (of {He}, {Ne}, {Ar} and {Kr}) on desorption, sputtering and secondary ion formation process has been studied. By using very low impact energy (10 - 500 {eV),} the dependence of particle emission from metals and insulators on the charge state of the primary ions can be demonstrated. The measurements have been performed using a {CO} covered Ni(111) surface and a {LiF(100)} singly crystal or {LiF} thin film, respectively.

For sputtering of the {CO} covered metal surface, the positive secondary ion yields {({Ni}+} and {CO+)} are slightly higher when using doubly charged rare gas ions instead of singly charged, but only at impact energies below 200 {eV.} No dependence of the primary ions charge state on the sputtering yields of neutrals was observed. The enhancement in the secondary ion yield is explained by sputtering and simultaneous charge exchange in a close collision between a primary ion and a target particle.

Sputtering of the {LiF} surface with low energetic rare gas ions has been studied as an example for an insulator surface. Extensive experiments have been performed to exclude effects caused by charging up of the surface during ion bombardment; it was found that the best method for charge neutralization was to heat the {LiF} samples up to {400$^\circ$C.}

For ejection of {Li}+ and F- only a small influence of the charge state of the projectile has been observed at impact energies below 100 {eV} whereas at higher energy no effect was seen. In contrast to this it has been shown, that the sputtering of {F}+ strongly increases with the potential energy of the projectile. However, the {F}+ yield also depends on the primary energy of the projectile and a threshold energy for {F}+ emission is observed. This indicates that the potential energy of the incident particle alone is not sufficient for {F}+ emission; a certain momentum transfer is necessary for sputtering. The observed behaviour can be explained by a combination of an Auger neutralization event followed by a collisional process. {F}+ is formed by Auger neutralization between the lattice F- ion and the incoming projectile provided that the potential energy of the projectile exceeds at least two times the energy of the band gap of the {LiF} surface. The so formed {F}+ ion is in a weakly bound state and will be sputtered by the incoming projectile.},

The combination of low energy ion scattering {(LEIS)} and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {(XPS)} enables us to study quantitatively the growth of reactive metal films on metal oxides, and the chemical interactions at the interface. Ultrathin {Cr} films grow initially in a quasi-two-dimensional fashion at room temperature. Changes in oxidation states of both {Ti} and {Cr} during film formation suggest that strong chemical interactions at the interface are of great importance in the growth of reactive metal films. {Cr} "wets" the surface more effectively at 300 K than ultrathin films of less reactive metals, {Fe} and {Cu}. This suggests that a relation exists between the metal reactivity with oxygen and the wetting of metal films on oxides: The more reactive the metal towards oxygen, the better is the wetting ability. The chemical interaction is accompanied by charge transfer at the interface, causing a reduction of the surface work function. The interfacial interaction also causes the interfacial {Cr} layer to behave differently from the top metallic {Cr} atoms upon thermal annealing. The top layers of metallic {Cr} show a strong clustering tendency at {500$^\circ$C,} while the interfacial {Cr} seems to have less surface mobility and slow bulk diffusion.},

Our measurements clearly show that {Volmer-Weber} growth (formation of three-dimensional crystallites) occurs even at sample temperatures as low as 160 K. Defects created by sputtering the substrate prior to {Cu} deposition do not influence the subsequent growth of the {Cu} films. The clusters are oriented with their (111) orientation parallel to the surface as confirmed by {LEED.} During low-temperature annealing, a coarsening of the crystallites takes place. The size of the clusters and the coverage have been modeled using simple assumptions about their shape. An average thickness of approximately 10 \AA{} is needed to cover half of the sample with {Cu}. The growth mode can be attributed to a very weak interaction between {Cu} and the substrate.},

Contrary to common belief, two-stage spring systems with eddy-current damping for the upper stage only are superior to similar systems with eddy-current damping of both stages.
Plate stacks with elastomer elements yield good amplitude reduction at high frequencies, while vibrations in the 10-100 Hz range may be even enhanced. Several stacks with different arrangements of masses and spring constants are compared, and it is shown that stacks should have only few (2 or 3) plates. For optimum performance it is necessary to combine the plate stack inside the vacuum chamber with soft (pneumatic or spring) suspension of the whole chamber.},

These processes take place several \AA{}ngstr\"{o}ms in front of the surface. (2) The initial repulsive forces between the {F}+ ion and the surface are changed into attractive ones within a very short time by rearrangement of the alkali halide lattice [2]. (3) The neutralized projectile sputters the {F}+ as in a normal sputtering event on a surface with low surface binding energy, and {F}+ can he emitted as long as the kinetic energy of the projectile is sufficiently high.},

However, for {He}$^+$ below 100 {eV} impact energy, a drastic decrease for the {F}+ yield was observe-which indicates that {F}+ emission cannot be due to a pure electronic effect.

The anharmonic spectrum  of the crystals is used to find a formula by which the eigenfrequency of the corresponding infinite plate can be determined from measured frequencies of planoconvex crystals. If this correction  is applied to experimental frequency spectra of composite quartz-film resonators, excellent agreement with the one-dimensional model is found. As theoretically predicted, also even harmonic overtones of heavily loaded crystals can be excited electrically. The vibration patterns are examined with an ultrasensitive laser-speckle technique. The measurements of the odd harmonic overtones  agree well with the theory of energy trapping in planoconvex  quartz crystals. An increase of the crystal's active area with  increasing mass load is observed. The even overtones frequently exhibit no such energy trapping; in these cases, unusual vibration patterns occur.},

	abstract = {The determination of cross-sections for desorption fo {CO} adsorbed on a Ni(111) single crystal induced by argon ion bombardment is discussed. Experimental results are given for ions with kinetic energies ranging from 10 to 600 {eV.} The desorption cross-sections and the fractions of neutrals and ions desorbed from the surface were measured by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. In addition, the influence of the charge state of the impinging ion on the desorption cross-section has been studied.},

	doi = {10.1016/0040-6090(89)90907-3},
	abstract = {The sensor function of high-accuracy quartz crystal thin film thickness monitors is determined by the properties of the unloaded crystal and the acoustic impedance {zF} of the film material. This material constant {zF} is often not precisely known, but it can be determined by the introduced two-frequency or {Auto-Z-Match\textregistered{}} technique which uses the frequencies of two different quasiharmonic modes of the crystal. In comparison with standard crystal thickness measurement techniques as well as with atomic absorption spectrometry and the conventional microbalance, the superiority of the {Auto-Z-Match\textregistered{}} technique is demonstrated for the evaporation materials copper, titanium, aluminium and lead. As the two-frequency technique allows the determination of the effective acoustic impedance of the film and thus thickness, determinations with higher accuracy are possible in the case of poorly known or unknown z-values. Other contributions to the practical performance and accuracy of quartz crystal thin film thickness monitors, such as the influence of crystal temperature, thin films stresses and the relaxation phenomenon, as well as the occurrence of frequency jumps, are discussed on the basis of the most recent research results.},

	abstract = {We report on angle resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy {(EELS)} in reflection mode with low primary energy on a graphite single crystal. Measurements with primary electron energy of 175 {eV} have been performed in {off-Bragg-reflex} geometry in two different directions within the (0001) surface plane of the graphite single crystal. In addition, {EELS} measurements in specular reflection mode with different primary energies and angles of incidence were done in order to distinguish between surface and bulk plasmon losses. The energy losses and the transferred momenta of the losses have been analyzed. The results are compared with the loss functions for bulk and surface excitations calculated from the dielectric function [epsilon]([omega],q) obtained from {TEELS-data} {(EELS} in transmission mode) {[Springer} Tracts Mod. Phys. 54 (1970) 77].},
