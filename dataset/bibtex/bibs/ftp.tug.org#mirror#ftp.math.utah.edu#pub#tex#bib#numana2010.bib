                 in numerical analysis for more specialized topics, such
                 as finite element theory, advanced numerical linear
                 algebra, and optimization. It prepares graduate
                 students for taking doctoral examinations in numerical
                 analysis. The text covers the main areas of
                 introductory numerical analysis, including the solution
                 of nonlinear equations, numerical linear algebra,
                 ordinary differential equations, approximation theory,
                 numerical integration, and boundary value problems.
                 Focusing on interval computing in numerical analysis,
                 it explains interval arithmetic, interval computation,
                 and interval algorithms. The authors illustrate the
                 concepts with many examples as well as analytical and
                 computational exercises at the end of each chapter.
                 This advanced, graduate-level introduction to the
                 theory and methods of numerical analysis supplies the
                 necessary background in numerical methods so that
                 students can apply the techniques and understand the

                 this book, available computer power has increased
                 greatly. Today, scientific computing is playing an ever
                 more prominent role as a tool in scientific discovery
                 and engineering analysis. In this second edition, the
                 key addition is an introduction to the finite element
                 method. This is a widely used technique for solving
                 partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex
                 domains. This text introduces numerical methods and
                 shows how to develop, analyze, and use them. Complete
                 MATLAB programs for all the worked examples are now
                 available at www.cambridge.org/Moin, and more than 30
                 exercises have been added. This thorough and practical
                 book is intended as a first course in numerical
                 analysis, primarily for new graduate students in
                 engineering and physical science. Along with mastering
                 the fundamentals of numerical methods, students will
                 learn to write their own computer programs using
                 standard numerical methods.",

                 the problem of matrix eigenvalue computation from
                 difficult to routine almost overnight about fifty years
                 ago. It was named one of the top ten algorithms of the
                 twentieth century by Dongarra and Sullivan, and it
                 deserves to be more widely known and understood by the
                 general mathematical community. This article provides
                 an efficient introduction to Francis's algorithm that
                 follows a novel path. Efficiency is gained by omitting
                 the traditional but wholly unnecessary detour through
                 the basic QR algorithm. A brief history of the
                 algorithm is also included. It was not a one-man show;
                 some other important names are Rutishauser, Wilkinson,
                 and Kublanovskaya. Francis was never a specialist in
                 matrix computations. He was employed in the early
                 computer industry, spent some time on the problem of
                 eigenvalue computation and did amazing work, and then
                 moved on to other things. He never looked back, and he
                 remained unaware of the huge impact of his work until
                 many years later.",
