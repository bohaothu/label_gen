abstract = { In an effort to transform the position of a QWERTY keyboard to the rear of a tablet PC, this paper investigates the usability of a system called RearType. The idea is to allow for more screen real estate without forcing users to use on-screen keyboards by rotating and moving the keyboard to the back of the tablet. The research involves both developing a prototype system, as well as a thorough study of how well users can familiarize themselves with the RearType system. The paper concludes that while, the average WPM is still not statistically different from the touchscreen, that there are still benefits to the RearType system.},

 abstract = { This paper studies the relevance of mobile device services to a user based on their current real world experience. Measuring and recording which service icons on a mobile device are being arranged during a particular event, for example a trip to the airport, provides insight into how to better develop adaptive menus. The authors develop a prototype suite of software which includes a back-end server and mobile device software which learns about the users actions. After learning the system can easily and automatically adapt the users menu screen when a similar (or the same) event occurs in the future. The paper largely focuses on how a human interacts with the icons on his/her screen.},
