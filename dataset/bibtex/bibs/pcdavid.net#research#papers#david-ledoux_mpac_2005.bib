  abstract      = {We present WildCAT, an extensible Java framework to ease
                  the creation of context-aware applications. WildCAT
                  provides a simple yet powerful dynamic model to represent
                  an application's execution context. The context information
                  can be accessed by application programmers through two
                  complimentary interfaces: synchronous requests (pull mode)
                  and asynchronous notifications (push mode). Internally,
                  WildCAT is designed to support different kinds of
                  extensions, from the simple configuration of the default
                  generic implementation to completely new implementations
                  tailored to specific needs. A given application can mix
                  different implementations for different aspects of its
                  context while only depending on WildCAT simple and unified
                  API.}
