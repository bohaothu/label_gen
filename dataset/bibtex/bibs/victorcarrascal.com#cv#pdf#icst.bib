	abstract = {In recent years the growing proliferation of small wireless devices able to maintain wireless communications using IEEE 802.11 technologies has enabled the deployment of MANETs (Mobile Ad Hoc Networks). This fact has stimulated the demands of multimedia services over this type of networks, such as video-streaming services. Providing QoS in this environment is a challenging task due to the inherent dynamic characteristics of these networks. In this paper we propose a-MMDSR (adaptable-Multipath Multimedia Dynamic Source Routing), a dynamic framework which improves the user perceived quality for video streaming services. We have perfected our previous approach s-MMDSR (static-MMDSR), a multipath routing protocol based on DSR which works simultaneously with a cross-layer algorithm. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the performance of our proposal framework outperforms DSR and s-MMDSR.},
