@inproceedings{barber.01,
	Abstract = {Agents in a multi-agent system must coordinate to achieve their 
goals, in general.  Establishing an organizational structure that 
specifies how agents in the system should work together helps 
multi-agent systems achieve effective coordination.  Among other 
things, an organizational structure specifies agent decision- 
making frameworks.  A decision-making framework identifies the 
locus of decision-making control for a given goal and the 
authority of decision-makers to assign subtasks in order to achieve 
that goal.  Agents may participate in different decision-making 
frameworks for each goal they pursue.  Agents who implement the 
capability of Adaptive Decision-Making Frameworks (ADMF) are 
able to dynamically modify their decision-making frameworks at 
run-time to best meet the needs of their current situation.  
Through ADMF, agents are able to reorganize decision-making 
groups by dynamically changing (1) who makes the decisions for 
a particular goal and (2) who must carry out these decisions.  This 
paper presents experiments exploring the following hypothesis:  
Multi-agent systems that implement ADMF can perform better 
and more robustly across run-time changes in situation than 
systems that maintain static decision-making frameworks.  
Experimental results show that no one decision-making 
framework performs best across various situations that may be 
faced at run-time.  Further experiments show that the 
implementation of ADMF in multi-agent systems can improve 
system performance across changing situations.  These 
experimental results clearly motivate the implementation of 
Adaptive Decision-Making Frameworks in multi-agent systems.},
	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {This paper focuses on reorganization in which the decision making control and authority-over relationships amongst agents are allowed to change during system operation, but the application specific resources, task responsibilities, and capabilities of the agent remains the same.
* Assumes a fixed number of homogenous agents.
* Defines three decision making controls and styles: Command Driven (A Master agent gives commands to one or more slave agents to do something...)  True Consensus (All agents decide together what to do) and Locally Autonomous/Master (The agent is solely responsible for making its own decisions.)
* Allows the decision making style to vary at runtime and argue that the optimal style depends on the task and environmental conditions at hand. 
* Assumes a continuously changing environment which causes the decision making style to vary.
* Paper is highly specific to a single task: selecting radar frequencies for a set of military ships and it is not clear how it would apply to other domains. Also results presented are expected given the problem being solved.

Note: with reference to our work:
Our use of managers to coordinate high level tasks is similar to the use of master control with the managees being run in command driven more. I.e. the manager acts as a master agent for a high-level node and decides which of the subtasks/subnodes to execute. It then gives commands to the agents responsible for the subnodes to execute them. Also some of the tasks are the sole responsibility of one agent in which case the decisions are similar to the locally autonomous approach.
