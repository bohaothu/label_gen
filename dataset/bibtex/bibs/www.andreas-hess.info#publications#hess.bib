  abstract ="The ever-growing amount of content and knowledge published online makes it possible for libraries to complement their own data and to present their collections in novel ways. Conceptually related information can be semantically linked so that users may benefit from richer data collections and novel search possibilities that capitalize on the inherent relationships between media, local metadata and external information sources. This paper presents potential solutions for the fundamental challenges of integrating heterogeneous data sources and providing innovative semantic search approaches, as they are developed for libraries and multimedia archives within the CONTENTUS project."

Naive Bayes and Rocchio classifiers on the well-known Reuters
dataset. We use part-of-speech tagging for stopword removal. We show
that our setup performs just as well as other approaches that use the
full article text even though we only classify headlines. Finally, we
apply a Rocchio classifier on a dataset from a Web 2.0-site and show
that it is suitable for semi-automated labelling (often called
tagging) of short texts and is faster than other approaches."

  abstract ="Web 2.0 and Semantic Web are regarded as two complementary paradigms that will probably converge in the future. However, whereas the Semantic Web is an established field of research, there has been little analysis devoted to Web 2.0 applications. For this reason it remains unclear how the advantages of both paradigms could be merged. In this paper we make three contributions in this direction. First, we discuss why merging Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web is beneficial and propose five approaches. Second, we show that (semi-) automated tagging of content improves the quality of annotations. Third, we present an automatic approach for improving the tag quality by using duplicate detection techniques. We verify our approach on a large-scale data set from the social search service Lycos IQ."

Thereby it becomes clear that social bookmarking systems complement rather than threaten algorithmic search engines."

We compare the performance of our algorithm with the performance of other alignment algorithms and show that our algorithm can compete well against the current state-of-the-art."

  abstract = "The World Wide Web offers an ocean of information and services for everyone, and many of us rely on it on a daily basis. One of the reasons for the Web's success is that the threshold for creating content on the Web was always very low, because comfortable and easy to use HTML editors are available. However, today's Web is limited by the fact that it is machine-readable, but not machine-understandable. The Semantic Web promises a solution to this problem by adding explicit semantics with the goal of making the Web machine-understandable by using description logics and ontologies. However, the threshold for creating this extra markup is very high, and no comfortable tools exist at present. The goal of this work is to develop such tools. Machine Learning techniques have been used in literature for various classification tasks. The central claim of this thesis is that such algorithms, supervised and unsupervised, can be used for this purpose."

First, Triskel learns an ensemble of classifiers, each biased to have high precision on instances from a single class (as opposed to, for example, boosting, where the ensemble members are biased to maximise accuracy over a subset of instances from all classes). Second, the ensemble members' voting weights are assigned so that certain pairs of biased classifiers outweigh the rest of the ensemble, if their predictions agree. Our experiments demonstrate that Triskel often outperforms boosting, in terms of both accuracy and training time. We also present an ROC analysis, which shows that Triskel's iterative structure corresponds to a sequence of nested ROC spaces. The analysis predicts that Triskel works best when there are concavities in the ROC curves; this prediction agrees with our empirical results."

  abstract = " The Semantic Web Services vision requires that each service be annotated with semantic metadata. Manually creating such metadata is tedious and error-prone, and many software engineers, accustomed to tools that automatically generate WSDL, might not want to invest the additional effort. We therefore propose ASSAM, a tool that assists a user in creating semantic metadata for Web Services. ASSAM is intended for service consumers who want to integrate a number of services and therefore must annotate them according to some shared ontology. ASSAM is also relevant for service producers who have deployed a Web Service and want to make it compatible with an existing ontology. ASSAM's capabilities to automatically create semantic metadata are supported by two machine learning algorithms. First, we have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying Web Services, their operations, and input and output messages. Second, to aggregate the data returned by multiple semantically related Web Services, we have developed a schema mapping algorithm that is based on an ensemble of string distance metrics."

In this paper we show two extensions to existing approaches. First, we propose to use two separate classifiers for the intrinsic and the relational (extrinsic) attributes and vote their predictions. Second, we introduce a new way of exploiting the relational structure. When the extrinsic attributes alone are not sufficient to make a prediction, we train specialised classifiers on the intrinsic features and use the extrinsic features as a selector. We apply these techniques to the task of semi-automated Web Service annotation, a task with a rich relational structure."
