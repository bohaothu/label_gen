  abstract={Passive tracer dynamics are used in numerical simulations of plasma turbulence to describe fundamental anomalous transport processes including diffusive behaviour and up-gradient transport for paradigmatic as well as more realistic plasma turbulence systems. The limits of the applicability of passive tracer dynamics to extrapolate to the overall or even just to impurity transport are discussed. Results are presented on curvature- and inertia-related pinch effects and further on the clustering of passive tracers due to the compressibility of the advecting turbulent velocity fields. },

  abstract={Two-dimensional numerical fluid turbulence simulations demonstrating the formation and radial propagation of blob structures in toroidally magnetized plasmas are presented and analysed in detail. A salient feature of the model is a linearly unstable edge plasma region with localized sources of particles and heat, which is coupled to a scrape-off layer with linear damping terms for all dependent variables corresponding to transport along open magnetic field lines. The formation of blob structures is related to profile variations caused by bursting in the global turbulence level, which is due to a dynamical regulation by self-sustained differential rotation of the plasma layer. Radial propagation of the blob structures follows from a vertical charge polarization due to magnetic guiding centre drifts in the toroidally magnetized plasma. Statistical analysis of the particle density, radial electric drift and the radial turbulent particle flux reveals asymmetric conditional waveforms with a steep front and a trailing wake and positively skewed and flattened probability distributions, in agreement with recent experimental investigations. Coarse graining and spectral analysis further indicate the presence of long-range correlations in the particle density fluctuations. Finally, conditional statistics of the particle flux demonstrates the intermittency of the turbulent plasma transport and the quasi-periodic apparency of blob structures due to bursting in the global turbulence level. },

  abstract={The spontaneous generation of large-scale flows by the rectification of small-scale turbulent fluctuations is of great importance both in geophysical flows and in magnetically confined plasmas. These flows regulate the turbulence and may set up effective transport barriers. In the present contribution the generation of zonal flows will be illustrated in a simple fluid experiment performed in a rotating container with radial symmetric bottom topography. An effective mixing that homogenizes the potential vorticity in the fluid layer will lead to the replacement of the high-potential vorticity near the centre with low potential vorticity from the outside, which will imply the formation of a large-scale flow. The experimental results are supported by direct numerical solutions of the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation in the \&beta;-plane approximation modelling the experimental situation. The analogy to large-scale flow generation in drift-wave turbulence dynamics in magnetized plasma is briefly discussed. },

  abstract={In this contribution some recent investigations of two-dimensional thermal convection relevant to ordinary fluids as well as magnetized plasmas are reviewed. An introductory discussion is given of the physical mechanism for baroclinic vorticity generation and convective motions in stratified fluids, emphasizing its relation to interchange motions of non-uniformly magnetized plasmas. This is followed by a review of the theories for the onset of convection and quasi-linear saturation in driven-dissipative systems. Non-linear numerical simulations which result in stationary convective states reveal the process of laminar scalar gradient expulsion, leading to the formation of temperature plumes and vorticity sheets. These dissipative structures are demonstrated to result in temperature profile consistency and power law transport scaling far from the threshold. The last part of this paper deals with the generation of differential rotation by fluctuating motions through tilting of the convective structures. The role of kinetic energy transfer and shearing due to differential advection is pointed out. Numerical simulations for strongly driven systems reveal turbulent states with a bursty behaviour of the fluctuation level which is associated with relaxation oscillations in the kinetic energy of the azimuthally mean flows. This leads to a state of large-scale intermittency manifested by exponential tails in the single-point probability distribution function of the dependent variables. The global bursting is interpreted in terms of a predator\&ndash;prey regulation from the point of view of energetics. Finally, a discussion is given of the relevance of these phenomena to a variety of magnetized plasma experiments. },

Single movable Langmuir probes and a poloidal probe array are used for studies of spatiotemporal dynamics and for characterization of the background plasma parameters. All experimentally observed features of the instability are found to be consistent with drift waves. A linear nonlocal numerical model for drift modes, based on the two-fluid description of a plasma, is used for comparison between the experimental observations and theory. Comparing numerical and experimental frequencies, it is found that the experimentally observed frequencies are consistent with drift waves. The numerical results show that the high electron collision frequencies provide the strongest destabilization mechanism in the helicon plasma. },

   abstract = { The dynamics of drift waves in magnetized plasmas is mostly more or less turbulent. Drift waves are candidates for causing anomalous cross-field particle transport. It is thus an appealing goal to achieve active control over the turbulent drift wave dynamics. This is a spatiotemporal problem, and an open-loop control scheme is chosen acting both in space and in time. Experiments have been performed in the linear, magnetized, low-\beta plasma experiment MIRABELLE (LPMI Nancy, France). For the synchronization of drift waves, an azimuthal arrangement of eight electrodes (octupole exciter) is placed in flush-mounted geometry in the edge region of the plasma column. The electrodes of the octupole exciter are driven by sinusoidal signals with a fixed phase angle between neighbouring electrodes. This makes it possible to preselect the azimuthal mode structure (m=1,2,3) of drift waves. It is demonstrated that the periodically forced octupole exciter is able to synchronize both regular and turbulent drift wave states. The efficiency of the spatio-temporal synchronisation depends on the frequency and on the phase shift of the exciter signals. The experimental observations agree very well with computer simulations of a Hasegawa-Wakatani model in cylindrical geometry, where the octupole exciter is assumed to create a azimuthally rotating, mode structured current profile.},
