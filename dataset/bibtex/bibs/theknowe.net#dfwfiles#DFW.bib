PBS

ROSE: The style of David Foster Wallace defies description. In an age where the novel is constantly being threatened by the allure of technological advancement, he put it back on the map with his mammoth work, "Infinite Jest." When he is not writing novels of extraordinary length, he is out chronicling America for publications like Harper's, Esquire and Premiere. "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again" is a collection of the pieces he has written on everything from the genius of David Lynch to tennis to the horrors of a cruise ship. I am pleased to have him back on this broadcast.

Your Dad is a professor of philosophy.

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: He was a protege of George Will's father, who also taught same school, same department.

DFW: Uh-huh.

ROSE: And considered him --

DFW: Well --

ROSE: -- as an influence -- [crosstalk]

DFW: Dad's been at the University of Illinois since the early '60s and when Dad first came, Fred Will, who's now I think in his 70s, was, you know, maybe in his 40s or 50s and was a guy of major stature and he was nice to Dad. And I think most junior academics, this is what happens is, you know, you find -- you find older people in the department whose intellectual approach is congenial to you and who are nice to you and you kind of become friends with him.

I was a philosophy major in college, but my -- my areas of interest were mathematical logic and semantics and stuff, which my dad thinks is kind of gibberish, so it's very weird. In a certain way, I'm following in Dad's footsteps, but I'm also doing the required, you know, thumbing the nose at the father thing. And the stuff -- the stuff that I was doing was really more math than it was philosophy and I don't know whether I would have taught. If you're good enough at that, they just kind of put you in a think tank and let you write on yellow paper. There's a thing at Princeton where they've hired -- they're supposedly professors. They don't teach any classes. They just sit and, you know, devise proofs.

ROSE: But I don't think everybody should have to teach, do you?

DFW: I heartily agree with you.

ROSE: Yeah. I mean, I would hope we're getting away from that sort of -- or -- and then, likewise, you hope that you can get away from this notion of "publish or perish," too.

DFW: Yeah. Oh, boy. Don't even get me started on teaching. Teaching, you learn an enormous amount. The clich{\'e} turns out to be true. The teacher learns a lot more than the students. You do for about two or three years and then the curve falls off sharply and most -- most of the older teachers that I know, except for a very few geniuses, are extremely bored with teaching and are not very interested in their students and they're going through the motions and it's -- there's a weird schizophrenia about higher education because people are hired to teach and to teach college students who are preparing to enter the field themselves, yet on the other hand, very often they're judged and given or denied tenure based on their own work. And I think administrators believe that the two are compatible. They're really not. They're entirely different. And the more time and energy spent on teaching, which is extraordinarily hard to do well, the less time spent sort of on your own work.

I'm in a good position because I was hired -- I mean, I didn't have much teaching experience. I was hired because, you know, I write a lot and publish stuff and that's really all they care about. And I hadn't had much teaching experience and so you learn a lot right at the beginning. But I'm coming up on -- this is my fourth year and I'm already realizing --

ROSE: So you're kind of burned out and bottomed out and plateaued.

DFW: No, I think -- no, I think what's the -- I think I've developed an esthetic or I've developed a position and I'm now -- I find myself saying this year the same thing I said last year and -- and it's a little bit horrifying. I got very lucky and got a grant, so I can take next year off as an unpaid leave and I don't really have to confront the decision.

ROSE: And so what will you do with that year?

DFW: I will -- if past -- if past experience holds true, I will probably write an hour a day and spend eight hours a day biting my knuckle and worrying about not writing.

ROSE: Worrying about not writing?

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: Not worrying about what to write.

DFW: Right. Yeah. Worrying about not writing. [unintelligible]

ROSE: Yeah. Respect means a lot to you, sort of a sense that "I'm taken seriously and respected for my work."

DFW: You can read this in my face?

ROSE: Yeah. I can read it in terms of what's been written about you and what you've said.

DFW: Well, show me somebody who doesn't like to be respected. I guess there was a certain -- there's a certain amount of ambivalence about, say, the reception that "Infinite Jest" got because, you know, every writer dreams of having a lot of attention.

ROSE: You bet.

DFW: But the fact of the matter is this is a long, difficult book and a lot of the attention began coming at a time when I -- I mean, I can do elementary arithmetic. A lot of people hadn't had time to read the book yet. So the stuff about me or interesting rumors that developed about the book and all that stuff getting attention -- I found that -- I didn't like that very much just because I wanted people to write -- to read the book. I'm sorry that I'm essentially stuttering.

ROSE: No, you're not. You're doing just fine.

DFW: So other than that, I mean, I -- you know, I don't think I'm more hungrey for respect than the average person.

ROSE: Let me ask about this book, "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again," which is one of the pieces in here. I want to talk about David Lynch, who after I read your piece in Esquire -- was it Esquire? No, Premier. Premier. I interviewed David Lynch. You never got to interview David Lynch.

DFW: Well, I said from the outset it's the reason they let me on the set of all the other journalists, because I was the only one who said he did not, in fact --

ROSE: Why?

DFW: -- want to interview David Lynch.

ROSE: Why did you want to go observe David Lynch?

DFW: I found -- you mean why did I not want to interview him or why did I --

ROSE: No, but -- well, why was David Lynch interesting to you as a subject of a magazine piece?

DFW: I -- for me, the number of -- the number of film directors who are truly interesting as artists is very, very small and Lynch was one of them for me. I've been interested in Lynch's films for a long time and actually, in grad school -- I think there's a thing about this in the essay. "Blue Velvet" came at a time for me when I reallyl needed to see it and it helped me a lot in my own work. And then it -- after that, I went and, you know, found "Eraserhead" and had sort of followed this guy's career and I find him -- I find him instructive and useful to think about. For whatever that's worth.

ROSE: Did you like the movie "Lost Hightway"?

DFW: I have not seen the movie "Lost Highway." I've seen the rough cut of "Lost Highway" or scenes. They let me go in and sit in what I believe to be David Lynch's personal chair --

ROSE: Yeah. And you sat there and --

DFW: -- and looked at on the little -- on the little monitor and see -- which was the thrill of my life. But I've been on this tour and even though I'm in big cities, I have not yet gotten to see it. And I'm kind of terrified because there's a big part of the essay that talks about what the movie's about and if, indeed, the movie is nothing like that, I'm going to look --

ROSE: Yeah. When he was here, I asked him about what was "Lynchian" and I took that right out of your piece.

DFW: And I'm sure he just looked at you and blinked slowly.

ROSE: Well, he didn't have a great answer because I don't think he thinks that way. He obviously doesn't think that way.

DFW: There was -- I mean, yeah, there's a part in the essay that kind of does this academic "Let's unpack the idea of Lynchian and what Lynchian means is something about the unbelievably grotesque existing in a kind of union with the unbelievably banal," and then it gives a series of scenarios about what -- what is and what isn't Lynchian. Jeffrey Dahmer was borderline Lynchian.

ROSE: Borderline?

DFW: Well, the refrigerator. And actually, what was Lynchian was having the actual food products next to the disembodied bits of the corpse. I guess the big one is, you know, a regular domestic murder is not Lynchian. But if the man -- if the police come to the scene and see the man standing over the body and the woman -- let's see, the woman's '50s bouffant is undisturbed and the man and the cops have this conversation about the fact that the man killed the woman because she persistently refused to buy, say, for instance, Jif peanut butter rather than Skippy, and how very, very important that is, and if the cops found themselves somehow agreeing that there were major differences between the brands and that a wife who didn't recognize those differences was deficient in her wifely duties, that would be Lynchian -- this weird -- this weird confluence of very dark, surreal, violent stuff and absolute, almost Norman Rockwell, banal, American stuff, which is terrain he's been working for quite a while -- I mean, at least since -- at least since "Blue Velvet."

ROSE: You think the failure of "Dune" was good for his career.

DFW: I --

ROSE: Because it made him understand a system that he didn't want to be part of.

DFW: What happened to Lynch with "Dune" -- and now, I'm getting a lot of this from my research, which was published stuff. It's not like, you know, Mr. Lynch and I had coffee and he told me this stuff. But Lynch's career for a while had a kind of Richard Rodriguez arc to it. "Eraserhead," like "El Mariachi" --

ROSE: Yeah, right.

DFW: -- this enormous -- enormously cool independent film, and it attracts the attention of people with money. The first one is Mel Brooks and Brooks hires him to do "The Elephant Man." And "The Elephant Man" is a fantastic, fantastic film and it's lighting and atmospherics, nothing else. So anyway, because of that, you know, DeLaurentis hires him to do "Dune" and now this is -- "Dune," at the time, is equivalent to what, like, "Twister" or "The Rock" would be now. It's this enormous -- this is -- this is a "product" and there's all this money at stake. And "Dune" itself, the novel, I don't know if people read it anymore, but it's a trememdously complicated science fiction novel.

Anyway, Lynch -- so you don't need an hour-long narrative of this, but Lynch does the thing and doesn't do it all that well, but what really happens is the money men come in and they cut, like, I think 35 minutes out of the movie and it renders the movie incoherent. I mean, literally incoherent. And it was a huge flop and I think Lynch ate the flop and decided that what he wanted to do is he wanted to, you know, rule over small films, rather than serve large corporate ones.

I mean, he was really one of the first -- we see a lot of them now, the -- you know, Cinemax and Fine Line directors, these kind of independents who are doing stuff a little out of the mainstream, but still getting national distribution. As far as I can tell, Lunch really -- Lynch really pioneered that ground. He was really the first one to be doing small, eccentric films that got a very wide release, "Blue Velvet" being the best example. And this may be entirely false. I mean, I'm not a film scholar.

ROSE: But you like movies.

DFW: I do like movies.

ROSE: A lot.

DFW: Front row.

ROSE: Okay. Me, too. "The English Patient."

DFW: You're seriously asking me for my view on "The English Patient"?

ROSE: I am. Of course.

DFW: I thought "The English Patient" was an extremely well-done, slick, commercial movie. I thought it was beautifully lit. I thought, you know, the desert looks like a body. I mean, it's got an erotic --

ROSE: It was David Lean-ian for you.

DFW: I thought it was like David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" in some ways. I felt the story -- I felt the story was somewhat predictable and some of the -- some of the sentimental stuff at the end seemed to me like stuff I've seen 250 times before. But in all fairness, and in all respect to Michael Ondaatje, I felt the same way about the book, which I actually really like Ondaatje's poetry. He's got a book called "A Few Tricks I Can Do With a Knife" that's really good. I didn't think "The English Patient" was his best book.

ROSE: But it's a good book.

DFW: It's a -- it's an outstanding book.

ROSE: Yeah. And the film is interesting in that it's not the book.

DFW: That is --

ROSE: And he recognizes --

DFW: -- difficult to argue with.

ROSE: Well, no, no. But that's not it. I don't mean to make a simple point, but it is a perfect example of where somebody makes a film that's every bit as good as the book.

DFW: Yeah. It's a -- [crosstalk]

ROSE: -- not doing the book.

DFW: A "Godfather" thing.

ROSE: Yeah. A "Godfather" thing.

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: Absolutely.

ROSE: How about "Shine"? I'm going to go down three, David.

DFW: This is -- a lot of this is going to get cut out, right?

ROSE: Perhaps. But I'll make the decision as to what's cut out.

DFW: It's funny. This -- I mean, I'm totally intimidated. I'm sitting next to the guy in the Green Room and, you know, not saying a word. Then the minute he leaves, I start haranguing his publicist. The thing that interested me about "Shine" was I thought -- I mean, besides being a manual for how to build a mentally ill child -- I mean, all the early -- early adult stuff -- I thought it was absolutely incredible up until the end, and then I just thought -- the causes of the dysfunction and the symptoms of the dysfunction are unpacked with such complexity and such care. And the ending, charming though Lynn Redgrave is, just the move from the time he becomes ahit in the bar to the time Lynn Redgrave meets him to the time she consults an astrology chart to marry him, to, you know, his very moving "Mr. Holland's Opus"-like --

ROSE: Right. Right.

DFW: -- performance at the end -- it's terrific, but it happens at about 10 times the speed that all the other stuff did. So the thing I was asking the publicist is: "Did the money guys or the studio guys make him wrap the ending" --

ROSE: And they said no. In fact, it was his script.

DFW: They got a little bristly. The got a little bristly.

ROSE: But why would --

DFW: And I am not trying to bust on "Shine," which --

ROSE: I know you're not but, I mean, what we're trying to do here is just understand you by talking about things other than your work. And we'll come back to --

DFW: Unfortunately, most of the things that are leaving my mouth seem to be mean.

ROSE: What?

DFW: Most of the things that are leaving my mouth seem to be mean.

ROSE: Well, we'll get to that.

DFW: Okay.

ROSE: Now, here -- why wouldn't you talk to Scott Hicks in the Green Room?

DFW: Because --

ROSE: Because what?

DFW: Well, because he's --

ROSE: I mean, you're a big-deal writer.

DFW: Well, it -- I don't know. I think of myself as the schmuck in the Green Room.

ROSE: Well, you may be the schmuck in the Green Room, too -- [crosstalk] But why wouldn't you turn to him -- I mean, did you have no curiosity to turn to him and ask the filmmaker the question that you were curious about?

DFW: I think if I had known him or he was my friend --

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: -- I would have been comfortable. Just doing it out of -- I think part of it is going to readings -- you do a reading at a book store --

ROSE: Yeah. Right.

DFW: -- and then afterwards there's usually a Q&A --

ROSE: Right.

DFW: -- which it's very difficult to get out of. I've tried all kinds of things. And many of the questions have this kind of belligerence about them. You know, "Did you think that this ending was weak?" And part of you kind of goes, "Well, why don't you and I go have supper and we'll talk about this. You don't just come at somebody with a question like that."

What -- what I was trying to do is -- I don't know anything about filmmaking from the perspective of making a film. What I know is watching them, as a movie fan. I mean, Pauline Kael is sort of my idol this way. She was -- she was the fan. She was the consumer and her authority came from that. I wanted -- I felt as if the ending of "Shine" had been mucked with, either to get the time down or the guy said -- you know, the producer said, "This is kind of -- we need a more upbeat ending." And I was curious to know whether that was true and it turns out no. It turns out Hicks -- apparently the story got really happy really fast in real life and that's the way it happened.

ROSE: Can you imagine yourself writing a screenplay? Have you tried?

DFW: No, I haven't tried. I've talked a couple times -- my best friend writes mysteries and he and I have talked about doing a screenplay. I think -- I think I would have a very difficult time writing something that's a product that other people would mess with. And the amount of money that's at stake in movies and the amount of -- the dispersal of responsibility for the thing -- I mean, the director, the actors, the producer -- in order to do -- writing is very difficult for me and it takes a lot of time and energy. And once I've done it, it's my thing. I can't imagine putting in the time and energy to do a good screenplay -- I mean, something like what David Webb Peoples can do. He's a screenwriter I think is really, really superb.

ROSE: What's he written?

DFW: He's written "Blade Runner" and he wrote "Unforgiven," the Clint Eastwood Western which --

ROSE: Did you like it?

DFW: I thought -- "Unforgiven"?

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: I thought "Unforgiven" is the first really smart Western since, I don't know, early Peckinpah.

ROSE: I do, too. I loved it.

DFW: What's interesting is I don't know a single female who likes the film. It's very odd. I talk to all these people --

ROSE: It's interesting you say that.

DFW: -- about "Unforgiven" --

ROSE: It's interesting you say that because --

DFW: -- and females think, "Western? It stinks." And if you can get them to watch it, it's not a Western at all. I mean, it's a moral drama. It's -- you know, it's Henry James, basically. But it's very odd.

ROSE: My girlfriend and I -- Amanda hates the film and it's the one film that I just have a wider difference with her than any other film that we've seen together.

DFW: Yeah. If I were going to try to do something, I'd want to do something like that. But that was also an enormous success story -- luck story. David Webb Peoples -- reclusive, weird screenwriter -- I don't know much about him. This script had been shopped around for years and finally Clint Eastwood bought it and Clint Eastwood's got enough juice to go, "Okay, I'll star in it so they'll make it." This was a weird Western. This is very cerebral for a Western and I think the only way that it could have got made was if a, you know, star director, you know, was willing to do it. And the thing about it is, I think for every script like that that gets made, there've got to be, you know, hundreds of these really intelligent, cool scripts --

ROSE: Absolutely, that there's not somebody that comes along who has the power to get it made.

DFW: Right. Or else it gets worked on by the rewrite guys, you know, and John Gregory Dunne's got that whole book, "Monster" --

ROSE: "Monster," yeah.

DFW: -- about, you know, their working on the Jessica Savitch story, which became, you know, what was it --

ROSE: "Up Close and" something --

DFW: -- "Up Close and Personal," which was --

ROSE: Michele Pfeiffer.

DFW: -- a film so bad it doesn't even have charm. You know, some things are so bad that they're enjoyable. This was worse than that.

ROSE: I know. It was. It was. How about writing essays? I did an interview the other night, not on television, but -- with Alfred Kazin. I mean, the kind of thing that he does -- does that appeal to you, in a sense?

DFW: I think of myself as a fiction writer and I'm not even a particularly experienced fiction writer, so a lot -- like, a lot of the essays in this book, if there's a schtick, the schtick is, "Oh, gosh, look at me, not a journalist, who's been sent to do all these journalistic things."

ROSE: Yeah, but I mean, as some critic wrote about you, you have two things that are -- that most journalists wish they had. One is a great -- you have a great memory for the phrase, the delivered phrase --

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: And you also have a great power of observation for the moment.

DFW: Oh --

ROSE: You'd agree with that?

DFW: I would agree with that and the things -- the things in this book that most people like are the sensuous or experiential essays, which is basically an enormous eyeball floating around something, reporting what it sees.

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: When you're talking about Kazin, you're talking about something different, which is, you know, the art essay, the belles lettres --

ROSE: Right. Exactly.

DFW: -- essay. I think there are one, maybe a couple like that in there, but I -- I have this problem of thinking that I haven't made myself clear or that the argument hasn't been sufficiently hammered home, so I will make the same point five, six, seven times. And I did -- the "E Unibus Plurum" thing in there is an argumentative essay that I did six or seven years ago and I just gave up after that because it seems as if, to make the argument truly persuasive requires 500, 600 pages and nobody wants to read it.

ROSE: Yeah. Talking about style -- what's the -- what are the footnotes about? I mean, is that just simply --

DFW: The -- in "Infinite Jest," the end notes are very intentional and they're in there for certain structural reasons and -- well, you don't need to hear about it. It's sort of embarrassing to read this book. You could almost chart when the essays were written because the first couple don't have any. But the footnotes get very, very addictive.

ROSE: Right.

DFW: I mean, it's almost like having a second voice in your head.

ROSE: But where does it come from? I mean, I'm now on page 981 of "Infinite Jest" and the footnotes run, notes and errata, run to page -- you may know the answer to this, but there are 200 --

DFW: Yes, but the reader doesn't experience it in that way because the end note tags are --

ROSE: Three-oh-four --

DFW: -- in the text.

ROSE: Three hundred and four footnotes, sir.

DFW: There are -- there are quite a few. Not -- some of them are very short. Some of them are only one line long. It is a way -- no, see, this is --

ROSE: This is what?

DFW: Well, I'm just going to look pretentious talking about this.

ROSE: Why -- quit worrying about how you're going to look and just be!

DFW: I have got news for you. Coming on a television show stimulates your "What am I going to look like?" gland like no other experience. You may now be such a veteran that you're, like -- you don't notice anymore.

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: You confront your own vanity when you think about going on TV. So I'm -- no apologies, but just -- that's an explanation. The -- the footnotes in the -- there's a way that -- there's a way, it seems to me, that reality's fractured right now, at least the reality that I live in. And the difficulty about writing one of those, writing about that reality, is that text is very linear and it's very unified and you -- I, anyway, am constantly on the lookout for ways to fracture the text that aren't totally disoriented. I mean, you can -- you know, you can take the lines and jumble them up and that's nicely fractured, but nobody -- nobody's going to read it, right? So you've got -- there's got to be some interplay between how difficult you make it for the reader and how seductive it is for the reader so the reader's willing to do it. The end notes were, for me, a useful compromise, although there were a lot more when I delivered the manuscript. And one of the things that the editor did for me was had me pare the end notes down to really the absolutely essential.

ROSE: Who's your editor?

DFW: His name is Michael Pietsch --

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: -- spelled P-I-E-T-S-C-H, not like the fruit -- senior editor at Little Brown and a fine individual.

ROSE: What did it do to you -- Newsweek -- "Truly remarkable. What weird fun 'Infinite Jest' is to read." The New York Times -- "Uproarious. It shows off Wallace as one of the big talents of his generation, a writer of virtuosic talents who can seemingly do anything." That's the way I feel about you. I mean, I -- I'm a little bit -- I mean, I hear a brain at work there -- sort of -- where do you want it to go? What is it --

DFW: I think not exploding would be a nice start. That kind of stuff -- I'm -- I dissociate very well --

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: -- and it's a useful talent. Writing for publication is a very weird thing because part of you -- part of you is a nerd and you want to sit in libraries, you don't want to be bothered and you're very shy. And another part of you is the worst ham of all time. "Look at me. Look at me. Look at me." And you have fantasies about writing something that makes everybody drop to one knee, you know, like Al Jolson or something.

We -- of course, you never get it as much as that part wants, but to get a little bit of it is just -- is very, very strange because very often, for me -- I didn't read a whole lot of the reviews, but a lot of the positive ones seemed to me to misunderstand the book. I wanted it to be extraordinarily sad and not particularly post-modern or jumbled up or fractured and most of the people -- the reviewers who really liked it seemed to like it because it was funny or it was erudite or it was interestingly fractured, so --

ROSE: What does "post-modern" mean in literature?

DFW: No, no, no, no. "After modernism" is what it means.

ROSE: Okay. [crosstalk]

DFW: -- what it means. It's a very useful catch-all term because you say it and we all nod soberly, as if we know what we're talking about --

ROSE: As if we know what it means --

DFW: -- and in fact we don't. There are certain -- what I mean by post-modern, I'm talking about maybe the black humorists who came along in the 1960s, the post-Nabokovians. I'm talking about Pynchon and Barthelme and Barth.

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: DeLillo in the early '70s, Coover. I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot. Let me see --

ROSE: But that's the camp you put yourself in.

DFW: I think -- [crosstalk] I think that's the camp that interested me when I was a student. The problem is, I think post-modernism has, to a large extent, run its course. The biggest thing for me about -- that was interesting about post-modernism is that it was the first text that was highly self-conscious, self-conscious of itself as text, self-conscious of the writer as persona, self-conscious about the effects that narrative had on readers and the fact that the readers probably knew that. It was the first generation of writers who'd actually read a lot of criticism --

ROSE: Yeah.

DFW: -- and there was a certain schizophrenia about it. It was very useful, it seems to me, because the culture -- this was a real beaker of acid in the face of the culture, the culture at the time that this came out. This was before, you know, the youth rebellion in the '60s. It was very staid and very conservative and very Alfred Kazin-ish.

And the problem, though, is that a lot of the schticks of post-modernism -- irony, cynicism, irreverence -- are now part of whatever it is that's enervating in the culture itself, right? Burger King now sells hamburgers with "You gotta break the rules," right? So I'm -- I don't really consider myself a post-modernist. I don't consider myself much of anything, but I know that that's the tradition that excited me when I was starting to write.

ROSE: Paul --

DFW: Is that anything like an answer to your question?

ROSE: It is. I mean -- Paul Cezanne, the painter, always felt that he had -- I mean, up until the end of his life, until he created "The Bathers" in, like, 1907, always felt like he had to create a big painting, a big painting both in terms of size, but in terms of a great piece of work, you know? Do you think about that?

DFW: Well, see, it's -- a book is a different kind of object than a painting. A painting, however big it is, is taken in all at once. Size is an entirely different component of it. For a book, a big book means the reader is going to have to spend a long time reading it, which means your burden of proof goes up, right? Big books -- big books are more challenging. They're more intimidating.

So, you know, if you're talking about "Infinite Jest," I have a problem with length and it's one reason why I'm grateful to have found a really good editor. "Infinite Jest" did not start out to be this long. It started out to be a fractured, multiple narrative with a number of main characters and it became -- perhaps I was just in denial that this was going to require great length. And at a certain point, it became clear that it was going to be very long.

ROSE: All right.

DFW: Feminists are always saying this. Feminists are saying white males say, "Okay, I'm going to sit down and write this enormous book and impose my phallus on the consciousness of the world."

ROSE: And you say?

DFW: I -- I -- if that was going on, it was going on on a level of awareness I do not want to have access to.

ROSE: Do you still play tennis?

DFW: I do play tennis. I no longer play competitively.

ROSE: You played as a junior.

DFW: I was --

ROSE: And you were competitive and good.

DFW: I was good. I was not even very good. I was between good and very good. I was good on a regional level. And one of the things about writing the piece about Michael Joyce, who was hundredth in the world and junior champion, is I really had to -- had to realize that there were a lot of levels beyond the level that I was on. That -- that essay, for me, which I know you haven't asked me about and now I'll tell you about, is -- ended up -- it's very weird and I'm surprised that Esquire even bought it. It ended up being way more autobiographical than it did -- it was supposed to. It was supposed to start out as a profile of this tennis player.

ROSE: But it was about you.

DFW: Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of these, I think, end up being about me.

ROSE: I think so, too.

DFW: As a couple reviewers have pointed out.

ROSE: But -- and then, therefore, back to David Lynch. How is that about you?

DFW: I'm trying to think of a way so that this will have anything to do with what we've talked about before. Imagine you're a hyper-educated avant garde-ist in grad school learning to write.

ROSE: Right.

DFW: The screen gets all fuzzy now as the viewer's invited to imagine this. Coming out of an avant garde tradition, I get to this grad school and at the grad school, turns out all the teachers are realists. They're not at all interested in post-modern avant garde stuff. Now, there's an interesting delusion going on here -- so they don't like my stuff. I believe that it's not because my stuff isn't good, but because they just don't happen to like this kind of esthetic.

In fact, known to them but unknown to me, the stuff was bad, was indeed bad. So in the middle of all this, hating the teachers, but hating them for exactly the wrong reason -- this was spring of 1986 -- I remember -- I remember who I went to see the movie with -- "Blue Velvet" comes out. "Blue Velvet" comes out.

"Blue Velvet" is a type of surrealism -- it may have some -- it may have debts. There's a debt to Hitchcock somewhere. But it is an entirely new and original kind of surrealism. It no more comes out of a previous tradition or the post-modern thing. It is completely David Lynch. And I don't know how well you or your viewers would remember the film, but there are some very odd -- there's a moment when a guy named "the yellow man" is shot in an apartment and then Jeffrey, the main character, runs into the apartment and the guy's dead, but he's still standing there. And there's no explanation. You know, he's just standing there. And it is -- it's almost classically French -- Francophilistically surreal, and yet it seems absolutely true and absolutely appropriate.

And there was this -- I know I'm taking a long time to answer your question. There was this way in which I all of a sudden realized that the point of being post-modern or being avant garde or whatever wasn't to follow in a certain kind of tradition, that all that stuff is B.S. imposed by critics and camp followers afterwards, that what the really great artists do -- and it sounds very trite to say it out loud, but what the really great artists do is they're entirely themselves. They're entirely themselves. They've got their own vision, their own way of fracturing reality, and that if it's authentic and true, you will feel it in your nerve endings. And this is what "Blue Velvet" did for me.

I'm not suggesting it would do it for any other viewer, but I -- Lynch very much helped snap me out of a kind of adolescent delusion that I was in about what sort of avant garde art could be. And it's very odd because film and books are very different media. But I remember -- I remember going with two poets and one other student fiction writer to go see this and then all of us going to the coffee shop afterwards and just, you know, slapping ourselves on the forehead. And it was this truly epiphantic experience.

ROSE: Now -- that's right. I -- you feel the same way when you see "Lost Highway," too.

DFW: I hope so because --

ROSE: Same thing, and you walk out and you say, "I have no idea. It just was an experience." And it was an experience inside of David Lynch's head.

DFW: What's weird about Lynch, though --

ROSE: And that's what it is. I didn't get any message. I don't --

DFW: Did you see -- did you see "Wild at Heart"?

ROSE: No.

DFW: That was --

ROSE: Yeah, I did see it. I did see it.

DFW: See, I don't think "Wild at Heart" --

ROSE: This was Laura Dern and --

DFW: -- is good at all.

ROSE: -- and --

DFW: Yeah. Yeah. Laura Dern and Nicholas Cage and --

ROSE: Right. Right.

DFW: -- they were great performances.

ROSE: Was Willem Dafoe in that?

DFW: Willem Dafoe was in that --

ROSE: Right.

DFW: -- with black stumps for teeth.

ROSE: Right. Right.

DFW: I mean, there's all kinds of -- and it's set up exactly the same way and yet it falls flat. There was some magic that "Blue Velvet" had and I think it has to do with the hoary old concept of a well-developed central character, who is Jeffrey, Kyle MacLachlan, whereas in "Wild at Heart" -- "Wild at Heart" is a weird, inter-textual allusion to "Fugitive Kind" with Marlon Brando and this Italian actress.

ROSE: Yeah. Yeah.

DFW: And there's all these arch sort of -- but there weren't really any characters in it and -- so I don't know. The interesting thing about Lynch is, is it going to be absolutely great or is it going to be cringeingly horrible? And I ended up really rooting for "Lost Highway." Get ready for Robert Blake in this movie. I don't know whether you've seen this movie.

ROSE: Oh, he's fantastic. He's fantastic.

DFW: The movie does --

ROSE: He's fantastic.

DFW: This movie does for Blake what "Blue Velvet" did for Dennis Hopper, who, if you remember, was in oblivion before this movie.

ROSE: Yeah. Yeah.

DFW: And now, all of a sudden, you know, he could do Coke commercials if he wanted.

ROSE: I don't know whether it'll do that for Robert Blake, but -- you mean Dennis could?

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: Dennis could do Coke commercial.

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE Yeah. He could.

DFW: Yeah.

ROSE: I mean, he --

DFW: But I -- my memory of Robert Blake is, you know, "That's the name of that tune," in "Baretta" or something and now, all of a sudden, they've got him made up like Max Schreck in "Nosferatu."

ROSE: We're way over time. Let me ask one last question. You have gone through -- your personal life is kind of bent to hell and back. Yes?

DFW: No, I don't think any more than most people my age.

ROSE: Oh, come on.

DFW: Well, most of the people I -- [crosstalk]

ROSE: I mean, do you look at that as simply sort of passing through the valley and coming out -- I mean, come on.

DFW: I think -- I mean, I -- I think I got -- I got some attention for some work that didn't really deserve it at an age when I had a hard time hardling it. And it wasn't a whole lot of attention, but it seemed like a whole lot to, you know, a library weenie from the lower level of Frost Library at Amherst College and I had a hard time with it. And I was lucky enough so that there was something left of my life when it was over. Whatever that means. If you wanted something, like, really exciting or sexy, there isn't much. I just got really -- [crosstalk]

ROSE: Well, but you -- I mean, it was drugs and you were suicidal and the whole nine yards, yes?

DFW: Yeah. Here's why I'm embarrassed talking about it, not because --

ROSE: I want to know why.

DFW: Not because I'm personally ashamed of it, because everybody talks about it. I mean, it sounds like --

ROSE: In other words, everybody --

DFW: It sounds --

ROSE: Everybody talks about it for themselves or everybody talks about you?

DFW: No, everybody talks -- it sounds like some kind of Hollywood thing to do. "Oh, he's out of rehab and -- "

ROSE: No, I --

DFW: "--back in action."

ROSE: -- didn't say anything about rehab.

DFW: This -- this was --

ROSE: No, I said something about the course that took you from Amherst College to -- back to Illinois.

DFW: I did -- I did some recreational drugs. I didn't have the -- I didn't have the stomach to drink very much and I didn't have the nervous system to do anything very hard. Yeah, I did some drugs. I didn't do as many drugs as most of the people I know my age. What it turned out was I just don't have the nervous system to handle it. That wasn't the problem. The problem was I started out, I think, wanting to be a writer and wanting to get some attention and I got it really quick and --

ROSE: By writing.

DFW: -- and realized it didn't make me happy at all, in which case, "Hmm. Why am I writing?" You know, "What's the purpose of this?" And I don't think it's substantively different from the sort of thing -- you know, somebody who wants to be a really successful cost accountant, right, and be a partner of his accounting firm and achieves that at 50 and goes into something like a depression. "The brass ring I've been chasing does not make everything okay." So that's why I'm embarrassed to talk about it. It's just not particularly interesting. It's -- what it is, is very, very average.

ROSE: Yeah. Do you see yourself chasing a brass ring now?

DFW: I -- this is what's very interesting is I -- there's part of me that wants to get attention and respect. It doesn't really make very much difference to me because I learned in my 20s that it just doesn't change anything and that whatever you get paid attention for is never the stuff that you think is important about yourself anyway. So a lot of my problem right now is I don't really have a brass ring and I'm kind of open to suggestions about what -- what one chases that -- there are real abstract ideas about, you know, what art can be and the redemptive quality of art and, you know, kindness to animals and, you know, all the cliches that we can invoke.

But it's -- I -- the people who most interest me now are the people -- are people who are older and who have sort of been through a mid-life crisis. They tend to get weird because the normal incentives for getting out of bed don't tend to apply anymore. I have not found any satisfactory new ones, but I'm also not getting ready to, you know, jump off a building or anything.

ROSE: Well, that's good news. David Foster Wallace -- "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again," essays and arguments by the author of "Infinite Jest." Thank you.

DFW: Thank you.

ROSE: Thank you for joining us. We'll see you next time.

May 17, 1996

CHARLIE ROSE , Host: Welcome to the broadcast. Tonight, Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, reflects on Bob Dole.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD, (D), CT: There are a lot of us here who are truly saddened with the thought that on June 10th or 11th, Bob Dole will no longer be a colleague of ours. It's someone moving out of the neighborhood. It's a co-worker you've spent, in my case, 16 years with here. And while we obviously have our differences, there are far more things we have in common. And I deeply mean this. I will miss him very, very much.
CHARLIE ROSE : And two savvy reporters, E.J. DIONNE of The Washington Post and TODD PURDUM of The New York Times reflect on Bill Clinton.
E.J. DIONNE, ``The Washington Post'': I just wonder if running against the Republicans between now and November is enough. At a certain point, I think this campaign is going to turn back to ``What is the next president'' -- and he will be the next president in the next term -- ``going to do for us?'' And I think he's going to have to be more specific.
TODD PURDUM, ``The New York Times'': Well, in terms of intelligence quotient -- however you measure that -- that he has to be among the two or three most intelligent presidents of the 20th century with the other possibilities--
CHARLIE ROSE : And how do you measure that and what makes you think that's right?
TODD PURDUM: --being Woodrow Wilson and-- the fluidity of his mind, the quickness of his mind, his willingness to sort of read, the depth of his-- of his reading, the diversity of subjects in which he's conversant, his ability to pick up things--
CHARLIE ROSE : And three novelists look at novels as we approach the end of the century.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, Author: What drew me into writing was mostly memories of really fun rainy afternoons spent with a book. It was a kind of a-- it was a kind of a relationship.
JONATHAN FRANZEN, Author: People who read books, who seriously read books, who read a lot of books, nowadays, it's, like, a priori not of the mainstream.
CHARLIE ROSE : Politics and writing when we continue.

A Democratic Senator Reflects on Bob Dole

CHARLIE ROSE : This was a momentous week in Washington. Bob Dole's dramatic resignation from the Senate Wednesday riveted the national press. The announcement took even Washington insiders by surprise. Republican Senator John McCain, a friend and counselor to Senator Dole, predicted the reinvigorated Dole campaign will be -- quote -- ``the biggest fight of President Clinton's political life.''
	Joining me now from the United States Senate, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. He is chairman of the Democratic National Committee and I'm pleased to have him back on this program.
	Welcome back.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD, (D), CT: Thank you, Charlie. Nice to be with you.
CHARLIE ROSE : What do you think of this strategy by Senator Dole?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, first of all, let me share a personal observation here. And I-- anyone who's a part of a relatively small group of people that's at work or neighborhoods will appreciate what I'm about to say, that whatever else may have been the motivations here, there are a lot of us here who are truly saddened with the thought that on June 10th or 11th, Bob Dole will no longer be a colleague of ours. It's someone moving out of the neighborhood. It's a co-worker you've spent, in my case, 16 years with here.
	And while we obviously have our differences, there are far more things we have in common. And I deeply mean this. I will miss him very, very much. On a personal level I will miss him very much and I don't-- [unintelligible] I'm not unique in that regard. I think, across party lines here, almost any Senator sitting here, I think, would share a similar sentiment.
CHARLIE ROSE : What is it about him that causes you and others to say that, without raising any question of the obvious difference on policy matters, but he clearly was a man of the Senate. You are now man of the Senate. But it's more than that. It seems that Senator Dole and the people in that institution-- there was a kind of something that resulted in some sense of great admiration for him.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, it's-- it's like any-- you know, 10 percent of our-- of our dealings with each other -- maybe a bit more than that, in this case, but not much more -- are on policy and politics and 50, 60, 70 percent of our relationship are on personal things. I mean, a handshake. ``I'll be at that event for you.'' I don't know how many groups of constituents over 16 years that I've had down from Connecticut and I've said to Bob Dole, ``Could you come on over and say hello to these people and give me a half an hour?'' And he'd come and spend an hour.
	How do I explain that to someone? They'd say, ``Well, you never vote alike.'' And then you-- that walk back, that subway ride on the car between the office buildings, that late night on the floor when you sit down and just start talking and I'd hear stories about Russell, Kansas, or he'd talk about knowing my father, who he served with here or other Senators that he had remembered or people in public life.
	I went and talked-- he was the first person I talked to when President Clinton asked me if I'd be the national chairman of the Democratic Party. And you'd say, ``Why do you run to talk to Bob Dole?'' Well, Bob Dole was a Senator in 1972 when Richard Nixon asked him, as a sitting Senator, to be the chairman of the Republican National Committee.
	And so I went to Bob and said, ``Tell me about this. Is this a good idea, a bad idea? What are the things I ought to watch out for? What are the things I ought to do?'' And he gave me his advice and counsel, talked to me repeatedly, would ask how I was doing, things to watch out for.
	I can't explain that, I suppose. I'm talking more about it with you, Charlie, than I have with anybody else in the last few days. So when I say these things about going to-- I miss-- I'm missing him already and he hasn't even left. But the notion, somehow, that on June 12th I'm going to walk on the floor of the United States Senate and Bob Dole is not going to be there is-- is very difficult for me to accept right now.
CHARLIE ROSE : And you can understand why there were tears in his eyes when he left.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: I feel the emotion now, talking about it. And so it's on that level. Now, having-- having said all of that, I also-- now I've got to-- I sit back and say, ``Well, why is he doing this?'' and-- and--
CHARLIE ROSE : Because he wants to beat the brains out-- beat the--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Absolutely. This is not--
CHARLIE ROSE : --brains out of your guy.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Absolutely. As I said the other day, this is-- this wasn't a death in the family. This-- Bob Dole is not ill. Those are normal circumstances when we see someone get up and say, ``I have to leave. I'm sorry.'' And we all feel terribly bad about it. Bob is a very good politician. He didn't get where he did over the years by being a bad one.
	And he has looked around, and his advisers have, and said, ``Look, get as far away from this place as you can. This Congress is a disaster. Every time you get your picture taken with Newt Gingrich, you lose two points. You're not going to lose a lot.''
	There are only 22 days or so left of the legislative session here, when you take away the 4th of July, Memorial Day. We're out all of August. We're back for about a week after Labor Day.
	``This is not missing six months, it's missing about 20 days, and you're not going to want to be here. Look, even if you lose on November 6th, do you really want to come back here on November 7th and be a Senator for the next two years and maybe have to face a challenge from Trent Lott over your majority leader position? So if your plan is, one way or the other, you've had enough, do it now.''
	So on a personal level, on a political level, he wants to get as much distance between himself and this agenda that's been a disaster for the country and the personalities associated with it. And so he did the intelligent thing, and that is he said, ``I'm taking a hike. I'm getting out of here. I'm changing my clothes. I'm taking off my tie. I'm going to Rockford, Illinois. I'm not going to go to Washington.'' And I understand all of that.
	Having said all of that, and understanding it all -- and he'd disagree with my analysis, here -- I'm still going to miss him very much.
CHARLIE ROSE : Is it-- one last moment about the nature of the man. I've been told by a number of Senators and people who've worked at the Senate that probably, if the Senate voted on who they thought would make a good president, Bob Dole -- in the Senate -- would get more votes than anyone else.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, I don't know if he'd-- he'd do very well. I mean, that's a tough question. There are a lot of people who I think could fill the bill. If you could-- if the issue were strictly appointing somebody, there are a lot of people people would say ought to be appointed.
	The problem is with that question, is we don't appoint and there's something about having to go through the process and winning the support of the American people that is a very important ingredient about being a good president and you've got to get elected. The qualification is to be elected to it and meet the obvious Constitutional requirements.
	So there's a great respect for Bob as a leader. He's a great legislator and-- and there's a lot of-- a lot been written over the years about whether or not good legislators make good chief executive officers or whether a good chief executive officer would necessarily make a good legislator.
	I watch a lot of former governors here, some former mayors, and they have a difficult time when they first come to the Senate. When they've been sort of king of the hill and all of a sudden they're one of--
CHARLIE ROSE : They're not in control.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: --they're one of 99 others and they're co-equals, that can be hard. And you know, John Kennedy was the only president, along with Warren Harding, who ever went directly from the Senate to the presidency. So it's not a natural place to move from.
CHARLIE ROSE : Senator McCain said the Clinton White House was confident that the president could win reelection by simply keeping Washington in gridlock. ``Today the president learned that he's in the biggest fight of his political life.'' You think Senator McCain is right on target?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, it's-- it's certainly-- whether it's the largest of his life, I-- only history will tell us that. We can look back on November 6th or whenever and draw a better conclusion about that. I think that's more rhetoric, probably, than anything else. It certainly is going to be a major battle, I think a very close race. We look-- the president's doing very well right now in the polls, but if he were sitting in this chair, Charlie, he'd be the first one to tell you that this race will tighten up, it'll be very close. He has a great deal of respect for Bob Dole. He has a good sense about himself. He knows-- the president knows the country well. So he anticipates this to be a very, very tough race. Whether or not it's the toughest race of his political life, we'll let history make judgments like that.
CHARLIE ROSE : Are Democrats, and are you encouraging Democrats to run against Gingrich and to make this a kind of run against the Congress?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, it's-- in a sense, that's certainly a major part of it, but I don't think you can win elections by just what you're against. I'd be-- I would tell you, having been through seven elections myself, that constituencies, whether they be a state or the country, certainly are motivated by things they don't want to see happen, but they also want to know what you're for, where you're going to take them, what you'd really like to see happen, your values and so forth. So that's an important element
	And clearly, because Mr. Gingrich and Bob Dole are the co-architects of this ``Contract with America,'' and clearly, as you see by every survey, almost in every state in the country, there has been a wholesale rejection of this agenda, where you have significant cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, crime and so forth-- these are matters that people are concerned with.
	And the fact that this leadership in the past 40 months has moved or tried to move the country in that direction is certainly going to be something we're going to remind people of: what Mr. Gingrich and company would have done but for the veto pen of this president and people in the Senate who were able to slow this agenda down, what would have happened in education, what Medicare would look like today, what our environmental laws would look like.
	Had they had a president and a filibuster-proof United States Senate, they would have gotten their way completely and this would be a very different country, in our view, and we're going to tell the American-- 
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah. But is that--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: --people that story.
CHARLIE ROSE : --a vision to say, ``But for us there would have been more cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. But for us they would have done more to education and the environment''? Is that a vision of--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: You can't build--
CHARLIE ROSE : --America or is that simply saying, you know, ``We-- we stand there not because we have a positive view of the country, but because we stand there to say no on your behalf''?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: No, I-- I was responding to your question. I said-- you-- ``Is that going to be a part of it?'' The answer is yes, it'll certainly be a part of it. Is it the whole story? I hope not, because if it is, then I don't think you necessarily win support. I think you then, in addition to pointing out the difficulties that could have been there, you have to quickly point out that this president is committed to balancing this budget within seven years and has laid out a program to do so and, in fact, has cut the deficit in half.
	Remember, Bill Clinton arrived in town in January of 1993. He was never a Congressman, never a Senator. He's been here 40 months. Contrast that, with all due respect, to the majority leader, who's been here 36 years. When Bill Clinton arrives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he's given a $4 trillion debt, $3 trillion have been accumulated in the last 12 years. And in 40 months, he takes the annual deficit from $300 billion down to $144 billion. That's four consecutive years of deficit reduction. We've seen employment go up by 8.5 million jobs in this nation. We have seen inflation rates come down. The combination, the ``misery index,'' is the lowest it's been in 28 years. We're going to talk about accomplishments and then take that further and say, ``In the 19-- in the 21st century, as we hope this president can lead us over the next four years, these are the things we want to do to improve opportunities for people in education, to expand job opportunities, to create more growth in this country so that there'll be more work for people in this nation, to see to it that we can do a better job in the environment''-- 
CHARLIE ROSE : Let me--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: --``and do a better job on international relations.'' Those are the things we've got to talk about positively.
CHARLIE ROSE : Let me-- I've got about a minute on the satellite. Let me ask you--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Sorry.
CHARLIE ROSE : --two quick questions. Will you take control of the Senate in 1996, in your judgment?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: I think we have a good chance. I'll be close. It's-- right now, we're three seats short, but we're in a lot better position than I would have imagined a few years ago. We're competitive in states like Virginia and Wyoming and South Dakota and Oregon and--
CHARLIE ROSE : And how close to taking control--
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: --the Carolinas--
CHARLIE ROSE : --of the Senate-- I mean, the House, back?
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: I think pretty good, as well, there. We've got some very good candidates. We're matching up very well. I'm just reluctant to-- I saw that Speaker Gingrich predicted all sorts of numbers and gains. I can't do that for you today. Twenty-five weeks is a long time. But I would tell you this. We're in a very, very good position to regain the House and the Senate, but it's going to be very close.
CHARLIE ROSE : I thank you, Senator Dodd.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Thank you.
CHARLIE ROSE : It's a pleasure to have you on the broadcast, as always.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Thank you.
CHARLIE ROSE : Thanks for joining us on this Friday afternoon.
Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Thank you.
CHARLIE ROSE : We'll be right back. We'll talk about the president with TODD PURDUM, who wrote this piece, and E.J. DIONNE, who writes a column for The Washington Post. Back in a moment.

Two Journalists Reflect on Bill Clinton

CHARLIE ROSE : We'll continue our look at the White House and the Congress and Bob Dole and President Clinton. TODD PURDUM covers the White House for The New York Times. He's written the cover story for this Sunday's New York Times magazine, ``Facets of Clinton.'' E.J. DIONNE has been on this program before. He's a Washington Post columnist and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
	We're pleased to have both of them here now to continue our conversation about the politics of 1996. Let me first turn to Bob Dole. E.J., does this work? Does this make Dole -- the decision to leave the Senate -- a more effective campaigner? Does it make him a more effective candidate? Does it make him a tougher challenger?
E.J. DIONNE, ``The Washington Post'': Well, there was a headline in my paper this week that said this move was ``desperate and wise'' and I think that's exactly right. I think he had to get out of there. Clinton is about to lose his best ally, who's Tom Daschle, who tied the Senate in knots, made it impossible for Dole to get anywhere, and so he has to pursue this new strategy. The question is, ``Does it work?'' And I don't think we've seen yet whether-- how well it's going to work because a lot depends on whether Dole has enough to say to change some of the subjects of this campaign. Right now, most of the subjects, whether it's minimum wage or Medicare or Medicaid, help the Democrats.
CHARLIE ROSE : Todd?
TODD PURDUM, ``The New York Times'': I think that's very true and, you know, the moment of his taking leave was so dramatic and emotional, but it seemed to be emotional because he was leaving his life's work and the thing that he cared most about of all. And as E.J. pointed out, this won't solve the problem of Bob Dole articulating a sort of over-arching rationale for his campaign. He still has to find a way to do that more cogently, more effectively, with the same kind of oomph he did the other day, when he made this dramatic announcement, so--
CHARLIE ROSE : But people are saying it clearly gives him an opportunity for the American people to take a second look at him because the first look was not working very well, as he stood in the well of the Senate, being cornered by Tom Daschle.
TODD PURDUM: Absolutely.
E.J. DIONNE: If any time you do something that surprises the press, we immediately are inclined to say, ``This is a brilliant move'' and we give somebody a lot of attention. Dole got all that attention the last couple of days. I think the catch is he's really got to do two contradictory things at the same time. I think he's got to figure out how to defend the record of the last year and a half because if he leaves it undefended, the Democrats are going to keep going to town on it. At the same time he does that, he's got to try to slip away from that record a little bit, slip away from Newt Gingrich and kind of suggest new themes and tell us what he's going to do as president. I think those things are hard to do at the same time, but he's got to do them.
CHARLIE ROSE : Is it too simple to say that this race will either be a referendum on the Congress and Speaker Gingrich or a referendum on the president and, one way or the other, which referendum it is may very well determine who wins?
TODD PURDUM: It's possible. I think the White House wouldn't be unhappy to have it be a referendum on the Republican Congress, obviously.
CHARLIE ROSE : Of course. Yeah.
TODD PURDUM: But Dick Morris, the president's strategist, is also quite confident and saying that he wants this period -- and he's seen it for the last six months and he sees it for the next two or three months until the conventions -- as being a time to win the referendum on Bill Clinton. And the president's strategists' view is if they can win that essential referendum on making it worth reelecting the president, bringing up his approval levels, so that the public says he hasn't been such a bad guy, he's made some achievements, maybe they were misunderstood, underappreciated, not connected as well as they should have been, then they think that it'll be a comparatively easier task to go head to head with Bob Dole. And, you know, so I-- I think that's fair to say.
CHARLIE ROSE : Does he--
E.J. DIONNE: The Republicans-- oh, I'm sorry, Charlie.
CHARLIE ROSE : No, go ahead. You go ahead.
E.J. DIONNE: The Republicans could get themselves out of this a little bit by adjourning the Congress early and there's talk around town that they might just do that, in that if they get out of here, the whole focus of the news moves away from the Congress and back toward the presidential campaign. President Clinton has still got to be here, so the focus of Washington news is on him. And that's one way they might start pulling themselves out of this morass.
CHARLIE ROSE : Are we essentially a conservative, a moderate or a progressive country?
E.J. DIONNE: Oh, I'm-- as you know, Charlie, I'm on the record as saying we're a progressive country. I mean, I think we are a country that has an instinctive mistrust of government at the abstract level that keeps turning around and asks government to help us out and do things, whether it's in medical care or in job training or now we're talking about what can government do about corporate down-sizing, if anything. And so I think the-- running purely against government doesn't work, but it's still very hard for somebody to tell people ``The government's going to help you'' because people are very skeptical of that sentence.
CHARLIE ROSE : But if we are essentially progressive-- I would always-- I assumed, had grown to assume, that we were essentially a conservative country. Your book asked me-- forced me to ask some questions. You then make this point about progressivism, and if we are essentially progressive, Clinton is in a good place. Todd makes this point in his article. ``If Clinton had a central conviction-- has a central conviction, his supporters say it is his belief in the power of government to encourage social progress, a faith born of his first-hand observation of the federal Civil Rights revolution.
	I mean, is that, in essence, the core of Bill Clinton, a belief in government?
TODD PURDUM: Well, I think he's had to slice it very carefully because I think he does believe, as E.J. says, and as the president likes to say now, he thinks we're moving into a new era that poses the greatest challenges since the progressive era of a century ago, when society moved from farm to factory, and now we're moving from the industrial age to the information age. And I think he would argue that government has to find new, more efficient, more effective ways to do things. The tasks aren't the same, but there are still many tasks that only government can do on behalf of-- of the citizenry. But I do think there's much to say on our antecedents about how we are essentially a conservative country. The framers set up a system that was deliberately prone if not to gridlock, at least to very deliberate and slow motion, as we've seen what happens when there is divided party. We don't have a parliamentary system in which a government falls in a sudden vote in a matter of, you know, three weeks' time and you have the other people come in and a prime minister leaves. So I think he has to balance a fundamental growing distaste for government with what E.J. correctly says is the public's continued desire to have all the fruits of government action that only sort of collective action can provide.
CHARLIE ROSE : And you also make the point that he has always played situational political.
TODD PURDUM: He's always-- ever since his whole life, ever since he came back from Oxford and Yale and Georgetown and had to get elected in a state that was, you know, by many national standards poor and backward and conservative and suspicious of-- although it must be said, with Orville Faubus, too, there was always a big sort of populist streak in the state-- but anyway-- [crosstalk] 
CHARLIE ROSE : E.J., go ahead.
E.J. DIONNE: I think Todd's point in that piece is exactly right and I think-- about Clinton finally, in his gut, believing in government's power to do good things, and I think once you start sort of taking the layers off, yeah, he'll say the era of big government is over, and in about five minutes, he'll start listing for you the things he would like government to do. And he will say, ``Of course, we want to do them in a new and different way.'' He will-- you know, and I think he means that. But at heart, he'd really like the government to take on a lot of problems.
TODD PURDUM: Everything from tax credits for companies that, you know, are trying to down-size or have worker retraining to incremental piecemeal steps to expand health insurance coverage in the kind of limited ways that are under discussion now in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in Congress, or by opening the federal insurance pool to private sector workers, all sorts of means and methodologies to get to fundamentally--
E.J. DIONNE: Health care is a perfect metaphor for both situational politics and his underlying commitment. It failed the last time, when he did it the big way, so now the situation-- he looks at the situation and says, ``Okay, we got to do it piecemeal, piece by piece, these little changes,'' but he's still trying to do it.
CHARLIE ROSE : Incremental is key now. Here's what I don't quite understand. And you bring this out, Todd, in a number of different ways. You talk about flying back from the anti-terrorism summit. The president is on his plane and he-- some kind of plane this Air Force 1 must be. I want to show our audience a picture of-- [crosstalk] This is the president at his desk on the plane. Look at that.
PANELIST: [off-camera] People can see why Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich wanted to sit in the front, you know? I mean-- 
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah, that's why they wanted to sit in the front! Yeah. Exactly. They're back there in-- in coach, at the back of the plane. You say that Bill Clinton stops on this flight back, ``sinks to a squat on my carry-on computer case and starts to talk once more, and talk on and on and on and on for two more hours. His restless, self-revealing ramble is stunning in its breadth, its energy, its originality, its length. He rolls around the universe like a pinball in a machine. He critiques movies and noodles over the possibilities of the 21st century. When he suggests, in awe, human beings may routinely live beyond 100 years, he unspools a seamless string of insightful stories about the political problems and physical quirks of a half a dozen world leaders and frets about the casual cruelties of the information age.''
	You know him, have seen him up close. Help me understand him and help this audience understand who this guy is and where do all these contradictions come from.
TODD PURDUM: Well, Charlie, if only I could. You know, I've just spent about 9,000 words in our Sunday magazine trying to do that and I-- I wish-- I'd be fraudulent if I said I thought I really understood the president.
	And I think one of the things that's remarkable about him and remarkable about his ability to sort of keep going as a politician when others would have counted him out, is that he is very complex. He's not simple. There's nothing easy about him. He's a very big guy. He's physically big, much bigger than he seems on T.V. He's big in his person, sort of big in his soul, big in his heart, big in his flaws sometimes.
	And, you know, he's-- much has been written about how he's the product of this very complicated upbringing. His father died before he was even born. His stepfather was an alcoholic. He had a lot of turmoil in his family life and he was the eldest son who learned how to cope from a very early age and who is persuaded that if he could only get to know people, shake their hands, look into their eyes, he could win them over. And it certainly worked for him and it continues to work for him in hand-to-hand campaigning.
CHARLIE ROSE : What is it that makes you say ``Therein appears the paradox of Bill Clinton. One of the biggest, most talented, articulate and intelligent, open, colorful characters ever to inhabit the Oval Office''? I mean, how do you measure that? What-- what does he say, do, smell like, that makes you say that?
TODD PURDUM: Well, it's-- obviously, that's a sort of a subjective judgment. It's complicated to say and we've had what, 42 presidents now, so that's in some ways a sort of bold pronunciamento, I guess, to say, because there have been some--
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, and also-- yeah.
TODD PURDUM: There have been some pretty big ones, but--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
TODD PURDUM: --if one thinks of the recent era of the 20th century, in which there were some pretty big characters -- Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, obviously Richard Nixon, in his own way, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman -- there have also been a number of fairly pallid presidents--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
TODD PURDUM: --over time and I think it's just--
CHARLIE ROSE : But are you putting him in that category with Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson--
TODD PURDUM: Well, I--
CHARLIE ROSE : --in terms of the hugeness of his abilities and his intelligence and his personality and his color?
TODD PURDUM: I think there's almost no doubt that, in terms of intelligence quotient -- however you measure that -- that he has to be among the two or three most intelligent presidents of the 20th century with the other possibilities--
CHARLIE ROSE : And how do you measure that and what makes you think that's right?
TODD PURDUM: --being Woodrow Wilson and-- the fluidity of his mind, the quickness of his mind, his willingness to sort of read, the depth of his-- of his reading, the diversity of subjects in which he's conversant, his ability to pick up things. I mean, E.J.'s spent a lot of time with him, too, in the-- 
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, I'm coming to E.J., so-- 
TODD PURDUM: But my only point would be--
CHARLIE ROSE : --hold on a minute.
TODD PURDUM: --that you can't say definitively or even tentatively much about his presumptive greatness until there's some perspective on his presidency and I think, you know, there's-- that will have to be argued out. But I think he has sort of won the argument that he's a big character, entitled to rank with some of the bigger characters who's ever-- who have ever been there, just by the sheer sort of breadth of his-- of the stuff I talked about in that discussion on the plane.
CHARLIE ROSE : Pick that up, E.J.
E.J. DIONNE: Yeah. I would defend Todd's thesis this way. You've had a lot of presidents who were real smart and were policy wonks, but they haven't had his appetites for-- all kinds of appetites, including for affection and relating to people and other such things. You've had a lot of people-- presidents with big appetites, but they haven't had this, you know, what we call ``policy wonk'' side, this intellectual nimbleness. He puts all this together. The real question, I think, is what's he going to do with all this? In other words, that he has these abilities. You haven't seen it yet in performance. The first two years were very disappointing, I think to him as much as anybody. The second two years he's been entirely reactive to the Republican Congress, which has served him very well politically. The question is what's going to happen if he wins again? Can he use all these skills that I think Todd is right in ascribing to him to get something done and to shape the country. And that, I think, is going to determine whether he is Teddy Roosevelt or FDR or a president like that.
CHARLIE ROSE : If Rush Limbaugh, bless his soul, was sitting here at this table, he would say, ``There they go, one guy from The New York Times, one guy from The Washington Post. They are somehow enamored, snowed,'' to use an expression that Bill Clinton and I would understand, ``by the notion of this president, his brains and all of that. Somehow he has been able to win them over to his largeness.''
E.J. DIONNE: I'd say three things. First of all, both our newspapers should not be blamed for us.
CHARLIE ROSE : Okay, but I just want--
E.J. DIONNE: Second thing is, my--
CHARLIE ROSE : --to identify as to where you come from, what part of the establishment.
E.J. DIONNE: The second thing I'd say is my wife once said that if all Americans could meet Bill Clinton, his popularity would stand at 70 percent. There is something winning about him. A Republican I know said he watched him do Cal Ripken's, you know, record-breaking game on ESPN for three innings and decided no one's ever going to beat this guy. So there is that quality to him and that I think most people who are objective about him say he's got these big qualities. That's very different from deciding what kind of president he is and it's very different, also, from how do you judge somebody with these large appetites? The whole point of all these Republican attacks is to say his appetites are too large. So I think you can say some of the things we've said and come to the political conclusions that Rush Limbaugh would come to.
TODD PURDUM: I mean, my-- my only point in the piece was to say that some of the very bigness of his appetites and talents are things that get him into trouble when he goes too far and goes over the edge. And in my own-- I don't want to say ``defense,'' but it was made clear to me today that the president, for example, was not at all enamored of--
CHARLIE ROSE : Was not enthralled with your piece.
TODD PURDUM: No, and--
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, what did they say? Just give us a sense of what-- this piece now-- people have been able to see it because the magazine comes out early and gives people like me an opportunity to read it and decide if I want to do a program and other things. What did the White House say to you?
TODD PURDUM: Well--
CHARLIE ROSE : What don't they like?
TODD PURDUM: Well, I don't-- I don't know in detail and, obviously, you know, the president hasn't called me up to discuss it and I wouldn't expect that he would. But it's been revealing to me. The reaction to this piece has been the Rorschach test, much like the president. People have warned me, my colleagues, that I should be prepared for the fact that people will think it was too sympathetic. Others have warned me that I should be prepared for the fact that it will seem devastating. So I think it depends on what people think about Bill Clinton and the people who like him will probably read about the parts that they like and admire and take that away and the people who dislike him will read it and say, ``Oh, there he goes again,'' you know?
E.J. DIONNE: I mean, that's one of the amazing things about Bill Clinton is that whenever you write something about him, you get the most extraordinary response. He has--
CHARLIE ROSE : People are not neutral.
E.J. DIONNE: Right. And, I mean, he has the most extraordinary-- a pretty large group of people who really can't stand him and a small but some-- growing group who really get down your throat if you say anything critical of him. He's become, as Ronald Reagan was, in a sense, a polarizing figure like that.
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, let me just quote again from the piece, as I am doing perhaps too much, but-- 
PANELIST: [off-camera] It's a good piece.
CHARLIE ROSE : --``Therein lies the paradox,'' I said-- and you go on to say that, ``In a real sense, his strengths are his weaknesses, his enthusiasms are his undoing. And most of the traits that make him appealing can make him appalling in the flash of an eye.'' Quote-- `` `It's almost impossible not to be charmed by him and it's almost impossible not to be disappointed by him,' says one long-time aide.''
	Why are they disappointed, Todd?
TODD PURDUM: Well, because of what E.J. talked about, because, you know, when people have big appetites and big energy, they get out of control sometimes. And, I mean, the president, particularly in his first two years, when he had an expansive agenda, he won-- he had a 43 percent victory margin and 115 percent agenda and he came in and the gulf between those two things was very hard to bridge. And E.J. makes the point that the Democrats on Capitol Hill have been supporting him now in tying Senator Dole in knots, but when the Democrats were running Congress, they were giving him no end of grief. ``Don't send us this. Don't do that. Repeal the assault weapons ban. It'll be terribly troublesome for us,'' and so forth. So he-- he has been the victim of his own ambitions, his own energies and his own enthusiasms. And he wanted to do so many things, he got a little bit over-- he himself says he bit off too much.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah. He's remarkably self-analytical, it seems to me, both in terms of David Broder and explaining what happened to health care, and in terms of this piece and in terms of things that E.J. has written about him. There is, obviously, a mind at work that understands how to look at where he's been and where he's going.
TODD PURDUM: Well, especially when it comes to politics. I mean, I'm not sure he spends so much time being self-aware, in the sense of how he comes across, or he may not be so self-aware in sort of a psychological sense. But in a political sense, he's incredibly self-analytical. He knows what he's--
E.J. DIONNE: Yeah. No, and on that point about disappointing, I think that Bill Clinton seems to be capable of unbelievably warm friendships, but he can also cut people loose. I mean, if you had Lani Guinier on this program, to pick one example of a number of people, they would say, you know, he can turn around, if he decides it makes sense for him to turn around. And that also, I think, for some people, has been a source of disappointment.
CHARLIE ROSE : What's happened to result in this amazing turnaround from his approval ratings, so that he seems to have moved into this place where he looks presidential, in terms of just an appearance thing-- he walks with the presence of leadership now. He has that quality now. And secondly, there seems to be an approval, 53 percent in the latest poll by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, registered voters by 52 percent to 40 percent approve the job that the president is doing. By 53 to 38, they approve of his handling of the economy. What's happened to give him this change in his relationship with the American public?
E.J. DIONNE: Well, I think he should take Air Force 1, give it to Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and all the freshman Republicans and say, ``Take a month's vacation. I owe you a huge debt,'' because I think he used the Republican agenda to do three things. First, he made the Republicans look extreme, which suddenly allowed him to look more centrist, which is what he'd always wanted to do. But the issues that he fought on were old Democratic issues-- Medicare, Medicaid, education--
CHARLIE ROSE : Minimum wage.
E.J. DIONNE: --minimum wage. And so that rallied the most ardent Democrats, so he pulled a real jujitsu move, looking more centrist and rallying the base at the same time. And then the third piece of it is by standing up to them at all, he helped erase, at least a little bit, this image that he didn't stand for something. And so I think he owes them a debt on all these counts.
TODD PURDUM: And the fourth piece is that-- or the fourth and fifth and sixth-- whatever-- he really did, I think, learn in office. He really has become more presidential, in the sense that he is more careful not to step on his own message, careful to stick to his guns, careful to make one overriding point a week instead of seven points a day or, you know, talk to the press-- I mean, I can't argue that he shouldn't talk to the press more. I wish he would talk even more than he does. But he's been very much more careful about keeping his priorities straight and saying-- you know, sticking to the thing he's most concerned about.
CHARLIE ROSE : What is it that his handlers are so fearful of that they will not allow you to report on the conversation that took place on Air Force One and other times in which he has been very relaxed and has been able to span over a series of subjects over a period of time?
TODD PURDUM: Well, I think part of it is, they fear -- and I understand some of their fear because there is a lot of this at work in the modern press -- the ``gotcha'' syndrome, the search for a daily headline, the take out of context, quick hit, sort of he says he has to lead the country out of a funk, and so everybody focuses on that and forgets that he made the comment in the context of saying he thinks the country is poised on endless possibilities and has so much going for it and people may be more anxious than they should be and all of that. And that gets lost in translation.
	I think it's also just that they know that he's capable, in an extended conversation, of, again, because of this enormous energy, these enormous enthusiasms, going off the reservation a little bit, you know? I mean, saying something he would wish, with sober second thought, he hadn't said, trying to hard to be liked, trying too hard to please somebody, being just a little too enthusiastic. And I think they know that that jumps up and bites him sometimes.
CHARLIE ROSE : What's the relationship with the First Lady today? And I mean by that, in terms of her influence, advice, positioning within whatever advice he gets within the White House?
TODD PURDUM: Well, you know, it's one of the great speculations, in a sense. I mean, we can't know for sure. We're not there when they talk and it's not right for us to be there when they talk. But one can only assume, based on all the evidence we hear, that, you know, she remains his most influential adviser in many ways, as indeed most, you know, long-married couples are with each other and--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah, they say that Elizabeth Dole had a significant influence on getting her husband to make the decision to leave the Senate.
TODD PURDUM: You know, I think the First Lady knew that the public was uncomfortable seeing her exercise a more overtly policy adviser role, but-- but I don't think she's changed, really, her fundamental involvement in his life.
E.J. DIONNE: No, I think that's right and I think she is a person who's very political, loves politics, has always been involved in making political decisions. I cannot imagine that, just because the polls changed and she had to get out of the public spotlight, it's fundamentally changed her role inside. But as Todd said, we're not there, so we don't exactly know, but that's my sense from what everybody says.
CHARLIE ROSE : Will she be an issue in the campaign?
E.J. DIONNE: Doubtless she will be an issue in the campaign, but she'll be a huge asset, too, and, you know, she got about something like thousands of people to come out in New Hampshire on a freezing day this winter, when you wouldn't expect that they would do it. And she-- she draws enormous audiences, enormous support from core Democratic supporters that they-- she goes to address. Her book's been on The New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks this coming Sunday. She's a pretty big asset, in a lot of ways. [crosstalk]
CHARLIE ROSE : What do either of you define or divine that he might want to do, if he wins reelection, in a second term?
E.J. DIONNE: I think that's the heart of the darkness in that he's given some indications-- I went in to do one of those interviews that he's giving out now and that was my interest. And you get a sense he wants to do a little more on health care. He wants-- he may want to do a little on pensions. But he's been very cautious, maybe too cautious, in trying to explain what he'd do with a second term. And I think there's real division in the White House over how expansive he should be about that, that they think, number one, things are going okay now, why blow it? Number two, if you dare look at all expansive, people will jump down your throat and say ``You're going to give us big government.'' I just wonder if running against the Republicans between now and November is enough. At a certain point, I think this campaign is going to turn back to, ``What is the next president'' -- and he will be the next president in the next term -- ``going to do for us?'' And I think he's going to have to be more specific.
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, it reminds me of the Reagan campaign in-- 
PANELIST: [off-camera] In '84?
CHARLIE ROSE : --in '84, in which it was ``morning in America'' and nobody understood what the referendum was to do in the second term.
E.J. DIONNE: And there wasn't that much that happened in that second term, it's worth remembering.
TODD PURDUM: Iran-contra for one.
CHARLIE ROSE : Which is one of the worries.
TODD PURDUM: But I think the Clinton White House would settle for the Reagan victory margin.
CHARLIE ROSE : We've-- this article-- ``What kind of Democrat''-- again, we seem not to know the answer to that, but TODD PURDUM has written an interesting profile of this president called ``Facets of Clinton.'' E.J. DIONNE continues to write a column from Washington and I am pleased to have both of you on this broadcast. Thank you very much.
E.J. DIONNE: Thank you, Charlie.
TODD PURDUM: Thank you.
CHARLIE ROSE : When we come back, four young-- three young novelists talk about the role of the novel and where it stands in American literary life today. Stay with us.

Three Novelists Reflect on the Modern Novel

CHARLIE ROSE : A generation ago, a new book by a fiction writer was anticipated with the kind of excitement and buzz that is not seen anymore. In the age of Internet, information and images, many publishers doubt the younger generation reads very much. Who and what are the future of American fiction?
 	Joining me, DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, whose 1,000-page novel, Infinite Jest, has become the season's most talked-about book; JONATHAN FRANZEN-- his latest book is Strong Motion; and MARK LEYNER, author of Tooth Imprints on a Corn Dog. Great to have all of you here and the reason we have convened you here is to talk about that very subject.
	Mark, let me begin with you. I mean, what's happening to fiction, do you think, and its appeal to young people today? I don't know who young people, where the division is, but--
MARK LEYNER, Author: I don't know. I don't know. In a way--
CHARLIE ROSE : Is there an audience, do you think? I mean, is it growing? Is it decreasing? Is it impacted by all these things we talk about?
MARK LEYNER: You know, honestly, it's something I never think about as a writer. I-- there's an image I have of Bobby Fischer-- you know, the chess player--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yes.
MARK LEYNER: --when he was a kid-- 16, 15. And he's in his room every night, listening to WABC on some little transistor, playing through all the chess games of history, you know, obsessively.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: I don't think, at that point, he cared about how popular chess was or who was interested--
CHARLIE ROSE : No.
MARK LEYNER: --in it or not. It was just--
CHARLIE ROSE : I couldn't agree more.
MARK LEYNER: --his obsession, his compulsion, what he did. He knew at that point. And that's pretty much how I feel about it. You know, I'm not-- I didn't sign on as a sociologist or a professor or-- I mean, this is what I do. I write these books and I'm loyal-- I mean, I'm grateful for whatever loyal readers I have. I'm privileged by it and sort of write for that readership. So generally, I don't get the sense, when I go out there-- if I go out on a book tour, for instance-- this is just, you know-- my empirical evidence is that there seems to be a lot of interest in books out there.
CHARLIE ROSE : Notwithstanding all the distractions, not withstanding the Internet and all that, notwithstanding the technology that plays out there?
MARK LEYNER: I think not withstanding the distractions. I don't-- I don't think additional media supplant other media. I think they crowd it. I think they sort of impact on the kinds of readers we have. But I'm not certain that there are less readers and I'm not certain that there are less enthusiastic readers and I'm certain that there are more readers out there for me that haven't read my books. So I guess once I exhaust them, then I'll worry about it.
CHARLIE ROSE : Does any of these questions we're talking about influence the way-- how you write and the way you write and-- I mean, because your style is unique and different?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, Author:: Well, I was just listening to what Mark said. In a-- you know, in a way I agree. If you think about that stuff, like the size of the audience and how much it will appeal to a reader, you go nuts fairly quickly.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Yes. Yes.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: But on the other hand, I think that-- I think where Mark and I differ a little bit is-- is I think, in a weird way, the condition sort of commercially for fiction has-- bears a little bit on the esthetics of writing right now because at least-- at least the generation that I think of myself as part of was raised on television, which means that at least I was raised to view television as more or less my main kind of artistic snorkel to the universe. And I think television, which is a commercial art that's a lot of fun, that requires very little of the recipient of the art, I think affects-- affects what people are looking for in various kinds of art and I think can make the sort of fiction which-- if I can lump a bit, I think all three of us do stuff that's at least harder than average, weird, requires some work to read. What's interesting to me is the very phenomenon that perhaps demographically cuts into our audience is a big part of sort of what's going on in the country that I think fiction writers are trying to capture in some way.
CHARLIE ROSE : Okay, what's that?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Oh, boy. I hope this is a four-hour segment. [crosstalk] 
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, okay, it is. Go.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: As-- as--
CHARLIE ROSE : Reduced by three hours and 45 minutes.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Yeah. I guess, as far as I can see, fiction for me, as-- mostly as a reader, is a very weird, double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can be difficult and it can be redemptive and morally instructive and all the good stuff we learned in school. On the other hand, it's supposed to be fun.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: It is a lot of fun. And what-- what drew me into writing was mostly really fun rainy afternoons spent with a book. It was a kind of a-- it was a kind of a relationship.
CHARLIE ROSE : Now, why did that draw you into writing? Because, I mean, the love of the book make you want to make those-- make them, be a part of the--
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Well, I think-- see, this gets real abstract. I think part of the fun for me was being part of some kind of exchange between consciousnesses, a way for human beings to talk to each other about stuff that we normally can't talk about. Like, we're sure not going to be able to talk about this stuff here, you know? The thing that-- the thing that interests me in a lot of the stuff I think that I do has to do with I think a lot-- commercial entertainment, its efficiency, its sheer-- its sheer ability to deliver pleasure in large doses changes people's-- changes people's relationship to art and entertainment. It changes what an audience is looking for. I would argue is changes us in deeper ways than that and that some of the ways that commercial culture and commercial entertainment affects human beings is one of the things that I sort of think serious or arty fiction ought to be doing right now.
JONATHAN FRANZEN, Author: And it cuts in in a different way, too, because I think 50 years ago, somebody setting out to write a scene at a precinct house, basically, you know, would go to a precinct house and feel that pretty much anything they had to say about it would be fresh and interesting. And now if I sit down to write about-- I won't-- I basically won't write about a precinct house because I see so many of them on T.V. They do such a slick job. I'm completely captivated by that. And so that's in my head, whether I want it to be in my head or not.
PANELIST: [off-camera] And in your reader's head.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: And in my reader's head, as well. And so I-- you know, I consider myself my own reader and so I kind of consult my entertainment habits. To say that I don't think about an audience is both true and not true because I think about myself as an audience. And that audience is one that has had its expectations regarding all kinds of narrative art profoundly changed by what's happened in the last 50 years.
MARK LEYNER: You know, I think it's a-- it's a tough audience. I mean, if we can make a monolith out of this audience we're talking about, for the sake of discussion, a young audience raised on television is used to receiving its entertainment in these kinetic bursts and it's tough to sway people like that a book, to reading a book.
	I mean, if you go to public places now-- first of all, I think one of the terrible things that's happening-- I mean, I watch a lot of T.V. myself. I-- you know, I don't think it's evil in any sense, but I do think compulsory viewing of television is evil. One of the last refuges in which we can read anymore are these-- [crosstalk] 
CHARLIE ROSE : And it's only between 9:00 and 12:30, too.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Exactly.
PANELIST: [off-camera] You know.
CHARLIE ROSE : It could be worse.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: A brutal regime.
PANELIST: [off-camera] We have these--
CHARLIE ROSE : Dictatorial, I'd say.
MARK LEYNER: Now what was I going to say?
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: These-- these sorts of interstitial zones where people read--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: --like waiting for planes, waiting for things--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: You know, that's sort of the last refuge of peace and quiet. Well, it's no longer because now you go to an airport and they have televisions there.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: So-- 
PANELIST: [off-camera] Check-out lines.
MARK LEYNER: These are-- now we're dealing with people who almost never experience any sort of down time in their life from electronic media. But I think-- one of the things I've always tried to do is accept that as a given, that this is a pretty tough crowd I'm dealing with and that I have to come up with the kind of work that's able to somehow compete with that. You know, there's-- in-- Beaudelaire wrote this great little preface to Flowers of Evil where he said, ``Hypocrite reader, my brother''-- I mean, I-- I have the same kind of feeling where I have realized pragmatically that I have to bond with people-- I have to somehow devote my work to people that may not be such great readers anymore.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: But that sounds as if you're almost saying the opposite of what you started out saying. It sounds like you're molding your fiction very much to the kind of readership you expect. Whereas if--
MARK LEYNER: No, I wouldn't say ``molding.'' I think you have to be aware and realistic and pragmatic about who's reading you work because-- I mean. I mean, I'm not going to say you-- you know, you don't have to.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: Thank you, Mark.
MARK LEYNER: But I-- you know, my relationship with my readers is somewhat theatrical. I mean, I really-- one of the-- one of the main things I try to do in my work is delight my readers and-- you know, and the work is-- is hopefully funny.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Right.
MARK LEYNER: In order to do that, you have to know who they are. I mean, you have to have some notion of how they're taking in this information and what they're used to, to play off it, in some way. So it's not a matter of molding your work necessarily, but you have to know, sort of, who the patient is you're dealing with--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah, but--
MARK LEYNER: --as a doctor.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah, but didn't you say, in a sense, without [unintelligible] point, I heard this same thing. When we were talking about in the beginning the Bobby Fischer notion--
JONATHAN FRANZEN: That he was merely obsessively--
CHARLIE ROSE : Was obsessive--
JONATHAN FRANZEN: --pursuing this--
CHARLIE ROSE : --pursuing chess. He wasn't thinking about the role of chess or all those other questions.
MARK LEYNER: Yeah. Yeah.
CHARLIE ROSE : I mean, who was watching who.
MARK LEYNER: Well, I'll make a distinction. I mean, I don't-- I don't think about-- I don't think in sociological terms about dwindling readership--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
MARK LEYNER: --and why and-- when I'm writing.
CHARLIE ROSE : But you do think about--
MARK LEYNER: But I do think--
CHARLIE ROSE : --who might read my book and--
MARK LEYNER: I think about the people who do read my books.
CHARLIE ROSE : --what are they demands.
MARK LEYNER: Yeah. And what-- and what their habits are.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Well, because it's an act of communication.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Right.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: But where the-- what makes the analogy okay, but also makes it break down, is that part of the Fischer-like obsession Mark's talking about consists of a kind of mental and emotional dance with a constructed reader that you figure has a life more or less like yours and whom, in a weird way, you're talking to, you know? Again-- again, I'm, like, totally with you about 50 percent of it. The thing about it is that delight and fun and all that stuff is definitely-- that-- that's part of what makes art magical for me, but there's another part. There's a-- there's the part-- and, see, I'm afraid I'm going to sound like a puritan or a prig, but there's this part that's--
MARK LEYNER: That's okay. Go ahead. [crosstalk] 
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: No, there's this part-- there's this part that's-- that's-- that makes you feel full. There's this part that is-- that is redemptive and instructive, where when you read something, it's not just delight. You go, ``My God, that's me.'' You know, ``I've lived like that. I've felt like that. I'm not alone in the world.'' I mean, you can get-- you can get very kind of abstract in the way you talk about it.
	What's tricky for me is-- see, it would-- it would be one thing if everybody was absolutely delighted watching T.V. 24-7, but we have, as a culture, not only an enormous daily watching rate, but we have a tremendous cultural contempt for T.V. I mean, from Newton-- Newton Minnow's ``the vast wasteland'' has become kind of culture-wide, such that now T.V. that makes fun of T.V. is itself popular T.V.
	There's this way in which we who are watching a whole lot are also aware that we're missing something, that there's something else, there's something more, while at the same time, because television is really darned easy-- you sit there. You don't have to do very much. And in many ways--
CHARLIE ROSE : It's not easy to do, though.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: Oh, no, no. We'd never suggest that. But, you know-- but there's-- there's also-- I mean, there's-- there's a second model you can sort of come at the audience from--
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: --which-- with-- which is that people who read books, who seriously read books, who read a lot of books, nowadays, it's, like, a priori not of the mainstream. You have a weird audience who is defined, in large part, by their non-participation in mass entertainments of that kind and I think another way you can go about it is to just basically keep on doing the same old kind of book, making little subtle nods to the fact that it's now 1996 and--
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: So what, the only people who--
JONATHAN FRANZEN: --not 1896.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: The only people who read, like serious fiction, are people who don't watch T.V.?
JONATHAN FRANZEN: No, no. Thank you for drawing that out for me, Dave.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: No, if I've misheard, enlighten me.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: My impression is that people who read feel-- who read a lot of books -- just seat of the pants sense -- is that they don't-- they-- they do that because they don't fit in in some way. At some point in their lives, they-- they have found solace-- they have found it necessary to engage with books because the community, the society around them is not giving them everything they need. And I think that's a-- that's a fair description of a person who continues to read challenging books that require sort of an effort of concentration.
CHARLIE ROSE : Yeah, I want to ask that-- you-- especially you about that. Is-- it is that do you think that your books are known to be-- the one-- this book is known to be complicated and long, compared even to the Internet. Is it simply because that's the way you express what you have to say or is it some sense of design there?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Oh, there's some sense of design. Part of it, I think, is, for me, it's weird. I feel like I'm kind of-- if you put these two guys in a blender--
CHARLIE ROSE : What two guys?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: --I am these guys-- these guys-- these guys sitting right here. I mean, part of it-- one of the things that I want is to do something that is-- yeah, it's complicated and it's hard and it's weird, but it's also seductive enough so that you're willing to do the work to go through that. And a lot of that has to do with trying-- trying, yes, to be-- to be delightful and to have it be delightful. [crosstalk] 
MARK LEYNER: --if you put us in a blender.
JONATHAN FRANZEN: So I'm the one who's not delightful here? Is that what you're saying?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: A very soft blender and not with sharp blades. No, I-- no. I'm just-- I-- I guess-- [crosstalk] I mean, it's not any kind of tactic or whatever, but I think, at least for-- the way I am as a writer comes very much out of what-- what I sort of want as a reader and what sort of got me off, you know, when I was reading. And a lot of it has to do with-- ``Good Lord, I'm really stretching myself. I'm really having to think and process and feel in ways I don't normally feel. And the book-- the book has motivated me to do that.''
CHARLIE ROSE : Let me ask this because we talk all around this. Is what you like to read different today than it might have been 10 years ago, what you like to read? And why?
JONATHAN FRANZEN: Oh, 10 years ago, what-- [crosstalk] Yeah, Hardy boys. Exactly. [crosstalk] 
CHARLIE ROSE : Well, but you know what I mean. I mean, in terms of what's on the landscape today and what you want to read-- is it different than-- 
MARK LEYNER: I don't read-- I don't really read-- I don't read much contemporary fiction, I have to say.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Yeah.
CHARLIE ROSE : Why not?
MARK LEYNER: You know, I'm not quite sure why not. I-- there may be some anxiety about the influence of it, in some way-- you know, just wanting--
CHARLIE ROSE : A subconscious influence on the way you write or--
MARK LEYNER: Yeah. Yeah. I-- I also love reading non-fiction and just grab it at the library every week, just books about every sort of thing. And I'm also catching up, I think, on what I should have read, you know, when I was getting high and screwing around all the time. I mean, I'm re-educating myself, to some degree.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: You might want to edit that part.
CHARLIE ROSE : You what?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Might want to edit that part.
MARK LEYNER: I said I'm finished with that now.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: You're recovered.
MARK LEYNER: Which I found is not a bad thing to do. I mean, it's not a bad thing to read all-- to read the books we were supposed to have read in college--
CHARLIE ROSE : You read mostly, then--
MARK LEYNER: --when--
CHARLIE ROSE : But-- you don't read contemporary fiction, but--
MARK LEYNER: Not really.
CHARLIE ROSE : --do you read mostly non-fiction, then?
MARK LEYNER: Mostly non-fiction and then older sorts of things.
CHARLIE ROSE : Mostly, you read what today?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: If I understand your question, 10 years ago I was reading a lot more avant-garde stuff and I thought it was very cool. One of my complaints right now is that because I think commercial entertainment has conditioned readers to want kind of more easy fun, I think avant-garde and art fiction has sort of relinquished the field and is now-- basically, I don't read much contemporary avant-garde stuff because it's hellaciously un-fun. A lot of really serious literary stuff--
CHARLIE ROSE : But was it hellaciously un-fun--
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Yeah.
CHARLIE ROSE : --five years ago and ten years ago?
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: Well-- well, the stuff I was reading 10 years ago was avant-garde stuff from, like, the '60s and early '70s, which--
CHARLIE ROSE : I see.
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: --as far as I can see, was kind of the heyday, at least of contemporary avant-garde stuff. But these days, a lot of it is very academic and cloistered and basically written for critics and college teachers and Ph.D. students and it's something that I-- I feel a lot more strongly about that than I do about T.V.
CHARLIE ROSE : Let me-- for those-- in a sense, Jonathan, for those who say the novel is dead and, you know, the age of fiction is past, you three are witness to what or testimony to what?
JONATHAN FRANZEN: Oh, I'd say we're-- we're witness to-- we're testimony to the fact that it is not dead, that people are still doing it. There's still audience for it. It might be the kind of big clout audience that Mailer and Hemingway had in the '50s--

CHARLIE ROSE : And?
JONATHAN FRANZEN: And the novel dead? I think the novel-- the novel and its audience may be returning to a point before-- there was kind of a golden 100 years before T.V. and movies had fully taken over, but after universal education or nearly universal education had produced a large audience of readers. That-- the novel was the only game in 1880, 1890, 1900s.
CHARLIE ROSE : Infinite Jest, DAVID FOSTER WALLACE; Strong Motion, JONATHAN FRANZEN; and MARK LEYNER's Tooth Imprints on a Corn Dog-- I thank you for coming.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Thank you.
PANELIST: [off-camera] Thanks, Charlie.
CHARLIE ROSE : My thanks to DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, to MARK LEYNER and to JONATHAN FRANZEN.
	On Monday we'll have two recent Pulitzer Prize winners and Senator Warren Rudman. See you then.

5. DFW worked on the Amherst College journal Sabrina when he went there.  It is unclear if any of his writing is in the Journal.  See the entry "Notes on Missing Pieces" for more information on this.

6. Cross reference the tables of contents for DFW's books so that we can easily see where each piece in the collection (or novel, in the case of Infinite Jest) originally came from.

7. Continue to collect text/pdf versions of pieces - specifically those not collected in DFW's books or pieces that had substantial changes in them between published editions.  A list should be compiled of what is needed.

8. Continue to collect audio recordings of interviews and readings.  A list needs to be compiled.

9. Create a list of audio recordings and written interviews that are truly missing from the web, and take steps to recover them.  A list needs to be compiled.

10. Run OCR on pdfs of texts that don't have full text in the bibliography.  This will make all sorts of concordance-type research possible - and allow easy answers to questions like "Did Wallace say X about Updike in some interview?"

11. Research any letters to/from DeLillo/Franzen (see http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/delillo.scope.html)}}

Dave Eggers on David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest
Tuesday, November 14, 2006 - 12:00 pm
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Little Brown is publishing a new $10 edition of Infinite Jest with a new foreward by Dave Eggers, which follows here. Skylight Books hosts a re-issue party on Sunday, November 19, at 5pm; 1919 N. Vermont Avenue in Los Feliz, (323) 660-1175 or www.skylightbooks.com


In recent years, there have been a few literary dustups --- how insane is it that such a thing exists in a world at war? --- about readability in contemporary fiction. In essence, there are some people who feel that fiction should be easy to read, that it's a popular medium that should communicate on a somewhat conversational wavelength. On the other hand, there are those who feel that fiction can be challenging, generally and thematically, and even on a sentence-by-sentence basis --- that it's okay if a person needs to work a bit while reading, for the rewards can be that much greater when one's mind has been exercised and thus (presumably) expanded.

Much in the way that would-be civilized debates are polarized by extreme thinkers on either side, this debate has been made to seem like an either/or proposition, that the world has room for only one kind of fiction, and that the other kind should be banned and its proponents hunted down and, why not, dismembered.

But while the polarizers have been going at it, there has existed a silent legion of readers, perhaps the majority of readers of literary fiction, who don't mind a little of both. They believe, though not too vocally, that so-called difficult books can exist next to, can even rub bindings suggestively with, more welcoming fiction. These readers might actually read both kinds of fiction themselves, sometimes in the same week. There might even be --- though it's impossible to prove --- readers who find it possible enjoy Thomas Pynchon one day, and Elmore Leonard the next. Or even: readers who can have fun with Jonathan Franzen in the morning while wrestling with William Gaddis at night.

David Foster Wallace has long straddled the worlds of difficult and not-as-difficult, with most readers agreeing that his essays are easier to read than his fiction, and his journalism most accessible of all. But while much of his work is challenging, his tone, in whatever form he's exploring, is rigorously unpretentious. A Wallace reader gets the impression of being in a room with a very talkative and brilliant uncle or cousin, who, just when he's about to push it too far, to try our patience with too much detail, has the good sense to throw in a good low-brow joke. Wallace, like many other writers who could be otherwise considered too smart for their own good---Bellow comes to mind---is, like Bellow, always aware of the reader, of the idea that books are essentially meant to entertain, and so almost unerringly balances his prose to suit. This had been Wallace's hallmark for years before this book, of course. He was already known as a very smart and challenging and funny and preternaturally gifted writer when Infinite Jest was released in 1996, and thereafter his reputation included all the adjectives mentioned just now, and also this one: Holy shit.

No, that isn't an adjective in the strictest sense. But you get the idea. The book is 1,067 pages long and there is not one lazy sentence. The book is drum-tight and relentlessly smart and, though it does not wear its heart on its sleeve, it's deeply felt and incredibly moving. That it was written in three years by a writer under 35 is very painful to think about. So let's not think about that. The point is that it's for all these reasons---acclaimed, daunting, not-lazy, drum-tight, very funny (we didn't mention that yet but yes) --- that you picked up this book. Now the question is this: Will you actually read it?

In commissioning this foreward, the publisher wanted a very brief and breezy essay that might convince a new reader of Infinite Jest that the book is approachable, effortless even --- a barrel of monkeys' worth of fun to read. Well. It's easy to agree with the former, more difficult to advocate the latter. The book is approachable, yes, because it doesn't include complex scientific or historical content, nor does it require any particular expertise or erudition. As verbose as it is, and as long as it is, it never wants to punish you for some knowledge you lack, nor does it want to send you to the dictionary every few pages. And yet, while it uses a familiar enough vocabulary, make no mistake that Infinite Jest is something other. That is, it bears little resemblance to anything before it, and comparisons to anything since are desperate and hollow. It appeared in 1996, sui generis, very different than virtually anything before it. It defied categorization, and thwarted efforts to take it apart and explain it.

It's possible, with most contemporary novels, for an astute reader, if they are wont, to break it down into its parts, to take it apart as one would a car or Ikea shelving unit. That is, let's say a reader is a sort of mechanic. And let's say this particular reader-mechanic has worked on lots of books, and after a few hundred contemporary novels, the mechanic feels like he can take apart just about any book and put it back together again. That is, the mechanic recognizes the components of modern fiction, and can say, for example, I've seen this part before, so I know why it's there and what it does. And this one, too---I recognize it. This part connects to this and performs this function. This one usually goes here, and does that. All of this is familiar enough. That's no knock on the contemporary fiction that is recognizable and breakdown-able. This includes about 98 percent of the fiction we know and love.

But this is not possible with Infinite Jest. This book is like a spaceship with no recognizable components, no rivets or bolts, no entry points, no way to take it apart. It is very shiny, and it has no discernible flaws. If you could somehow smash it into smaller pieces, there would certainly be no way to put it back together again. It simply is. Page by page, line by line, it is probably the strangest, most distinctive, and most involved work of fiction by an American in the last twenty years. At no time while reading Infinite Jest are you are unaware that this is a work of complete obsession, of a stretching of the mind of a young writer to the point of, we assume, near-madness.

Which isn't to say it's madness in the way that Burroughs or even Fred Exley used a type of madness with which to create. Exley, like many writers of his generation and the few before it, drank to excess, and Burroughs ingested every controlled substance he could buy or borrow. But Wallace is a different sort of madman, one in full control of his tools, one who instead of teetering on the edge of this precipace or that, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, seems to be heading ever-inward, into the depths of memory and the relentless conjuring of a certain time and place in a way that evokes --- it seems so wrong to type this name but then again, so right! --- Marcel Proust. There is the same sort of obsessiveness, the same incredible precision and focus, and the same sense that the writer wanted (and arguably succeeds at) nailing the consciousness of an age.

Let's talk about age, the more pedestrian meaning of the word. It's to be expected that the average age of the new Infinite Jest reader would be about 25. There are certainly many collegians among you, probably, and there may be an equal number of 30-year-olds or 50-year-olds who have for whatever reason reached a point in their lives where they have determined themselves finally ready to tackle the book, which this or that friend has urged upon them. The point is that the average age is appropriate enough. I was 25 myself when I first read it. I had known it was coming for about a year, because the publisher, Little Brown, had been very clever about building anticipation for it, with once-monthly postcards, bearing teasing phrases and hints, sent to every media outlet in the country. When the book was finally released, I started in on it almost immediately.

And thus I spent a month of my young life. I did little else. And I can't say it was always a barrel of monkeys. It was occasionally trying. It demands your full attention. It can't be read at a crowded caf{\'e}, or with a child on one's lap. It was frustrating that the footnotes were at the end of the book, rather than on the bottom of the page, as they had been in Wallace's essays and journalism. There were times, reading a very exhaustive account of a tennis match, say, when I thought, well, okay. I like tennis as much as the next guy, but enough already.

And yet the time spent in this book, in this world of language, is absolutely rewarded. When you exit these pages after that month of reading, you are a better person. It's insane, but also hard to deny. Your brain is stronger because it's been given a month-long workout, and more importantly, your heart is sturdier, for there has scarcely been written a more moving account of desperation, depression, addiction, generational stasis and yearning, or the obsession with human expectations, with artistic and athletic and intellectual possibility. The themes here are big, and the emotions (guarded as they are) are very real, and the cumulative effect of the book is, you could say, seismic. It would be very unlikely that you would find a reader who, after finishing the book, would shrug and say, ``Eh.''

Here's a question once posed to me, by a large baseball cap-wearing English major at a medium-sized western college: Is it our duty to read Infinite Jest? This is a good question, and one that many people, particularly literary-minded people, ask themselves. The answer is: maybe. Sort of. Probably, in some way. If we think it's our duty to read this book, it's because we're interested in genius. We're interested in epic writerly ambition. We're fascinated with what can be made by a person with enough time and focus and caffeine and, in Wallace's case, chewing tobacco. If we are drawn to Infinite Jest, we're also drawn to the Magnetic Fields' 69 Songs, for which Stephin Merritt wrote that many songs, all of them about love, in about two years. And we're drawn to the 10,000 paintings of folk artist Howard Finster. Or the work of Sufjan Stevens, who is on a mission to create an album about each state in the union. He's currently at State No. 2, but if he finishes that, it will approach what Wallace did with the book in your hands. The point is that if we are interested with human possibility, and we are able to cheer each other onto leaps in science and athletics and art and thought, we must admire the work that our peers have managed to create. We have an obligation, to ourselves, chiefly, to see what a brain, and particularly a brain like our own --- that is, using the same effluvium we, too, swim through --- is capable of. It's why we watch Shoah, or visit the unending scroll on which Jack Kerouac wrote (in a fever of days) On the Road, or William T. Vollmann's 3,300-page Rising Up and Rising Down, or Michael Apted's 7-Up, 28-Up, 42-Up series of films, or ... Well, the list goes on.


And now, unfortunately, we're back to the impression that this book is daunting. Which it isn't, really. It's long, but there are pleasures everywhere. There is humor everywhere. There is also a very quiet but very sturdy and constant tragic undercurrent that concerns a people who are completely lost, who are lost within their families and lost within their nation, and lost within their time, and who only want some sort of direction or purpose or sense of community or love. Which is, after all and conveniently enough for the end of this introduction, what an author is seeking when he sets out to write a book---any book, but particularly a book like this, a book that gives so much, that required such sacrifice and dedication. Who would do such a thing if not for want of connection and thus of love?

Last thing: In attempting to convince you to buy this book, or check it out of your library, it's useful to tell you that the author is a normal person. Dave Wallace --- and he is commonly known as such --- keeps big sloppy dogs and has never dressed them in taffeta or made them wear raincoats. He has complained often about sweating too much when he gives public readings, so much so that he wears a bandana to keep the perspiration from soaking the pages below him. He was once a nationally ranked tennis player, and he cares about good government. He is from the Midwest---east-central Illinois, to be specific, which is an intensely normal part of the country (not far, in fact, from a city, no joke, named Normal). So he is normal, and regular, and ordinary, and this is his extraordinary, and irregular, and not-normal achievement, a thing that will outlast him and you and me, but will help future people understand us --- how we felt, how we lived, what we gave to each other and why.}}

	Abstract = {In his final year at Amherst College, David Foster Wallace faced a difficult career decision. He had to decide whether his future lay with graduate studies in philosophy or in what academia labels "creative writing." Few of us could have solved the problem as neatly: Mr. Wallace produced two senior honors theses that brought him a double summa cum laude. The philosophy paper, a highly technical mathematical affair, was, he reports, the more successful effort. But the fiction -- which turned out to be a wild, funny, somewhat disheveled novel -- really blissed him out.

He would sit down around lunch time to invent a few scenes, Mr. Wallace remembered the other day, and when he looked up, dinner time would have come and gone. "I don't know where I had been but I hadn't been on earth for a few hours. I have approached nothing like that in any kind of emotional and intellectual endeavor before."

Mr. Wallace's writing honors thesis, "The Broom of the System" (Viking/Penguin), completed in 1985 when he was 23 and revised during his summer vacation, was published this year to a good deal of critical attention, a lot of it favorable.

By the time it appeared, Mr. Wallace was in his final year in the graduate writers' program at the University of Arizona in Tucson. You would think that a brilliant young man who had produced his first novel before commencement would forgo more classes, but this one is not only well-educated, he is smart.

As he said on a recent trip east from Tucson, Mr. Wallace knew he was still "very raw" and needed to develop his powers of self-criticism. He had only begun working in fiction in his junior year, responding in part to professorial observations that his papers, while unscholarly, were certainly imaginative.

Through a friend, Mr. Wallace acquired an agent, Fred Hill of San Francisco. When the novel came on the market in late 1985, at least five houses wanted it. Gerald Howard, who runs Penguin's Contemporary American Fiction line, says he took care of the competition by "reading it very quickly and going nuts for it." His $20,000 floor, a nice figure for a first effort by an unknown, won the day. Mr. Wallace, shaggy-haired, slender, boyish, quietly droll and wonderfully vague about business matters, mutters there has been movie interest in an outline. Mr. Howard reports that Alliance Entertainment has paid a $10,000 option toward a $200,000 purchase if it likes the script treatment.

The CAF line is the eight-year-old reprint house for such sturdy modern masters as Donald Barthelme, William Kennedy and Laurie Colwin. "The Broom" is the first novel it has published as an original and the first to appear simultaneously with the Viking hardcover, a nervous experiment, according to Mr. Howard. "If it hadn't worked, we would have fouled the marketplace for another effort of this sort."

Mr. Howard's apprehension is a reminder of how vital to writers and readers trade paperback editions have become. In the economics of modern mass-market paperback publishing, a serious literary novel that sells steadily but modestly is nearly impossible to keep in print. Nowadays, it is an outfit like CAF, as well as Random House's Vintage line and a clutch of small presses, that offer the possibility of a long life for much serious fiction.

It could be said that the Wallace novel is a seriously funny book about a collection of off-the-wall characters. It is -- well, sort of -- the 463-page odyssey of young Lenore Stonecipher Beadsman, who works on a deranged switchboard and owns a talkative cockateel that becomes a star of television evangelical broadcasting and is searching for her missing great-grandmother, a Wittgenstein authority. It is about Lenore's boss, Rick Vigorous, who makes up for sexual incapacity by telling wonderfully sick stories. It is also Amherst as Animal House. Mr. Wallace, who was not happy there, has taken this revenge.

But then you can't be sure. In several of the book's psychiatric sessions, Mr. Wallace seems to impale modern psychotherapy. When you ask him about that, he confides, "I tend only to be able to have people say stuff that I think is serious if I'm simultaneously making fun of the character. I think that's a weakness. It comes from being really self-conscious." The novel's main setting is Cleveland, which, of course, Mr. Wallace has never seen. A Middle-Westerner -- he grew up in Champaign, Ill., where his father is a philosophy professor at the University of Illinois -- he wanted a heartland city that he could imagine instead of describe.

The book is also, sort of, about the way in which language sustains us and fails us. His title would seem to come from a Wittgensteinian model that proposes that what is fundamental to the broom -- bristles or stick -- depends on whether you want to sweep the floor or break windows. But the author wants you to know that "The Broom of the System" is also what his mother, a community-college teacher, calls roughage or dietary fiber.

Because of the crazy names and the absurdist comic edge to his narratives, reviewers often mention him in the same sentence with Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo. Mr. Wallace wishes they wouldn't: "These are writers I admire but the five-year-old in me pushes out its lower lip and says, 'Well, no, I'm a person, too. I do my own work.'" Besides, one of his heaviest influences has gone totally unnoticed. "The Broom" has entire virtuoso chapters of uninterrupted dialogue that, its author says, are indebted to Manuel Puig.

In his work habits, Mr. Wallace turns out to be nearly as eccentric as his characters. He seems to be able to write early drafts only in busy public places.

Museums and restaurants are preferred; when he reaches a late stage of composition, he will settle for a heavily trafficked library. Maybe, he speculates, he needs to be engaged in writing as a "secret" activity. Conceivably, his imagination is even fueled by a vaguely "illicit" setting. "It's totally neurotic," he says good-naturedly.

This summer, Mr. Wallace gets to spend half the season at Yaddo, a upstate New York writer's colony, where he plans to complete his first collection of short stories. It's not too early to worry about how he's going to do that in a woodland setting known and sought for the absolute isolation and privacy with which it succors the average creative spirit.}}

Federer as Religious Experience
By DAVID FOSTER WALLACE

Correction Appended

Almost anyone who loves tennis and follows the men's tour on television has, over the last few years, had what might be termed Federer Moments. These are times, as you watch the young Swiss play, when the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you're O.K.

The Moments are more intense if you've played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do. We've all got our examples. Here is one. It's the finals of the 2005 U.S. Open, Federer serving to Andre Agassi early in the fourth set. There's a medium-long exchange of groundstrokes, one with the distinctive butterfly shape of today's power-baseline game, Federer and Agassi yanking each other from side to side, each trying to set up the baseline winner...until suddenly Agassi hits a hard heavy cross-court backhand that pulls Federer way out wide to his ad (=left) side, and Federer gets to it but slices the stretch backhand short, a couple feet past the service line, which of course is the sort of thing Agassi dines out on, and as Federer's scrambling to reverse and get back to center, Agassi's moving in to take the short ball on the rise, and he smacks it hard right back into the same ad corner, trying to wrong-foot Federer, which in fact he does --- Federer's still near the corner but running toward the centerline, and the ball's heading to a point behind him now, where he just was, and there's no time to turn his body around, and Agassi's following the shot in to the net at an angle from the backhand side...and what Federer now does is somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward three or four steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of his backhand corner, all his weight moving backward, and the forehand is a topspin screamer down the line past Agassi at net, who lunges for it but the ball's past him, and it flies straight down the sideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of Agassi's side, a winner --- Federer's still dancing backward as it lands. And there's that familiar little second of shocked silence from the New York crowd before it erupts, and John McEnroe with his color man's headset on TV says (mostly to himself, it sounds like), ``How do you hit a winner from that position?'' And he's right: given Agassi's position and world-class quickness, Federer had to send that ball down a two-inch pipe of space in order to pass him, which he did, moving backwards, with no setup time and none of his weight behind the shot. It was impossible. It was like something out of ``The Matrix.'' I don't know what-all sounds were involved, but my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over the couch and I was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like novelty-shop eyeballs.

Anyway, that's one example of a Federer Moment, and that was merely on TV --- and the truth is that TV tennis is to live tennis pretty much as video porn is to the felt reality of human love.

Journalistically speaking, there is no hot news to offer you about Roger Federer. He is, at 25, the best tennis player currently alive. Maybe the best ever. Bios and profiles abound. ``60 Minutes'' did a feature on him just last year. Anything you want to know about Mr. Roger N.M.I. Federer --- his background, his home town of Basel, Switzerland, his parents' sane and unexploitative support of his talent, his junior tennis career, his early problems with fragility and temper, his beloved junior coach, how that coach's accidental death in 2002 both shattered and annealed Federer and helped make him what he now is, Federer's 39 career singles titles, his eight Grand Slams, his unusually steady and mature commitment to the girlfriend who travels with him (which on the men's tour is rare) and handles his affairs (which on the men's tour is unheard of), his old-school stoicism and mental toughness and good sportsmanship and evident overall decency and thoughtfulness and charitable largess --- it's all just a Google search away. Knock yourself out.

This present article is more about a spectator's experience of Federer, and its context. The specific thesis here is that if you've never seen the young man play live, and then do, in person, on the sacred grass of Wimbledon, through the literally withering heat and then wind and rain of the '06 fortnight, then you are apt to have what one of the tournament's press bus drivers describes as a ``bloody near-religious experience.'' It may be tempting, at first, to hear a phrase like this as just one more of the overheated tropes that people resort to to describe the feeling of Federer Moments. But the driver's phrase turns out to be true --- literally, for an instant ecstatically --- though it takes some time and serious watching to see this truth emerge.

Beauty is not the goal of competitive sports, but high-level sports are a prime venue for the expression of human beauty. The relation is roughly that of courage to war.

The human beauty we're talking about here is beauty of a particular type; it might be called kinetic beauty. Its power and appeal are universal. It has nothing to do with sex or cultural norms. What it seems to have to do with, really, is human beings' reconciliation with the fact of having a body.(1)

Of course, in men's sports no one ever talks about beauty or grace or the body. Men may profess their ``love'' of sports, but that love must always be cast and enacted in the symbology of war: elimination vs. advance, hierarchy of rank and standing, obsessive statistics, technical analysis, tribal and/or nationalist fervor, uniforms, mass noise, banners, chest-thumping, face-painting, etc. For reasons that are not well understood, war's codes are safer for most of us than love's. You too may find them so, in which case Spain's mesomorphic and totally martial Rafael Nadal is the man's man for you --- he of the unsleeved biceps and Kabuki self-exhortations. Plus Nadal is also Federer's nemesis and the big surprise of this year's Wimbledon, since he's a clay-court specialist and no one expected him to make it past the first few rounds here. Whereas Federer, through the semifinals, has provided no surprise or competitive drama at all. He's outplayed each opponent so completely that the TV and print press are worried his matches are dull and can't compete effectively with the nationalist fervor of the World Cup.(2)

July 9's men's final, though, is everyone's dream. Nadal vs. Federer is a replay of last month's French Open final, which Nadal won. Federer has so far lost only four matches all year, but they've all been to Nadal. Still, most of these matches have been on slow clay, Nadal's best surface. Grass is Federer's best. On the other hand, the first week's heat has baked out some of the Wimbledon courts' slickness and made them slower. There's also the fact that Nadal has adjusted his clay-based game to grass --- moving in closer to the baseline on his groundstrokes, amping up his serve, overcoming his allergy to the net. He just about disemboweled Agassi in the third round. The networks are in ecstasies. Before the match, on Centre Court, behind the glass slits above the south backstop, as the linesmen are coming out on court in their new Ralph Lauren uniforms that look so much like children's navalwear, the broadcast commentators can be seen practically bouncing up and down in their chairs. This Wimbledon final's got the revenge narrative, the king-versus-regicide dynamic, the stark character contrasts. It's the passionate machismo of southern Europe versus the intricate clinical artistry of the north. Apollo and Dionysus. Scalpel and cleaver. Righty and southpaw. Nos. 1 and 2 in the world. Nadal, the man who's taken the modern power-baseline game just as far as it goes, versus a man who's transfigured that modern game, whose precision and variety are as big a deal as his pace and foot-speed, but who may be peculiarly vulnerable to, or psyched out by, that first man. A British sportswriter, exulting with his mates in the press section, says, twice, ``It's going to be a war.''

Plus it's in the cathedral of Centre Court. And the men's final is always on the fortnight's second Sunday, the symbolism of which Wimbledon emphasizes by always omitting play on the first Sunday. And the spattery gale that has knocked over parking signs and everted umbrellas all morning suddenly quits an hour before match time, the sun emerging just as Centre Court's tarp is rolled back and the net posts driven home.

Federer and Nadal come out to applause, make their ritual bows to the nobles' box. The Swiss is in the buttermilk-colored sport coat that Nike's gotten him to wear for Wimbledon this year. On Federer, and perhaps on him alone, it doesn't look absurd with shorts and sneakers. The Spaniard eschews all warm-up clothing, so you have to look at his muscles right away. He and the Swiss are both in all-Nike, up to the very same kind of tied white Nike hankie with the swoosh positioned above the third eye. Nadal tucks his hair under his hankie, but Federer doesn't, and smoothing and fussing with the bits of hair that fall over the hankie is the main Federer tic TV viewers get to see; likewise Nadal's obsessive retreat to the ballboy's towel between points. There happen to be other tics and habits, though, tiny perks of live viewing. There's the great care Roger Federer takes to hang the sport coat over his spare courtside chair's back, just so, to keep it from wrinkling --- he's done this before each match here, and something about it seems childlike and weirdly sweet. Or the way he inevitably changes out his racket sometime in the second set, the new one always in the same clear plastic bag closed with blue tape, which he takes off carefully and always hands to a ballboy to dispose of. There's Nadal's habit of constantly picking his long shorts out of his bottom as he bounces the ball before serving, his way of always cutting his eyes warily from side to side as he walks the baseline, like a convict expecting to be shanked. And something odd on the Swiss's serve, if you look very closely. Holding ball and racket out in front, just before starting the motion, Federer always places the ball precisely in the V-shaped gap of the racket's throat, just below the head, just for an instant. If the fit isn't perfect, he adjusts the ball until it is. It happens very fast, but also every time, on both first serves and second.

Nadal and Federer now warm each other up for precisely five minutes; the umpire keeps time. There's a very definite order and etiquette to these pro warm-ups, which is something that television has decided you're not interested in seeing. Centre Court holds 13,000 and change. Another several thousand have done what people here do willingly every year, which is to pay a stiff general admission at the gate and then gather, with hampers and mosquito spray, to watch the match on an enormous TV screen outside Court 1. Your guess here is probably as good as anyone's.

Right before play, up at the net, there's a ceremonial coin-toss to see who'll serve first. It's another Wimbledon ritual. The honorary coin-tosser this year is William Caines, assisted by the umpire and tournament referee. William Caines is a 7-year-old from Kent who contracted liver cancer at age 2 and somehow survived after surgery and horrific chemo. He's here representing Cancer Research UK. He's blond and pink-cheeked and comes up to about Federer's waist. The crowd roars its approval of the re-enacted toss. Federer smiles distantly the whole time. Nadal, just across the net, keeps dancing in place like a boxer, swinging his arms from side to side. I'm not sure whether the U.S. networks show the coin-toss or not, whether this ceremony's part of their contractual obligation or whether they get to cut to commercial. As William's ushered off, there's more cheering, but it's scattered and disorganized; most of the crowd can't quite tell what to do. It's like once the ritual's over, the reality of why this child was part of it sinks in. There's a feeling of something important, something both uncomfortable and not, about a child with cancer tossing this dream-final's coin. The feeling, what-all it might mean, has a tip-of-the-tongue-type quality that remains elusive for at least the first two sets.(3)

A top athlete's beauty is next to impossible to describe directly. Or to evoke. Federer's forehand is a great liquid whip, his backhand a one-hander that he can drive flat, load with topspin, or slice --- the slice with such snap that the ball turns shapes in the air and skids on the grass to maybe ankle height. His serve has world-class pace and a degree of placement and variety no one else comes close to; the service motion is lithe and uneccentric, distinctive (on TV) only in a certain eel-like all-body snap at the moment of impact. His anticipation and court sense are otherworldly, and his footwork is the best in the game --- as a child, he was also a soccer prodigy. All this is true, and yet none of it really explains anything or evokes the experience of watching this man play. Of witnessing, firsthand, the beauty and genius of his game. You more have to come at the aesthetic stuff obliquely, to talk around it, or --- as Aquinas did with his own ineffable subject --- to try to define it in terms of what it is not.

One thing it is not is televisable. At least not entirely. TV tennis has its advantages, but these advantages have disadvantages, and chief among them is a certain illusion of intimacy. Television's slow-mo replays, its close-ups and graphics, all so privilege viewers that we're not even aware of how much is lost in broadcast. And a large part of what's lost is the sheer physicality of top tennis, a sense of the speeds at which the ball is moving and the players are reacting. This loss is simple to explain. TV's priority, during a point, is coverage of the whole court, a comprehensive view, so that viewers can see both players and the overall geometry of the exchange. Television therefore chooses a specular vantage that is overhead and behind one baseline. You, the viewer, are above and looking down from behind the court. This perspective, as any art student will tell you, ``foreshortens'' the court. Real tennis, after all, is three-dimensional, but a TV screen's image is only 2-D. The dimension that's lost (or rather distorted) on the screen is the real court's length, the 78 feet between baselines; and the speed with which the ball traverses this length is a shot's pace, which on TV is obscured, and in person is fearsome to behold. That may sound abstract or overblown, in which case by all means go in person to some professional tournament --- especially to the outer courts in early rounds, where you can sit 20 feet from the sideline --- and sample the difference for yourself. If you've watched tennis only on television, you simply have no idea how hard these pros are hitting the ball, how fast the ball is moving,(4) how little time the players have to get to it, and how quickly they're able to move and rotate and strike and recover. And none are faster, or more deceptively effortless about it, than Roger Federer.

Interestingly, what is less obscured in TV coverage is Federer's intelligence, since this intelligence often manifests as angle. Federer is able to see, or create, gaps and angles for winners that no one else can envision, and television's perspective is perfect for viewing and reviewing these Federer Moments. What's harder to appreciate on TV is that these spectacular-looking angles and winners are not coming from nowhere --- they're often set up several shots ahead, and depend as much on Federer's manipulation of opponents' positions as they do on the pace or placement of the coup de gr{\^a}ce. And understanding how and why Federer is able to move other world-class athletes around this way requires, in turn, a better technical understanding of the modern power-baseline game than TV --- again --- is set up to provide.

Wimbledon is strange. Verily it is the game's Mecca, the cathedral of tennis; but it would be easier to sustain the appropriate level of on-site veneration if the tournament weren't so intent on reminding you over and over that it's the cathedral of tennis. There's a peculiar mix of stodgy self-satisfaction and relentless self-promotion and -branding. It's a bit like the sort of authority figure whose office wall has every last plaque, diploma, and award he's ever gotten, and every time you come into the office you're forced to look at the wall and say something to indicate that you're impressed. Wimbledon's own walls, along nearly every significant corridor and passage, are lined with posters and signs featuring shots of past champions, lists of Wimbledon facts and trivia, historic lore, and so on. Some of this stuff is interesting; some is just odd. The Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum, for instance, has a collection of all the various kinds of rackets used here through the decades, and one of the many signs along the Level 2 passage of the Millennium Building(5) promotes this exhibition with both photos and didactic text, a kind of History of the Racket. Here, sic, is the climactic end of this text:

    Today's lightweight frames made of space-age materials like graphite, boron, titanium and ceramics, with larger heads --- mid-size (90-95 square inches) and over-size (110 square inches) --- have totally transformed the character of the game. Nowadays it is the powerful hitters who dominate with heavy topspin. Serve-and-volley players and those who rely on subtlety and touch have virtually disappeared.

It seems odd, to say the least, that such a diagnosis continues to hang here so prominently in the fourth year of Federer's reign over Wimbledon, since the Swiss has brought to men's tennis degrees of touch and subtlety unseen since (at least) the days of McEnroe's prime. But the sign's really just a testament to the power of dogma. For almost two decades, the party line's been that certain advances in racket technology, conditioning, and weight training have transformed pro tennis from a game of quickness and finesse into one of athleticism and brute power. And as an etiology of today's power-baseline game, this party line is broadly accurate. Today's pros truly are measurably bigger, stronger, and better conditioned,(6) and high-tech composite rackets really have increased their capacities for pace and spin. How, then, someone of Federer's consummate finesse has come to dominate the men's tour is a source of wide and dogmatic confusion.

There are three kinds of valid explanation for Federer's ascendancy. One kind involves mystery and metaphysics and is, I think, closest to the real truth. The others are more technical and make for better journalism.

The metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan,(7) who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could ``float'' across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type --- a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces. Particularly in the all-white that Wimbledon enjoys getting away with still requiring, he looks like what he may well (I think) be: a creature whose body is both flesh and, somehow, light.

This thing about the ball cooperatively hanging there, slowing down, as if susceptible to the Swiss's will --- there's real metaphysical truth here. And in the following anecdote. After a July 7 semifinal in which Federer destroyed Jonas Bjorkman --- not just beat him, destroyed him --- and just before a requisite post-match news conference in which Bjorkman, who's friendly with Federer, says he was pleased to ``have the best seat in the house'' to watch the Swiss ``play the nearest to perfection you can play tennis,'' Federer and Bjorkman are chatting and joking around, and Bjorkman asks him just how unnaturally big the ball was looking to him out there, and Federer confirms that it was ``like a bowling ball or basketball.'' He means it just as a bantery, modest way to make Bjorkman feel better, to confirm that he's surprised by how unusually well he played today; but he's also revealing something about what tennis is like for him. Imagine that you're a person with preternaturally good reflexes and coordination and speed, and that you're playing high-level tennis. Your experience, in play, will not be that you possess phenomenal reflexes and speed; rather, it will seem to you that the tennis ball is quite large and slow-moving, and that you always have plenty of time to hit it. That is, you won't experience anything like the (empirically real) quickness and skill that the live audience, watching tennis balls move so fast they hiss and blur, will attribute to you.(8)

Velocity's just one part of it. Now we're getting technical. Tennis is often called a ``game of inches,'' but the clich{\'e} is mostly referring to where a shot lands. In terms of a player's hitting an incoming ball, tennis is actually more a game of micrometers: vanishingly tiny changes around the moment of impact will have large effects on how and where the ball travels. The same principle explains why even the smallest imprecision in aiming a rifle will still cause a miss if the target's far enough away.

By way of illustration, let's slow things way down. Imagine that you, a tennis player, are standing just behind your deuce corner's baseline. A ball is served to your forehand --- you pivot (or rotate) so that your side is to the ball's incoming path and start to take your racket back for the forehand return. Keep visualizing up to where you're about halfway into the stroke's forward motion; the incoming ball is now just off your front hip, maybe six inches from point of impact. Consider some of the variables involved here. On the vertical plane, angling your racket face just a couple degrees forward or back will create topspin or slice, respectively; keeping it perpendicular will produce a flat, spinless drive. Horizontally, adjusting the racket face ever so slightly to the left or right, and hitting the ball maybe a millisecond early or late, will result in a cross-court versus down-the-line return. Further slight changes in the curves of your groundstroke's motion and follow-through will help determine how high your return passes over the net, which, together with the speed at which you're swinging (along with certain characteristics of the spin you impart), will affect how deep or shallow in the opponent's court your return lands, how high it bounces, etc. These are just the broadest distinctions, of course --- like, there's heavy topspin vs. light topspin, or sharply cross-court vs. only slightly cross-court, etc. There are also the issues of how close you're allowing the ball to get to your body, what grip you're using, the extent to which your knees are bent and/or weight's moving forward, and whether you're able simultaneously to watch the ball and to see what your opponent's doing after he serves. These all matter, too. Plus there's the fact that you're not putting a static object into motion here but rather reversing the flight and (to a varying extent) spin of a projectile coming toward you --- coming, in the case of pro tennis, at speeds that make conscious thought impossible. Mario Ancic's first serve, for instance, often comes in around 130 m.p.h. Since it's 78 feet from Ancic's baseline to yours, that means it takes 0.41 seconds for his serve to reach you.(9) This is less than the time it takes to blink quickly, twice.

The upshot is that pro tennis involves intervals of time too brief for deliberate action. Temporally, we're more in the operative range of reflexes, purely physical reactions that bypass conscious thought. And yet an effective return of serve depends on a large set of decisions and physical adjustments that are a whole lot more involved and intentional than blinking, jumping when startled, etc.

Successfully returning a hard-served tennis ball requires what's sometimes called ``the kinesthetic sense,'' meaning the ability to control the body and its artificial extensions through complex and very quick systems of tasks. English has a whole cloud of terms for various parts of this ability: feel, touch, form, proprioception, coordination, hand-eye coordination, kinesthesia, grace, control, reflexes, and so on. For promising junior players, refining the kinesthetic sense is the main goal of the extreme daily practice regimens we often hear about.(10) The training here is both muscular and neurological. Hitting thousands of strokes, day after day, develops the ability to do by ``feel'' what cannot be done by regular conscious thought. Repetitive practice like this often looks tedious or even cruel to an outsider, but the outsider can't feel what's going on inside the player --- tiny adjustments, over and over, and a sense of each change's effects that gets more and more acute even as it recedes from normal consciousness.(11)

The time and discipline required for serious kinesthetic training are one reason why top pros are usually people who've devoted most of their waking lives to tennis, starting (at the very latest) in their early teens. It was, for example, at age 13 that Roger Federer finally gave up soccer, and a recognizable childhood, and entered Switzerland's national tennis training center in Ecublens. At 16, he dropped out of classroom studies and started serious international competition.

It was only weeks after quitting school that Federer won Junior Wimbledon. Obviously, this is something that not every junior who devotes himself to tennis can do. Just as obviously, then, there is more than time and training involved --- there is also sheer talent, and degrees of it. Extraordinary kinesthetic ability must be present (and measurable) in a kid just to make the years of practice and training worthwhile...but from there, over time, the cream starts to rise and separate. So one type of technical explanation for Federer's dominion is that he's just a bit more kinesthetically talented than the other male pros. Only a little bit, since everyone in the Top 100 is himself kinesthetically gifted --- but then, tennis is a game of inches.

This answer is plausible but incomplete. It would probably not have been incomplete in 1980. In 2006, though, it's fair to ask why this kind of talent still matters so much. Recall what is true about dogma and Wimbledon's sign. Kinesthetic virtuoso or no, Roger Federer is now dominating the largest, strongest, fittest, best-trained and -coached field of male pros who've ever existed, with everyone using a kind of nuclear racket that's said to have made the finer calibrations of kinesthetic sense irrelevant, like trying to whistle Mozart during a Metallica concert.

According to reliable sources, honorary coin-tosser William Caines's backstory is that one day, when he was 2 1/2, his mother found a lump in his tummy, and took him to the doctor, and the lump was diagnosed as a malignant liver tumor. At which point one cannot, of course, imagine...a tiny child undergoing chemo, serious chemo, his mother having to watch, carry him home, nurse him, then bring him back to that place for more chemo. How did she answer her child's question --- the big one, the obvious one? And who could answer hers? What could any priest or pastor say that wouldn't be grotesque?

It's 2-1 Nadal in the final's second set, and he's serving. Federer won the first set at love but then flagged a bit, as he sometimes does, and is quickly down a break. Now, on Nadal's ad, there's a 16-stroke point. Nadal is serving a lot faster than he did in Paris, and this one's down the center. Federer floats a soft forehand high over the net, which he can get away with because Nadal never comes in behind his serve. The Spaniard now hits a characteristically heavy topspin forehand deep to Federer's backhand; Federer comes back with an even heavier topspin backhand, almost a clay-court shot. It's unexpected and backs Nadal up, slightly, and his response is a low hard short ball that lands just past the service line's T on Federer's forehand side. Against most other opponents, Federer could simply end the point on a ball like this, but one reason Nadal gives him trouble is that he's faster than the others, can get to stuff they can't; and so Federer here just hits a flat, medium-hard cross-court forehand, going not for a winner but for a low, shallowly angled ball that forces Nadal up and out to the deuce side, his backhand. Nadal, on the run, backhands it hard down the line to Federer's backhand; Federer slices it right back down the same line, slow and floaty with backspin, making Nadal come back to the same spot. Nadal slices the ball right back --- three shots now all down the same line --- and Federer slices the ball back to the same spot yet again, this one even slower and floatier, and Nadal gets planted and hits a big two-hander back down the same line --- it's like Nadal's camped out now on his deuce side; he's no longer moving all the way back to the baseline's center between shots; Federer's hypnotized him a little. Federer now hits a very hard, deep topspin backhand, the kind that hisses, to a point just slightly on the ad side of Nadal's baseline, which Nadal gets to and forehands cross-court; and Federer responds with an even harder, heavier cross-court backhand, baseline-deep and moving so fast that Nadal has to hit the forehand off his back foot and then scramble to get back to center as the shot lands maybe two feet short on Federer's backhand side again. Federer steps to this ball and now hits a totally different cross-court backhand, this one much shorter and sharper-angled, an angle no one would anticipate, and so heavy and blurred with topspin that it lands shallow and just inside the sideline and takes off hard after the bounce, and Nadal can't move in to cut it off and can't get to it laterally along the baseline, because of all the angle and topspin --- end of point. It's a spectacular winner, a Federer Moment; but watching it live, you can see that it's also a winner that Federer started setting up four or even five shots earlier. Everything after that first down-the-line slice was designed by the Swiss to maneuver Nadal and lull him and then disrupt his rhythm and balance and open up that last, unimaginable angle --- an angle that would have been impossible without extreme topspin.

Extreme topspin is the hallmark of today's power-baseline game. This is something that Wimbledon's sign gets right.(12) Why topspin is so key, though, is not commonly understood. What's commonly understood is that high-tech composite rackets impart much more pace to the ball, rather like aluminum baseball bats as opposed to good old lumber. But that dogma is false. The truth is that, at the same tensile strength, carbon-based composites are lighter than wood, and this allows modern rackets to be a couple ounces lighter and at least an inch wider across the face than the vintage Kramer and Maxply. It's the width of the face that's vital. A wider face means there's more total string area, which means the sweet spot's bigger. With a composite racket, you don't have to meet the ball in the precise geometric center of the strings in order to generate good pace. Nor must you be spot-on to generate topspin, a spin that (recall) requires a tilted face and upwardly curved stroke, brushing over the ball rather than hitting flat through it --- this was quite hard to do with wood rackets, because of their smaller face and niggardly sweet spot. Composites' lighter, wider heads and more generous centers let players swing faster and put way more topspin on the ball...and, in turn, the more topspin you put on the ball, the harder you can hit it, because there's more margin for error. Topspin causes the ball to pass high over the net, describe a sharp arc, and come down fast into the opponent's court (instead of maybe soaring out).

So the basic formula here is that composite rackets enable topspin, which in turn enables groundstrokes vastly faster and harder than 20 years ago --- it's common now to see male pros pulled up off the ground and halfway around in the air by the force of their strokes, which in the old days was something one saw only in Jimmy Connors.

Connors was not, by the way, the father of the power-baseline game. He whaled mightily from the baseline, true, but his groundstrokes were flat and spinless and had to pass very low over the net. Nor was Bjorn Borg a true power-baseliner. Both Borg and Connors played specialized versions of the classic baseline game, which had evolved as a counterforce to the even more classic serve-and-volley game, which was itself the dominant form of men's power tennis for decades, and of which John McEnroe was the greatest modern exponent. You probably know all this, and may also know that McEnroe toppled Borg and then more or less ruled the men's game until the appearance, around the mid-1980's, of (a) modern composite rackets(13) and (b) Ivan Lendl, who played with an early form of composite and was the true progenitor of power-baseline tennis.(14)

Ivan Lendl was the first top pro whose strokes and tactics appeared to be designed around the special capacities of the composite racket. His goal was to win points from the baseline, via either passing shots or outright winners. His weapon was his groundstrokes, especially his forehand, which he could hit with overwhelming pace because of the amount of topspin he put on the ball. The blend of pace and topspin also allowed Lendl to do something that proved crucial to the advent of the power-baseline game. He could pull off radical, extraordinary angles on hard-hit groundstrokes, mainly because of the speed with which heavy topspin makes the ball dip and land without going wide. In retrospect, this changed the whole physics of aggressive tennis. For decades, it had been angle that made the serve-and-volley game so lethal. The closer one is to the net, the more of the opponent's court is open --- the classic advantage of volleying was that you could hit angles that would go way wide if attempted from the baseline or midcourt. But topspin on a groundstroke, if it's really extreme, can bring the ball down fast and shallow enough to exploit many of these same angles. Especially if the groundstroke you're hitting is off a somewhat short ball --- the shorter the ball, the more angles are possible. Pace, topspin, and aggressive baseline angles: and lo, it's the power-baseline game.

It wasn't that Ivan Lendl was an immortally great tennis player. He was simply the first top pro to demonstrate what heavy topspin and raw power could achieve from the baseline. And, most important, the achievement was replicable, just like the composite racket. Past a certain threshold of physical talent and training, the main requirements were athleticism, aggression, and superior strength and conditioning. The result (omitting various complications and subspecialties(15)) has been men's pro tennis for the last 20 years: ever bigger, stronger, fitter players generating unprecedented pace and topspin off the ground, trying to force the short or weak ball that they can put away.

Illustrative stat: When Lleyton Hewitt defeated David Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon men's final, there was not one single serve-and-volley point.(16)

The generic power-baseline game is not boring --- certainly not compared with the two-second points of old-time serve-and-volley or the moon-ball tedium of classic baseline attrition. But it is somewhat static and limited; it is not, as pundits have publicly feared for years, the evolutionary endpoint of tennis. The player who's shown this to be true is Roger Federer. And he's shown it from within the modern game.

This within is what's important here; this is what a purely neural account leaves out. And it is why sexy attributions like touch and subtlety must not be misunderstood. With Federer, it's not either/or. The Swiss has every bit of Lendl and Agassi's pace on his groundstrokes, and leaves the ground when he swings, and can out-hit even Nadal from the backcourt.(17) What's strange and wrong about Wimbledon's sign, really, is its overall dolorous tone. Subtlety, touch, and finesse are not dead in the power-baseline era. For it is, still, in 2006, very much the power-baseline era: Roger Federer is a first-rate, kick-ass power-baseliner. It's just that that's not all he is. There's also his intelligence, his occult anticipation, his court sense, his ability to read and manipulate opponents, to mix spins and speeds, to misdirect and disguise, to use tactical foresight and peripheral vision and kinesthetic range instead of just rote pace --- all this has exposed the limits, and possibilities, of men's tennis as it's now played.

Which sounds very high-flown and nice, of course, but please understand that with this guy it's not high-flown or abstract. Or nice. In the same emphatic, empirical, dominating way that Lendl drove home his own lesson, Roger Federer is showing that the speed and strength of today's pro game are merely its skeleton, not its flesh. He has, figuratively and literally, re-embodied men's tennis, and for the first time in years the game's future is unpredictable. You should have seen, on the grounds' outside courts, the variegated ballet that was this year's Junior Wimbledon. Drop volleys and mixed spins, off-speed serves, gambits planned three shots ahead --- all as well as the standard-issue grunts and booming balls. Whether anything like a nascent Federer was here among these juniors can't be known, of course. Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform --- and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.

Correction: Aug. 27, 2006

An article in PLAY magazine last Sunday about the tennis player Roger Federer referred incompletely to a point between Federer and Andre Agassi in the 2005 United States Open final and incorrectly described Agassi's position on the final shot of the point. There was an exchange of groundstrokes in the middle of the point that was not described. And Agassi remained at the baseline on Federer's winning shot; he did not go to the net.

Footnotes

(1) There's a great deal that's bad about having a body. If this is not so obviously true that no one needs examples, we can just quickly mention pain, sores, odors, nausea, aging, gravity, sepsis, clumsiness, illness, limits --- every last schism between our physical wills and our actual capacities. Can anyone doubt we need help being reconciled? Crave it? It's your body that dies, after all.

There are wonderful things about having a body, too, obviously --- it's just that these things are much harder to feel and appreciate in real time. Rather like certain kinds of rare, peak-type sensuous epiphanies (``I'm so glad I have eyes to see this sunrise!'' etc.), great athletes seem to catalyze our awareness of how glorious it is to touch and perceive, move through space, interact with matter. Granted, what great athletes can do with their bodies are things that the rest of us can only dream of. But these dreams are important --- they make up for a lot.

(2) The U.S. media here are especially worried because no Americans of either sex survived into even the quarterfinals this year. (If you're into obscure statistics, it's the first time this has happened at Wimbledon since 1911.)

(3) Actually, this is not the only Federer-and-sick-child incident of Wimbledon's second week. Three days prior to the men's final, a Special One-on-One Interview with Mr. Roger Federer() takes place in a small, crowded International Tennis Federation office just off the third floor of the Press Center. Right afterward, as the ATP player-rep is ushering Federer out the back door for his next scheduled obligation, one of the I.T.F. guys (who's been talking loudly on the telephone through the whole Special Interview) now comes up and asks for a moment of Roger's time. The man, who has the same slight, generically foreign accent as all I.T.F. guys, says: ``Listen, I hate doing this. I don't do this, normally. It's for my neighbor. His kid has a disease. They will do a fund-raiser, it's planned, and I'm asking can you sign a shirt or something, you know --- something.'' He looks mortified. The ATP rep is glaring at him. Federer, though, just nods, shrugs: ``No problem. I'll bring it tomorrow.'' Tomorrow's the men's semifinal. Evidently the I.T.F. guy has meant one of Federer's own shirts, maybe from the match, with Federer's actual sweat on it. (Federer throws his used wristbands into the crowd after matches, and the people they land on seem pleased rather than grossed out.) The I.T.F. guy, after thanking Federer three times very fast, shakes his head: ``I hate doing this.'' Federer, still halfway out the door: ``It's no problem.'' And it isn't. Like all pros, Federer changes his shirt during matches, and he can just have somebody save one, and then he'll sign it. It's not like Federer's being Gandhi here --- he doesn't stop and ask for details about the kid or his illness. He doesn't pretend to care more than he does. The request is just one more small, mildly distracting obligation he has to deal with. But he does say yes, and he will remember --- you can tell. And it won't distract him; he won't permit it. He's good at this kind of stuff, too.

() (Only considerations of space and basic believability prevent a full description of the hassles involved in securing such a One-on-One. In brief, it's rather like the old story of someone climbing an enormous mountain to talk to the man seated lotus on top, except in this case the mountain is composed entirely of sports-bureaucrats.)

(4) Top men's serves often reach speeds of 125-135 m.p.h., true, but what all the radar signs and graphics neglect to tell you is that male power-baseliners' groundstrokes themselves are often traveling at over 90 m.p.h., which is the speed of a big-league fastball. If you get down close enough to a pro court, you can hear an actual sound coming off the ball in flight, a kind of liquid hiss, from the combination of pace and spin. Close up and live, you'll also understand better the ``open stance'' that's become such an emblem of the power-baseline game. The term, after all, just means not turning one's side all the way to the net before hitting a groundstroke, and one reason why so many power-baseliners hit from the open stance is that the ball is now coming too fast for them to get turned all the way.

(5) This is the large (and presumably six-year-old) structure where Wimbledon's administration, players, and media all have their respective areas and HQs.

(6) (Some, like Nadal or Serena Williams, look more like cartoon superheroes than people.)

(7) When asked, during the aforementioned Special One-on-One Interview, for examples of other athletes whose performances might seem beautiful to him, Federer mentions Jordan first, then Kobe Bryant, then ``a soccer player like --- guys who play very relaxed, like a Zin{\'e}dine Zidane or something: he does great effort, but he seems like he doesn't need to try hard to get the results.''

Federer's response to the subsequent question, which is what-all he makes of it when pundits and other players describe his own game as ``beautiful,'' is interesting mainly because the response is pleasant, intelligent, and cooperative --- as is Federer himself --- without ever really saying anything (because, in fairness, what could one say about others' descriptions of him as beautiful? What would you say? It's ultimately a stupid question): ``It's always what people see first --- for them, that's what you are `best at.' When you used to watch John McEnroe, you know, the first time, what would you see? You would see a guy with incredible talent, because the way he played, nobody played like this. The way he played the ball, it was just all about feel. And then you go over to Boris Becker, and right away you saw a powerful player, you know?() When you see me play, you see a `beautiful' player --- and maybe after that you maybe see that he's fast, maybe you see that he's got a good forehand, maybe then you see that he has a good serve. First, you know, you have a base, and to me, I think it's great, you know, and I'm very lucky to be called basically `beautiful,' you know, for style of play. ... With me it's, like, `the beautiful player,' and that's really cool.''

() N.B. Federer's big conversational tics are ``maybe'' and ``you know.'' Ultimately, these tics are helpful because they serve as reminders of how appallingly young he really is. If you're interested, the world's best tennis player is wearing white warm-up pants and a long-sleeved white microfiber shirt, possibly Nike. No sport coat, though. His handshake is only moderately firm, though the hand itself is like a carpentry rasp (for obvious reasons, tennis players tend to be very callusy). He's a bit bigger than TV makes him seem --- broader-shouldered, deeper in the chest. He's next to a table that's covered with visors and headbands, which he's been autographing with a Sharpie. He sits with his legs crossed and smiles pleasantly and seems very relaxed; he never fidgets with the Sharpie. One's overall impression is that Federer is either a very nice guy or a guy who's very good at dealing with the media --- or (most likely) both.

(8) Special One-on-One support from the man himself for this claim: ``It's interesting, because this week, actually, Ancic [comma Mario, the towering Top-10 Croatian whom Federer beat in Wednesday's quarterfinal] played on Centre Court against my friend, you know, the Swiss player Wawrinka [comma Stanislas, Federer's Davis Cup teammate], and I went to see it out where, you know, my girlfriend Mirka [Vavrinec, a former women's Top-100 player, knocked out by injury, who now basically functions as Federer's Alice B. Toklas] usually sits, and I went to see --- for the first time since I have come here to Wimbledon, I went to see a match on Centre Court, and I was also surprised, actually, how fast, you know, the serve is and how fast you have to react to be able to get the ball back, especially when a guy like Mario [Ancic, who's known for his vicious serve] serves, you know? But then once you're on the court yourself, it's totally different, you know, because all you see is the ball, really, and you don't see the speed of the ball.... ''

(9) We're doing the math here with the ball traveling as the crow flies, for simplicity. Please do not write in with corrections. If you want to factor in the serve's bounce and so compute the total distance traveled by the ball as the sum of an oblique triangle's() two shorter legs, then by all means go ahead --- you'll end up with between two and five additional hundredths of a second, which is not significant.

() (The slower a tennis court's surface, the closer to a right triangle you're going to have. On fast grass, the bounce's angle is always oblique.)

(10) Conditioning is also important, but this is mainly because the first thing that physical fatigue attacks is the kinesthetic sense. (Other antagonists are fear, self-consciousness, and extreme upset --- which is why fragile psyches are rare in pro tennis.)

(11) The best lay analogy is probably to the way an experienced driver can make all of good driving's myriad little decisions and adjustments without having to pay attention to them.

(12) (...assuming, that is, that the sign's ``with heavy topspin'' is modifying ``dominate'' rather than ``powerful hitters,'' which actually it might or might not --- British grammar is a bit dodgy.)

(13) (which neither Connors nor McEnroe could switch to with much success --- their games were fixed around pre-modern rackets.)

(14) Formwise, with his whippy forehand, lethal one-hander, and merciless treatment of short balls, Lendl somewhat anticipated Federer. But the Czech was also stiff, cold, and brutal; his game was awesome but not beautiful. (My college doubles partner used to describe watching Lendl as like getting to see ``Triumph of the Will'' in 3-D.)

(15) See, for one example, the continued effectiveness of some serve-and-volley (mainly in the adapted, heavily ace- and quickness-dependent form of a Sampras or Rafter) on fast courts through the 1990's.

(16) It's also illustrative that 2002 was Wimbledon's last pre-Federer final.

(17) In the third set of the '06 final, at three games all and 30-15, Nadal kicks his second serve high to Federer's backhand. Nadal's clearly been coached to go high and heavy to Federer's backhand, and that's what he does, point after point. Federer slices the return back to Nadal's center and two feet short --- not short enough to let the Spaniard hit a winner, but short enough to draw him slightly into the court, whence Nadal winds up and puts all his forehand's strength into a hard heavy shot to (again) Federer's backhand. The pace he's put on the ball means that Nadal is still backpedaling to the baseline as Federer leaves his feet and cranks a very hard topspin backhand down the line to Nadal's deuce side, which Nadal --- out of position but world-class fast --- reaches and manages to one-hand back deep to (again) Federer's backhand side, but this ball's floaty and slow, and Federer has time to step around and hit an inside-out forehand, a forehand as hard as anyone's hit all tournament, with just enough topspin to bring it down in Nadal's ad corner, and the Spaniard gets there but can't return it. Big ovation. Again, what looks like an overwhelming baseline winner was actually set up by that first clever semi-short slice and Nadal's own predictability about where and how hard he'll hit every ball. Federer sure whaled that last forehand, though. People are looking at each other and applauding. The thing with Federer is that he's Mozart and Metallica at the same time, and the harmony's somehow exquisite.

By the way, it's right around here, or the next game, watching, that three separate inner-type things come together and mesh. One is a feeling of deep personal privilege at being alive to get to see this; another is the thought that William Caines is probably somewhere here in the Centre Court crowd, too, watching, maybe with his mum. The third thing is a sudden memory of the earnest way the press bus driver promised just this experience. Because there is one. It's hard to describe --- it's like a thought that's also a feeling. One wouldn't want to make too much of it, or to pretend that it's any sort of equitable balance; that would be grotesque. But the truth is that whatever deity, entity, energy, or random genetic flux produces sick children also produced Roger Federer, and just look at him down there. Look at that.

In its September, 1998 issue, the mainstream movie magazine Premiere ran a twelve-page article on our little awards show (Neither Adult Nor Entertainment). It has been suggested that the piece was written by award-winning author David Foster Wallace, with some help from Premiere editor Glenn Kenny.
Contrary to our best information, Hustler Erotic Video Guide editor Mike Albo vehemently denies having acted as a source to Wallace and Kenny. "I didn't have anything to do with that piece," says Albo. "You guys must feel pretty stupid."
While hysterical, the piece contained factual errors and was so colored by obvious editorializing that several of us here at AVN felt compelled to respond. Paul Fishbein's letter has been promised space in an upcoming issue of Premiere, and we're including Mark Kernes' and Kensington Smith's letters here in full. Enjoy.

Dear Mr. Meigs:

First, thank you for devoting approximately 12 pages of your high-profile, mainstream magazine to our Adult Video News Awards. Unfortunately, your funny and beautifully-worded article is also a shoddy piece of journalism, rife with errors and innuendo.
Bad reviews are part of the game; it could be argued that we here at AVN give bad reviews for a living. I do feel compelled to point out that AVN is a trade magazine for the adult industry: producers, talent, manufacturers, wholesalers, cable television buyers, foreign buyers, etc. Similarly, the AVN Awards are for the adult industry. We do not market tickets to consumers, so commentary about the show aimed at consumers is pointless.
The writers imply that the AVN Awards are rigged. Could this be libel? Your reporters seemed bent on damaging AVN's reputation; a reputation we have earned over fifteen years of service to the adult industry and the video retail community. News publications such as U.S. News and World Report, The L.A. Times, Time, Newsweek, Variety, and The New York Times have cited AVN sales charts and consulted with AVN editorial staff members. However, your reporters did not consult any of us. Not even about AVN itself. Had they asked us about the voting process, they could have learned that the ballots (all signed on every page) are available for inspection for a year after the awards ceremony. Had they called us for information, or indulged in some simple fact-checking, they could have inspected every ballot and recounted votes themselves. They could also have found out that Ellen Thompson uses her real name when writing regular reviews and articles, and the name "Ida Slapter" for her fetish-oriented copy, and because of this we included both names in the program booklet; but every writer has only one vote, as the ballots can testify.
Instead, the main sources for an article on our Awards show are two "experts" whose names no one in the industry seems to recognize.
The errors in the piece are too numerous to list here. But a few could easily have been avoided:
Page 91: Evil Angel's Jeff "Hatman" Marton, of the goatee and trademark fedora, is incorrectly identified as director Greg Dark, who did not attend CES this year.
Page 92: The Sands Casino, referred to as being "just outside [the CES]" does not exist. The Sands Hotel was razed in 1996 - and this includes the bar where Tom Byron supposedly held court nightly, as averred on page 100.
Page 93: This report has Jasmin St. Claire - with dyed (?) black hair- signing at the Xplor booth. Jasmin signed exclusively at Impressive.
Page 100: Suggesting that our awards trophies are stolen, or purchased "hot," is mystifying. Is there some big "hot trophy" market we're unaware of?
Page 102: Gene Ross is a 12-year employee of AVN, a senior editor and vice president; he is not, however, a co-owner.
Page 103: Security at the AVN Awards is mentioned in light of "problems with unauthorized Caesars employees sneaking in to catch the gala" the year before. Last year's show was held at the Riviera Hotel; not an impossible trek from Caesars, just unlikely.
Page 104: Robert Black did not win the AVN Breakthrough Award. Steve Orenstein of Wicked Pictures did.
I could go on, but the point has been made. Bad reviews are one thing. Bad journalism is another. And a brazen attempt to hurt someone else's reputation is something else entirely.

Sincerely yours,

Paul Fishbein
President

All at Premiere,
As a target of what amounts to an unsubstantiated attack on an already marginalized industry, I take issue with the gross, sensational Neither Adult Nor Entertainment, September, 1998. Is this the analog of responsible journalism at Premiere?
I find it reprehensible, your thesis statement about the Snuff Film being the guide for modern porn (page 106, capitalization the authors'; it's interesting to note that the "snuff film" is considered to be a myth by both law enforcement and industry professionals). It is exactly this kind of moralizing attitude which degrades the performers in porn, not the fact that pornography is becoming more acceptable all the time. Porn doesn't thrive because it's taboo; it thrives because humans have sex drives, and in our culture - thanks to the myopic, church-elder agenda of pieces such as yours - honoring one's sex drive is an act of subversion. It is this kind of "reportage" that puts the adult industry, sex work, rights for women, sexual equality and understanding, free speech, freedom from repression and guilt, and simple safety for sex performers back in the gutter - where these things "belong," no doubt. You must be so proud.
Speaking of suffrage, thanks for broadcasting your condemnation of our industry under the banner of "Feminists of all stripe" (page 92). You are the righteous defenders of helpless females everywhere! Wish you'd called any of the women on staff (like Ellen Thompson, so you could actually get a quote, rather than attributing to her something overheard - what is wrong with you people?) before damning pornography from the self-congratulatory high ground of "feminism." Have you ever heard of (and my apologies to those I haven't room to list) Annie Sprinkle, Susannah Breslin, Susie Bright, Tristan Taormino, Carol Queen, Betty Dodson, Candida Royalle, Gloria Leonard, Kathy Acker, Jane Hamilton, Pat Califia - your ignorance (or was it flat out ignoring to gird your point?) of this wave of pro-porn - and if I may, much more rational and humanist - feminism is unforgivable. Shame on you.
Finally, on your choice to let two juvenile sniffers ("mook"? In my four years writing about the industry, I've never heard that one - except from the pages of Hustler, hint hint) give reign to their adolescent prurience in the guise of reporting: I know plenty of writers with access to as many three-dollar words who can leave their repression at home when taking on the delicate, multi-dimensional task of reporting on the already stigmatized sex industry.

Rebecca Gray
a.k.a. Kensington Smith
Associate Editor

Dear Mr. Meigs,
Although my employer, Paul Fishbein, has also written to you concerning the article "Neither Adult Nor Entertainment" in your September issue, I am writing with somewhat different concerns; namely, the anti-porn agenda which the article's pseudonymous authors have brought to your readership.
To be sure, "deGroot" and "Rundlet" simply echo sentiments which can be found in hundreds of other publications, from the American Family Association newsletter to the New York Times. I had hoped, however, that Premiere's writers would be a little bit more incisive and inquisitive. I am disappointed to see that that was not the case.
My colleague Rebecca Gray has addressed the problem with "Feminists of all stripe oppose the contemporary adult industry... " so I won't reiterate what she wrote. But the authors' suggestion, through the quote from David Mura, that looking at pornography is equivalent to drug use, is beyond the pale. Mura claims masturbating to porn is "a way of numbing psychic pain," but the vast majority of porn viewers experience no "psychic pain" - simply horniness, which masturbation quickly relieves.
Mura further writes that "Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends to their business deals or last Sunday's sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer... reduces himself. He becomes stupid."
I wonder how the studio executives at Paramount or Touchstone would react if the titles Titanic or Saving Private Ryan or Armageddon were substituted for the word "pornography" in the above quote? The purpose of art is to enthrall the viewer; if it doesn't, the piece is, to that extent, less successful. That writers for a movie magazine like Premiere failed to realize this speaks more to the writers' agenda than Premiere's dedication to objective reporting.
Further, the writers' attempt to defame porn and its workers becomes clear with descriptions such as the one of Jasmin St. Claire as "a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket." Or that "the woodmen all avoid cameras like Mafiosi." One supposes they could have said, "like Alec Baldwin," who recently won an anti-paparazzi suit, but that simile wouldn't have fit the agenda.
Or consider, "The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the 'smoldering' sexuality of [Sharon] Stone and Madonna and [Pamela] Anderson Lee and so many other mainstream iconettes." What's laughable about this is that none of the "mainstream iconettes" (with the exception of Pam Lee's inadvertent sortie into porn with husband Tommy) are explicitly sexual, yet to "deGroot's" and "Rundlet's" twisted sensibilities, people who can be seen having sex on camera are somehow parodies of those who can't!
The writers' problem is made clear in the paragraph, on page 93, beginning, "For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair." It is a sorry commentary that those who cannot adjust to porn stars' open and relaxed sexuality seem duty-bound to defame it, as if there were something rational about being sexually repressed.
Even plainer is the statement in footnote 36 that "The psychology of porn seems always to have depended on a certain degree of shame, self-loathing and perception of 'sin.'" It is apparently inconceivable that actors could appear in porn movies simply because they are somewhat exhibitionistic, they like sex, and have managed to throw off the stifling hang-ups which all-too-many "normal" citizens learn by osmosis in American society! And their unfounded assumption that porn somehow thrives on unacceptability, when anyone who has cursorily studied the subject knows that "acceptability" is exactly what the industry is currently fighting for, only leads them deeper into the mire of idiotic statements like "the star that late-'90s porn is steering by is the Snuff Film." How ludicrous!
Perhaps the writers' problem is made more clear in the homo-panic statement (on page 104) that "the urge to look over/down at [Alex Sanders' and Dave Hardman's] penises is so overwhelming and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma)."
Much as they talk about "not wanting to go into it," understanding "complexity" is certainly not your writers' strong point. I only hope that they someday can come to the porn industry with open minds, and leave their "sin" concepts at the door.

Yours Truly,

Mark Kernes

To the Editor:

In his review of my ''Borges: A Life'' (Nov. 7), David Foster Wallace
gets up to the usual mischief of the dishonest reviewer --- quoting out
of context, twisting and trivializing statements and grossly
misrepresenting my aims and methods. And there is the deeper
dishonesty of his agreeing to review my book when he confesses to an
intrinsic hostility to the genre of literary biography itself.

He claims that my book ''misses the whole point'' of Borges, which is,
apparently, that his stories are ''inbent and hermetic,'' for his is a
mind turned ''wholly in on itself.'' Have I heard this before? Why,
only several hundred times, it seems, in 30-odd years of reading
Borges. Yet unlike Wallace, Borges always held that there was an
expressionist, autobiographical basis to all writing, including his
own. (''The stories were about myself, my personal experiences.'') I
hardly need Wallace to tell me that Borges's texts are densely
allusive and polyvalent, but for the purposes of my biography I chose
to concentrate largely on readings that would bring out their
emotional and psychological infrastructure --- a procedure not entirely
alien to Wallace, since he concedes in a footnote that ''so many of
the elements that appear over and over in Borges's fiction are symbols
of the psyche turned inward.''

Borges was, of course, preoccupied with the ''self-enclosed psyche,''
but this is only half the story, if that. There is another Borges whom
I reveal in my biography, and it is a pity, in this regard, that
Wallace could give your readers no inkling of the significance of the
failed romance with Norah Lange in the 1920's. Not only is this a
major discovery, it is the pivot on which the two sides of Borges's
literary personality turn, for the loss of Norah to a rival changed
Borges from an impassioned disciple of Whitman into the writer who was
eventually to write the ficciones. Most of his subsequent work was to
spring from a tension between Whitman and Kafka, as he put it ---
between a desire to redeem the self through writing and a horror of
what he called ''the nothingness of personality.'' (Wallace,
incidentally, hasn't noticed that ''Pierre Menard'' is not a
celebration but a bitter parody of the death of the author.)

I find it odd that this brave Young Turk of the literary scene should
want to keep Borges in a 60's groove. Has Wallace ventured far beyond
that copy of ''Labyrinths'' he came across on his father's bookshelves
in 1974? I want to rescue Borges from the postmodernists' embrace and
restore him to history, to the trials and tribulations of living in
this world, for only then can we get a truer measure of his
achievement.

Since this is a dispute over how best to read Borges, let me close
with the Borgesian conceit of a contest in which my
biographical-critical approach might be tested against the retro
readings of Wallace's tired postmodernism. Is he up for it? I wonder.

Oblivion: You Won't Find it Here

By Kristin Kearns '03

In the spring of my junior year at Pomona, a group of students trekked over to Sumner House to pick up David Foster Wallace. Over the next two days, Wallace would tour the campus, lead a writing workshop, give a reading and leave no doubt that he would soon be the holder of Pomona's new creative writing professorship. As an English Department liaison, I helped coordinate his visit, recruiting students to help me acquaint him with Pomona College. This wasn't hard; there was a waiting list of students, majoring in everything from math to philosophy, who wanted to hang out with David Foster Wallace.

That night, he came to the door wearing sweatpants and told us to call him Dave. Over dinner at Tutti Mangia, he talked to us about college classes; we discussed our favorite writers; I recall that I didn't like the polenta that came with my meal, so I gave him the rest. What I most clearly remember is what a good time we all had and how much he knew about, well, everything. And I remember how very easy he was to talk to.

Considering the complexity and brilliance of his writing, it is no wonder that we were all a little surprised at Wallace's accessibility. He has become a sort of legend among readers, the Joyce of our generation: we hear the words Infinite Jest and, whether or not we have actually read it, nod vigorously to prove that we are in the loop. Even those who have not read his work have likely heard enough to associate him with an extensive collection of knowledge, wordy prose, a sharp sense of humor, footnotes and the bandanna he's been known to wear in his ``About the Author'' pictures.

However, Wallace's writing, even with its long, elaborately constructed sentences and complicated logic, is in its scope and subject matter unexpectedly accessible, exploring anxieties, fears and quirks that are strange yet movingly, sometimes painfully recognizable. Oblivion, his new book, is a collection of short stories (one of which, ``Incarnations of Burned Children,'' he read to his standing-room-only audience at Pomona in 2001) that deal with the desires and struggles that so often come along with being human. Their characters want desperately to fit in, to distinguish themselves and to live extraordinary lives. What helps to make these stories so remarkable is that the characters know what they want to be, and they know what they are, and they recognize the immensity of the gap between the two while refusing to accept it.

Each of the eight stories in Oblivion takes us deep into the minds of its characters while managing to keep us at the distance of clinical observers, just as the characters analyze their own thoughts even as they are thinking them. In ``Mister Squishy,'' the first story, a focus group is sampling a new chocolate snack cake. In Wallace's hands, everyone becomes data, even the lonely, love-starved focus group facilitator whose thoughts and yearnings pop up so intermittently and briefly, you almost think you imagined them. Later stories allow us more access to the characters' psyches. In ``The Soul is Not a Smithy,'' a boy daydreams as his teacher goes (or seems to go) insane, and ``Good Old Neon'' is a soul-searching monologue of epic proportions. The most poignant and eloquent story in the book, ``Good Old Neon'' explores the conflict between who we are and who we appear to be, and who we want to be, and who we want to appear to be.

It is clear that Wallace is writing for our time. He writes about one of the most contemporary and frustrating of conflicts: the struggle to conform, but also to understand who we are in a society that sends increasingly mixed messages. Men explain themselves to their therapists; a woman is disfigured by plastic surgery; the media chases sensationalist stories; the erudite mingles with the everyday; brand names and abbreviations abound; and exquisite sentences trail off into ``&c. &c.'' or ``and so on.'' At times, even the narrator seems unable to maintain focus, going off on frequent tangents.
This is self-conscious writing at its best, aware of its own brilliance and its own shortcomings, reveling in language at the same time that it recognizes the inadequacy of words. ``Many of the most important impressions and thoughts in a person's life,'' says the awesomely self-aware narrator of ``Good Old Neon,'' ``... have so little relation to the sort of linear, one-word-after-another-word English we all communicate with each other with that it could easily take a whole lifetime just to spell out the contents of one split-second's flash of thoughts and connections, etc.---and yet we all seem to go around trying to use English.''

Wallace uses English to express how very difficult it is to express anything. His writing builds relentlessly, pushing the reader along and manifesting the driving need to verbalize reality. You get the sense that you are inside a mind that goes faster than its possessor can write---yet its possessor can write that fast, and does. Everything about Oblivion is obsessive: the narrator, the characters, the sentences themselves. Wallace does not just touch upon truths about life and being human. He pokes and prods and rips open these truths, going on to cover them up again and attack them from another angle. It can be exhausting. There is no denying that reading David Foster Wallace isn't just a pastime; it's an experience.

All seriousness aside, Oblivion is funny. This will surprise no one who has read Wallace, a master of the unexpected. In the writing workshop he held in the spring of 2001, he told us never to be clever just for the sake of cleverness, and with Oblivion he shows us what he meant. There is a reason for every bit of wit, for every stylistic quirk. As much as the stories treat serious situations---loneliness, suicide, the dissolution of a marriage---with humor, Mr. Wallace never pokes fun. He finds dignity in the most ridiculous characters and circumstances, all of which are complex and contradictory.

Indeed, Oblivion is full of contradictions; the title itself contradicts the insanely analytical nature of the world Wallace has created. The narrators of these stories are very much aware, not only of external situations but of the characters' thoughts, emotions, and impulses. The characters themselves are far from oblivious; they analyze themselves to exhaustion and are hyper-aware of how they come across to others. Oblivion seems to refer not to the people's perceptions of themselves, but to their inability to see other paths and the possibility of change, not to mention their blindness to one another.

This is not to say that story takes a back seat to some thematic agenda. Story and theme seem to have emerged together, and spectacularly, and the result is a book that impresses without manipulating, a book that is entertaining, provoking, and larger-than life

Wallace's stories make you feel smarter. His writing is proof of the versatility of fiction, and his popularity is proof that something is right with today's readers. It is tremendously encouraging to know that people are ready to pick up a book that is consciously about something even as it tells one hell of a good story. These stories encourage us to explore new ways of reading and writing and seeing the world---in short, to refuse to be oblivious: thinking and worrying and analyzing may be exhausting, but it is part of being human, and it can be the stuff of terrifically innovative fiction. Wallace has faith in his readers. (He has faith in his students, too. Just look at the names of some of the courses he has taught at Pomona: ``Eclectic Fictions'' and ``Inconceivably Advanced Essay Writing.'')

When Wallace's visit to Pomona had drawn to a close, a friend and I drove him to the airport. He was wearing his famous bandanna for the first time during the trip. By that time, I almost felt comfortable calling him Dave. He had given me a handwritten, five-page critique of the story I had submitted for his workshop; the upshot was that he ultimately liked the story, but he didn't know why. In workshops, you are generally expected to articulate what you like and don't like and why. It was a relief to realize that sometimes, it's okay not to know; it reminded me that writing is a process that even writers don't always understand, and that it can reach people in unexpected ways.

Anyway, we arrived at the Ontario airport, and he signed my copy of Brief Interview with Hideous Men, adding a smiley face to his signature. It's amazing, the little ways in which people surprise you. But then, when you consider how much goes on inside people's heads, maybe it isn't so amazing after all.

(If anybody feels like perspiring [cough], I'd advise you to go ahead, because I'm sure going to. In fact I'm gonna [mumbles while pulling up his gown and taking out a handkerchief from his pocket].) Greetings ["parents"?] and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes "What the hell is water?"

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story ["thing"] turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I'm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education's meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let's talk about the single most pervasive clich{\'e} in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about quote teaching you how to think. If you're like me as a student, you've never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I'm going to posit to you that the liberal arts clich{\'e} turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we're supposed to get in a place like this isn't really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.

Here's another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: "Look, it's not like I don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn't see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out 'Oh, God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard, and I'm gonna die if you don't help me.'" And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. "Well then you must believe now," he says, "After all, here you are, alive." The atheist just rolls his eyes. "No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp."

It's easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people's two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy's interpretation is true and the other guy's is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person's most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there's the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They're probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists' problem is exactly the same as the story's unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up.

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realist, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it's so socially repulsive. But it's pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people's thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.

Please don't worry that I'm getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It's a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being "well-adjusted", which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education -- least in my own case -- is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.

As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts clich{\'e} about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich{\'e} about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.

This, like many clich{\'e}s, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.

And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let's get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what "day in day out" really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I'm talking about.

By way of example, let's say it's an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you're tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there's no food at home. You haven't had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store's confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren't enough check-out lanes open even though it's the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can't take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line's front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to "Have a nice day" in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.

Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn't yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year.

But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it's going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.

Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV's and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] (this is an example of how NOT to think, though) most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the future's fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.

You get the idea.

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn't have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It's the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities.

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it's not impossible that some of these people in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.

Again, please don't think that I'm giving you moral advice, or that I'm saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it's hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just flat out won't want to.

But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it's also not impossible. It just depends what you what to consider. If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it.

This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to worship.

Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, bet it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clich{\'e}s, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.

Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.

They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and [unintelligible -- sounds like "displayal"]. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.

That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.

I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don't just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr. Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.

The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:

"This is water."

"This is water."

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand clich{\'e} turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.

I wish you way more than luck.

The American writer David Foster Wallace is disturbed over itself and its compatriots
David Foster Wallace gilt als "Superbrain" der modernen amerikanischen Literatur
David Foster Wallace is considered to the modern American literature as  "Superbrain"

David Foster Wallace gives interviews extremely rarely. He would dearest still the day before have called the following discussion off; to the suggestion to meet it at home it reacts rejecting: not possibly, its both dogs are expressed biting. Thus the interview in a hopeless hotel takes place, in which Wallace fate-result in nervously, but punctually and appear. The rebel of the American literature shows up - to own frightening - nearly old-fashionably: without cynicism and full fear of a war with the Iraq. With Wallace Miriam B{\"o}ttger spoke.

THE WORLD: Into your novels and Kurzgeschichten it concerns usually your own generation. What be so particularly to it?

David Foster Wallace: I am now forty years old, am thus born at the beginning of the sixties. The problem of my generation is that we regard ourselves still as children, as children with parents. We do not want to be arisen simply. And our culture uses and serves exactly in us, which child would like to remain, it promotes everything at you, which infantil, addicted, and is greedy.

THE WORLD: That sounds as if happen with system{\ldots}

Wallace: However. Children in the USA learn very early that it only concerns, what one want. That is the American ethics, and one can imagine that she contributes much to hold the consumer and Unterhaltungsindustrie at running. This message has a large attraction for humans as an individual: "There is no higher property than the own well-being"- everyone hears gladly. Naturally your parents take you not aside and say to you: "Thus, boy, thinks in your life only of you." Functions many more subtly. But in fact is what says our system a thousand times on the day.

THE WORLD: What is so dangerous to it?

Wallace: The American society and economy, which base to turn their citizen goods fail to give then, if it concerns to educate children or a notion from luck to humans to - if this word at all some more means. That is nevertheless no luck, if one must follow each of its impulses blindly and satisfy each demand. For me is a kind of slavery. But nobody calls it in such a way, instead hears one key words like "liberty of the choice" and "right to consumption."

The interesting is nevertheless: while I sit here and talk about all these things, I am ashamed at the same time to death, because I sound like my own grandfather. As an old man, who holds moral lectures, which none wants to hear. In America makes for one so which easily the joke figure. I actually hear a voice, which makes itself merry over me in my head in this moment. And exactly that is the paradoxes situation, in which one is as a halfway intelligent American. Actually white one, what good and correct is, but constantly gives it these diversons, one says itself there: Hey, is nevertheless no play-crude.

THE WORLD: Do they have a television?

Wallace: No, sometimes I watch television with friends. But if I had its own television, then were the day and night in enterprise and I were for nothing else more to use. In this regard I am not a piece different than most humans. I am just as greedy after everything that provokes the eye. 

 THE WORLD: In your novel Infinite Jest krepieren humans before the television at the consequences of the ultimative maintenance.

Wallace: I would be never so stupid to state that maintenance is generally bad. But a life, in which panische fear bores humans forwards to have and like silence any longer cannot bear such a thing, appears to me nevertheless rather poorly.

THE WORLD: In the US media others than American topics and interests come hardly pre why?

Wallace: The behavior of the American government in relation to the remainder of the world is not bare arrogance, but a completely natural and consistent effect of our culture and its values. America is not a malicious country. We had it only for a long time materially very comfortably. We would have used assistance from the outside, in order to understand that there is some more different one than comfort. I have large fear before it how humans will react, if all that is omitted simply.

THE WORLD: America is "a country in the war". How becomes apparent for you?

Wallace: To the general feeling humans react to the disconcertion, by buying these modern, heavy, aufgemotzten jeeps, which look like tanks. With it the particular feels safer, uses however enormous amounts of gasoline - and in a country, where gasoline costs still a fifth of, which should actually cost it. The same people select politicians, who are ready to kill in the Iraq civilians. There always one says: "These mad fanatics, it do not gonnen us our liberty!" However as stupid one must be, in order to believe so which? Who hates already the liberty? Humans hate humans, not the liberty. As much fear as in this moment I did not have no more, since I was a small boy - at that time as itself the USA and opposite Soviet Union stood. But today I have more fear of us than before the others.

THE WORLD: What can one do against it?

Wallace: Naturally there are possibilities of the rebellion. One can consume and try consciously less not to refer its view of the world evenly from the television. One can try - in such a way bl{\"o}d it also sounds - an attentive citizen of its country to be. In America rebellion is long a plate, it you as sexy thing is sold: bold, cool men, those for their right fight{\ldots} blabla{\ldots} however the rebellion, which we need now, are unfortunately exactly the opposite of sexy.

THE WORLD: Do you understand irony as a means of the criticism?

Wallace: In America one has to do it in puncto irony with a strange situation. Naturally irony is still a reaction to political events, but in the media and in the Unterhaltungsindustrie it has a rather problematic function: the people use an ironical Attit{\"u}de only, in order to give, they are dissatisfied with the conditions. But actually they arranged themselves long. Someone said times: Irony is the song of a bird, which loves its cage. The bird sings of it, how much it hates its lock up-locking up its, but feels actual completely well it in its cage. And so irony can be in the USA nowadays both: a wake-up and a sleeping drug, which are to einlullen you.

Literary star, out of the limelight 
 For David Foster Wallace, a plum teaching gig at Pomona College is both hide-out and a reason to leave the house.
 
				 

By Paul Brownfield, Times Staff Writer 

On a warm, windblown evening in late March, David Foster Wallace showed up at an old-style Mexican place in Pomona called El Ranchero. He was wearing shorts and a Pomona College sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off, so that he looked like a faintly menacing guy you might see late one night at a 7-Eleven buying Gatorade.

Wallace, the author of, most famously, the 1996 brick of a novel called "Infinite Jest," is finishing his first year as the Roy Edward Disney Professor of Creative Writing at Pomona. He's a literary star -- MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant winner, compared before he was 35 to Pynchon, to DeLillo -- newly arrived in Southern California.

Landing him was a coup for Pomona College, but getting the word out has been another matter. A bucolic and progressive campus 35 miles east of Los Angeles, off the 10 freeway, the school is a geographically undesirable place from which to generate attention. This suits Wallace, who moved here from Illinois, just fine (the public information office was not even able to get him to take a faculty photo). What he says about L.A. is polite while conveying that he isn't going native. He liked Union Station when he saw it, and attended the symphony when his parents visited. There have been a few readings, and once he went to Staples Center, to see tennis. Los Angeles and its world of special invitations evidently does not beckon him.

Wallace never completely agreed to be interviewed (even after the interview had started). Beforehand, in numerous phone calls, he assured me that driving to Pomona to talk to him about the course he is teaching this semester, an upper-division literature seminar called "Eclectic/Obscure Fictions for Writers," was certain to end in thumb-twiddling disappointment for both of us.

He had nothing grand to say about the eclectic/obscure books, all novels, that he had chosen for his syllabus. But whatever, he said. If I wanted to schlep to Pomona, sit in traffic for two hours ("You're a big boy," is what he said), then he supposed we could have dinner. These negotiations -- always on Tuesdays, shortly after 5, Wallace saying he had to call back because he had a student with him -- took place for several months. His return calls were always punctual.

Now that he'd arrived at the restaurant, Wallace made no move to identify himself. In fact, he was still hiding, sitting at a small table near the entrance with his head held low. There were only two people at the bar, and one of them was a middle-aged lawyer nursing a drink. Wallace sat where he was. I saw glasses, a familiar-seeming hangdog face. He appeared to be ducking.

"OK, what to tell you that's true and halfway interesting," was one of the first things he said. "I've taught courses like this before. The last school I was at, Illinois State University -- in Normal, Ill., the Fighting Redbirds -- I worked largely with graduate students, so I taught what's known as a graduate seminar. I haven't done it with undergrads before, and so for that reason the format is both familiar and very, very new to me."

The way he spoke -- in tightly wound, fully realized thought, his diction excellent, his tone formal, any high-mindedness kept in check by free-floating jargon -- sort of replicated the experience of reading him. It's not that Wallace is a borg, finally. It's that he's socially awkward and very guarded, and so in person, his intelligence naturally becomes his greatest defense.

"It's an odd question to ask me," Wallace said, when he was asked if one should worry about never having read certain "classic" works of literature. "I worry about it, but for me it gets very muddled between what are my expectations for myself as a human being and what do I want to read professionally. Totally between you and me, use it if you want, but my mom and I both laugh. Mom teaches literature at a junior college; mom's never read 'Moby-Dick.' I've never read 'The Iliad.' I know I've stood in gatherings and made facial expressions meant to communicate that I've read it, but in fact I haven't."

And yet, it came out, he has read the entire Tom Clancy oeuvre. On airplanes.

"Now, the last couple have been shaky," he said. "But for a long time there was no better airplane reading than Tom Clancy. Have you ever? Forget it, he doesn't need advertising."

Wallace marveled at the way Clancy can suspend plot for a 25-page treatise on how a nuclear weapon works. "And it's absolutely fascinating," he said. "I don't know how this guy finds this stuff out and then is able to render it in language that an eighth-grader could understand."

A private presence

Wallace, who is 41, arrived at Pomona tenured, his salary drawn from the interest from a $1.75-million endowment given the school by Disney, Walt Disney's nephew and a Pomona alumnus. The mandate, in part, was to find a name writer.

With humility, Wallace allows that it's a plum gig. He has taught through much of his rise in the literary world. Pomona, well-regarded, part of the Claremont College consortium of campuses, graduates roughly 35 English majors a year. Wallace teaches one course a semester and a few directed studies.

"I told him, 'We're hiring you to write -- you have to keep writing,' " said Rena Fraden, chair of the school's English department.

She speaks about Wallace like a protective mother, guarding by proxy Wallace's trepidation about being a public figure. As a colleague, she said, he's hardly precious. He's helping read applications for the school's Mosley Fellow, in which a creative writer is brought in to teach a course. He goes to readings and plays tennis with Maria Donapetry, a Spanish professor. As Wallace would, she professes not to know why any of this is interesting.

"He is a presence here at the college, because being a presence here is very private," she said.

Put up in one of the "weird little houses around the college," Wallace says, "I'm poised, ready to write, 10 hours a day. Days I'm not teaching I'm home all day. Either working or reading, but thinking I oughta be working -- you know the whole drill." He does not own a television. "I lived with a woman for a year, a really cool woman," he said. "She had a satellite TV. Five hundred channels. It was a serious problem."

Asked what he was writing, Wallace would only say that he's finishing a nonfiction book on the inventor of set theory.

His first novel, "The Broom of the System," was published when Wallace was in his mid-20s; his last book was a 1999 collection of experimental short stories called "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men."

But it was "Infinite Jest" -- a 1,079-page, obsessively footnoted, high-comic novel -- that made Wallace a literary cause c{\'e}l{\`e}bre. The book is set in a near future in which years are not numbered but corporate-sponsored ("Year of the Trial-Sized Dove Bar," etc.), and within its world are a junior tennis academy, a band of Quebecois separatists and addicts of various stripes and substances.

The novel turned Wallace, at 33, into a kind of literary rock star with a cultish Web-site following. Then came "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again," a collection of essays, criticism and neojournalism. The journalism is the most winning, even brilliant -- Wallace on subjects including the state fair in his native Illinois and his experience aboard a luxury cruise ship, both pieces that initially ran in Harper's magazine. An accomplished junior tennis player in his youth, Wallace wrote about the professional tennis player Michael Joyce for Esquire and produced a humanized look at the margins of pro sports. It was also probably the only piece of sports writing to ever contain the sentence: "Bismarck's epigram about diplomacy and sausage applies also to the way we Americans seem to feel about professional athletes."

Recently, he has seen Jonathan Franzen, of "The Corrections" fame, achieve the kind of mainstream commercial success about which literary writers are supposed to be torn. Wallace calls Franzen "one of my few writer friends."

"It's very sexy this year to be able to say that; two years ago, nobody would have cared," he foot-noted dryly.

Franzen's career, of course, got turned upside-down: lots of touring, Oprah Book Club selection controversy, option money from A-list Hollywood producer Scott Rudin.

Wallace paused when the Franzen/Oprah imbroglio was brought up. He asked if this were still part of the interview, then said: "It's good of you to tell me."

He expressed "admiration mixed with a mild contempt for the increasingly savvy way" Franzen handled the controversy that ensued when he spurned Winfrey's selection of "The Corrections" for her book club. He said the Franzen incident illustrates the trouble with whirlwind book tours, wherein the author moves in a state of surreal fatigue from airport to hotel room.

"There's something very uncomfortable about the whole thing, and yet on the other hand, what kind of prima donna says, 'Thank you, major corporation, for your advance, but now you're not allowed to use your marketing tools to try to recoup your investment'? You know, the head just goes around and around and around."

The subject -- Was it still Franzen? His own conflicted sense of writerly self? Both? -- had got him going.

"There's a weird illogic about it, because the less important literary fiction gets to the culture, the harder those corporations who for whatever reason keep wanting to publish it, have to market it. So in order to keep it alive, you have to murder it to save it."

"Shall I say something so obvious that you just won't even put it in the article?" Wallace said. "A book is also a product. At least the books that we're talking about.... Even a book that's about living in a culture that relentlessly turns everything into a product is a product. There are not very complicated ironies built into that situation. But you know that happens maybe four or five times a year. There are these legions of very smart, nice, usually Seven Sisters-educated young publicists for all the different publishing houses whose entire job is networking and lunching and hanging out with the book reviewers and opinion makers again and again ... hoping the cultural and marketing motor will catch, which one out of 200 times it does.

"At a certain point," Wallace said finally, "I just stopped thinking about it."

Energized by students

The Wallace who conducted class, several weeks later, was altogether lighter. For everything else it is, teaching is an occasion for interaction within prescribed roles, and Wallace thrives in this social contract. Last week, tacked to the door of his office in Crookshank Hall, was a note from a student. "Dear Dave," it read. "Thank you for the lamp. I like it a lot!"

In class, Wallace smiled, he joked. He took attendance. Nine of his 12 students were on hand. Two were barefoot. Wallace was wearing khaki shorts, two old shirts, black dress socks and white high-top sneakers. He was chewing gum. The faculty lounge in which Wallace conducts his class had just been host to a luncheon for graduating seniors, and Wallace encouraged his students to partake of the leftover cr{\`e}me br{\^u}l{\'e}e, the chocolate cake, the half-drunk bottles of Chardonnay and Merlot.

You could have used the scene to sell prospective liberal arts majors on the school -- come to Pomona, sip wine, don't wear shoes, talk about interesting books with a famous writer. Except that as a teacher, Wallace is cool but rigorous. Students complete a small paper on each book, a 10-page midterm and a 20-page final.

"There's a weird kind of flabby mythos around creative writing that it's more subjective, more expressive, like high school was, and therefore attracts students who don't think they have to work that hard. I'm sort of a fascist opponent to that pedagogy," Wallace said.

For "Eclectic/Obscure Fictions for Writers" (his title), Wallace's reading list consisted of nine books, a few of which he hadn't read: "The Man Who Loved Children," by Christina Stead; "Play It As It Lays," by Joan Didion; "The Moviegoer," by Walker Percy; "The Golden Notebook," by Doris Lessing; "Desperate Characters," by Paula Fox; "Giovanni's Room," by James Baldwin; "In Watermelon Sugar," by Richard Brautigan; "Nightwood," by Djuna Barnes; and "Speedboat," by Renata Adler.

"The rationale for being at a very good school," Wallace had said, "is, here's an environment and here are students with whom you can tell the truth, and you can talk about things like who picked the books on the syllabus."

On this day they were discussing the middle portion of Lessing's "The Golden Notebook," the early 1960s novel of seminal themes, namely feminism and postwar Communist Party politics. Two students led the discussion and Wallace put in a comment every now and then, but he hardly needed to. He apologized at one point for stopping the discussion to give a thumbnail recap on Communism in the '60s ("It's pretty lame to just vomit that out in five minutes," he said).

It was clear from the rhythm of the 90-minute class that his students had long since learned they wouldn't be receiving Wallace's wisdom as doctrinaire. There's something touchy-feely-sounding about that, but Wallace is plain: His students give him a very good reason to leave the house.

Wallace seemed energized by the way the class had gone. He hadn't had to listen to himself prattle on, and nearly everyone in the room participated. After the class ended, Wallace lingered with a few students. Finally he left for his office. "Pleasure doing business with you," he said.

David Foster Wallace doesn't feel at all good.

The author of "Infinite Jest" and other novels [sic] is ensconced in a top-floor room in Madison's Sheraton Hotel, and he is recovering from the flu.

Because he's on the executive floor, he has to take an elevator to the lobby to greet a reporter; entrance to the "executive floor" is by key-card only.

Back in the "executive" room, which looks like every other Sheraton room, two beds and an uncomfortable chair, Wallace slumps down, sticks a wad of snuff in his cheeks and prepares for yet another interview.

"It takes a strange temperament to be a writer," Wallace allows. "You stay cooped up by yourself for years while you work on a book and, then, you reappear for a few weeks, stay in hotels with executive floors and try to be gregarious. Then you disappear again."

Wallace is author of "The Broom of the System," of "Girl With Curious Hair" and of "Infinite Jest."

Currently, however, he is selling a book of essays, "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again" (Little, Brown; $23.95).

"I told the publisher I wouldn't do a paperback tour. So, they sent me out to read from this book -- but, then, they suggested I do some readings from 'Infinite Jest,' too and that just happens to be coming out in paperback, so I think they got me," he grumbles.

On the whole, Wallace seems like a pretty positive guy, at least when he's not suffering from the flu or rolling his eyes at the inconveniences of "executive" floors.

He teaches English at Illinois State University in Bloomington and says he likes living in the Midwest.

"I lived on the East Coast for a decade. Out here I enjoy not having to lock my doors. I enjoy having people be civil. I have two dogs, black lab mixes, and I enjoy being able to let them run," he explained.

"I never have understood the logic of living in New York City. If you are a writer, you are basically living on a fixed income, whatever the royalties and advances provide, and the cost of living there is sky high."

Wallace's book of essays -- the title comes from a Harper's magazine article he wrote about taking a cruise -- is mostly journalistic.

He talks about his fellow passengers on the cruise. He talks about playing tennis in Illinois (where the land is so flat that people don't grade it when they lay out tennis courses, which, as a result, aren't really flat). He talks about attending the Illinois State Fair.

The essays are good because they are accurate. But, Wallace says, he doubts he will do more journalistic essays.

"If you are going to write accurately about an experience, you will portray people in a way that may hurt their feelings. People on the cruise told me things that, in retrospect, they probably shouldn't have.

"But we were having different experiences. They were on the ship to engage in a fantasy vacation and I was there to write down what I saw and heard. I would rather write fiction where you can get at the truth but where you aren't writing about living people."}}

QPB Review, Sept. 1996

QPB: I was wondering if you had a particular type of reader in mind when you wrote "Infinite Jest."

WALLACE: I wanted the book to sound intimate and conversational, as if somebody was talking right to you. So I think there was a kind of ghost reader for me all the way along. Being -- like everybody else, I think -- basically a narcissist, I imagine my reader as being somewhat like me: somebody probably between 25 and 45, with too much education, who's sort of puzzled and confused and overwhelmed, and has a pretty good antenna for a lot of the stuff that's floating around in the culture but not really much training in how to derive any sort of meaning out of it.

QPB: How important is living where you do to the book and the way you see the country?

WALLACE: Well, I've lived in a lot of different places. When I was working on this book I was living in Boston and Syracuse. Now I live in a tiny town in the Midwest.

I think one of the things about American culture is that it really doesn't matter too much where you live. All you need is an antenna and a modem, and you're pretty much in the mainstream.

QPB: You don't see any difference between Boston and where you live now?

WALLACE: I think where I live now is three or four years behind the East Coast curve in terms of what's hip and what's cool, but it's just as much in the thrall of hipness hipness and coolness. People here spend as much time worrying about what attitude they project and being nervous about getting laid.

David Foster Wallace is being touted as the Jay McInerney of the 90's. Can he survive the attention?

The Grunge American Novel
By Frank Bruni

Nervousness and dread frequently chase David Foster Wallace, and when they catch him, as they have now, he writhes and twitches and prattles at a breakneck clip, his incessant quips running the gamut from marvelous to mundane. "Do you have my saliva?" he asks a companion in his cab, reflecting on the way his jitters have drained all moisture from his mouth. "Somebody took my saliva, because I don't have it."


The Sunday-night traffic is negligible and the taxi's route is a fairly straight shot down Broadway from Wallace's hotel in midtown Manhatten to a club downtown where he will kick off a 10-city book tour. But the trip seems to take an awfully long time, perhaps because it represents such a pivotal passage -- as close as anything else to a dividing line between what Wallace was and what he is becoming, between modest literary recognition and immodest literary fame.


"I'm sort of nervous," he says as the cab creeps ever closer to its destination. "I have no saliva."

The taxi pulls up to a dark building that could easily pass for abandoned. K.G.B. is a smoky, shadowy club with a Muscovite motif and a weekly reading series, largely for avant-garde writers. Wallace steps inside to find a narrow staircase mobbed with people. They are merely the spillover. The real crowd waits in a room at the top.


Wallace's lips almost curl into a smile, then beat a hasty retreat. He wants this, he doesn't want this, he is still sifting through his feelings. He is also trying to find precisely the right face to put on them, because he knows that the way he plays this scene and similar ones could color his whole career.


He pushes up the stairs, through the tangle of bodies, and somehow, inch by crushing inch, makes his way to the front of the room, where a lectern stands before about 125 people. After a short wait and a fawning introduction by the club's co-owner, he opens a copy of his sprawling 1,079-page novel, "Infinite Jest," and begins to read three snippets.


For the first, concerning a bungled burglary by two drug addicts, his voice is halting and the crowd's laughter is tentative. During the second, about a bizarre fitness guru, both his confidence and the crowd's response grow strong. And by the end of the third, about the use of video telephones in the near future, he sounds positively exultant, and the audience answers him with sustained applause. Bathed in that delicious noise, Wallace looks beatific.


Nervousness? Dread? For this moment, at least, they seem distant memories, banished by the heady thrill of it all.


A decade ago, it was McInerney. Decades earlier, Mailer. Right now, it is Wallace, the first young novelist in several years to pique such intense curiosity.


He is a 34-year-old writer with the ardor, arrogance or sheer audacity to produce a book so bulky that, as he jokes, customers at Barnes & Noble may need help carrying their purchases to their cars. "Infinite Jest" is not only massive but also forbidding, and more than a few of the hardy souls who set out to scale it will neither make it to the summit nor care to.


Set mostly at a tennis academy and a drug rehabilitation center in the not-too-distant future, "Infinite Jest" tells a jumble of tales that often seem loosely related, if at all. Front and center is the story of the three Incandenza brothers -- a promiscuous football punter, a brainy tennis prodigy and a dwarf -- and the long shadow cast over them by their father, who committed suicide. Off to the side are a band of terrorists in wheelchairs who are on the hunt for a copy of a movie, the eponymous "Infinite Jest," said to be so entertaining it puts anyone who watches it into a permanent, blissed-out stupor. And way down below, struggling to the surface for air, is Don Gately, an old drug addict with a new religion.


All of these strenuously eccentric characters inhabit a narrative that proceeds in a distinctly nonlinear fashion, lurching from abrupt, trumpet-like blasts of information to sentences so long only a supercomputer could diagram them. Wallace is to literature what Robin Williams or perhaps Jim Carrey is to live comedy: a creator so manically energetic and amused with himself that he often follows his riffs out into the stratosphere, where he orbits all alone. "Infinite Jest" is best read with a dictionary and maybe even a pharmacology textbook at hand, for it employs an often arcane vocabulary ("strabismic," "erumpent") and makes reference to a bulging medicine chest of psychoactive drugs. Some are explicated in the 96 pages of footnotes that Wallace has appended to his tome.


The critics -- or most of them, anyway -- are smitten. "Next year's book awards have been decided," began a review in New York magazine by Walter Kirn. "The plaques and citations can now be put in escrow." The normally saturnine Sven Birkerts, writing in The Atlantic Monthly, proclaimed that "Infinite Jest" had "internalized some of the decentering energies that computer technologies have released into our midst." Will Blythe, of Esquire, after grousing about the novel's heft and hype, came right out and declared that "it shows signs, in fact, of being a genuine work of genius." Even those critics with qualms about the novel's loquacity and opacity gave it high marks in the end. Michiko Kakutani, who reviewed "Infinite Jest" for The Times, was highly dubious, but ultimately anointed Wallace "a writer of virtuosic talents who can seemingly do anything."


The critics aren't the only ones angling to prove that they get it. Wallace's contemporaries have shown up at his public appearances in force. When he read at K.G.B., Elizabeth Wurtzel, the author of "Prozac Nation," claimed a spot near the front of the room. The following night, at another jam-packed reading, this time at Tower Books in the Village, Ethan Hawke lurked in the back. And at the official book party two nights later at an East Village club, M.G. Lord, the author of "Forever Barbie," can be seen chatting up another novelist of the moment, A.M. Homes. Between puffs of their cigarettes, many people whisper what Wallace says he does not want to hear: he is the current "it" boy of contemporary fiction.


For a long stretch, Wallace retreats to an office above the club's kitchen to decompress. There are moments when the full measure of his success hits him and he feels what he describes as "unalloyed happiness." But there are moments, too, when he feels besieged, disoriented and even a bit terrified.


"Something is slightly off about this whole thing," he says on the eve of his tour, as he sits on a sofa in his house in Bloomington, Ill. The smaller of his two dogs, a black Labrador retriever mix named Jeeves, keeps trying to climb into his lap and lick his lips, a gesture not unrelated to the fact that Wallace is eating a bologna sandwich. "They pretend they're kissing you," Wallace says of his dogs, "but they're really mining your mouth for food."


He is as suspicious of the attention coming his way as he is of Jeeves's motives. "I keep getting the feeling that all of this is about some initial surge of excitement, and now it's created excitement about the excitement," he says. Elated as he is about his achievement and eager as he is to promote the book, he maintains that the hoopla almost makes him want to become a recluse.


This assertion plays in part like a canny pose of tactful modesty and in part like a nod to such literary idols as J.D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon, whose work Wallace's resembles. But Wallace's friends say that his desire for privacy is genuine. They cite his decision to live far away from the publishing hub-bub, in the flat farmland of the Middle West, and to teach at Illinois State University, a school without ivy. Jonathan Franzen, a fellow novelist and confidant, says Wallace is like many serious writers who, by necessity, spend most of their time alone. "You tend to develop the personality that corresponds to that solitude," Franzen says.


This helps explain why sudden fame is often more awkward for a serious writer than for a serious actor, who does his work in public and is accustomed to being the subject, rather than the agent, of observation. An actor can mug his way through a fairly long string of parties and fashion shows before he is accused of overexposure and ridiculed; a writer hits that threshold sooner. "Then his subsequent work isn't looked at directly, but through the glare of all that publicity," says the editor Gary Fisketjon, whose stable of writers at Knopf includes Jay McInerney. The more a writer indulges the news media, Fisketjon observes, the more vulnerable he is to deflation. "It raises the stakes on everything he does in the future."


Wallace has a virtually innate awareness of this danger. "When I won't do things like appear on network television, it's not because I have a lot of integrity," he says. "Part of it is that I feel I'm going to turn off exactly the people whose approval I'm most hungry for." While he is not greedy about money, he explains, "I'm real greedy about respect."


In one sense, the success of Wallace and "Infinite Jest" are a complete surprise. No one knows who and what will hit the jackpot at a given moment, and publishers constantly squander large cash advances and aggressive publicity campaigns on books that land quickly in the remainder bin. "It really depends on so many things that are impossible for you to align by yourself," says Bret Easton Ellis, who has had more than a decade, and plenty of disappointments, since the publication of "Less Than Zero" to reflect on the process. "It's the mood of the public, the times -- all these intangibles."


But in another sense, what is happening to Wallace was predictable and painstakingly engineered. When Michael Pietsch, the book's editor, convinced his colleagues at Little, Brown and Company to fork over a figure estimated at $90,000 to buy "Infinite Jest" as a work in progress, he argued that Wallace had developed a significant cult following with his first two books, "The Broom of the System" and "Girl With Curious Hair," and was due for a breakthrough.


Pietsch also apprehended several other realities that have influenced Wallace's success. Many years had passed since the so-called Brat Pack of the mid- to late 1980's -- McInerney, Ellis and Tama Janowitz -- turned putatively serious literature into a fashion statement, and it was long past time for a new Wunderkind to do something similar. More to the point, the members of so-called Generation X had yet to claim definitively a maverick, idiosyncratic literary voice all their own. Wallace's work spoke both to this generation's shtick and to its soul.


"Infinite Jest" is sardonic, jaded and steeped in references to all strata of popular culture, from high to low. It exhibits both a savvy grasp of the cyberfrontiers on the horizon and a deep, abiding distrust of them. It is mildly subversive, occasionally ribald and sporadically crude. Think David Letterman with a postgraduate degree and diction, and you get at least some idea of the sensibility. "This has become a very hip book to read," says Alice K. Turner, the fiction editor at Playboy, who encouraged Wallace early in his career. "We've had a lot of skimpy fare for a long time."


Indeed, executives at Little, Brown quickly realized that the sheer length of "Infinite Jest" could work in their favor, and although Wallace was asked to cut about 300 pages from his initial draft, he was still allowed to exceed 1,000 pages, which meant that the book would be priced at $30. "We decided to play it as importance -- that the size lent a certain weight to the book, that there was a certain undeniability about it," says Amy Rhodes, head of marketing for the complany. Her strategy revolved around a kind of dare: are you reader enough for this book?


To create that elusive, ephemeral entity known as buzz, the company compiled a list of 4,000 booksellers, industry insiders and media types and sent out a staggered series of six postcards that cryptically heralded the release of an at-first-unspecified book that gives "infinite pleasure" with "infinite style." And when blurbs to that effect became available from other authors and critics, Little, Brown put them on postcards and dispatched another series of three. Says Paul Slovak, senior vice president of publicity of Viking Penguin, "The promotional campaign has been brilliant."


And Wallace -- wittingly or unwittingly -- has served it well, projecting the perfect measure of aloofness, particularly in his appearance, which flouts conventional vanity in a manner that doth protest perhaps a bit too much. He often wears a bandanna wrapped tightly around his head, as if to avoid combing his shoulder-length hair and to coddle his febrile mind. His wire-rimmed glasses, stubble of beard and hole-ridden sweaters lend him the aspect of a doctoral candidate so deep in thought that he cannot afford the time or energy for grooming. Yet he runs regularly to stay fit, and his bathroom contains special tooth polish to combat the effects of the tobacco he chews. There's also a special acne medication to keep his skin unblemished.


He hates that his publicity tour involves so many photography sessions. "Whenever the picture comes out, it's absolutely appalling to me," he says. "I just so wish that wasn't what I looked like. I've just figured it out: I'm not going to look at them anymore."


"Do you guys know 'The Charlie Rose Show'?" Wallace asks two of his faculty friends at Illinois State, a married couple many years older than he, when he visits their house to say goodbye before his three-week tour. "Would you think it was whorish if somebody went on it?"


"No, no," says Charles Harris, a professor of English. "It's on late at night, and it goes into things at length. Are you going on it?"


"I did have a no-TV pledge," Wallace sighs.


"Until they asked?" jokes Harris's wife, Victoria.


After considerable introspection, Wallace nixes "Charlie Rose," just as he turned down the "Today" show before it. In the interviews he does grant, Wallace draws sharp boundaries about what he will discuss and begs assurances about how it will be presented. "If you quote that," he will qualify something he has just said, "I'd really like you to quote that I acknowledge it sounds banal and clich{\'e}d."


Friends say there are powerful currents of ambition and competitiveness in Wallace that can be traced back to his childhood in Urbana, Ill., and his career as a junior tennis player of some local prominence. Wallace's father, a philosophy professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, and his mother, an English teacher at a community college, ferried him to tournaments throughout the Middle West.


At Amherst College in Massachusetts, however, it was the life of the mind that he pursued, and with a similar vengeance. His major was philosophy. He recalls that during his sophomore year a professor told him he was a genius: "It was the happiest moment in my life. I felt like I would never have to go to the bathroom again -- that I'd transcended it."


Mark Costello, a classmate, says Wallace was pegged by professors as someone who could become an important philosopher. So when Wallace turned his intellectual energies toward fiction writing, it was a decision fraught with ambivalence and fear. "He was a guy under tremendous internal pressure," Costello says. "I think it was important to him to get a little external confirmation that he hadn't made an absurd choice."


His senior thesis at Amherst became the first rough chunk of "The Broom of the System," his 487-page Pynchonesque debut novel; shortly after he graduated and went on to what he derisively calls a "master of flatulent arts" program in creative writing at the University of Arizona, he had a contract with Viking Penguin, which published "Broom" in 1987. That same year he won a prestigious $25,000 Whiting Writers' Award. Two years later Norton published "Girl With Curious Hair," a collection of short fiction.


But Wallace was tormented and miserable. Was he really brilliant, as some people told him? Or was he a fake, as he sometimes felt? By this point he was drinking heavily, taking drugs and sleeping around, self-destructive behavior that he figured was consistent with the life style that a cool, serious writer was supposed to have. Wallace is intentionally vague on this period of his life, and what he divulges sometimes contradicts the recollections of friends. He says he never formally entered a recovery program; Alice Turner says he did. He mentions a single suicide scare and subsequent stay in a psychiatric ward; friends allude to more than one.


There is an agreement, however, that he halted his downward spiral around 1990 and began to cultivate a saner, stabler existence. He eventually took a job as an associate professor at Illinois State in Normal and bought a middle-class house on a road that winds past fields of feed corn and a slaughterhouse. He adopted Jeeves and another black Lab mix, the Drone.


For a while, a woman lived there, too, but she is gone now, her departure marked by the absence of any furniture in the living room. "I hate that room," Wallace says. "I always walk fast through that room to get to other rooms." His relationships, he confesses, have been many and short-lived. Before moving back to Illinois, he became involved for a time with the writer Mary Karr, author of "The Liar's Club," and had her name tattooed on his upper arm. He blames himself for the brevity of his attachments. "I'm massively selfish about my work, and I don't seem to be able to be very polite or considerate about other people's feelings," he says.


His friendships appear to be more durable, and he finds them in unexpected places. Back in Illinois, he began to attend Sunday services at various churches around town -- there is something about religious faith, which was missing from his rearing by two atheists, that entices and calms him -- and he formed his closest social relationship with an older, married couple, Doug and Erin Poag. They met at a Mennonite house of worship.


The Friday night before the Sunday start of his book tour finds Wallace watching "The X-Files" with the Poags in their living room. They are eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and Italian heroes on trays.


The Poags mention that another of Wallace's favorite shows is "Baywatch," and his face reddens. "There are very complicated esthetic reasons why I watch it," he protests. "It's why I used to watch 'The Love Boat' -- it was soothing, like a narcotic. You knew all problems would be resolved in 15 minutes and many lush platitudes would be exchanged."


Wallace actually brings Erin Poag along to his readings in New York. The trip was a Christmas present to her from both Wallace and her family, but it clearly serves Wallace as well, reminding him of his other life outside the limelight.


It will be difficult to balance the two existences. Although Wallace had intially decided not to read reviews of "Infinite Jest," telling his agent to save them for some later date, he made a special trip to the campus library to find one of the first ones. He even donned sunglasses, "because I'm an idiot who imagines that people have nothing better to do than sit around and watch me read my reviews."


Five days into his tour Wallace says that what he finds scariest about the whirlwind is his ability to tune out the aspects that make him uncomfortable and to let himself be borne along on its velvety currents. By the time he reached his 12th photo shoot, he says, he had learned to travel far away from the moment in his mind: "I have actually gotten to revisit, in my head, all the museums I've ever gone to."


Very soon, he says, he will go home and get back to work. He will even change his telephone number. But there's a subtle note of worry in his voice. At some level, he knows how hard it will be to resist it. }}

by David Wiley

Also: To watch or not to watch by David Wiley

In your essay "E Unibus Pluram," you talk about irony in television and sometimes in fiction as something toxic.

See, here's the hard part about talking about something like that -- it takes a 60-page essay to develop the question, and so I'm going to be very uncomfortable about anything I'll just say discursively off the cuff. Now -- the point of the essay is that the ironic function like in postmodern fiction started out with a rehabilitative agenda. Largely it was supposed to explode hypocrisy -- certain hypocritically smug ways the country saw itself that just weren't holding true anymore. The problem is that when irony becomes in and of itself just a mode of social discourse, that is it's not really about causing any sort of change any more, it's just sort of a hip, cool way to do it -- to speak and to act, to sort of make fun of everything and yourself and being really afraid of being made fun of. A certain amount of this comes out of the work of this essayist named Lewis Hyde, who I believe for a while lived in Minneapolis. This was an essay about John Berryman -- I think I cite it in (A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again). Anyway, Hyde talks about irony after a while becoming the sound of prisoners who enjoy their confinement. The song of a bird who enjoys being in the cage. For instance, if I'm uncomfortable with how commercial the culture is and how everybody seems to be out for a buck, I decide so I'll do it too, but I'll kind of make fun of myself and say, 'I'm a whore, just like you're a whore,' and now we all get an uneasy laugh out of it. But we've somehow taken a situation that originally I was unhappy about, and it may perhaps put some pressure on me to opt out of, and instead I take the easy decision, but I adopt this patent of irony about it that shields me from criticism for it. That may be the clearest quick way of talking about it. I think the people like my age and younger relate to irony, which is largely unconscious and largely is used as a mechanism for avoiding some really thorny issues -- I think that's toxic. Irony itself is fantastic. It's one of the primary rhetorical modes. It's been around forever. It's intensely powerful. There's nothing wrong with it.


Do you think it's the same with satire?

I think anybody who does satire, and I've probably done a certain amount -- there's this implicit, unspoken idea that by satirizing something you're going to create motive force for change. Which in fact doesn't really happen. But at least you're using satire as a recommendation -- you know -- I ridicule this to show that it's totally grotesque and unacceptable, therefore motivating people to change stuff. But when satire and irony get divorced from that project, they just become a kind of mode of discourse in and of themselves. Then I think that things get kind of dark.


You wrote this essay in the 80s but revised it a bit for the book, right?

Right. That's one thing I'm a little uncomfortable about -- I don't watch that much TV any more. That essay seems to me a bit dated. I think the situation is roughly the same. But the fact that there's this tone of urgency in the essay, and then it was seven years ago strikes me as a bit off. It was originally commissioned by Harper's, and I believe it was printed in '90. I think I wrote it in Summer and Fall of 1990. And then it didn't work. They thought that it was too academic. But that's when I did it.


Your revision mentions Beavis and Butthead, but you wrote this before that show. And it seems that the meta-watching on that show is just what you're talking about -- the idea that people watching Beavis and Butthead are making fun of the show that does exactly what they do -- make fun of TV.

Where irony comes in is anyone with an average brain notes that I'm making fun of it but I'm also part of it. Now there's two ways I can go -- I can change the situation, because it's clearly ridiculous, or I can ironically genuflect the situation -- 'Isn't this great? I'm a dickhead, sitting here watching these dickheads watch dickheads on TV.' And it becomes, it seems to me, a very easy excuse to perpetuate the deal. It's a way to keep doing what's easy and convenient and yet look hip and cool while you're doing it. Here's the other thing that's pernicious about it -- I know that as I'm saying this stuff to you I'm afraid that I'm coming off as some 60s refugee idealist, like 'Oh, instead of making jokes, we ought to change things, man,' and so what I want to do is jazz it up so that you don't make fun of me that way, right? And the way that I would do that of course is to be ironic. When Irony and ridicule become cultural currency, then the great terror is not that you're gonna hit me or that you're gonna disagree with me, it's that you're gonna make fun of me. And being earnest or saying stuff that you really believe in that -- and there are always problems with it -- opens you up to ridicule in a way that if I were to say, 'Well man, I don't know what you want to talk about. I'm a fuck-off, and I fucked off writing this book, and I don't know,' then there's no way you can attack. There's no way anybody disagrees. That's the way in which it seems to me this stuff can become toxic. It's not the thing in and of itself. It's the cultural use to which it's put and how pervasive it is. I'm not a sociologist, I'm not a politician, I'm not an advocate for cultural change. I'm talking like a private citizen. My stuff is not programmatic, and I don't want to revolutionize American culture. What I'm mostly trying to talk about is what it feels like emotionally to be 34 in this country.


This reminds me of DeLillo's White Noise -- the section about 'The Most Photographed Barn in America' -- the levels of distancing as you watch something.

DeLillo and Pynchon and Gaddis and a lot of those guys I think called the situation a long time ago. What's ironic (laughs ironically) is that the stuff they're talking about is still going on but their ironic, sarcastic voice we have adopted as a way to protect ourselves from responsibility to the situations. So it's like we've taken the technique or the surface of what it is they're talking about, but we haven't listened to what the message is.


So you don't watch much TV any more?

I did at one time, but now -- I've got a VCR, but I don't get any TV on it, so I'm a little out of it. There are a couple of shows that I go over to friends' houses and watch. And as far as I can tell, the average quality of TV is better than it was seven years ago. I mean the writing's better. It's smarter. It's funnier.


Why do you think that is?

I really don't know. I think probably it has something to do with the maturation of Baby Boomers and probably the demographics -- there are more young, hip, educated people in the television audience then there were, say, 10 years ago. I mean TV's not a moral entity. It feels the pulse, and it delivers what it thinks the pulse wants. Smartly written shows like Seinfeld and Frasier, oh, Lord, a whole bunch -- Party of Five is fairly smart. X-Files and Millennium are kind of depressing, but the TV has discovered there's an audience for what's perceived as quality -- NYPD Blue -- I really don't know. I'm sort of out of the loop now.


Do you think the writing's better because writers can't get other work?

Writers have been writing for popular -- you know, Faulkner wrote movies. A lot of writers break in on it. I think part of this has something to do with the fact that there have emerged these TV auteurs. Steven Bochco I think probably in the 80s was one of the first -- Hill Street Blues, and then L.A. Law, St. Elsewhere and now NYPD Blue -- he came up with the show. He directs most of it. He develops his own kind of stylistic signature. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who started out with Designing Women. These guys who came up with Seinfeld, and I'm afraid I can't remember their names, but there are some of these signature production companies and writers and directors who are very, very smart. But what's happened is their stuff has hit, where I think probably in the past there have been plenty of really smart, quick, clever, skillful screenwriters and directors -- it's just a lot of them never really got a chance to show us, because there apparently wasn't much audience demand for it. I think it's possibly also due to the fact that cable now, first the addition of FOX and now cable channels, puts a great deal more pressure on network television to be better. Because there are so many niches now available, and one can at the flick of a button turn to not just public broadcasting but the Learning Channel or Arts and Entertainment, that it's jacked the stakes up a little bit.


Do you think this improvement is a good thing, or is it just popular entertainment usurping more of the novelist's job?

I can remember a cover feature in the New York Times Magazine that had some characters from Bochco and some characters I think from Seinfeld, and it was like, 'Want good literature? Watch TV.' And this whole article was about TV supplanting the functions of literature. I think TV and movies as narrative systems or as deliverers of narrative and pleasure supplanted novelists and short-story writers and poets a long time ago. I think we exist on the margins of culture in a way that novelists didn't a hundred years ago. I have friends who think this is a terrible thing. For me myself it's sort of like it's just the way things are. I know that I'm uncomfortable enough about a lot of attention, that I rather like it. I think if novelists were treated the way TV stars or musicians were, it would so warp us and so distort our capacity for standing on the sides and watching. You've got like Dickens and James and Dostoyevsky, who were just absolutely revered by their cultures and just besieged like rock stars -- how they were able to have the amount of balance and continue to have the amount of insight -- I mean it would be very hard not to imagine that you're different and better than other people if everybody's treating you like you're different and better than them. So, just in my own case, I'm rather comfortable with it. It means you don't make all that money, and that might be bad. I don't know. I don't particularly care. For the state of the culture, I think there's stuff reading can do. Reading demands a level of activity on the part of the respondent that TV and movies don't in most cases, and I think it's probably, on a nutritional level, I think probably reading is better than TV and movies. But, you know -- wheat germ is better for us than Snickers bars, and I eat Snickers bars all the time, because they're yummy.


Do you think novelists have to watch television now?

No. I think writers, say, under forty-five or forty or something who aren't in some way having to deal with the impact of popular culture on America -- unless you're writing a historical novel, I just don't get it. I don't watch television as research or anything like that, but it just seems as if television, advertising, popular culture, media intrusion, now the Internet and circuits of information, are part of our environment the way clouds and trees were part of the environment a hundred years ago. I don't know that there's any way to escape it.


What about someone like Kafka? Would Kafka be writing about television? Or Bruno Schulz -- would they be doing this, or would they still just be writing about their families?

Well, possibly. But Kafka and Schulz would be writing about the family in an atmosphere in which from Oprah and Montel we now have this thing called the dysfunctional family. We have a series of cliches we can banter around ironically, and they would have to take account of that, because they don't want to simply thoughtlessly recycle it and look like pap. You know what I mean? Kafka would not have to sit down and channel-surf in order to write about what it's like to live in a televisual culture, because it's oxygen. It's the atmosphere. My guess is that, given Kafka's struggles with the idea of the human being as loathsome and the human being as repulsive and worthless, that a culture very much defined by these superstars who are way prettier than any of the rest of us are -- and smoother and suaver and whatever -- would have an enormous effect on him. If you're a writer, unless you're like doing sci-fi or horror, you're engaged with the culture. And this stuff is the culture. You can be glad about it. You can be sad about it. But it's what there is, and there's fascinating stuff about it.


You kind of refer to Don DeLillo as a prophet of contemporary fiction for the way he foresaw a lot of this stuff. What other writers do you see as leading the way now?

Vollmann's one. I think Gaddis' Frolic of His Own, which is almost entirely about how litigious our society is, and most of the novel takes place in a living room where a man's watching television. It seems to me that the writers who aren't really engaged with the stuff are the writers who came to maturity in the kind of realistic era of the 50s and 60s. Updike doesn't seem to me to write all that effectively about this stuff. When his characters go out to eat fast food they go to Burger Bliss instead of Burger King, as if in fiction you can't use the regular product name. It just seems to be a mentality that is more old-fashioned, and a lot of -- it's ironic -- the hard-core realists, the ones who specialize in, you know, domestic psychodrama and the terrain of the interior heart, seem to lean really far away from references to pop culture -- I think because they're afraid that stuff is freighted with social agenda and theory and they want to stay away from that. The idea of writing realistic fiction where people aren't spending 6 hours a day watching TV seems absurd to me, because that's what people do.


I read Banana Yoshimoto's Kitchen, and a lot of that novel took place in front of the TV

But here's the problem. The new novels -- they're sort of like Linklaeter films, where really articulate people dissect the Jetsons. And the problem is that it can very quickly become more of the ironic pose of, 'Yeah, well I'm uncomfortable with this, but, well, let's just kick back and fire up another doob and it's all right.' And it can become then a series of hip gestures and schticks, in which case you're not engaged with the culture -- you're just recycling it. We're just all singing the same tune over and over again. The thing that the essay's supposed to be about is, we've got kind of a problem here, because if we want to engage with this and talk to it and in a certain way make fun of it, how do you do that without using techniques that TV has already taken from earlier insurgent fiction and is now using in order to sell mini-vans and hamburgers. It's a real interesting problem.


So now we see Pynchon scrambling to keep up with the techniques that television stole from him.

Pynchon's another one whom I regard as really kind of old-fashioned. I like early Pynchon. I like The Crying of Lot 49. I like Gravity's Rainbow. But the Pynchon of Slow Learner (sic) and Vineland, which I didn't like very much, seems to be making the same tired jokes -- 'look how shallow and superficial the culture is.' All right -- I've been told -- TV itself now tells that to me. It just seems like more of the same. I'm not as big a Pynchon fan as some other people are.


The word Pynchon is on every one of you're book covers as a comparison. Does this drive you crazy?

Pynchon was important to me when I was in college. The first book that I wrote, Broom of the System, some reviewer for the New York Times said it was a rip-off of The Crying of Lot 49, like that I hadn't read yet. So I got all pissed, and then I went and read The Crying of Lot 49, and it was absolutely, incredibly good. I think a certain amount of this is marketing, and, you know, the fastest way to tell what something is like is to compare it to something else. And having read Gaddis and having read Pynchon and DeLillo and Coover and McElroy and Sorrentino, I can see that the kind of stuff that I do or like that Bill Vollmann does or that Richard Powers does is certainly more like that than it's like, you know, Irwin Shaw or John Updike. Writers are bad to ask about this though, because we're all egomaniacs, and we all want to be utterly unique and, you know, not like anybody else, and so there's a certain amount of bristling about it, but after a while there's just no way to help it. Gravity's Rainbow is a great book, but for the most part Pynchon kind of annoys me, and I think his approach to a certain amount of stuff is kind of shallow, to be honest with you. So I get uncomfortable about that, and when people ask it over and over again I get the sense that they're saying they think I'm ripping him off or just rehashing stuff he's done, in which case I get pissed, but if that's how they're seeing it, it means I've failed. I mean if my stuff's coming off derivative of somebody else, it means there's something that I'm doing that isn't right. But I find myself doing it all the time. I'll see a movie, and I'll really like it, and I'll recommend it to friends, and I'll say, well, it's sort of like this combined with this. I mean it's such a convenient shorthand. And nobody likes to have it done to them. You don't want to have a friend say to you, 'You're just exactly like this other guy we know.' You say, 'No, I'm not. I'm me.' But we do it to each other all the time.


Are the names Mondragon and Bodine (from Infinite Jest) allusions to Pynchon's Kurt Mondaugen and Pig Bodine?

Well, Jethro Bodine is from The Beverly Hillbillies. That's not a Pig Bodine thing. But there were a few -- That thing in Infinite Jest where two representatives (Steeply and Marathe) of two countries are on a cliff-side and are making enormous shadows and playing with it -- and there's even the use of the word Brockengespenst, which comes out of Slothrop and Geli Tripping (from Gravity's Rainbow) fucking on the Brockengespenst -- that's an outright allusion. And I think there are a couple -- that's not supposed to be any kind of inter-textual allusion. I just thought it was really cool. And I've been to Tucson, and you actually can do that with the shadows, and I thought it was neat. But I'm not trying to lace the book with allusions to other texts. There's nothing wrong with it. I'm not just particularly interested in it.


Could you talk about this idea you have about the Fiction of Image?

There's a certain amount of stuff that's treating pop culture not just as a system of reference, but as a subject. And for me, the first thing I ever read of this was Max Apple's The Oranging of America, which is a story about Howard Johnson. There are very shallow archetypes in the images on the screen, and the idea that you can remind the reader that these are artifice and that there are real worlds behind them by using them as characters in stories -- that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. References -- these sort of hallucinatory references to pop culture. I think Leyner's My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist is a big example that I talk about in the book. This is somewhat embarrassing. I don't read an enormous amount of contemporary fiction. There are writers I really like, but for the most part, most of the stuff that I do requires so much research and outside reading -- plus my teaching duties -- that I read very little stuff now that isn't connected with work. About the only stuff that I read just purely for my own pleasure is poetry. And whatever trends are going on in poetry don't seem to me to have anything to do with the trends that are going on in fiction.


Do you think fiction needs to be or should be as self-referencing as TV?

You would have to define self-referencing.


Well, like meta-fiction.

Another thing that the essay tries to do, and I don't know how good a job it does of it, is sort of to trace out some of that impulse in a kind of increase in self-consciousness that I think TV has a big part in informing. Let me put it to you this way. Since the 60s, and you probably know this better than I, the real battle in fiction has been between writers and theorists who see fiction as essentially a recursive mechanism -- William Gass and John Barth and the 60s guys -- and most of them now publish with academic presses and small presses like Dalkey, and the book-buying public probably doesn't see much of them. The other side of it says that fiction is not recursive, it's referential -- the old realistic 'language is a system of pictures, of words, and I'm gonna write a story that's makes you imagine that this stuff is really going on.' My personal take is that since the 60s, and really since the rise of television, there's a degree of self-consciousness culturally now that makes classic realistic stuff seem to me to be either very naive or very manipulative. And at least what I'm trying to do in my own stuff -- and I'm not saying it succeeds, I am not saying it succeeds -- but what the writers who interest me, what I see them doing, what I'm trying to do involves trying to write fiction that works both ways. Because one of the things that we've learned is that what we imagined to be reality is more and more a linguistic enterprise. The same way we found out that the observer in an experiment affects the experiment, such that that classic distinction where 'I'm only going to write stories about stories being written by writers who are writing about stories' -- that whole game seems to me very tired. I read Barth's last book of short stories, and I was just sad for him, because he does it so well, but he's been doing the same thing over and over again for 30 years. But then on the other hand, you know, 'Imagine, dear reader, that you're not reading words -- you're magically transported to the Summer of where this dysfunctional family is going through it's throes' -- and I don't believe that shit either. I think the stakes are higher now, and it's much more exciting, and the balance is much finer. But writers I admire, you know, like Gaddis, Cormac McCarthy, DeLillo, Cynthia Ozick, are writers who seem to me to be able to create compelling narratives that make you feel something for these characters and know them in a way that like you and I could never know each other -- and at the same time not being in any way manipulative or old-fashioned or falsely naive about the way language can stretch that world in which they live. Put it this way -- me and Vollmann and Powers and Franzen and Leyner, we got a pretty good idea who our readers are. Our readers are mostly college-educated people under 50, which means you've had some theory. You know about the linguistic turn in philosophy and theory in the 50s and 60s in Europe. This is the terrain in which we're having to work. I think the average reader, you know, the guy who picks up the paperback book in an airport, doesn't give a flying fuck about this. Because what he wants is what a certain other type of fiction can provide -- it's just a momentary escape from a stressful flight in an airplane.


You've mentioned Ozick before in other interviews. She's amazing isn't she.

Here's what's cool is that this is this hyper-educated, very seriously Jewish person writing about a culture and ethnicity that I know very slightly, and mostly only from books, and whom I -- number one, the prose is just completely luminous, but number two, I find myself feeling stuff for these folks that I sure don't feel for most of the people who look just like me in regular life. There's this magic that stories can do, and the thing that is transcendent about Ozick is that she's extremely canny and familiar with language and fiction as artifice and all that stuff, and manages not to offend your sensibilities about that stuff, while at the same time creating these really kind of luminous, luminous, luminous stories. There are maybe two or three living American writers who I think are just absolutely capital-G-great, and she's one of them. Let's just have the whole thing be about her. You'd be better off telling your readers about her than about me.


Her story "Levitation" has a really cool tension between the characters' lives and the characters' writing.

Writing about writing is fascinating and pregnant, and writing about writing versus writing about life -- the more you look at it, the more the distinctions collapse. On the other hand, writing about writing can very easily collapse into a pose and a game. You're just turning a crank on a certain kind of mechanism. And if I'm talking about some of the ways that it seems to me irony kind of afflicts us, I'm talking about strategic uses that we've put to it to make hard things easier for us.


Let's talk about Infinite Jest -- the title first of all. It's Shakespeare, but there's this feeling that "Infinite Jest" also just means "Big Joke."

Well, it's supposed to be a long encomium to the dead father. But part of the book is about a culture deciding that the meaning of life consists in experiencing as much pleasure as much of the time as possible and what are the implications of that. So it's multivalent, but it's not particularly profound. I'm not very good at titles.


The question about art and entertainment -- are these things that make us human, or are these things that degrade us, like they do to the people who watch the movie Infinite Jest?

Let's put it this way. Say you've got really serious art, and it takes really hard work, whether it's painting or music or literature. That stuff's not fun in the way commercial entertainment is fun. I mean fun -- like eating a Twinkie. It's like slipping into a warm bath after a hard day. It's an escape. It's a relaxation. And that's fine, and that's entirely appropriate. The danger comes when the escape becomes the overriding purpose. And one of the ways it seems that television has affected me is that my expectation for the amount of fun and pleasure to work -- that ratio is very different than they are for my parents. I think my pain threshold is lower. My expectations are higher. My level of resentment at having to do anything I don't particularly want to do that isn't pleasurable is higher. I think a certain amount of that comes from the fact that for six hours a day I receive certain messages -- you know, 'relax, we're going to give to you, you don't have to give anything back, all you need to do is every so often go and buy this product.' But animals have fun. My dogs play. And watching them play -- there's a purity of intent and a lack of self-consciousness that I wish I could achieve when I was experiencing pleasure. But Plato and John Stuart Mill both take books to talk about different types of pleasure. In my own personal life, I like really arty stuff a lot of the time. But there's also times I watch an enormous amount of TV, and I've read probably 70 percent of Stephen King's books. And I've read them basically because for a little while I want to forget that my name is David Wallace, you know, and that I have limitations, and that I'm sad that my girlfriend yelled at me. I think serious art is supposed to make us confront things that are difficult in ourselves and in the world. And one of the dangers is if we get conditioned to confront less and less and experience more and more pleasure, the commercial stuff's gonna win out.


So the movie Infinite Jest has no redeeming value?

Whether or not it has any value ends up being irrelevant. This is a movie that is so pleasurable that once you've watched it once, all you want to do is watch it again. I mean you want to watch it again rather than eat.


So why not watch the movie?

That's a very interesting question. Would you? Have you ever read any Larry Niven? Very cool, hard sci-fi guy. He talks about wire-heads. The technology, maybe not in my lifetime but in yours, will exist that they can jack into the p-terminals of your brain. There's a lot of this stuff in (Infinite Jest), but a lot of it got cut out. They jack into your brain, and you will be able to have a system whereby you can plug it into a wall and have your pleasure center stimulated. And in Niven -- and I hadn't read Niven until the book was done, and I worry that everybody's going to think I ripped him off -- wire-heads die. Because they don't eat or drink or anything. I mean it's like sustained orgasm. So if that technology were available and you had the money to do it, and you would basically be kissing the rest of your life good-bye -- would you do it? I don't know. And what's interesting is that 60, 70 years ago -- the average person on the street would say, 'Absolutely not. Only deviants and weak-willed people would do it.' I think these days the average moral person would say, 'I really don't know.' I'd like to say no, but the first time I was like really depressed or life seemed really fucked -- there's the plug.


So you don't know is the point.

What would your guess be?


About you?

No, about yourself.


I'd probably say no.

It sounds to me like you like to read too much, and if you did this.... There's things like joys of learning and joys of getting to know other people, and then there's religious stuff and all that. But all that stuff is now pulling against what I think in my generation and yours is very different from, say, our grandparents' -- an immense, gnawing, craving hunger for pleasure, and a real feeling of deprivation when we're not experiencing it. I don't think that I would do it, but I think what I would do is I would arrange to have a lot of friends around me who would keep me from doing it.

A Conversation with David Foster Wallace

by Valerie Stivers
David Foster Wallace did not expect to be the Spring '96 literary posterboy. After all, Infinite Jest is only his second novel and it spends its 1000-plus pages satirizing and decrying consumer and media culture. But the media has made him their darling nonetheless, and book-buyers are, well, buying it. And now, this self-effacing young author---and his bludgeon-sized book---have found themselves riding a self-perpetuating hype wave.

His publisher's intense publicity campaign began last summer and apparently it paid off: the novel was already in its fourth printing when it arrived in bookstores this February. Reviews and profiles have appeared everywhere from the New York Times to Salon, from the Atlantic Monthly to Puncture. Fittingly, the hype merited media coverage of its own. A book mocking products, it seems, can still be a hot one.

But my fear, as a reader of Infinite Jest, was that the joke was on me.
	
Audiences in Infinite Jest are pretty much fucked.
	You see, audiences in Infinite Jest are pretty much fucked. At the novel's core are a group of recovering drug addicts, a pair of government agents, and the three sons of filmmaker James O. Incandenza, who inhabit a not-so-distant future in which Mexico, Canada and the United States have formed O.N.A.N., the Organization of North American Nations. It is a culture ruled by mass entertainment that is consumed mostly in solitude.

The Quebecois, however, want out. In Infinite Jest, the French Canadian residents of what is in our world the Canadian province of Quebec, wage a terrorist campaign against the rest of the Onanites, whom they view as selfish, immediate-gratification seekers. Their secret weapon is Incandenza's seminal film "Infinite Jest", which, as it turns out, is a fatal kind of fun. The film is said to be so compelling, so mind-numbingly satisfying, that its viewers slip into near-comatose states. For the fun-obsessed Onanite entertainment consumer, "Infinite Jest" is an irresistible commodity.

But as I said, all this fun fatale made me paranoid. After all, I was actively enchanted, slack-jawed, and entertained by Infinite Jest---thankfully the book, not the film---so where did that leave me? It was a funhouse mirror and I had to look.

It was with no small amount of trepidation, then, that I approached the Sheraton Manhattan where Wallace was staying during the New York leg of his nine-city book tour.

More cause for nervousness was the fact that Wallace, a 34 year-old writer who teaches creative writing at Illinois State University in Bloomington, Ill., was never smiling in his publicity shots. Also, he wore an unsettling bandanna for every photo, forcing me to wonder, what's underneath the bandanna? Why does he need the bandanna? What's wrong with the top of your head, brother?
	
What's wrong with the top of your head, brother?
	My worries were totally unfounded. Wallace showed up, sans bandanna, showing a broad expanse of normal human forehead, and appeared more terrified of me than I was of him. With him was a woman I took to be either his mom or the Illinois version of a flack. "Are you his publicist?" I asked. She laughed---at me, I think, but nicely---and identified herself as Erin Poag, a friend from home.

Like his book, and like Don Gately, one of the novel's recovering drug addicts, Wallace is big and sort of square (in shape, not in attitude). While we talked about fiction as a medium of media critique and what exactly about our media-saturated culture Wallace objects to, the author of this wickedly funny, brilliant book fidgeted in his chair like a child, smoked, and inserted ungainly wads of tobacco between cheek and gum. "I know I'm really disgusting," he disclaimed. "I'm just nervous."

Talking to Wallace is like edging a large reluctant boulder onto a slope---hard to get started and difficult to stop. I got dizzy just watching him. But, despite my expectations, he was very nice. And my fear that the book was personally mocking and threatening me, the faithful reader, was, well, paranoid and off-base. Wallace does not consider his book the same kind of media entertainment that he is critiquing. It should have been obvious.

Not mistaken, however, was my conviction that Wallace, with his yarn of drug addicts and devotees, was engaged in a denouement of the human condition in a media-saturated, entertainment-mediated world. Infinite Jest is a futuristic burlesque of entertainment, a novel concerned about what we choose to get ourselves off on, and where we find ourselves when we turn away from the television or the drug wears off.

David Foster Wallace winces at the suggestion that his book is sloppy in any sense

"It may be a mess, but it's a very careful mess," he says. "A lot of work went into making it look like that. That might sound like a pathetic lie, but it's not. Now, as you can see, my dander's getting up."

Wallace's dander, however, isn't perceptibly on the rise. Seated in his hotel room at the Copley Plaza, shortly after doing Christopher Lydon's radio show and before heading out for a reading, Wallace looks tired but entirely calm. And he remains that way except when he thinks he might be coming off as pretentious or self-promoting, when he's forced to face a photographer, and when he's asked to talk about himself. "The less I'm being watched, the more I can watch, and the better it is for me and for my work," he explains. "If people really want to know what I ate for lunch, I guess that's okay. But it's kind of toxic."

Whatever the cost of celebrity, Wallace, at 34, is about as famous as serious writers get in this country before they've been dead for quite a while. Although he's glad that Infinite Jest has attracted attention, he seems genuinely baffled by all the fuss about him. "I'm somebody who spends much of his life in libraries," he says. "I'm just not that interesting."

Asked why he chose to be a writer, Wallace dodges, saying, "There isn't much else I want to do," and talks instead about writers in general: "Most of the writers I know are weird hybrids. There's a strong streak of egomania coupled with extreme shyness. Writing's kind of like exhibitionism in private. And there's also a strange loneliness, and a desire to have some kind of conversation with people, but not a real great ability to do it in person.

"When I was younger," he goes on, "I saw my relationship with the reader as sort of a sexual one. But now it seems more like a late-night conversation with really good friends, when the bullshit stops and the masks come off."

Why the conversation took the form and direction it did in Infinite Jest isn't something Wallace is anxious to explain. "You do what you do, and then afterwards you think up why you did it, so there's an element of bullshit about any explanation," he says. "I'm not going to run some lit crit thing on you," says Wallace, who teaches English at Illinois State University. "But the book doesn't work the way novels normally work." He inhales deeply and then pushes the air back out through his teeth in spurts, making a noise like a kid's imitation of a chugging locomotive. "It's really designed more like a piece of music than like a book, so a lot of it consists of leitmotifs and things that curve back. And there's all this stuff about movement within limits and whether you can puncture the limits or not."

When Wallace's erudition starts to show, he seems to feel obliged to explain it, as if it were a broken leg. "I come from a weird background. My parents are academics, and they read a lot. And I read a lot," he says, neglecting to mention that he also studied philosophy at Harvard. "So I come to writing from a pretty hard-core, abstract place. It comes out of technical philosophy and continental European theory, and extreme avant-garde shit. I'm not just talking Pynchon and Gaddis. That's commercial avant-garde. I'm talking like Beckett, and Fiction Collective 2, and Dalkey Archive." Suddenly, he slaps his forehead, swears, and makes the train noise again.

"On the other hand," he continues, "I'm somebody who can't even own a TV anymore, because I'll just sit there slack-jawed and consume enormous amounts of what is, in terms of art, absolute shit. But it's very pleasurable shit.

"If you're torn in these two different directions," he says, "it's very odd. The project, at least with this book, was to do something long and difficult that was also fun. I'm not saying it succeeds. I wanted to write something that would make somebody say, `Holy, shit, I've got to read this,' and then seduce them into doing a certain amount of work. And that -- if I can be pretentious for a second -- is what art ought to do."

One task he requires of his readers "keeping track of enormous amounts of information." Others include "being required to pay attention to some of the strategies that regular entertainment uses" and "having certain formulaic expectations that go along with reading commercial stuff fucked with. Not just disdained. Fucked with."

Case in point: the ending. "I think that some of that commercial stuff evidences a real contempt for the reader, by having such a reductive idea of what the reader wants. Like they're children and have to have their fantasies enabled and have a happy ending," says Wallace. "Plot-wise, the book doesn't come to a resolution. But if the readers perceive it as me giving them the finger, then I haven't done my job. On the surface, it might seem like it just stops. But it's supposed to stop and then kind of hum and project. Musically and emotionally, it's a pitch that seemed right."

funny face: Hello???

funny face: Where did everyone go???

yoshi: hello

yoshi: hello?

funny face: Cool... This rules!!!

funny face: Are you one of the programmers???

Marisa: Hi everyone, how are you? I am FINE

funny face: I doing great. I have been in one of these!

Keats: Hello, everyone.

Keats: Where were you in one of these before? Just curious.

Keats: Everyone has left me all alone.

Marisa: Hi there, I have absolutely nothing to say.

Marisa: As of now, I still have just about nothing to say.

dfw: I've had some unpleasant nicknaames and monikers in my time, but nobody's ever hung "fosty" on me before.

Marisa: Well, I'm just sitting here, thinking and saying nothing.

Marisa: Keats, do you feel lonely?

Marisa: If I were paranoid, I'd wonder why no one was answering me.

Keats: Not anymore, now that you and, uh, Fosty are here...

Keats: You know, I still think it should be spelled Fostie, or Fostey.

Keats: Fosty looks too much like "Frosty" and "sty" to me.

Keats: And makes me think of eyeballs packed in ice.

funny face: Sorry. I had to do some work. I am back now.

dfw: "Sty" as in an impacted eyelash or a pigpen, you mean?

Keats: Yeah. Is that what a sty as in "sty in your eye" is?

Marisa: I used to think the word "sty" was pronounced "stee".

Keats: I had no idea exactly, just an unpleasant feeling about it.

dfw: Yes. Massively painful and embarrassing, too. Like a carbuncle on the exact tip of your nose -- that sort of thing.

Keats: I used to think the word "trough" was pronounced "troff."

Keats: You know, I happen to have a carbuncle on the tip of my nose right now.

Keats: Except it's not a carbuncle, it's more like a welt. It's still embarassing.

dfw: In my very first seminar in college, I pronounced facade "fakade." The memory's still fresh and raw.

Marisa: Keats, I don't want to know about your problems and feelings.

dfw: I'd like to hear more about keats's carbuncle, though.

Keats: *sniff* I only mentioned it because I thought it was relevant.

Keats: It's actually more like a welt.

funny face: This is wierd. Kind of like walking in on a conversation or something.

Keats: I was struck in the face by a lashing cord yesterday. It was rather windy.

Keats: The trick, funny face, is to seamlessly integrate yourself into the conversation.

funny face: Keats, you don't have to take that from Marisa.

Marisa: I have performance anxiety now. See, I *can* talk about my feelings, because I'm the BOSS.

Keats: Yes I do. She is close enough geographically to inspire fear.

Jay: I've almost finished the book. What do you think about William Gaddis?

ERVIN: where is mr. wallace?

Keats: Not just an anonymous cyber-entity.

talula: A lashing cord, Keats? Windy? What have you been up to?

dfw: A carbuncle's fucking HUGE, esse. Like an eggplant or something. Actually life-threatening -- it can apparently explode like an appendix and spread toxins throughout your bloodstream. A small but riveting history of cases on death-by-carbuncle is avail

Marisa: I could beat Keats up if I wanted to.

dfw: able in back issues of "Mortality and Morbidity" magazine.

Keats: Oh well, in that case, dfw, I should not have made the comparison.

Keats: Since what I have doesn't approach the gravity of a carbuncle.

Keats: I think I'm just going to ignore Marisa. She's one of those live-chat troublemakers.

dfw: ervin, I'm not sure where I am. How does one denote locations in cyberland or whatever this is?

talula: I have some cover-up make-up if you want to use it, Keats

Keats: Nah, I'll be okay.

dfw: don't shrug off a carbuncle, keats. they're not to be played with.

talula: so, dfw, what *do* you think of William Gaddis?

koleko: i could beat up both you guys. oops. not supposed to say stupid stuff

Marisa: I am going to encourage people to save their questions until 4:00.

ERVIN: i guess what i meant, mr. wallace, is why are you talking to the carbuncle people?

Keats: I hope I didn't come off as shrugging off. Everything I type has a tinge of sarcasm to it, even when it's unintentional.

dfw: I like The Recognitions very, very much. I haven't yet got all the way through "Frolic...Own" yet.

Keats: Approx. T minus five minutes.

dfw: What happens in five minutes?

ERVIN: i dare you to finish "frolic"

talula: spontaneous combustion

Keats: Didn't Marx have a lot of carbuncles? Just before he died?

Keats: Or is that what he died from? Some carbuncle-related condition.

dfw: I thought keats was going to weigh in against that nasocartilaginous 'buncle in five, is what I thought he meant.

Joshua S.: (Strep?)

Marisa: Ok let's start this fucking thing. Officially. Now.

Keats: Oh, nah. I have no beefs with buncles. T minus three till 4:00 PM EST.

dfw: There's actually a Sherlock Holmes story called "The Case of the Fluorescent Orange Carbuncle" or something -- a real one, by A.C. Doyle.

ERVIN: the three weeks i devoted to reading "frolic" were a total and complete loss. i can never get those weeks back.

talula: didn't Eliot use the phrase "the young man carbuncular" somewhere?

dfw: we can presume it wasn't your keep of tea, then, quite, ervin?

Joshua S.: (I'm thinking staph skin lesions.)

Marisa: I wanna know why you put all that stuff about avant-garde film in the book.

Keats: Isn't there some sort of gem or precious mineral that sounds vaguely like "carbuncle" ?

Jay: Why wouldn't a person like "Frolic"?

dfw: talula: yes, it's in "The Wasteland"; the wrinkled-dugs man (I think) is watching the Young Man Carbuncular seduce a stenographer who's weeping or something. Very grim.

Keats: Apart from it being in there because it's so funny, the avant-apres-garde filmography I mean.

talula: thank you, david.

dfw: Well, Marisa & Keats, it's in there because that's the kind of films that the Dad makes.

talula: why did you choose to have the Dad make those kind of films

koleko: what are you guys talking about?

Keats: I think it was more the idea of having all those references upon references that was interesting. Maybe. Marisa?

dfw: Hmm. Well, how much time do you have?

Jay: Do you think what Joseph McElroy was doing in "Women and Men" is similar to what you're doing?

Marisa: Wow that is a great answer. You know, it's the *simple* things that seem so easy to understand, that actually take a lifetime to master--without help *from* a master, that is.

Slappy the Sad Clown: I think I hear the sound of lips hitting buttocks.

iczy: so david--a certain friend of mine (she knows who she is) gave me a bit of your essay on getting past irony (from Missis.Rvw.?) you still thinking about that stuff?

dfw: I thought that book sucked canal-water, Jay. There ARE some affinities with "Lookout Cartridge," though.

dfw: Marisa -- the point is to empty your mind of conscious cognitive thought. Become like the surface of a pond. Clap with only one hand.

Marisa: So how are things out there in Iowa, man?

Keats: I do that sometimes but it makes my forearm hurt after a while.

Marisa: Lotta clapping with one hand out there in Iowa? I'll bet there is.

koleko: hey fosty. i read your cool piece on dostoevsky in the village voice. do you think "dosty" informs your work in any way?

dfw: iczy: yes and then some. I think it's the single richest and knottiest problem young avant-esque fiction writers in this country have to contend with.

raining sheep: can you become like the surface of a pond and still suck canal water?

Keats: Sometimes I feel as if irony is enveloping everything, in a rather dangerous way.

dfw: Mareesa -- I live in Illinois. Iowans do use just one hand a great deal, but not for clapping.

Joshua S.: I was curious about your heavy use of pathology in IJ, which I enjoyed. Aside from their being a lot of it around, what made you decide to include so many medical references in the book?

Herb: Yes, irony can suck. So, what, if anything, is "redemptive" about "Infinite Book"?

dfw: koleko: Pleaase don't call me Fosty. It makes me do a full-body wince. Dostoevski informs everybody; or he ought to.

iczy: wow, you guys drive tractors around with just one hand?!

talula: Dostoevsky comes in with the redemption, is that it?

iczy: "irony can suck". how meta a statement.

dfw: Herb: Maybe nothing. I fear it's not for me to decide. The worst thing about irony for me is that it attenuates emotion. "IJ" is at least SUPPOSED to be both funny and very sad.

dfw: Dostovski meant "redemption" in a pretty specific Christian way. I don't think we now can use the word the same way.

raining sheep: it's as if the whole book is set up not only as a look at addiction, but a look a obsessive-compulsive behavior in the thoroughness of the footnotes, ie medicinal properties. No?

Herb: Well, I saw elements of hope, at least in the character of Gately.

koleko: sorry for the tasteless nickname. Dostoevsky used to take New York Post-style newspaper articles about peoples' irrational suffering then put those true stories in his books. do you mine the bleakness of our culture for your work?

dfw: iczy: are you being ironic about irony sucking?

Herb: Though of course at book's end, the reader never finds out what happens to any of the characters (which kinda pissed me off!).

Marisa: I was fascinated by the use of AA philosophy as a way to get through cynicism and irony, because I know some people in real life for whom AA had that effect.

Joshua S.: Humor and sadness are synergistic, in a weird way.

raining sheep: the endless circle of irony

dfw: koleko: I don't think one has to "mine" the culture anymore. It's what we breathe. It's all around us.

iczy: ironically, i'm not. ok, ok, i'm ambivalent about it.

dfw: I don't think irony's meant to synergize with anything as heartfelt as sadness. I think the main function of contemporary irony is to protect the speaker from being interpreted as naive or sentimental.

raining sheep: Culture seems to be mining us

talula: or sincere

Marisa: Why are people afraid to be seen as naive and sentimental?

talula: or sincere

dfw: Dear Raining Sheep: is your cyber-name an oblique intertextual reference to something?

funny face: But "raining sheep", we &rt;are< culture!

Keats: It's not cool, because it's not perceived as a useful survival strategy.

iczy: the idea of irony being a self-protective impulse is interesting...maybe there's a distinction to be drawn between definsive and , uh, offensive uses of it.

chancho: whoa, wasn't i.j. , er, using an irony-cloaking (sic?) to veil the sentimental?

raining sheep: Yes, it's referenced to a chapter from Curious Hair, I used as a song title a couple years ago.

Tristero: Is it naive and sentimental, then, to not be ironic?

dfw: Marisa: I think that's a very deep, very hard question. One answer is that commercial comedy's often set up to feature an ironist making devastating sport of someone who's naive or sentimental or pretentious or pompous.

Marisa: Here's a question for later, when we're done with irony (which I'm still interested in): do you think your work changed a lot between "Girl" and "Broom", and "Jest"?

Joshua S.: There's a lot of sadness in the book, and the humor made it easier to handle. Is what I was saying.

dfw: Dear RS, I recall the song title "It's Raining Men," but nothing about sheep. That story seems like a long time ago.

Joshua S.: But it worked with the sadness, rather than as a breather.

dfw: Tristero: ask your local potsmaster.

Keats: I'm starting to see a lot of irony in Hollywood and in advertising, but it's function seems to be to let them talk out of both sides of their mouths.

raining sheep: It was titled "the day it rained sheep", about chuck nunn jr, I believe.

Marisa: I wonder what it is people are trying to protect, psychologically, by being "on-guard" and supersmart all the time, rather than naive and sentimental.

Keats: Kind of like some of the works from the filmography: either "homage" or "parody" or both.

dfw: Keats: advertising that makes fun of itself is so powerful because it implicitly congratulates both itself and the viewer (for making the joke and getting the joke, respectively).

Keats: And at the same time deliviring the advertising message intact.

dfw: Dear Maryssa -- why do YOU think? I'd be interested in your ideas about it. It seems monstrously confusing to me.

Avrill: dfw, i was wondering what you thought of barry hannah's "the tennis handsome"

raining sheep: That's a stand-up comedian's rule, make fun of yourself, then your free to make fun of others.

duddy: The story about the raining sheep is titled "John Billy"

Keats: Is Subsidized Time (from I.J.) that kind of advertising, maybe? Very ridiculous but immensely effective?

dfw: Dear Avrilla, I'm afraid I've never read it.

Marisa: Another question...I noticed a bunch of times in the book where someone--a tennis player, or whoever--was trying to achieve a state of egolessness, in order to be better at something--like tennis. Is that an intentional sub-theme?

roxifresh: naiive and sentimental means childlike, and I think people are scared of being trampled on Marisa, like they're weak if they're not supersmart and psychologically ept.

talula: marisa: trying to protect themselves from being made fools of

raining sheep: John Billy, that's right!

Tristero: But irony isn't exactly making fun of oneself, is it?

dfw: I don't think it's supposed to be all that ridiculous. I think it's not implausible at all. Talk about Painless Revenue-Enhancement!

bookworm: Mariesa: isn't is just that being smart is the best human quality?

Marisa: Yeah but what's so bad about being a fool? I mean big deal.

Keats: But the thing with the statue of liberty holding a product? That seems ridiculous now, but were you saying that it won't seem ridiculous soon?

dfw: talula: but why is being maade a fool of such a Great Horror right now? We (I, anyway) seem to fear it more than lots of other more objectively scary things.

Marisa: QUIT ASKING ME THE QUESTIONS!!! ASK DFW!!!!

roxifresh: irony is like seredipity or chaos to me, it's the lack of order of some things, and that can be very humorous, it's not straight edged or serious, it's random acts that make me laugh or cry the hardest.

iczy: what's interesting to me is how we all sort of accept that being sentimental or emotional is the same as being naive.

Tristero: Question for dfw: Did you attend Woodstock 95?

Marisa: Who said being smart was the best human quality? That is fucked up, man.

talula: ok dfw, you tell me. Why is being made a fool of a Great Horror now?

duddy: roxifresh: Doesn't irony need to be intentional? How is a random event ironic?

Keats: Yeah, being smart sucks.

dfw: I don't think irony's about disorder. I think it's about order -- a dark confluence to events. And keats: OK, maybe the Statue holding a product might be a little ridiculous. But think of the corporate revenue it would generate!

roxifresh: that's like the point of Forrest Gump, right?

Marisa: Yeah iczy I agree with you. Well I think it all has to do with "inner child", so nyah nyah.

Keats: My intuitions about the word irony go along with dfw. Things coming together in a twitchy sort of way.

roxifresh: no, irony is not necessarily intentional at all, like finding money on the street on your way to the cash machine or something

dfw: talula: I cannot tell you. I don't think there is any one set of answers, probably. Or maybe the answer (i.e. "remedy") lies in our being willing to consideer the question seriously. It's a serious question.

Herb: dfw: In other words, toe our line or be made a fool of?

duddy: iczy: I don't think it's sentimentality that's seen as naive. To me, the argument is often about whether sincerity is naive. That was a theme of the story about the Letterman show, "My Appearance".

Tristero: Re: Woodstock 95, there's an example of a potential irony-fest, yet hardly anyone in the media pointed that out.

Marisa: "Dark confluence" is an interesting idea...but who would be doing the dark confluencing, Satan?

raining sheep: Naive, in this case, is not what you are, but what you appear to be if you're sensitive and sincere, and that is screwed up.

Keats: The hidden forces of existence. Oooh--eeeeeh---oooh-aaah.

dfw: Herb -- irony and hip ennui are extremely authoritarian, I think -- so yes. And that's paradoxical, since hip irony gained much of its cultural momentum through being an engine of rebellion.

Marisa: Yeah I think there is this horrible compulsion to be cool that has, like, ruined everyone of a certain couple of age cohorts. Seriously.

roxifresh: can you explain ennui to me, please, I'm not getting that dfw, thanks

Avrill: dfw, what do you make of that song at the end of "gravity's rainbow"?

dfw: Marisa: you're making Descartes' error, deducing Agent from Event. Confluence could itself be Satan, or God.

Keats: It seems like being really sincere is hip in some contexts too, though.

Slappy the Sad Clown: ennui is French for boredom

talula: being cool and not looking like a fool are actually survival skills in the wild

duddy: Devo said "We're through being cool" a long time ago

iczy: re: ennui: there's nothing more boring than being bored. i want to stop.

Marisa: Same difference--at least that's what we used to like to say back in Minnesota.

dfw: Keats was complaining of a carbuncle earlier. How's that carbuncle, Keats?

Herb: Everyone said everything a long time ago.

roxifresh: yeah Marisa, I went to a Hot Wheels Club meeting (the little metal cars) with this 28 year old guy who's trying to impress me and vice versa and we had as much fun there as in , well, you know.

raining sheep: duddy: and yet that was cool - more irony

iczy: and (ironically) devo is so fucking cool for having said that (even more for having said it 15 years ago)

Herb: (aren't I ironic?)

Marisa: Wow we are all being so heavy here. Everyone who's sincere is now kicked OUT! Time to PAR-TAY!!!

dfw: duddy -- I doubt you need it pointed out that Devo was trying to be cool when they said that. Trying to be anti-cool is just one exponent off trying to be cool -- it's the same beast.

duddy: but I'm just being sincere ...

sterno: well all riiight!

koleko: hey dfw. how do you like to party?

Keats: dfw: I don't really have a carbuncle, already. I was mistaken about the meaning of the word, which is the case with me and most words.

dfw: This horse walks into a bar, and the bartender says: "Why the long face?"

Marisa: "Sincerity" is *sooooo*, like, 5 minutes ago. Let's talk about our physical and mental disorders now.

Joshua S.: dfw: On the topic of carbuncles. What made you decide to use so much pathology in IJ?

Tantivy: Emo

talula: dfw what's your worst character flaw?

roxifresh: I got a Hot Wheel Viper in green sparkly color, partaaay! And a red-hot Lexus coupe too!

dfw: koleko -- define "party." I never have understood the word as a verb.

raining sheep: a termite walks into the same bar and asks "is the bar-tender here?"

Keats: And references to various branches of knowledge in general.

Herb: Is there no "ending" to "Infinite Book" because there couldn't be? Or did you just get tired of writing it?

Marisa: Hey sheep, I don't get your joke.

talula: Come on, David , your worst character trait?

Herb: you are irony-impaired, Mareeesa!

Marisa: I wanna know what dfw does for fun out there in the fields of Iowa.

dfw: Herb -- there is an ending as far as I'm concerned. Certain kind of parallel lines are supposed to start converging in such a way that an "end" can be projected by the reader somewhere beyond the right frame. If no such convergence or projection occur

Tristero: A lobster walks into a bar and the bartender says sorry, buddy, we don't serve food.

raining sheep: is the bar tender here, the bar being made of wood and termites loving wood together make a really stupid joke

dfw: ed to you, then the book's failed for you.

Marisa: Herb: I would tell you to fuck off, but, like, I don't wanna hurt you.

Keats: He lives in Illinois, M-risa. The whole midwest is probably one big blob for you now, huh?

Herb: oh, it occurred to me. Guess I just sometimes get annoyed when it's not s-p-e-l-l-e-d o-u-t for me.

dfw: My worst character flaw that I'm conscious of is that I tend to think my way into circles instead of resolving anything. It's paralyzing and boring for people around me.

Keats: I think dfw has goten pretty good at answering that question. But I'm satisfied with that answer.

Marisa: Keats, that was my little joke. Hey, I want to know if dfw likes Denis Johnson's books.

talula: Uh oh.

koleko: i guess that gets amplified by the fields of iowa. maybe if you "partied" more, this phenomenon would halt

duddy: David, what was the impetus for renaming part of Brighton and Allston to be Enfield, MA? I used to live across the street from St. Elizabeth's Hospital.

Keats: The internet is a humor-impairing device.

dfw: Marisa -- I'm a huge Denis Johnson fan. He actually used to live near where I went to grad school. It was his poetry that first grabbed me.

Tristero: what about David Gates?

dfw: Isn't there a real Enfield? No wonder people always looked at me funny in Boston when I asked for directions.

Marisa: On the WELL some guy researched Enfield, MA and discovered it had been flooded to make a reservoir, and all the townspeople were evacuated.

raining sheep: humor is all timing, and 14.4 or 28.8 still make for joke grenades

Tantivy: asking for directions in Boston deserves a funny look

dfw: Gates's habit of using the Royal We irks me a bit, but overall his taste in fiction is hard to impugn.

raining sheep: 14.4 & 28.8 being modem speeds, of course

Tristero: people on the well have a little too much free time...

billygoat1: dfw, what do you make of that lightbulb in the middle of "gravity's rainbow"?

dfw: Marisa -- will wonders never cease.

Herb: dfw: Do you think there's a "hero" in IJ? Or at least one character you were closest to? Who?

raining sheep: billygoat: speaking of long books

Marisa: What rock groups do you like, dfw?

Tristero: Much appealing irony was found in Jernigan, Gates' novel

dfw: bg1 -- harold bloom has a real famous exgesis of Byron -- I forget which of Bloom's books it's in.

valmar: Hi DFW, It's your friend Valmar!

Herb: I mean, do you live with these characters in your head, or just watch them like a movie?

dfw: herb -- it would depend what you meant by "hero." Furilloesque hero, or McGarretesque hero, or cat.her., or what?

dfw: M -- I listen almost exclusively to the Archies. It's an Inner Child thing.

Marisa: I love that classification of hero-types

Keats: So which hero in IJ is the purely inactive one?

Herb: Well, yeah, fine, "hero" is vague. So, which character did you feel closest to?

dfw: herb -- I don't mean to be a pain, but you'd have to be more explicit about "live with...head" and "watch...movie."

iczy: i read on the well the archies are touring this summer. opening act on the schoolhouse rock tour.

valmar: I love the Archies. Sugarhoneyhoney!

Marisa: I bet you haven't listened to the Archies in 20 years, poser.

dfw: Keats -- Hal.

billygoat1: yes, i've read the bloom thing, i actually think it was written by one of his graduate students and it struck me as kind of stupid. among other things, bloom seems to think Byron is funny, hilariously funny, do you?

dfw: Hi Valmar! I'm in cyberspace! Look at me!

jr: DFW --Great book. Not enough tennis though. Do you plan on writing more tennis-fiction?

Keats: Ah, makes sense. Thanks. (about the inactive hero thing I mean)

valmar: Way to go, DFW!

DaleK: Mr. Wallace, I'm curious...who among current novelists do you find the most interesting?

raining sheep: dfw: are you in favor of "legalization?" IJ came up in a discussion recently around the bong at how a lot of obsessive nature comes from having to hide to do it. It seems so unhealthy to hide anything that you deem worthwhile to do.

Herb: I mean, are your characters like real people to you, or like characters in a film you're watching?

Marisa: Yeah by the way thanks for writing so well, we in cyberspace cheer you on, dfw.

dfw: Dalek -- DeLillo, Ozick, R. Powers, AM Homes, Denis Johnson, David Markson, (old) JA Phillips and Louise Erdrich.

valmar: What about William T. Vollman? I think he pretty much rules.

Incster: McGuane? Chabon?

DaleK: Thank you...Ozick and Powers seem to have remarkable intellects.

dfw: OK. I have no opinion on decriminalization. Given the tobacco thing now, it hasn't got a snowball's chance. My cybertime is drawing short. How do I get out of here? Will I retain corporeal form?

Marisa: Bummer, I have a million questions but time is not infinite. DFW has to go in a minute.

DaleK: Nice to see Erdrich on your list...she's a graduate of my institution.

dfw: Or will I be one of thosse smooth shiny metallic crash-dummyish things you see in popular depictions of people in cyberlaand?

Joshua S.: dfw: There are a lot of half- and unsolvable puzzles in the book, like the Mold Thing. Was your intention, among other things, to comment on the futility of puzzle solving?

Marisa: Hey everyone say kiss kiss g'bye...

valmar: DFW, before you go, what book should I read next?

jr: DFW- Tennis. Do you still play? Will you write about it again?

Keats: You may go, dfw, but we have uploaded a pattern of your neural net onto our server for later use.

iczy: no no, dfw, you look almost realistic.

dfw: Dalek -- I hope you weren't in the Locked part. I don't know how, but apparently WORD has some kind of timer on this modem, so at a certaain point it'll cut off and I'll just st

koleko: but marisa.. we were just getting started

raining sheep: Infinitely informative chat, I commend you sir Wallace

koleko: hey dfw: if you were being executed, what would your final wish be?

DAVID FOSTER WALLACE

    By LAURA MILLER

    Illustration by Harry Aung

David Foster Wallace's low-key, bookish appearance flatly contradicts the unshaven, bandanna-capped image advanced by his publicity photos. But then, even a hipster novelist would have to be a serious, disciplined writer to produce a 1,079-page book in three years. "Infinite Jest," Wallace's mammoth second novel, juxtaposes life in an elite tennis academy with the struggles of the residents of a nearby halfway house, all against a near-future background in which the U.S., Canada and Mexico have merged, Northern New England has become a vast toxic waste dump and everything from private automobiles to the very years themselves are [Sneak Peeks: New from Julian Barnes, Angela Carter and the Ragin' Cajun] sponsored by corporate advertisers. Slangy, ambitious and occasionally over-enamored with the prodigious intellect of its author, "Infinite Jest" nevertheless has enough solid emotional ballast to keep it from capsizing. And there's something rare and exhilarating about a contemporary author who aims to capture the spirit of his age.

The 34-year-old Wallace, who teaches at Illinois State University in Bloomington-Normal and exhibits the careful modesty of a recovering smart aleck, discussed American life on the verge of the millennium, the pervasive influence of pop culture, the role of fiction writers in an entertainment-saturated society, teaching literature to freshmen and his own maddening, inspired creation during a recent reading tour for "Infinite Jest."

What were you intending to do when you started this book?

I wanted to do something sad. I'd done some funny stuff and some heavy, intellectual stuff, but I'd never done anything sad. And I wanted it not to have a single main character. The other banality would be: I wanted to do something real American, about what it's like to live in America around the millennium.

And what is that like?

There's something particularly sad about it, something that doesn't have very much to do with physical circumstances, or the economy, or any of the stuff that gets talked about in the news. It's more like a stomach-level sadness. I see it in myself and my friends in different ways. It manifests itself as a kind of lostness. Whether it's unique to our generation I really don't know. 

Not much of the press about "Infinite Jest" addresses the role that Alcoholics Anonymous plays in the story. How does that connect with your overall theme?

The sadness that the book is about, and that I was going through, was a real American type of sadness. I was white, upper-middle-class, obscenely well-educated, had had way more career success than I could have legitimately hoped for and was sort of adrift. A lot of my friends were the same way. Some of them were deeply into drugs, others were unbelievable workaholics. Some were going to singles bars every night. You could see it played out in 20 different ways, but it's the same thing.

Some of my friends got into AA. I didn't start out wanting to write a lot of AA stuff, but I knew I wanted to do drug addicts and I knew I wanted to have a halfway house. I went to a couple of meetings with these guys and thought that it was tremendously powerful. That part of the book is supposed to be living enough to be realistic, but it's also supposed to stand for a response to lostness and what you do when the things you thought were going to make you OK, don't. The bottoming out with drugs and the AA response to that was the starkest thing that I could find to talk about that.

I get the feeling that a lot of us, privileged Americans, as we enter our early 30s, have to find a way to put away childish things and confront stuff about spirituality and values. Probably the AA model isn't the only way to do it, but it seems to me to be one of the more vigorous.

The characters have to struggle with the fact that the AA system is teaching them fairly deep things through these seemingly simplistic clich{\'e}s.

It's hard for the ones with some education, which, to be mercenary, is who this book is targeted at. I mean this is caviar for the general literary fiction reader. For me there was a real repulsion at the beginning. "One Day at a Time," right? I'm thinking 1977, Norman Lear, starring Bonnie Franklin. Show me the needlepointed sampler this is written on. But apparently part of addiction is that you need the substance so bad that when they take it away from you, you want to die. And it's so awful that the only way to deal with it is to build a wall at midnight and not look over it. Something as banal and reductive as "One Day at a Time" enabled these people to walk through hell, which from what I could see the first six months of detox is. That struck me.

It seems to me that the intellectualization and aestheticizing of principles and values in this country is one of the things that's gutted our generation. All the things that my parents said to me, like "It's really important not to lie." OK, check, got it. I nod at that but I really don't feel it. Until I get to be about 30 and I realize that if I lie to you, I also can't trust you. I feel that I'm in pain, I'm nervous, I'm lonely and I can't figure out why. Then I realize, "Oh, perhaps the way to deal with this is really not to lie." The idea that something so simple and, really, so aesthetically uninteresting -- which for me meant you pass over it for the interesting, complex stuff -- can actually be nourishing in a way that arch, meta, ironic, pomo stuff can't, that seems to me to be important. That seems to me like something our generation needs to feel.

Are you trying to find similar meanings in the pop culture material you use? That sort of thing can be seen as merely clever, or shallow.

I've always thought of myself as a realist. I can remember fighting with my professors about it in grad school. The world that I live in consists of 250 advertisements a day and any number of unbelievably entertaining options, most of which are subsidized by corporations that want to sell me things. The whole way that the world acts on my nerve endings is bound up with stuff that the guys with leather patches on their elbows would consider pop or trivial or ephemeral. I use a fair amount of pop stuff in my fiction, but what I mean by it is nothing different than what other people mean in writing about trees and parks and having to walk to the river to get water a 100 years ago. It's just the texture of the world I live in.

What's it like to be a young fiction writer today, in terms of getting started, building a career and so on?

Personally, I think it's a really neat time. I've got friends who disagree. Literary fiction and poetry are real marginalized right now. There's a fallacy that some of my friends sometimes fall into, the ol' "The audience is stupid. The audience only wants to go this deep. Poor us, we're marginalized because of TV, the great hypnotic blah, blah." You can sit around and have these pity parties for yourself. Of course this is bullshit. If an art form is marginalized it's because it's not speaking to people. One possible reason is that the people it's speaking to have become too stupid to appreciate it. That seems a little easy to me.

If you, the writer, succumb to the idea that the audience is too stupid, then there are two pitfalls. Number one is the avant-garde pitfall, where you have the idea that you're writing for other writers, so you don't worry about making yourself accessible or relevant. You worry about making it structurally and technically cutting edge: involuted in the right ways, making the appropriate intertextual references, making it look smart. Not really caring about whether you're communicating with a reader who cares something about that feeling in the stomach which is why we read. Then, the other end of it is very crass, cynical, commercial pieces of fiction that are done in a formulaic way -- essentially television on the page -- that manipulate the reader, that set out grotesquely simplified stuff in a childishly riveting way.

What's weird is that I see these two sides fight with each other and really they both come out of the same thing, which is a contempt for the reader, an idea that literature's current marginalization is the reader's fault. The project that's worth trying is to do stuff that has some of the richness and challenge and emotional and intellectual difficulty of avant-garde literary stuff, stuff that makes the reader confront things rather than ignore them, but to do that in such a way that it's also pleasurable to read. The reader feels like someone is talking to him rather than striking a number of poses.

Part of it has to do with living in an era when there's so much entertainment available, genuine entertainment, and figuring out how fiction is going to stake out its territory in that sort of era. You can try to confront what it is that makes fiction magical in a way that other kinds of art and entertainment aren't. And to figure out how fiction can engage a reader, much of whose sensibility has been formed by pop culture, without simply becoming more shit in the pop culture machine. It's unbelievably difficult and confusing and scary, but it's neat. There's so much mass commercial entertainment that's so good and so slick, this is something that I don't think any other generation has confronted. That's what it's like to be a writer now. I think it's the best time to be alive ever and it's probably the best time to be a writer. I'm not sure it's the easiest time.

What do you think is uniquely magical about fiction?

Oh, Lordy, that could take a whole day! Well, the first line of attack for that question is that there is this existential loneliness in the real world. I don't know what you're thinking or what it's like inside you and you don't know what it's like inside me. In fiction I think we can leap over that wall itself in a certain way. But that's just the first level, because the idea of mental or emotional intimacy with a character is a delusion or a contrivance that's set up through art by the writer. There's another level that a piece of fiction is a conversation. There's a relationship set up between the reader and the writer that's very strange and very complicated and hard to talk about. A really great piece of fiction for me may or may not take me away and make me forget that I'm sitting in a chair. There's real commercial stuff can do that, and a riveting plot can do that, but it doesn't make me feel less lonely.

There's a kind of Ah-ha! Somebody at least for a moment feels about something or sees something the way that I do. It doesn't happen all the time. It's these brief flashes or flames, but I get that sometimes. I feel unalone -- intellectually, emotionally, spiritually. I feel human and unalone and that I'm in a deep, significant conversation with another consciousness in fiction and poetry in a way that I don't with other art.

Who are the writers who do this for you?

Here's the hard thing about talking about that: I don't mean to say my work is as good as theirs. I'm talking about stars you steer by.

Understood.

OK. Historically the stuff that's sort of rung my cherries: Socrates' funeral oration, the poetry of John Donne, the poetry of Richard Crashaw, every once in a while Shakespeare, although not all that often, Keats' shorter stuff, Schopenhauer, Descartes' [David Foster Wallace's Bookbag] "Meditations on First Philosophy" and "Discourse on Method," Kant's "Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysic," although the translations are all terrible, William James' "Varieties of Religious Experience," Wittgenstein's "Tractatus," Joyce's "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," Hemingway -- particularly the ital stuff in "In Our Time," where you just go oomph!, Flannery O'Connor, Cormac McCarthy, Don DeLillo, A.S. Byatt, Cynthia Ozick -- the stories, especially one called "Levitations," about 25 percent of the time Pynchon. Donald Barthelme, especially a story called "The Balloon," which is the first story I ever read that made me want to be a writer, Tobias Wolff, Raymond Carver's best stuff -- the really famous stuff. Steinbeck when he's not beating his drum, 35 percent of Stephen Crane, "Moby-Dick," "The Great Gatsby."

And, my God, there's poetry. Probably Phillip Larkin more than anyone else, Louise Gl&uumlck, Auden.

What about colleagues?

There's the whole "great white male" deal. I think there are about five of us under 40 who are white and over 6 feet and wear glasses. There's Richard Powers who lives only about 45 minutes away from me and who I've met all of once. William Vollman, Jonathan Franzen, Donald Antrim, Jeffrey Eugenides, Rick Moody. The person I'm highest on right now is George Saunders, whose book "Civilwarland in Bad Decline" just came out, and is well worth a great deal of attention. A.M. Homes: her longer stuff I don't think is perfect, but every few pages there's something that just doubles you over. Kathryn Harrison, Mary Karr, who's best known for "The Liar's Club" but is also a poet and I think the best female poet under 50. A woman named Cris Mazza. Rikki Ducornet, Carole Maso. Carole Maso's "Ava" is just -- a friend of mine read it and said it gave him an erection of the heart.

Tell me about your teaching.

I was hired to teach creative writing, which I don't like to teach.

There's two weeks of stuff you can teach someone who hasn't written 50 things yet and is still kind of learning. Then it becomes more a matter of managing various people's subjective impressions about how to tell the truth vs. obliterating someone's ego.

I like to teach freshman lit because ISB gets a lot of rural students who aren't very well educated and don't like to read. They've grown up thinking that literature means dry, irrelevant, unfun stuff, like cod liver oil. Getting to show them some more contemporary stuff -- the one we always do the second week is a story called "A Real Doll," by A.M. Homes, from "The Safety of Objects," about a boy's affair with a Barbie doll. It's very smart, but on the surface, it's very twisted and sick and riveting and real relevant to people who are 18 and five or six years ago were either playing with dolls or being sadistic to their sisters. To watch these kids realize that reading literary stuff is sometimes hard work, but it's sometimes worth it and that reading literary stuff can give you things that you can't get otherwise, to see them wake up to that is extremely cool.

How do you feel about the reaction to the length of your book? Did it just sort of wind up being that long, or do you feel that you're aiming for a particular effect or statement?

I know it's risky because it's part of this equation of making demands on the reader -- which start out financial. The other side of it is publishing houses hate it because they make less money. Paper is so expensive. If the length seems gratuitous, as it did to a very charming Japanese lady from the New York Times, then one arouses ire. And I'm aware of that. The manuscript that I delivered was 1700 manuscript pages, of which close to 500 were cut. So this editor didn't just buy the book and shepherd it. He line-edited it twice. I flew to New York, and all that. If it looks chaotic, good, but everything that's in there is in there on purpose. I'm in a good emotional position to take shit for the length because the length strikes people as gratuitous, then the book just fails. It's not gratuitous because I didn't feel like working on it or making the cuts.

It's a weird book. It doesn't move the way normal books do. It's got a whole bunch of characters. I think it makes at least an in-good-faith attempt to be fun and riveting enough on a page-by-page level so I don't feel like I'm hitting the reader with a mallet, you know, "Hey, here's this really hard impossibly smart thing. Fuck you. See if you can read it." I know books like that and they piss me off.

What made you choose a tennis academy, which mirrors the halfway house in the book?

I wanted to do something with sport and the idea of dedication to a pursuit being kind of like an addiction.

Some of the characters wonder if it's worth it, the competitive obsession.

It's probably like this in anything. I see my students do this with me. You're a young writer. You admire an older writer, and you want to get to where that older writer is. You imagine that all the energy that your envy is putting into it has somehow been transferred to him, that there's a flipside to it, a feeling of being envied that's a good feeling the way that envy is a hard feeling. You can see it as the idea of being in things for some kind of imaginary goal involving prestige rather than for the pursuit itself. It's a very American illness, the idea of giving yourself away entirely to the idea of working in order to achieve some sort of brass ring that usually involves people feeling some way about you -- I mean, people wonder why we walk around feeling alienated and lonely and stressed out?

Tennis is the one sport I know enough about for it to be beautiful to me, for me to think that it means something. The nice thing about it is that I've got Tennis magazine wanting to do something about me. For me personally it's been great. I may get to hit with the pros some day. It has that advantage.

David Foster Wallace

Tom Scocca talks about fiction, fellatio, and
meddling editors with the best American essayist who
regularly uses like as punctuation

By Erica Werner

"I've never been considered Press before," writes
David Foster Wallace at the beginning of his 1993
essay "Getting Away from Already Pretty Much Being
Away from It All." That may be technically true; when
Harper's sent Wallace to do the piece, for which he
was issued press credentials and explored the
Illinois State Fair, he went as a novelist on a lark.
Still, reading that disclaimer now feels a bit like
watching an ing{\'e}nue fumble with a pool cue before
running the table: the 55-page piece, like most of
the other six essays gathered in A Supposedly Fun
Thing I'll Never Do Again, is a masterly example of
nonfiction.

Wallace's reputation still rests mainly on his
fiction, especially 1996's 1079-page Infinite Jest
(Little, Brown). But the humor and intellectual
deftness that made the 35-year-old Wallace a hot
young property in the world of literary novels -- he
won a MacArthur "genius" grant last year, and the
words virtuosity and brilliance tend to tumble across
his blurb pages -- also make him a captivating
reporter. The writing in A Supposedly Fun Thing, the
1997 collection of his magazine work now reissued in
paperback, has the sort of conceptual and stylistic
force that gets a writer talked about as a
generational icon. The title essay, a 96-page account
(including 137 of Wallace's distinctive footnotes) of
a seven-day Caribbean luxury cruise, has assumed
epochal status; Phoenix book reviewer Jordan
Ellenberg called another essay -- the athlete profile
"Tennis Player Michael Joyce's Professional Artistry
as a Paradigm of Certain Stuff about Choice, Freedom,
Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie, and Human
Completeness" -- "the best piece of sports writing I
have ever read."

In advance of the Boston reading on his A Supposedly
Fun Thing paperback tour, he spoke to the Phoenix by
phone from his home in Bloomington, Illinois.

Q: Okay, for basic reader orientation, are you doing
this from Bloomington?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Are you looking forward to seeing Boston?

A: Yeah. I was there last year, and I read at the
Brattle Theatre. Last night I went and saw Good Will
Hunting, which takes place not exactly where I used
to live, in Boston, but pretty darn close, so I've
been all flush with nostalgia for it. I was in Boston
from summer of '89 until spring of '92.

Q: So what did you think of Good Will Hunting?

A: I think it's the ultimate nerd fantasy movie. It's
a bit of a fairy tale, but I enjoyed it a lot. Minnie
Driver is really to fall sideways for. And there's
all kinds of cool stuff. It's actually a movie that's
got calculus in it. It takes place in Boston.

One guy I talked to who saw it described it as a
cross between Ordinary People and The Computer Wore
Tennis Shoes. If you see it, you'll see that that's
not un-germane. Do you remember The Computer Wore
Tennis Shoes? It's got Kurt Russell. There's an
electrical accident in the computer room when he's a
student in some college. It's like the old sci-fi,
toxic-accident-turns-him-into-Spiderman thing. These
are great old computers, with like reel-to-reel tapes
running back and forth, and it apparently injects him
with every bit of data known to man, and he goes on
College Bowl. You should check it out. Disney, I
think '69, '70.

Q: How do the different kinds of writing differ for
you, fiction versus nonfiction?

A: Golly. You know, I'm not a journalist and I don't
pretend to be one, and most of the pieces in the book
were assigned to me with these maddening instructions
like, "Just go to a certain spot, and kind of turn
360 degrees a few times and tell us what you see."

I'll be honest: I think of myself as a fiction
writer. Fiction's more important for me, so I'm more
scared and tense about fiction, more worried about
whether I'm any good or not. The weird thing is that
when a couple of the nonfiction pieces got attention,
then other magazines started to call. And then I
start thinking of myself as doing that, too, and Mr.
Ego gets in there and I begin worrying and sweating
over that stuff.

Q: As you're getting more offers, are there things
you don't want to write about?

A: Well, I've decided I'm not going to do any more
nonfiction for a while, 'cause I'll use that as an
excuse not to work on fiction. The funny thing is, I
think magazines are all so desperate for stuff that
-- when was it? There was that really long piece
about the cruise, and a version of it appeared in
Harper's, and for I think about six days I was really
hot with these editors. There was one offer to go to
a nudist colony and write about being in a nudist
colony, and there was one offer -- Elizabeth Taylor
was having the product launch of some new perfume,
which bizarrely was being held at an Air Force base.
There was an offer to interview David Bowie. I don't
know anything about David Bowie. For a while there
were all these offers and it was really neat. I took
a couple that I thought were going to be kind of
interesting to me, but most of them I just kind of
laughed and said, Thanks anyway.

Q: There are several places around the book where you
lay down a challenge to the editors -- where you say
that they probably won't like this, or they'll cut
this. Were there some of those that didn't make it
into the original magazine articles?

A: Well, the reason for doing the book -- other than
the fact that Little, Brown said they'd publish it,
and I of course am a whore -- is that this was the
chance to do the long, original versions of these
things that had gone through meat grinders in various
magazines.

I'd worked really hard on these things, and then
magazines sliced and diced them, and here was the
chance to do kind of a director's cut. [Laughs.] You
don't have to put in the thing about me being a whore
-- by which I simply meant it's just a big thrill to
have a publishing company be willing to publish one
of your books.

Q: How long was the initial version of the title
essay [about the cruise], and how much writing time
did that represent?

A: I always try to fool the magazine editors by
sending stuff single-spaced, in eight-point font.
Which of course insults them because they think,
what, I think they're idiots? So then they call me up
and get pissed and I send it back in 12-point font,
double-spaced. I think the cruise essay was about 110
pages, and it ended up getting cut just about in
half. And every time I'd bitch and moan to Harper's
they would say, Well, this is still going to be the
longest thing we've ever put in Harper's. At which
point I would have to shut up or look like an even
bigger prima donna than I am.

But the cruise thing took almost three months to do,
and then it took another two weeks -- I had to go to
New York and sit in a room with the editor. It was
very exciting. Rewrote the ending like an hour before
they had to wrap the magazine. It was like that
moment in Broadcast News when Joan Cusack was having
to run through the hallway to get the tape to Jack
Nicholson in time to run it. Kind of like my peak
moment in the magazine industry, and it was one I'll
always remember.

Q: How do you handle being responsible for facts --
after writing fiction, coming to a genre where the
things you say have to be on some level verifiably
true?

A: The thing is, really, between you and me and the
Boston Phoenix's understanding readers, you hire a
fiction writer to do nonfiction, there's going to be
the occasional bit of embellishment. Not to mention
the fact that when people tell you stuff, very often
it comes out real stilted, if you just write down
exactly what they said. You sort of have to rewrite
it so it sounds more out loud, which I think means
putting in some likes or taking out punctuation that
the person might originally have said. And I don't
really make any apologies for that.

Q: Have you heard back from the people that you're
writing about? Trudy [in "A Supposedly Fun Thing"]
especially comes to mind --

A: [groan]

Q: -- who you described as looking like --

A: That was a very, very bad scene, because they were
really nice to me on the cruise and actually sent me
a couple cards and were looking forward to the thing
coming out, and then it came out, and I never heard
from them again.

The thing is, saying that somebody looks like Jackie
Gleason in drag -- it might not be very nice, but if
you could have seen her, it was true. It was just
absolutely true.

One reason why I don't do a lot of these is that
there's a real delicate balance between fucking
somebody over and telling the truth to the reader.
The Michael Joyce essay was really, really upsetting.
It was originally commissioned by a different
magazine, and I screwed up, because I really got to
like this kid. There was some stuff that he told me
and then asked me not to print, and I didn't. But I,
dickhead that I am, made the mistake of telling the
magazine this, and they ended up killing the piece.

One reason why I might have put in some
not-particularly-kind stuff on the cruise is that I
felt like I'd learned my lesson. I wasn't going to
hurt anybody, but I was going to tell the truth. I
couldn't worry so about Trudy's feelings that I
couldn't say the truth, which was -- you know, a
terrific, really nice, and not unattractive lady who
did happen to look just like Jackie Gleason in drag.

Q: Your footnotes have a way of making the reader
break stride, or have to loop around and backtrack.
How hard do you want the reader to have to work?

A: I don't really think that way, because I don't
want to go down that path of trying to anticipate,
like a chess player, every reader's reaction. The
honest thing is, the footnotes were an intentional,
programmatic part of Infinite Jest, and you get sort
of addicted to them. A lot of these pieces were
written around the time that I was typing and working
on Infinite Jest. It's a kind of loopy way of
thinking that it seems to me is in some ways mimetic.

I don't know about you, but certainly the way I think
about things and experience things is not
particularly linear, and it's not orderly, and it's
not pyramidical, and there are a lot of loops.

Most of the nonfiction pieces are basically just:
Look, I'm not a great journalist, and I can't
interview anybody. But what I can do is slice open my
head for you, and let you see a cross-section of an
averagely bright person's head. And in a way, the
footnotes I think are better representations of
thought patterns and fact patterns.

The tricky thing with the footnotes is that they are
an irritant, and they require a little extra work,
and so they either have to be really germane or they
have to be fun to read. It does get to be a problem,
though, when every single gag that occurs to me, I
think I can toss in as a footnote. The most heavily
cut thing in the book was the David Lynch essay. The
book editor had me cut like a third of it, and a lot
of it was footnotes that were just gags. And I think
he had a good point.

Q: How much gag writing do you do? To what extent do
you try to be deliberately humorous?

A: [Sighs.] I'll tell you, I think another reason I'm
not doing any more of these for a while is that by
the end there really was kind of a schtick emerging:
the somewhat neurotic, hyperconscious guy showing you
how weird this thing is that not everybody thinks is
weird. I think it's more trying to notice stuff that
everybody else notices but they don't really notice
that they notice. Which I think a fair number of good
comedians do, too.

Q: I mean, when you have something like the oil rigs
"bobbing fellatially" . . .

A: Yeah, except that's exactly how it looks.

Q: That is exactly how they look, but it's funny
enough to . . .

A: But that was another big fight, 'cause I
originally had fellatically, which I thought sounded
better and had more of a kind of harsh, glottal,
fellatiatory sound, and then the copyeditor goes,
"There's no such word, we've got to say fellatially,"
and I think that sounds like palatially, and I don't
like it, and so 48 hours is spent thumb-wrestling
over this bullshit.

Q: You said there was a period of time, like six
days, when you were really hot with magazine editors.
How's the whole pendulum of fame swinging?

A: The degree of fame we're talking about here --
getting hot as a writer for six days is equivalent to
a fan base of, like, a local TV weatherman, right?
Magazines are certainly not calling every day to ask
me to do stuff anymore, which to be honest is
something of a relief, 'cause there's other stuff I'm
working on.

I've been doing this since the mid-'80s, and so,
since the mid-'80s, I've watched I don't know how
many writers get hot and then not get hot, and then
get hot again, and then not get hot. A lot of it is
just the peristalsis of the industry. The industry, I
think, is so pressed, and so anxious to create heat
and buzz around specific people. It's the same way
movies are, the same way music is, although the
amount of money at stake in books is vanishingly
small. It's nice when the phone doesn't ring as much,
and it's not very good for me when people treat me
like a big shot, because then I get puffed up inside.
But other than that, it doesn't really make much
difference.

Q: How big does the big-shot treatment get?

A: I remember giving a reading at a bookstore in
Harvard Square. It was December of '91, and Harper's
had this whole idea that they were going to put on
these readings. The Harper's PR person came to
Boston, and I came and I gave a reading, and nobody
showed up. There was a snowstorm, but the basic point
is, nobody showed up. So me and the PR guy went out
and ate, like, three pieces of cake each and
apologized to each other for three hours.

So, being used to that kind of stuff, giving a
reading in New York and having some people not be
able to get in is weird, and it makes you feel like
you're a big shot. Temporarily. The Sauron-like eye
of the culture passes over you, like in Lord of the
Rings. You're old enough to know Lord of the Rings. A
bitchingly good read, I think.

Q: Are there any nonfiction writers who've inspired
your work?

A: Ever since I was in college, I've been an enormous
fan of both Joan Didion and Pauline Kael. And, I
don't know . . . I think prosewise, Pauline Kael is
unequaled. Maybe John McPhee, at his very best, is as
good. I don't know what influence they have, but in
terms of just being a slobbering fan of . . . Frank
Conroy's first book, Tobias Wolff's This Boy's Life.
Oh, God, there's a book by a mathematician named
Hardy at Oxford called A Mathematician's Apology.
Hardy gets mentioned in Good Will Hunting, by the
way. Anyway. There are quite a few that are just
really, really, really, really good. But I'd say
Pauline Kael is the best. Annie Dillard's really
good, but she's much more sort of restrained.

Q: There's one other thing that I wanted to ask you
about, which was the relationship between footnotes
and hypertext.

A: I've had people say that, and I would love them to
think that there's some grand theory. I sometimes use
a computer to type when I've got a lot of corrections
to do, but I don't have a modem, I've never been on
the Internet. There's a guy in my department who
teaches hypertext, but I don't really know anything
about it.

Q: You do your stuff by typewriter?

A: I mostly typewrite. Some of the magazine stuff I
did on disk, because you learn that the magazines
very often will ask for a disk. And there's this
great term they use: they say, Well, we'll just take
the disk and massage it. I still can't get them to be
entirely clear what "massage" means. I guess it
means, like, changing the formats or something. I
think it's a terrific term to use for a disk.

But basically, I can type and I can save stuff onto
disk, and that's just about it, in terms of
computers. I feel like an old fogy.

Good luck on this. You're going to exceed whatever
word limit, I'll bet.

Q: Yeah. Well, we're just going to take the whole
tape and, you know, cut it down into something that
--

A: Just massage the tape.

Q: We're going to massage the tape.

A: Cool.

by Chris O'Connor and Rob Elder
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man-
David Foster Wallace
courtesy photo 	

At age 35, author David Foster Wallace has been hailed as "probably the most ambitious and prodigious literary talent of his generation."

A reluctant literary figure, Wallace seldom grants interviews and is self-conscious about his public persona.

While frequently compared to postmodern icons Thomas Pynchon and John Barth, Wallace prefers to see himself outside of that tradition.

As part of a younger generation raised on irony and self-reference, Wallace examines the American psyche in a culture where everyone is both a critic and a character, a product and a consumer.

His infectious writing style is marked by a meticulous eye for detail, hyperkinetic language, and an addiction to footnotes.1 Wallace's first major effort, Broom of the System, met with positive reviews, but it was 1996's Infinite Jest2 that would establish him as a literary wunderkind. The 1,079-page magnum opus was described by author Mark Childress as "hilarious, appalling, moving, subtle, wise and... nothing short of brilliant."

His latest work, a collection of essays titled,A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, continues his examination of millennial America, its anxieties, addictions, and fears.

In a rare interview from his home in Bloomington, Illinois, a caffeinated Wallace shares his thoughts on addiction, the American character, and the state of literature today.

OV: A lot of your work deals with addiction to television, drugs, sex . . . do we have a culture that enables addiction?

DFW: Boy, you're using the 12-step jargon. I don't claim to be a sociologist or a cultural critic, but my position is that we as a culture have a relationship with pleasure that's unprecedented, except maybe for royalty in medieval times or in ancient Rome or something.

We as a culture have an opportunity where we can kill ourselves with pleasure in a way that other cultures haven't (mainly because they're just trying to get enough to eat, etc.) And in a way, that's great, and in another way, it's testing parts of the human psyche that haven't been tested yet.

If you're put in a room with a substance that gives a great deal of pleasure but you know will make you narrow, selfish and crazy and shorten your life, well, do you do that substance or don't you? People have always had to deal with that question, but whole cultures . . . have never had to deal with that question before.

And so I'm less interested in drug addiction per se, than I am in [free] will and pleasure and whether really the point of life is to experience as much pleasure as possible- and whether, in fact, America is under that assumption.

OV: Your work also deals with America and American culture- is there something unique about the American character?

DFW: [laughs]

OV: We're going to hit you with the Big Questions now.

DFW: If somebody asked you that what would you say?

OV: Well, I don't write novels that deal with that theme-

DFW: We're not talking about your qualifications: I'm genuinely curious . . . wouldn't you just kind of go slack-jawed and your mind go blank when faced with that question?

OV: Okay then, let's try it from a different direction: You've written a few travel pieces for Harper's from the perspective of an outsider, almost as an anthropologist. Do you feel a connection to society, or are you permanently on the outside?

DFW: Are you kidding?

While we're having this interview, part of my brain is occupied with, "Be careful what you say, because you don't want to look like a pretentious asshole." That is the American character. There's this kind of odd combination of exhibitionism and weird self-conscious fear of other people's judgment.

OV: You've said in other interviews that living in America today is a sad thing. Could you articulate that for us?

DFW: Your questions are too good man, 'cause they're unanswerable. The remark, the way I remember it, was during all the fuss about Infinite Jest- people laughing about Infinite Jest and describing it as sad and true.

The genesis of that book was people about age 30 who have been incredibly lucky career-wise and education-wise and health-wise and all that stuff. All of us having similar friends and all of us seeming to be unhappy when none of us had ever been hungry for a day, or cold.

We have 500 channels of television. Americans enjoy a standard of living with a degree of excess that's really unprecedented in history. Just how strange is it that a generation like that is unhappy and impotent and anxious?

It's possible that we're just a bunch of ungrateful, self-absorbed whiners. That might be part of it but it's probably not the whole story . . . I don't know. I'm sorry if that sounds like a bunch of rubbish.

OV: In an era when critics are declaring the death of the novel, how do you account for your success when you write long, reader-intensive novels?

DFW: Which critics have declared the death of the novel? I know Roland Barthes declared the "Death of the Author..."

OV: Well, in today's television era, are we post-novel, post-literature?

DFW: Well, you see, if you ask meaty questions then the answers can go on for hours...

Well, I'll put it this way: The question itself, the death of the novel, shows how much the questioner has been co-opted by a very modern idea which is a lie. If somebody is saying in this age of electronic media that the novel is dead, what they're really showing is how much they themselves have been hypnotized. Literature is massively popular and making millions and millions of dollars. As far as I know, hard stuff, what you'd call literary fiction, has always had a small audience. I myself don't see that core audience shrinking. I know there's a lot of concern, you know, publishers and pundits of the publishing industry are owned by entertainment conglomerates but most of that stuff does not mean anything.

OV: So in this culture of mass media . . . what's the role of the novelist? Has the image of the writer become more important than the work itself?

DFW: Publishers tend to be more and more like conglomerates. You know, conglomerates are not charitable institutions; they're very interested in profit.

The economics are such that publishers make most of their money two months after the book comes out - which means they have to do their best to create some kind of hubbub about the book. Given the way PR works, the best free publicity is to get the magazines or a newspaper to do a profile. You know, like actors and directors go on the Johnny Carson Show. It's this enormous mechanism to get that big push of initial sales, I guess, from Barnes & Noble. I don't see where there's anything really wrong with it.

Where it gets tricky is that most of the writers I know are kind of weird and shy and don't really like a lot of that kind of attention. And yet we're aware that the publishers don't make much money on us and we're lucky that a mainstream publisher picks up our stuff and there's a weird . . . I don't really want to do this [interview] and yet do I really want to totally fuck over this company that blows a couple hundred thousand dollars if it's a bomb. What do I do?

Most of the writers I know kinda make their own compromises, kinda make their own psychic deals with that. Some writers- you can't even find out where they live, while others practically appear on game shows. There's a whole spectrum.

OV: So now that you've earned some fame, you've got everyone from college rags3 to Charlie Rose calling you up for an interview. You've become a literary icon of sorts. Has this changed your perspective on pop culture and-

DFW: Whoa- let's keep in mind here the kind of world we're talking about. A book that gets a lot of attention gets about as much attention as a popular local TV weatherman.

The problem is that when we talk about fame we all immediately think of the cover of TV Guide- where you're not going to be able to walk down the street without people asking you for your autograph.

Having a lot of fuss made over a couple of books4 and getting notoriety in a very small world is vastly different from being elevated to pop culture status and having magazines writing about your personal life. I don't see how those folks stay sane, how Brad Pitt could stand to walk out the door. It seems they all must be under heavy psychotropic medication.

OV: So do you get a taste of that though, reading about yourself?

DFW: There's like one profile in The New York Times which I didn't mind. The funny thing about them is that . . . you know how we all sneer at the politicians saying, "that remark was taken out of context"?

It's really funny, and I mean this'll be funny too because we're going to talk for half an hour and thousands of words will be exchanged. And if I happen to be in the [University of ] Oregon Student Union and pick this thing up- I will have a memory of this conversation and I will see that the stuff I said can be plucked out, placed in isolation and have an entire kinda connotation and emotional meaning change. So being the subject of this stuff really does nothing but just make me pity these poor people who keep saying they've been taken out of context.

It kinda helps you understand why political press secretaries and important guys are so fucking bland and spouting cliches when they're giving interviews, because anything other than that can just immediately be distorted in the compression process.5

I've interviewed people, I've done it myself and its not that you're going to fuck me over, but a print interview is real different from how people communicate.

OV: Sounds a lot like your recent story in The Paris Review, "Interviews with Hideous Men."6

DFW: My god, you read that?

OV: What you just said sounds pretty much like what you said in that story.

DFW: You're very prescient, now I have something else to worry about . . .

The thing about [fame] is, you gotta understand, The New York Times is all right, but their readers don't care. The number of people who care about writers of literature are mostly graduate students and academics, like one person out of a hundred.

OV: You've won a number of awards: a MacArthur Award, the Paris Review Award and the O. Henry Award. Do these awards have any value for you? Or in the world of literature?

DFW: Sure, when I was a kid and won the 50-yard breast stroke, that had value to me too. I think where writers get so fucked up is when they confuse an award with an Oscar or an Emmy.

You can see this in all kinds of worlds- you can see it in the world of (golly, I don't know) how about insurance salesmen, where you're a really good insurance salesman and you make the million dollar roundtable and you're a celebrity in the world of insurance. It's natural to follow to the conclusion that you're also a celebrity in the great big blue and green world, and in fact billions of people in the world that are all jockeying for position and pushing their chests out.

You get a prize one year, the next year you don't. You're crushed. Same thing as college, you know, when you get out it doesn't matter what your GPA is, although when you're in it, it's like life or death.

Does that make any sense? I'm not saying your question doesn't have merit, it's just that I think we're so saturated by this idea of fame, that we get the idea that fuss in one industry equals the sort of fuss that we all see on Oprah and Jerry Springer.

OV: Will people be reading Infinite Jest in 20 years?

DFW: I really . . . good question.

I'll put it this way: Every writer has got an ego. I've never met one who doesn't. The big mistake in writing is to get seduced by "Oh, did I get a big advance?" or "Did the book sell well" or "Oh, did Oprah pick it for her book club?"

They are thinking, "Is this a piece of art which is going to have any value in blank number of years?" and I think a writer's dream is to be able to a write a book like- be the MVP, like getting into the hall of fame and setting records. Something that matters and lasts.

I don't think anything that I've done will last. Not in the kind of way that writers dream about. On the other hand, late at night when I'm having ego attacks and fantasizing . . . I think, maybe. But I'm not a total wacko.

OV: I know you talk a lot about television7, but would you write for TV or Hollywood? Is television writing just brain candy or is it more?

DFW: I grew up watching a lot of TV. I actually don't have one anymore, although I do have a VCR and people tape episodes of Ally McBeal which I have an obsession with the show. (Which probably everyone thinks is cheesy.)

Anybody who writes books, I think, eventually gets asked either seriously or non-seriously if they'd like to write for electronic media. I don't want to, but I don't really have anything against electronic media, it's just completely different.

To me it's like, because you can write fiction you're asked to sing at the Metropolitan Opera. It's a completely different enterprise. And I don't have any ideas and I also have never gotten good grades on the part of my report card that always said, "Works Well with Others." I think that writing for the media - with editing your work interpretations, and change - I just don't think most of the fiction writers I know are willing to get into that.

OV: Maybe you can substantiate a report for us- Yahoo news, on the Internet, reported that a 157-page screenplay version of Infinite Jest, written by Curtis Armstrong and John Dolittle was being developed as an HBO original film.8

DFW: This is fascinating, because it's the first I've heard of it. HBO optioned Infinite Jest for X amount of money, which I gleefully took in the full expectation that nothing would come of it. I think the stats are 99 out of a 100 things are optioned and never seen.

So if a screenplay has been written, this is the first I've heard about it. I think the odds aren't good. I mean, who wants to watch a movie of like mostly 1100 pages of people talking? I'd be awfully surprised if it happened.

You really need to be leery [about the Internet]. I'm not online and I've never seen this Internet stuff but people will come to me with questions about stuff that's on the internet that's just - I mean I don't even know Mary Gaitskill and people are saying "You're co-writing a book with Mary Gaitskill?"

Anyone can put anything on the internet. It's pretty funny. Actually I think it'd be less funny if I actually had a modem and saw this stuff that's out there.

OV: So you've never gone out and seen the sites devoted to you on the Internet?9

DFW: No. I have various ways I get on the Internet but I see enough commercials.

OV: You say you're not a cultural critic? So why is it that you write?

DFW: I write . . . for me, I write for a couple of reasons. Number one, growing up, books and reading were important. I also write because it seems to me that all the really important stuff to talk about is stuff that can't be said- except indirectly. It's kind of a strange cover and one of those covers is art. I can't draw and I've got a really shitty voice for singing - so that's why I write.

OV: You've cited the short story, "The Balloon" by Donald Barthelme, as the first story that made you want to be a writer. What did that story do for you?

DFW: It's kind of hard to explain. The truth is, that story made my butthole pucker up. It had this big effect on me and I thought it was meaningful. It's this weird story about somebody trying to make a balloon. It's just kind of weird and yet totally seems true. That's the first time I can remember ever thinking, "Wow, I'd like to try to do something like that . . ."

We're lucky if we find a career that first made our testicles draw up and our breath shallow and our heart hammer- like maybe for a little kid watching the guy coming up to home plate. Maybe another little kid is watching a fire engine go by. You know what I mean?

OV: So what are you working on right now? What's the subject?

DFW: Well, if you ever take an ancient philosophy class, there was an ancient philosopher named Parmenides. Parmenides talked about things that are and things that are not. And he said things that are not, do not exist and . . . it's kind of hard to explain.10 I could give you a short answer.

OV: Okay. Short answer.

DFW: Parmenides was a pre-Socratic philosopher and well worth reading. Do like half a gram of mushrooms and then read some Parmenides.

1In recognition of Wallace's style, we decided to add a few footnotes of our own.
2Infintite Jest's complex storyline revolves around a film that is so entertaining, that once seen, becomes an all-consuming addiction. The characters involve Quebec seperatist terrorists, tennis academy students, and Alcoholic Anonymous members. At 1,079 pages, including 96 pages of footnotes, it is sometimes affectionately referred to as Infinite Book.
3i.e.the Oregon Voice
4Which include: Girl With Curious Hair (1989), The Broom of the System (1993), Infinite Jest (1996), Signifying Rappers (reissued, 1997), and A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again(1997).
5For Instance, due to space considerations, we cut his confession about his obsession with the Fox sitcom Ally McBeal in the printed issue, but did include pointers to the complete transcript of the interview on this page. 6This story is written in the form of a person answering questions from an unseen, unheard interviewer. The main character's cynicism and fatalistic attitude toward being misunderstood seems remarkably similar to Wallace's comments here.
7In A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, Wallace examines television, TV culture, and the critics of TV culture in the essay, "E Unibus Pluram."
8At press time, HBO had not responded to inquiries about the existance of a script of the possibility of its production.
9"The Howling Fantods" at www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8175/dfw.htm is a useful starting point for DFW info on the web.
10Parmenides' claim to philosophical fame, according to the Oxford Companion to Philosophy, is the concept that: "Reality itself is a thinking thing, and the object of its own thinking."

(Art by Michael Kupperman)


David Foster Wallace is one badass fiction writer. His tractor-trailer-size novel Infinite Jest is one of the most important books of the last 10 years. And his book of essays A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again took the art of the personal essay to a new level. His new book of stories, Brief Interviews With Hideous Men (Little Brown, late May), is another supersonic delight, a full-scale harassment of the short-story form. It is a dense, slippery type of fiction where complexities of a psychosexual nature run wild. In late April, at 9 a.m., I phoned this most significant writer:

L.A. Weekly: Your essays are exceptionally daring, like there's no place you mentally won't go --- your consciousness bubbles up these peculiar things, and then you set about . . .

David Foster Wallace: It would help if you put inflection in your voice. [Laughs.] What are you reading this from?

A notepad.

I don't quite understand what's so daring about it, but I will of course nod and smile.

You pursue elaborate arguments in micro detail, whether it's a cruise ship, on a David Lynch set, or at the porn awards. Please talk about frankness, honesty, the balls to venture into the embarrassing.

Wow. Questions like that are incredibly intimidating because there's no way the answer is going to be as well constructed and loquacious as the question, so it would actually be in your interest to make the questions clumsier and less literary.

But they are clumsy, and I don't even know what loquacious means.

My experience of doing nonfiction is that every once in a while I'll get an assignment that interests me, but it's extremely vague. They're like, "Just go and kind of notice everything you can, and then try and come up with an essay about it." The micro detail that readers enjoy from me often feels like a function of simple, pure anxiety --- I'm going to miss the crucial thing that will make this readable for somebody else.

The honesty thing --- I don't think this nonfiction is really as honest as people think it is. A certain amount of it is spent developing a kind of persona or narrative voice that will have qualities that the reader will like and find engaging, and one of them is this kind of blushing, kicking the ground, gosh-golly I really don't want to say this but I really will. I don't know that it's dishonest. It's kind of manipulative the same way constructing a narrator in first-person fiction is. The only really substantive differences in genres have to do with the expectations of the readers. Almost all the techniques are the same.

Cool. This leads to the next question pretty well. There's a stylistic difference in your fiction and nonfiction. In nonfiction, you seem very straight ahead, a rational machine devouring a subject. In your novels and stories it's a leap into the void, a trippy embrace of abstraction.

My experience with nonfiction is that's not really what I do. I consider myself mostly a fiction writer. Nonfiction isn't super scary to me, except in the oh-God-I'm-not-going-to-have-enough-material-to-make-an-essay [moments]. There may be a sort of machinelike quality to it only because I don't really have any ideology about how it ought to be done. I don't even feel like I have a style in fiction. I feel like I do all kinds of different stuff.

I come out of the nonprofit-press, pseudo-intellectual side of fiction. The stuff I do may look kind of avant-garde or experimental from the point of view of major-press publishing, the same way [Mark] Leyner's does or [William T.] Vollmann's does. In a weird way, we're kind of like indie bands that have been picked up by major studios. You know what I mean?

Yes sir. I am with you and I agree.

For anybody who thinks that what I do is weird, abstract and intellectual, they should go read some John Barth or some Stephen Dixon, oh Christ, some Curtis White at Fiction Collective, or Ron Sukenick, or some of the Oulipo Group, the French guys. It's funny, Illinois State University (where I teach) is the headquarters of Dalkey Archive Press and Fiction Collective, and I'm almost the house realist there. They almost think of me as a quaint New Yorkerish, sort of Cheeverish figure.

That's a nice misunderstanding.

It's very strange. I feel kind of biracial. Mainstream publishers think I'm Mr. Weirdo, and the true weirdoes know for a fact I'm very white bread.

The state of American fiction feels tricky. Readers seem less adventurous, less willing to pick up a book for its stylistic charms. They seem hungry for subject and content. Meta-fiction is having a hard time right now, unlike in the '70s when it thrived. Plus in the last year we saw Burroughs, Kathy Acker, John Hawkes, William Gaddis die. Sort of like the end of an era.

Wow, you kind of told a whole story there. All I can do, you know, is go `Zoinks!' I don't consider myself doing meta-fiction. It's another thing that I think keeps me from being an avant-gardist.

Are you serious?

I was born in '62. The postmodern heyday in America was kind of my childhood. My parents were reading that stuff. I began to write in the age of minimalism and the short-story renaissance, the early to mid-'80s. It sure didn't seem like a postmodern, meta-fictional heyday to me. I'm also somebody who does fairly strange, difficult stuff, and found that not only was a major publisher willing to publish it, they were willing to put their publicity machine to work on it as well. My personal experience is that people are a lot friendlier to the kind of stuff that I do than your question would seem to suggest.

Hey, you're a sleek, brilliant monster, and readers love you. I'm just saying it's tricky material. Cool fiction has to make it over a lot of hurdles. As a fan of demented fiction, I wish there was more.

Probably the astute answer and the one that's the safest: Fiction and poetry have always gone against the current, and right now the current is easy pleasure. And the pleasures available with greater intensity and less effort --- television, movies, record stuff --- are getting more and more sophisticated. Fiction and poetry that are difficult and challenging are apt to find a smaller and smaller audience as the culture gets less and less eager to do work. It's not commercial versus literary so much as how much work does this stuff require. I'm rather shocked that the kind of stuff we do has as large an audience as it does.

You're famous. You've bashed through. You've been embraced by a huge American audience. They're willing to be adventurous with you.

From where I'm sitting I have no idea whether that's true or not. How do you define fame? It seems to me, given how much we like to bitch and moan about how unadventurous readers are, there's an awful lot of borderline weird, difficult younger writers whofound support at major publishing houses. I don't know how to account for that, because I do agree that, culturally, times are hostile to difficult stuff. I've read essays where it's suggested that people like Leyner and me and Vollmann started out as real avant-gardists and then kind of sold out.

Yeah, I know a lot of writers who pat themselves on the back for publishing exclusively in tiny periodicals. They piss on anyone from the neighborhood who's branched out. It's so stupid and shortsighted.

There are things about it that are stupid, trust me, and there are things about it that are true. I was on the edges of the fictional brat pack in the '80s, and I watched a few writers become stars. They dated movie stars, were written about in gossip columns. They really became celebrities, and as far as I can see, it ruined them. Not just rhetorically but artistically.

Have you received any unusual fan mail?

I have what William Hurt in The Big Chill referred to as a "small, deeply disturbed following."

There's a fly in the room; it's moral fiction.

Excuse me?

Never mind.

Is this a reference to John Gardner?

Yes, that big, fat bullyish morality trip he pulled on American writers in his book On Moral Fiction. It's never seemed to go away.

Should it?

Yes, fly swatter please.

One reason why I'm not really popular with the avant-garde crowd anymore is that I think I buy more of Gardner's premise than a lot of other people do, particularly when there are venues of entertainment that are more powerful, and less work-intensive than fiction, which means that fiction needs to carve out its niche. There's got to be some stuff that art-fiction and poetry and essays offer that The Matrix doesn't offer.

I still buy something that I learned as a freshman in college, which is that one of the really neato-keano things about fiction is that it's an artificial enabler of empathy. If you're a character in a story, chances are I get to know you better. Vollmann has a neat phrase for it --- "It allows us to leap over the wall of self." That's aesthetically significant, and it also seems to be morally significant, assuming we agree on a vague, general meaning of the word moral. How to be a real human being instead of just a very sophisticated animal.

Benjamin Weissman is the author of the story collection Dear Dead Person (Serpent's Tail).

David Foster Wallace will read from his work at Skylight Books Monday, June 7, at 7 p.m.; and at the Skirball Cultural Center on Tuesday, June 8, at 7:30 p.m.

By Mitch Pugh
Copley News Service

David Foster Wallace doesn't do Budding Literary Icon as well as one might think, considering the praise heaped on the 37-year-old downstate Illinois writer.

He stammers and stumbles painfully through some sentences while others, which include words like loquacious and belletristic, sound as if they have been memorized from some collegiate text. Eventually, he reverts back to crude expletives as the doorbell of the posh San Francisco hotel suite (which "smells faintly of urine," he confides) Little, Brown Co. has booked him in rings annoyingly for the second time in 20 minutes.

But if anyone is capable of thrusting what we generally consider "literary fiction" kicking and screaming into the popular culture spotlight, it is the hugely imaginative and infinitely talented Wallace.

His two novels, "Infinite Jest" and "The Broom of the System," and the collections "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again" and "Girl with Curious Hair" have earned him such high praise as "the funniest writer of his generation" and "a writer of virtuosic talents who can seemingly do anything." He is the recipient of what is commonly referred to as a "Genius Grant" (the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship), the Lannan Award for Fiction, The Paris Review's Aga Kahn Prize and the O. Henry Award.

His sixth book, a collection of short fiction entitled "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men," hit bookstands in May and while his work has yet to make any kinds of serious dent on the New York Times best seller list, there's a growing subculture of followers who ferociously devour anything Wallace. In fact, fan Web site "The Howling Fantods," according to site creator Nick Maniatis, received 5,347 hits in the month of May alone.

But Wallace, while acknowledging his small but loyal fan base, is quick to disassociate with the attention generated by his newest novel as well as his seminal work, 1996's 1,079-page magnum opus "Infinite Jest."

"Writers who do kind of weird stuff ... I don't think there's lots of readers who enjoy that and the ones who do tend to be fanatical about it," says Wallace, an instructor at Illinois State University. "There are at least a dozen writers about my age who do the sort of stuff I do. I'm just lucky enough to get a major publishing house to pick up the stuff I do and plug it mercilessly."

Those fanatics (who Wallace describes as "almost all nerdy white males between 30 and 45") would tend to disagree.

"The way (he) comes out on the page reminds me of the way that I think," says Maniatis. "He is extremely humorous, encyclopaedic, truthful and can tell a great story."

Wallace, though, doesn't even own a modem and claims to have no knowledge of such shrines as "The Howling Fantods" which tracks the writer's every literary move with almost alarming precision.

"(The Internet) is clearly a force for like-minded people," he says. "Huge fans of the television show `The White Shadow' can get together and share anecdotes, whereas before they had that chance maybe two or three times a year at some `White Shadow' convention. I'm not dissing it. I just think it's probably a Net thing."

Yet, for whatever reason, Wallace has become a figure of sorts in the literary world, with fans and journalists attempting to pry into his personal life. He has even had to bar journalists from his home after writer Frank Bruni peeked into his medicine cabinet and reported the contents in a New York Times Magazine piece.

"'Infinite Jest' was like my third or fourth book, but I never had a book that got that kind of attention before," he says. "I invited the guy over to my house to meet my dogs and stuff. He asked to use the bathroom and I didn't think twice about it. It's just creepy.

"Writers really aren't entertainers in the way movie stars or rock stars are. Our personal lives aren't and shouldn't be as interesting as movie stars. It's no accident people who seriously deal with the press have these professionals who train them basically not to say anything that can be spun or taken advantage of."

The publication and media blitz by Little, Brown for `Jest' did, however, produce what has been called the first full-fledged literary event since James Joyce's "Ulysses." But Wallace, who is uncomfortable with the comparison, says the bar for "book as event" has been raised too high by television, movies and the Internet.

"('Infinite Jest') was pimple on a flea," says Wallace. "Every once in a while, a book will be an event. But it's really only colleges and graduate schools were books can get kind of hot and people can get energized. I'm tickled to death if a lot of grad students like the book but I think our standards of what an event is has been drastically altered by TV.

"The movie and record industry look at the book industry and think we are kind of quaint and cute. In literary fiction, things are going to create pools and ripples but there are smart, well-dressed young women from Seven Sisters Colleges who are plotting the next `event.'"

SIDEBAR:
In the company of Wallace: Blame it on Neil Labute


Of the nearly two dozen "stories" in David Foster Wallace's collection "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men," the four sections from which the title takes its name contain the most engaging, thought-provoking and generally horrifying pieces in the book.

Each interview is a clinical documentation of sorts of several dysfunctional and severely unpleasant men and each reads as if Wallace plucked them from some sociological resource book (i.e "B.I. 14 08-96 St. David PA"), hinting that there were even more of these heinous ramblings of patient to psychologist. And, in fact, there were.

But about five months before "Interviews" was to go to press, Wallace saw Labute's debut film S"n The Company of Men" and then proceeded to watch the follow-up, "Your Friends & Neighbors." It caused the author to pause, rethink and reshape the book, which was to be made up almost entirely of interviews.

"Some were repetitive and some just weren't very good. Others were too brutal," Wallace says. "Some of these are really brutal and really unpleasant, but there were others that were like having excrement smeared in your face. Seeing the movies of Neil Labute helped in some way. `Your Friends & Neighbors' was nastier than it needed to be. I ended up taking 10 or 11 of the interviews out and regarded it as a very helpful movie for me to see. You have to look at unpleasantness and decide when it's necessary and when it's not. I pulled back in the end and I'm glad I did."

The two most powerful interviews, Nos. 20 and 46, deal on some level with sexual violence toward women. In B.I. 46, the interviewee tries to explain his perceived connection between brutal rape or incest and Victor Frankl's "Man's Search For Meaning," one which is predicated on the concept that no experience is ever wholly good or bad.

"Alls I'm saying, it's not impossible there are cases where it can enlarge you. Make you more than you were before. More of a complete human being. Like Victor Frankl. Or that saying about how whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You think whoever it was that said that was for a woman getting raped? No way. He just wasn't being knee-jerk."

It's hard to imagine anything more Draconian, but it's all there. That may be one reason why the book has received mixed reviews. Influential critic Michiko Kakutani has dismissed the work as "boring" and "frequently repellent."

But Wallace, who acknowledges the darkness of the work and has stopped reading reviews, says his newest book clearly isn't for everyone.

"Michiko Kakutani stomped on it with golf shoes except I knew she was going to stomp on it with golf shoes," Wallace says. "I've been stomped on by her before. I'm reasonably happy with this book, but somebody who doesn't like unpleasantness in a book or wants characters to be pleasant should not buy this book. It's not for everybody. The reason she disliked it, because the characters are dislikable. I think that's a bit vapid."

And in "Interviews," even the person Wallace considers the main character, the unseen and unheard interviewer (designated when speaking by a mere Q. and who is revealed only by the "tiny, little remarks the men say to her") is not exactly flawless.

"She, to me, is the main character of the book, but also someone who is extremely sensitive to misogyny in all its forms and darkness, in all it's manifestations," Wallace says.

In the end, with throwaways like `Datum Centurio' and `Tri-Stan: I Sold Sisse Nar To Ecko', Interviews comes off as a bit uneven, but the title stories and the flair and genuine pathos Wallace brings to them are well worth the price of admission.

Besides, Labute has enough enemies as it is. }}

    Mischief
    A brief interview with David Foster Wallace
    by Chris Wright
    
    Don't expect to find any rakishly charming Don Juans in David Foster Wallace's new collection of fiction, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men. More neurotic than erotic, the book delves (with some glee, we might add) into the mire of modern romance through a series of fictional Q&As. With characteristic flair, Wallace subverts the form by omitting the questions, marking their absence with a Q. We caught up with Wallace in New York, a day after he read to a packed house at the Harvard Film Archive, and found him to be tired and full-bladdered, but not at all hideous. In the spirit of his book, however, we adopted the Brief Interview format for our 10-minute discussion.

    Q:

    A: What do you mean?

    Q:

    A: Not suffering fools gladly is a euphemism for being hostile and snapping at people, and I can't remember ever having done that.

    Q:

    A: Yes, no. The thing is, sometimes you're concerned with Q&As being boring, so it's tempting to make sport of people just to keep things interesting. That can be mean. I think I perhaps do that.

    Q:

    A: I think, um, the car crash is less important than turning to your friends and seeing the expressions on their faces. And them seeing the expression on your face. I'm more a reactor than a spectator. Does that make any sense?

    Q:

    A: No, I'm glad you're being honest. We left [Boston] at six o'clock this morning. I feel that people are asking perfectly reasonable questions and I'm just ranting. Feel free to cut out major nouns.

    Q:

    A: Between you and me, it'll be closer to 15, 'cause the next guy's not calling till 5:30. Actually 14, 'cause I need to piss.

    Q:

    A: I don't think it's really quite the same as being unable to walk down the street without girls trying to tear your shirt off.

    Q:

    A: No, the test is actually how many of them read it.

    Q:

    A: That's very nice of you, and I applaud your discernment and all that. The stuff that I cut my teeth on, the stuff that I really like to read, struck me as being challenging but also just fun as hell. I think a lot of avant-garde stuff in the US has lost touch with the fun -- you know, has flown up its own butt.

    Q:

    A: Say the quote again.

    Q:

    A: Ha!

    Q:

    A: At first when people said that about Infinite Jest it hurt my feelings. All writers want everybody to love them. But, you know, for me to do what I do and have some people like it -- that's going to have to be enough. When reviewers structure entire reviews around how fatigued they were when they tried to slog through the book -- yeah, that hurts my feelings, and I think they're being peckerheads.

    Q:

    A: Oh no, I'm not talking about you.

    Q:

    A: Attention is not the same thing as affection. I've finally figured that out. Anyway, my bladder begs. Is this gonna be enough? Okay. I apologize for any incoherence. Feel free to edit it however you like.

	Abstract = { An Interview With David Foster Wallace

by Larry McCaffery



LARRY McCAFFERY: Your essay following this interview is going to be seen by some people as being basically an apology for television. What's your response to the familiar criticism that television fosters relationships with illusions or simulations of real people (Reagan being a kind of quintessential example)?

DAVID FOSTER WALLACE: It's a try at a comprehensive diagnosis, not an apology. U.S. viewers' relationship with TV is essentially puerile and dependent, as are all relationships based on seduction. This is hardly news. But what's seldom acknowledged is how complex and ingenious TV's seductions are. It's seldom acknowledged that viewers' relationship with TV is, albeit debased, intricate and profound. It's easy for older writers just to bitch about TV's hegemony over the U.S. art market, to say the world's gone to hell in a basket and shrug and have done with it. But I think younger writers owe themselves a richer account of just why TV's become such a dominating force on people's consciousness, if only because we under forty have spent our whole conscious lives being "part" of TV's audience.

LM: Television may be more complex than what most people realize, but it seems rarely to attempt to "challenge" or "disturb" its audience, as you've written me you wish to. Is it that sense of challenge and pain that makes your work more "serious" than most television shows?

DFW: I had a teacher I liked who used to say good fiction's job was to comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. I guess a big part of serious fiction's purpose is to give the reader, who like all of us is sort of marooned in her own skull, to give her imaginative access to other selves. Since an ineluctable part of being a human self is suffering, part of what we humans come to art for is an experience of suffering, necessarily a vicarious experience, more like a sort of "generalization" of suffering. Does this make sense? We all suffer alone in the real world; true empathy's impossible. But if a piece of fiction can allow us imaginatively to identify with a character's pain, we might then also more easily conceive of others identifying with our own. This is nourishing, redemptive; we become less alone inside. It might just be that simple. But now realize that TV and popular film and most kinds of "low" art--which just means art whose primary aim is to make money--is lucrative precisely because it recognizes that audiences prefer 100 percent pleasure to the reality that tends to be 49 percent pleasure and 51 percent pain. Whereas "serious" art, which is not primarily about getting money out of you, is more apt to make you uncomfortable, or to force you to work hard to access its pleasures, the same way that in real life true pleasure is usually a by-product of hard work and discomfort. So it's hard for an art audience, especially a young one that's been raised to expect art to be 100 percent pleasurable and to make that pleasure effortless, to read and appreciate serious fiction. That's not good. The problem isn't that today's readership is "dumb," I don't think. Just that TV and the commercial-art culture's trained it to be sort of lazy and childish in its expectations. But it makes trying to engage today's readers both imaginatively and intellectually unprecedentedly hard.

LM: Who do you imagine your readership to be?

DFW: I suppose it's people more or less like me, in their twenties and thirties, maybe, with enough experience or good education to have realized that the hard work serious fiction requires of a reader sometimes has a payoff. People who've been raised with U.S. commercial culture and are engaged with it and informed by it and fascinated with it but still hungry for something commercial art can't provide. Yuppies, I guess, and younger intellectuals, whatever. These are the people pretty much all the younger writers I admire--Leyner and Vollman and Daitch, Amy Homes, Jon Franzen, Lorrie Moore, Rick Powers, even McInerney and Leavitt and those guys--are writing for, I think. But, again, the last twenty years have seen big changes in how writers engage their readers, what readers need to expect from any kind of art.

LM: The media seems to me to be one thing that has drastically changed this relationship. It's provided people with this television-processed culture for so long that audiences have forgotten what a relationship to serious art is all about.

DFW: Well, it's too simple to just wring your hands and claim TV's ruined readers. Because the U.S.'s television culture didn't come out of a vacuum. What TV is extremely good at--and realize that this is "all it does"--is discerning what large numbers of people think they want, and supplying it. And since there's always been a strong and distinctive American distaste for frustration and suffering, TV's going to avoid these like the plague in favor of something anesthetic and easy.

LM: You really think this distaste is distinctly American?

DFW: It seems distinctly Western-industrial, anyway. In most other cultures, if you hurt, if you have a symptom that's causing you to suffer, they view this as basically healthy and natural, a sign that your nervous system knows something's wrong. For these cultures, getting rid of the pain without addressing the deeper cause would be like shutting off a fire alarm while the fire's still going. But if you just look at the number of ways that we try like hell to alleviate mere symptoms in this country- from fast-fast-fast-relief antacids to the popularity of lighthearted musicals during the Depression--you can see an almost compulsive tendency to regard pain itself as the problem. And so pleasure becomes a value, a teleological end in itself. It's probably more Western than U.S. per se. Look at utilitarianism--that most English of contributions to ethics- and you see a whole teleology predicated on the idea that the best human life is one that maximizes the pleasure-to-pain ratio. God, I know this sounds priggish of me. All I'm saying is that it's shortsighted to blame TV. It's simply another symptom. TV didn't invent our aesthetic childishness here any more than the Manhattan Project invented aggression. Nuclear weapons and TV have simply intensified the consequences of our tendencies, upped the stakes.

LM: Near the end of "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way," there's a line about Mark that "It would take an architect who could hate enough to feel enough to love enough to perpetuate the kind of special cruelty only real lovers can inflict." Is that the kind of cruelty you feel is missing in the work of somebody like Mark Leyner?

DFW: I guess I'd need to ask you what kind of cruelty you thought the narrator meant there.

LM: It seems to involve the idea that if writers care enough about their audience--if they love them enough and love their art enough--they've got to be cruel in their writing practices. "Cruel" the way an army drill sergeant is when he decides to put a bunch of raw recruits through hell, knowing that the trauma you're inflicting on these guys, emotionally, physically, psychically, is just part of a process that's going to strengthen them in the end, prepare them for things they can't even imagine yet.

DFW: Well, besides the question of where the fuck do "artists" get off deciding for readers what stuff the readers need to be prepared for, your idea sounds pretty Aristotelian, doesn't it? I mean, what's the purpose of creating fiction, for you? Is it essentially mimetic, to capture and order a protean reality? Or is it really supposed to be therapeutic in an Aristotelian sense?

LM: I agree with what you said in "Westward" about serious art having to engage a range of experiences; it can be merely "metafictional," for example it has to deal with the world outside the page and variously so. How would you contrast your efforts in this regard versus those involved in most television or most popular fiction?

DFW:This might be one way to start talking about differences between the early postmodern writers of the fifties and sixties and their contemporary descendants. When you read that quotation from "Westward" just now, it sounded to me like a covert digest of my biggest weaknesses as a writer. One is that I have a grossly sentimental affection for gags, for stuff that's nothing but funny, and which I sometimes stick in for no other reason than funniness. Another's that I have a problem sometimes with concision, communicating only what needs to be said in a brisk efficient way that doesn't call attention to itself. It'd be pathetic for me to blame the exterior for my own deficiencies, but it still seems to me that both of these problems are traceable to this schizogenic experience I had growing up, being bookish and reading a lot, on the one hand, watching grotesque amounts of TV, on the other. Because I liked to read, I probably didn't watch quite as much TV as my friends, but I still got my daily megadose, believe me. And I think it's impossible to spend that many slack-jawed, spittle-chinned, formative hours in front of commercial art without internalizing the idea that one of the main goals of art is simply to "entertain," give people sheer pleasure. Except to what end, this pleasure-giving? Because, of course, TV's "real" agenda is to be "liked," because if you like what you're seeing, you'll stay tuned. TV is completely unabashed about this; it's its sole raison. And sometimes when I look at my own stuff I feel like I absorbed too much of this raison. I'll catch myself thinking up gags or trying formal stunt-pilotry and see that none of this stuff is really in the service of the story itself; it's serving the rather darker purpose of communicating to the reader "Hey! Look at me! Have a look at what a good writer I am! Like me!"

Now, to an extent there's no way to escape this altogether, because an author needs to demonstrate some sort of skill or merit so that the reader will trust her. There's some weird, delicate, I-trust-you-not-to fuck-up-on-me relationship between the reader and writer, and both have to sustain it. But there's an unignorable line between demonstrating skill and charm to gain trust for the story vs. simple showing off. It can become an exercise in trying to get the reader to like and admire you instead of an exercise in creative art. I think TV promulgates the idea that good art is just art which makes people like and depend on the vehicle that brings them the art. This seems like a poisonous lesson for a would-be artist to grow up with. And one consequence is that if the artist is excessively dependent on simply being "liked," so that her true end isn't in the work but in a certain audience's good opinion, she is going to develop a terrific hostility to that audience, simply because she has given all her power away to them. It's the familiar love-hate syndrome of seduction: "I don't really care what it is I say, I care only that you like it. But since your good opinion is the sole arbitrator of my success and worth, you have tremendous power over me, and I fear you and hate you for it." This dynamic isn't exclusive to art. But I often think I can see it in myself and in other young writers, this desperate desire to please coupled with a kind of hostility to the reader.

LM: In your own case, how does this hostility manifest itself?

DFW: Oh, not always, but sometimes in the form of sentences that are syntactically not incorrect but still a real bitch to read. Or bludgeoning the reader with data. Or devoting a lot of energy to creating expectations and then taking pleasure in disappointing them. You can see this clearly in something like Ellis's "American Psycho": it panders shamelessly to the audience's sadism for a while, but by the end it's clear that the sadism's real object is the reader herself.

LM: But at least in the case of "American Psycho" I felt there was something more than just this desire to inflict pain--or that Ellis was being cruel the way you said serious artists need to be willing to be.

DFW: You're just displaying the sort of cynicism that lets readers be manipulated by bad writing. I think it's a kind of black cynicism about today's world that Ellis and certain others depend on for their readership. Look, if the contemporary condition is hopelessly shitty, insipid, materialistic, emotionally retarded, sadomasochistic, and stupid, then I (or any writer) can get away with slapping together stories with characters who are stupid, vapid, emotionally retarded, which is easy, because these sorts of characters require no development. With descriptions that are simply lists of brand-name consumer products. Where stupid people say insipid stuff to each other. If what's always distinguished bad writing--flat characters, a narrative world that's cliched and not recognizably human, etc.--is also a description of today's world, then bad writing becomes an ingenious mimesis of a bad world. If readers simply believe the world is stupid and shallow and mean, then Ellis can write a mean shallow stupid novel that becomes a mordant deadpan commentary on the badness of everything. Look man, we'd probably most of us agree that these are dark times, and stupid ones, but do we need fiction that does nothing but dramatize how dark and stupid everything is? In dark times, the definition of good art would seem to be art that locates and applies CPR to those elements of what's human and magical that still live and glow despite the times' darkness. Really good fiction could have as dark a worldview as it wished, but it'd find a way both to depict this world and to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it. You can defend "Psycho" as being a sort of performative digest of late-eighties social problems, but it's no more than that.

LM: Are you saying that writers of your generation have an obligation not only to depict our condition but also to provide the solutions to these things?

DFW: I don't think I'm talking about conventionally political or social action-type solutions. That's not what fiction's about. Fiction's about what it is to be a fucking human being. If you operate, which most of us do, from the premise that there are things about the contemporary U.S. that make it distinctively hard to be a real human being, then maybe half of fiction's job is to dramatize what it is that makes it tough. The other half is to dramatize the fact that we still "are" human beings, now. Or can be. This isn't that it's fiction's duty to edify or teach, or to make us good little Christians or Republicans; I'm not trying to line up behind Tolstoy or Gardner. I just think that fiction that isn't exploring what it means to be human today isn't art. We've all got this "literary" fiction that simply monotones that we're all becoming less and less human, that presents characters without souls or love, characters who really are exhaustively describable in terms of what brands of stuff they wear, and we all buy the books and go like "Golly, what a mordantly effective commentary on contemporary materialism!" But we already "know" U.S. culture is materialistic. This diagnosis can be done in about two lines. It doesn't engage anybody. What's engaging and artistically real is, taking it as axiomatic that the present is grotesquely materialistic, how is it that we as human beings still have the capacity for joy, charity, genuine connections, for stuff that doesn't have a price? And can these capacities be made to thrive? And if so, how, and if not why not?

LM: Not everyone in your generation is taking the Ellis route. Both the other writers in this issue of "RCF" seem to be doing exactly what you're talking about. So, for example, even though Vollmann's "Rainbow Stories" is a book that is in its own way as sensationalized as "American Psycho," the effort there is to depict those people not as flattened, dehumanized stereotypes but as human beings. I'd agree though, that a lot of contemporary writers today adopt this sort of flat, neutral transformation of people and events into fiction without bothering to make the effort of refocusing their imaginations on the people who still exist underneath these transformations. But Vollmann seems to be someone fighting that tendency in interesting ways.

That brings us back to the issue of whether this isn't a dilemma serious writers have always faced. Other than lowered (or changed) audience expectations, what's changed to make the task of the serious writer today more difficult than it was thirty or sixty or a hundred or a thousand years ago? You might argue that the task of the serious writer is easier today because what took place in the sixties had the effect of finally demolishing the authority that mimesis had assumed. Since you guys don't have to fight that battle anymore, you're liberated to move on to other areas.

DFW: This is a double-edged sword, our bequest from the early postmodernists and the post-structuralist critics. One the one hand, there's sort of an embarrassment of riches for young writers now. Most of the old cinctures and constraints that used to exist--censorship of content is a blatant example--have been driven off the field. Writers today can do more or less whatever we want. But on the other hand, since everybody can do pretty much whatever they want, without boundaries to define them or constraints to struggle against, you get this continual avant-garde rush forward without anyone bothering to speculate on the destination, the "goal" of the forward rush. The modernists and early postmodernists--all the way from Mallarm{\'e} to Coover, I guess--broke most of the rules for us, but we tend to forget what they were forced to remember: the rule-breaking has got to be for the "sake" of something. When rule-breaking, the mere "form" of renegade avant-gardism, becomes an end in itself, you end up with bad language poetry and "American Psycho" 's nipple-shocks and Alice Cooper eating shit on stage. Shock stops being a by-product of progress and becomes an end in itself. And it's bullshit. Here's an analogy. The invention of calculus was shocking because for a long time it had simply been presumed that you couldn't divide by zero. The integrity of math itself seemed to depend on the presumption. Then some genius titans came along and said, "Yeah, maybe you can't divide by zero, but what would happen if you "could"? We're going to come as close to doing it as we can, to see what happens."

LM: So you get the infinitesimal calculus--"the philosophy of as if."

DFW: And this purely theoretical construct wound up yielding incredibly practical results. Suddenly you could plot the area under curves and do rate-change calculations. Just about every material convenience we now enjoy is a consequence of this "as if." But what if Leibniz and Newton had wanted to divide by zero only to show jaded audiences how cool and rebellious they were? It'd never have happened, because that kind of motivation doesn't yield results. It's hollow. Dividing-as-if-by-zero was titanic and ingenuous because it was in the service of something. The math world's shock was a price they had to pay, not a payoff in itself.

LM: Of course, you also have examples like Lobochevsky and Riemann, who are breaking the rules with no practical application at the time--but then later on somebody like Einstein comes along and decides that this worthless mathematical mind game that Riemann developed actually described the universe more effectively than the Euclidean game. Not that those guys were braking the rules just to break the rules, but part of that was just that: what happens if everybody has to move counter-clockwise in Monopoly. And at first it just seemed like this game, without applications.

DFW: Well, the analogy breaks down because math and hard science are pyramidical. They're like building a cathedral: each generation works off the last one, both in its advance and its errors. Ideally, each piece of art's its own unique object, and its evaluation's always present-tense. You could justify the worst piece of experimental horseshit by saying "The fools may hate my stuff , but generations later I will be appreciated for my ground breaking rebellion." All the beret-wearing "artistes" I went to school with who believed that line are now writing ad copy someplace.

LM: The European avant-garde believed in the transforming ability of innovative art to directly affect people's consciousness and break them out of their cocoon of habituation, etc. You'd put a urinal in a Paris museum, call it a "fountain," and wait for the riots next day. That's an area I'd say has changed things for writers (or any artist)--you can have very aesthetically radical works today using the same features of formal innovation that you'd find in the Russian Futurists or Duchamp and so forth, only now these things are on MTV or TV ads. Formal innovations as trendy image. So it loses its ability to shock or transform.

DFW: These are exploitations. They're not trying to break us free of anything. They're trying to lock us tighter into certain conventions, in this case habits of consumption. So the "form" of artistic rebellion now becomes . . .

LM: . . . yeah, another commodity. I agree with Fredric Jameson and others who argue that modernism and postmodernism can be seen as expressing the cultural logic of late capitalism. Lots of features of contemporary art are directly influenced by this massive acceleration of capitalist expansion into all these new realms that were previously just not accessible. You sell people a memory, reify their nostalgia and use this as a hook to sell deodorant. Hasn't this recent huge expansion of the technologies of reproduction, the integration of commodity reproduction and aesthetic reproduction, and the rise of media culture lessened the impact that aesthetic innovation can have on people's sensibilities? What's your response to this as an artist?

DFW: You've got a gift for lit-speak, LM. Who wouldn't love this jargon we dress common sense in: "formal innovation is no longer transformative, having been co-opted by the forces of stabilization and post-industrial inertia," blah, blah. But this co-optation might actually be a good thing if it helped keep younger writers from being able to treat mere formal ingenuity as an end in itself. MTV-type co-optation could end up a great prophylactic against cleveritis--you know, the dreaded grad-school syndrome of like "Watch me use seventeen different points of view in this scene of a guy eating a Saltine." The real point of that shit is "Like me because I'm clever"--which of course is itself derived from commercial art's axiom about audience-affection determining art's value.

What's precious about somebody like Bill Vollmann is that, even though there's a great deal of formal innovation in his fictions, it rarely seems to exist for just its own sake. It's almost always deployed to make some point (Vollmann's the most editorial young novelist going right now, and he's great at using formal ingenuity to make the editorializing a component of his narrative instead of an interruption) or to create an effect that's internal to the text. His narrator's always weirdly effaced, the writing unself-conscious, despite all the "By-the-way-Dear-reader" intrusions. In a way it's sad that Vollmann's integrity is so remarkable. Its remarkability means it's rare. I guess I don't know what to think about these explosions in the sixties you're so crazy about. It's almost like postmodernism is fiction's fall from biblical grace. Fiction became conscious of itself in a way it never had been. Here's a really pretentious bit of pop analysis for you: I think you can see Cameron's "Terminator" movies as a metaphor for all literary art after Roland Barthes, viz., the movies' premise that the Cyberdyne NORAD computer becomes conscious of itself as "conscious," as having interests and an agenda; the Cyberdyne becomes literally self-referential, and it's no accident that the result of this is nuclear war, Armageddon.

LM: Isn't Armageddon the course you set sail for in "Westward"?

DFW: Metafiction's real end has always been Armageddon. Art's reflection on itself is terminal, is one big reason why the art world saw Duchamp as an Antichrist. But I still believe the move to involution had value: it helped writers break free of some long-standing flat-earth-type taboos. It was standing in line to happen. And for a while, stuff like "Pale Fire" and "The Universal Baseball Association" was valuable as a meta-aesthetic breakthrough the same way Duchamp's urinal had been valuable.

LM: I've always felt that the best of the metafictionalists--Coover, for example, Nabokov, Borges, even Barth--were criticized too much for being only interested in narcissistic, self-reflexive games, whereas these devices had very real political and historical applications.

DFW: But when you talk about Nabokov and Coover, you're talking about real geniuses, the writers who weathered real shock and invented this stuff in contemporary fiction. But after the pioneers always come the crank turners, the little gray people who take the machines others have built and just turn the crank, and little pellets of metafiction come out the other end. The crank-turners capitalize for a while on sheer fashion, and they get their plaudits and grants and buy their IRAs and retire to the Hamptons well out of range of the eventual blast radius. There are some interesting parallels between postmodern crank-turners and what's happened since post-structural theory took off here in the U.S., why there's such a big backlash against post-structuralism going on now. It's the crank-turners fault. I think the crank-turners replaced the critic as the real angel of death as far as literary movements are concerned, now. You get some bona fide artists who come along and really divide by zero and weather some serious shit-storms of shock and ridicule in order to promulgate some really important ideas. Once they triumph, though, and their ideas become legitimate and accepted, the crank-turners and wannabes come running to the machine, and out pour the gray pellets and now the whole thing's become a hollow form, just another institution of fashion. Take a look at some of the critical-theory Ph.D. dissertations being written now. They're like de Man and Foucault in the mouth of a dull child. Academia and commercial culture have somehow become these gigantic mechanisms of commodification that drain the weight and color out of even the most radical new advances. It's a surreal inversion of the death-by-neglect that used to kill off prescient art. Now prescient art suffers death-by acceptance. We love things to death, now. Then we retire to the Hamptons.

LM: This is also tied to that expansion of capitalism blah blah blah into realms previously thought to be uncommodifiable. Hyperconsumption. I mean, whoever thought rebellion could be tamed so easily? You just record it, turn the crank, and out comes another pellet of "dangerous" art.

DFW: And this accelerates the metastasis from genuine envelope puncturing to just another fifteen-minute form that gets cranked out and cranked out and cranked out. Which creates a bitch of a problem for any artist who views her task as continual envelope-puncturing, because then she falls into this insatiable hunger for the appearance of novelty: "What can I do that hasn't been done yet?" Once the first-person pronoun creeps into your agenda you're dead, art-wise. That's why fiction-writing's lonely in a way most people misunderstand. It's yourself you have to be estranged from, really, to work.

LM: A phrase in one of your recent letters really struck me: "The magic of fiction is that it addresses and antagonizes the loneliness that dominates people." It's that suggestion of antagonizing the reader that seems to link your goals up with the avant-garde program--whose goals were never completely hermetic. And "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" seems to be your own meta-fictional attempt to deal with these large areas in ways that are not merely metafiction.

DFW: "Aggravate" might be better than "antagonize," in the sense of aggravation as intensification. But the truth is it's hard for me to know what I really think about any of the stuff I've written. It's always tempting to sit back and make finger-steeples and invent impressive sounding theoretical justifications for what one does, but in my case most of it'd be horseshit. As time passes I get less and less nuts about anything I've published, and it gets harder to know for sure when its antagonistic elements are in there because they serve a useful purpose and when their just covert manifestations of this "look-at-me-please-love-me-I-hate you" syndrome I still sometimes catch myself falling into. Anyway, but what I think I meant by "antagonize" or "aggravate" has to do with the stuff in the TV essay about the younger writer trying to struggle against the cultural hegemony of TV. One thing TV does is help us deny that we're lonely. With televised images, we can have the facsimile of a relationship without the work of a real relationship. It's an anesthesia of "form." The interesting thing is why we're so desperate for this anesthetic against loneliness. You don't have to think very hard to realize that our dread of both relationships and loneliness, both of which are like sub-dreads of our dread of being trapped inside a self (a psychic self, not just a physical self), has to do with angst about death, the recognition that I'm going to die, and die very much alone, and the rest of the world is going to go merrily on without me. I'm not sure I could give you a steeple-fingered theoretical justification, but I strongly suspect a big part of real art fiction's job is to aggravate this sense of entrapment and loneliness and death in people, to move people to countenance it, since any possible human redemption requires us first to face what's dreadful, what we want to deny.

LM: It's this inside-outside motif you developed throughout "The Broom of the System."

DFW: I guess maybe, but it's developed in an awful clunky way. The popularity of "Broom" mystifies me. I can't say it's not nice to have people like it, but there's a lot of stuff in that novel I'd like to reel back in and do better. I was like twenty-two when I wrote the first draft of that thing. And I mean a "young" twenty-two. I still thought in terms of distinct problems and univocal solutions. But if you're going to try not just to depict the way a culture's bound and defined by meditated gratification and image, but somehow to redeem it, or at least fight a rearguard against it, then what you're going to be doing is paradoxical. You're at once allowing the reader to sort of escape self by achieving some sort of identification with another human psyche--the writer's, or some character's, etc.--and you're "also" trying to antagonize the reader's intuition that she is a self, that she is alone and going to die alone. You're trying somehow both to deny and affirm that the writer is over here with his agenda while the reader's over there with her agenda, distinct. This paradox is what makes good fiction sort of magical, I think. The paradox can't be resolved, but it can somehow be mediated--"re-mediated," since this is probably where post-structuralism rears its head for me--by the fact that language and linguistic intercourse is, in and of itself, redeeming, remedy-ing.

This makes serious fiction a rough and bumpy affair for everyone involved. Commercial entertainment, on the other hand, smooths everything over. Even the "Terminator" movies (which I revere), or something really nasty and sicko like the film version of "A Clockwork Orange," is basically an anesthetic (and think for a second about the etymology of "anesthetic"; break up the word and think about it). Sure "A Clockwork Orange" is a self-consciously sick, nasty film about the sickness and nastiness of the post-industrial condition, but if you look at it structurally, slo-mo and fast-mo and arty cinematography aside, it does what all commercial entertainment does: it proceeds more or less chronologically, and if its transitions are less cause-and-effect-based than most movies', it still kind of eases you from scene to scene in a way that drops you into certain kinds of easy cerebral rhythms. It admits passive spectation. Encourages it. TV-type art's biggest hook is that it's figured out ways to "reward" passive spectation. A certain amount of the form-conscious stuff I write is trying--with whatever success--to do the opposite. It's supposed to be uneasy. For instance, using a lot of flash-cuts between scenes so that some of the narrative arrangement has got to be done by the reader, or interrupting flow with digressions and interpolations that the reader has to do the work of connecting to each other and to the narrative. It's nothing terribly sophisticated, and there has to be an accessible payoff for the reader if I don't want the reader to throw the book at the wall. But if it works right, the reader has to fight "through" the meditated voice presenting the material to you. The complete suppression of a narrative consciousness, with its own agenda, is why TV is such a powerful selling tool. This is McLuhan, right? "The medium is the message" and all that? But notice that TV's meditated message is "never" that the medium's the message.

LM: How is this insistence on meditation different from the kind of meta strategies you yourself have attacked as preventing authors from being anything other than narcissistic or overly abstract or intellectual?

DFW: I guess I'd judge what I do by the same criterion I apply to the self conscious elements you find in Vollmann's fiction: do they serve a purpose beyond themselves? Whether I can provide a payoff and communicate a function rather than just seem jumbled and prolix is the issue that'll decide whether the thing I'm working on now succeeds or not. But I think right now it's important for art-fiction to antagonize the reader's sense that what she's experiencing as she reads is meditated through a human consciousness, now with an agenda not necessarily coincident with her own. For some reason I probably couldn't even explain, I've been convinced of this for years, that one distinctive thing about truly "low" or commercial art is this apparent suppression of a mediating consciousness and agenda. The example I think of first is the novella "Little Expressionless Animals" in "Girl With Curious Hair." Readers I know sometimes remark on all the flash-cuts and the distortion of linearity in it and usually want to see it as mimicking TV's own pace and phosphenic flutter. But what it's really trying to do is just the "opposite" of TV--it's trying to prohibit the reader from forgetting that she's receiving heavily mediated data, that this process is a relationship between the writer's consciousness and her own, and that in order for it to be anything like a full human relationship, she's going to have to put in her share of the linguistic work.

This might be my best response to your claim that my stuff's not "realistic." I'm not much interested in trying for classical, big-R Realism, not because the big R's form has now been absorbed and suborned by commercial entertainment. The classical Realist form is soothing, familiar and anesthetic; it drops right into spectation. It doesn't set up the sort of expectations serious 1990s fiction ought to be setting up in readers.

LM: "The Broom of the System" already displays some of the formal tendencies found in the stories in "Girl With Curious Hair" and in your new work--that play with temporal structure and flash-cuts, for instance, for heightened rhetorical effects of various sorts, for defamiliarizing things. Would you say your approach to form/content issues has undergone any radical changes since you were a "young twenty-two"?

DFW: Assuming I understand what you mean by "form/content," the only way I can answer you is to talk about my own background. Oh boy, I get to make myself sound all fascinating and artistic and you'll have no way to check up. Return with us now to Deare Olde Amherst. For most of my college career I was a hard-core syntax wienie, a philosophy major with a specialization in math and logic. I was, to put it modestly, quite good at the stuff, mostly because I spent all my free time doing it. Wienieish or not, I was actually chasing a special sort of buzz, a special moment that comes sometimes. One teacher called these moments "mathematical experiences." What I didn't know then was that a mathematical experience was aesthetic in nature, an epiphany in Joyce's original sense. These moments appeared in proof-completions, or maybe algorithms. Or like a gorgeously simple solution to a problem you suddenly see after half a notebook with gnarly attempted solutions. It was really an experience of what I think Yeats called "the click of a well-made box." Something like that. The word I always think of it as is "click."

Anyway, I was just awfully good at technical philosophy, and it was the first thing I'd ever really been good at, and so everybody, including me, anticipated I'd make it a career. But it sort of emptied out for me somewhere around age twenty. I just got tired of it, and panicked because I was suddenly not getting any joy from the one thing I was clearly supposed to do because I was good at it and people liked me for being good at it. Not a fun time. I think I had kind of a mid-life crisis at twenty, which probably doesn't augur real well for my longevity.

So what I did, I went back home for a term, planning to play solitaire and stare out the window, whatever you do in a crisis. And all of a sudden I found myself writing fiction. My only real experience with fun writing had been on a campus magazine with Mark Costello, the guy I later wrote "Signifying Rappers" with. But I had had experience with chasing the click, from all the time spent with proofs. At some point in my reading and writing that fall I discovered the click in literature, too. It was real lucky that just when I stopped being able to get the click from math logic I started to be able to get it from fiction. The first fictional clicks I encountered were in Donald Barthelme's "The Balloon" and in parts of the first story I ever wrote, which has been in my trunk since I finished it. I don't know whether I have that much natural talent going for me fiction wise, but I know I can hear the click, when there is a click. In Don DeLillo's stuff, for example, almost line by line I can hear the click. It's maybe the only way to describe writers I love. I hear the click in most Nabokov. In Donne, Hopkins, Larkin. In Puig and Cort{\'a}zar. Puig clicks like a fucking Geiger counter. And none of these people write prose as pretty as Updike, and yet I don't hear the click in Updike.

But so here I am at like twenty-one and I don't know what to do. Do I go into math logic, which I'm good at and pretty much guaranteed an approved career in? Or do I try to keep on with this writing thing, this "artiste" thing? The idea of being a "writer" repelled me, mostly because of all the foppish aesthetes I knew at school who went around in berets stroking their chins calling themselves writers. I have a terror of seeming like those guys, still. Even today, when people I don't know ask me what I do for a living, I usually tell them I'm "in English" or I "work free-lance." I don't seem to be able to call myself a writer. And terms like "postmodernist" or "surrealist" send me straight to the bathroom, I've got to tell you.

LM: I spend time in the toilet stalls myself. But I noticed you I didn't take off down the hall when I said earlier that your work didn't seem "realistic." Do you agree with that?

DFW: Well, it depends whether you're talking little-r realistic or big-R. If you mean is my stuff in the Howells/Wharton/Updike school of U.S. Realism, clearly not. But to me the whole binary of realistic vs. unrealistic fiction is a canonical distinction set up by people with a vested interest in the big-R tradition. A way to marginalize stuff that isn't soothing and conservative. Even the goofiest avant-garde agenda, if it's got integrity, is never, "Let's eschew all realism," but more, "Let's try to countenance and render real aspects of real experiences that have previously been excluded from art." The result often seems "unrealistic" to the big-R devotees because it's not a recognizable part of the "ordinary experience" they're used to countenancing. I guess my point is that "realistic" doesn't have a univocal definition. By the way, what did you mean a minute ago when you were talking about a writer "defamiliarizing" something?

LM: Placing something familiar in an unfamiliar context--say, setting it in the past or within some other structure that will re-expose it, allow readers to see the real essence of the thing that's usually taken for granted because it's buried underneath all the usual sludge that accompanies it.

DFW: I guess that's supposed to be deconstruction's original program, right? People have been under some sort of metaphysical anesthesia, so you dismantle the metaphysics' axioms and prejudices, show it in cross section and reveal the advantages of its abandonment. It's literally aggravating: you awaken them to the fact that they've been unconsciously imbibing some narcotic pharmakon since they were old enough to say Momma. There's many different ways to think about what I'm doing, but if I follow what you mean by "defamiliarization," I guess it's part of what getting the click right is for me. It might also be a part of why I end up doing anywhere from five to eight total rewrites to finish something, which is why I'm never going to be a Vollmann or an Oates.

LM: You've mentioned the recent change about what writers can assume about their readers in terms of expectations and so on. Are there other ways the postmodern world has influenced or changed the role of serious writing today?

DFW: If you mean a post-industrial, mediated world, it's inverted one of fiction's big historical functions, that of providing data on distant cultures and persons. The first real generalization of human experience that novels tried to accomplish. If you lived in Bumfuck, Iowa, a hundred years ago and had no idea what life was like in India, good old Kipling goes over and presents it to you. And of course the post-structural critics now have a field day on all the colonialist and phallocratic prejudices inherent in the idea that writers were "presenting" alien creatures instead of "re presenting" them--jabbering natives and randy concubines and white man's burden, etc. Well, but fiction's presenting function for today's reader has been reversed: since the whole global village is now presented as familiar, electronically immediate--satellites, microwaves, intrepid PBS anthropologists, Paul Simon's Zulu back-ups--it's almost like we need fiction writers to restore strange things' ineluctable "strangeness," to defamiliarize stuff, I guess you'd say.

LM: David Lynch's take on suburbia. Or Mark Leyner's take on his own daily life--

DFW: And Leyner's real good at it. For our generation, the entire world seems to present itself as "familiar," but since that's of course an illusion in terms of anything really important about people, maybe any "realistic" fiction's job is opposite what it used to be--no longer making the strange familiar but making the familiar strange again. It seems important to find ways of reminding ourselves that most "familiarity" is meditated and delusive.

LM: "Postmodernism" usually implies "an integration of pop and 'serious' culture." But a lot of the pop culture in the works of the younger writers I most admire these days--you, Leyner, Gibson, Vollmann, Eurudice, Daitch, et al.--seems to be introduced less to integrate high and low culture, or to valorize pop culture, than to place this stuff in a new context so we can be "liberated" from it. Wasn't that, for example, one of the things you were doing with "Jeopardy" in "Little Expressionless Animals"?

DFW: One new context is to take something almost narcotizingly banal- it's hard to think of anything more banal than a U.S. game show; in fact the banality's one of TV's great hooks, as the TV essay discusses--and try to reconfigure it in a way that reveals what a tense, strange, convoluted set of human interactions the final banal product is. The scrambled, flash-cut form I ended up using for the novella was probably unsubtle and clumsy, but the form clicked for me in a way it just hadn't when I'd done it straight.

LM: A lot of your works (including "Broom") have to do with this breakdown of the boundaries between the real and "games," or the characters playing the game begin to confuse the game structure with reality's structure. Again, I suppose you can see this in "Little Expressionless Animals," where the real world outside "Jeopardy" is interacting with what's going on inside the game show--the boundaries between inner and outer are blurred.

DFW: And, too, in the novella what's going on on the show has repercussions for everybody's lives outside it. The valence is always distributive. It's interesting that most serious art, even avant-garde stuff that's in collusion with literary theory, still refuses to acknowledge this, while serious science butters its bread with the fact that the separation of subject/observer and object/experiment is impossible. Observing a quantum phenomenon's been proven to alter the phenomenon. Fiction likes to ignore this fact's implications. We still think in terms of a story "changing" the reader's emotions, cerebrations, maybe even her life. We're not keen on the idea of the story sharing its valence with the reader. But the reader's own life "outside" the story changes the story. You could argue that it affects only "her reaction to the story" or "her take on the story." But these things "are" the story. This is the way Barthian and Derridean post-structuralism's helped me the most as a fiction writer: once I'm done with the thing, I'm basically dead, and probably the text's dead; it becomes simply language, and language lives not just in but "through" the reader. The reader becomes God, for all textual purposes. I see your eyes glazing over, so I'll hush.

LM: Let's go back just for a moment to your sense of the limits of metafiction: in both your current "RCF" essay and in the novella "Westward" in "Girl With Curious Hair," you imply that metafiction is a game that only reveals itself, or that can't share its valence with anything outside itself--like the daily world.

DFW: Well, but metafiction is more valuable than that. It helps reveal fiction as a meditated experience. Plus it reminds us that there's always a recursive component to utterance. This was important, because language's self-consciousness had always been there, but neither writers nor critics nor readers wanted to be reminded of it. But we ended up seeing why recursion's dangerous, and maybe why everybody wanted to keep linguistic self-consciousness out of the show. It gets empty and solipsistic real fast. It spirals in on itself. By the mid-seventies, I think, everything useful about the mode had been exhausted, and the crank-turners had descended. By the eighties it'd become a god awful trap. In "Westward" I got trapped one time just trying to expose the illusions of metafiction the same way metafiction had tried to expose the illusions of the pseudo unmediated realist fiction that came before it. It was a horror show. The stuff's a permanent migraine.

LM:Why is meta-metafiction a trap? Isn't that what you were doing in "Westward"?

DFW: That's a Rog. And maybe Westward" 's only real value'll be showing the kind of pretentious loops you fall into now if you fuck around with recursion. My idea in "Westward" was to do with metafiction what Moore's poetry or like DeLillo's "Libra" had done with other mediated myths. I wanted to get the Armageddon-explosion, the goal metafiction's always been about, I wanted to get it over with, and then out of the rubble reaffirm the idea of art being a living transaction between humans, whether the transaction was erotic or altruistic or sadistic. God, even talking about it makes me want to puke. The "pretension." Twenty-five year-olds should be locked away and denied ink and paper. Everything I wanted to do came out in the story, but it came out just as what it was: crude and naive and pretentious.

LM: Of course, even "The Broom of the System" can be seen as a metafiction, as a book about language and about the relationship between words and reality.

DFW: Think of "The Broom of the System" as the sensitive tale of a sensitive young WASP who's just had this mid-life crisis that's moved him from coldly cerebral analytic math to a coldly cerebral take on fiction and Austin-Wittgenstein-Derridean literary theory, which also shifted his existential dread from a fear that he was just a 98.6 calculating machine to a fear that he was nothing but a linguistic construct. This WASP's written a lot of straight humor, and loves gags, so he decides to write a coded autobio that's also a funny little post-structural gag: so you get Lenore, a character in a story who's terribly afraid that she's really nothing more than a character in a story. And, sufficiently hidden under the sex-change and the gags and theoretical allusions, I got to write my sensitive little self-obsessed bildungsroman. The biggest cackle I got when the book came out was the way all the reviews, whether they stomped up and down on the overall book or not, all praised the fact that at least here was a first novel that wasn't yet another sensitive little bildungsroman.

LM: Wittgenstein's work, especially the "Tractatus," permeates "The Broom of the System" in all sorts of ways, both as content and in terms of the metaphors you employ. But in later stages of his career, Wittgenstein concluded that language was unable to refer in the direct, referential way he'd argued it could in the "Tractatus." Doesn't that mean language is a closed loop--there's no permeable membrane to allow the inside from getting through to the outside? And if that's the case, then isn't a book "only" a game? Or does the fact that it's a language game make it somehow different?

DFW: There's a kind of tragic fall Wittgenstein's obsessed with all the way from the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" in 1922 to the "Philosophical Investigations" in his last years. I mean a real Book-of-Genesis type tragic fall. The loss of the whole external world. The "Tractatus" 's picture theory of meaning presumes that the only possible relation between language and the world is denotative, referential. In order for language both to be meaningful and to have some connection to reality, words like "tree" and "house" have to be like little pictures, representations of little trees and houses. Mimesis. But nothing more. Which means we can know and speak of nothing more than little mimetic pictures. Which divides us, metaphysically and forever, from the external world. If you buy such a metaphysical schism, you're left with only two options. One is that the individual person with her language is trapped in here, with the world out there, and never the twain shall meet. Which, even if you think language's pictures really are mimetic, is an awful lonely proposition. And there's no iron guarantee the pictures truly "are" mimetic, which means you're looking at solipsism. One of the things that makes Wittgenstein a real artist to me is that he realized that no conclusion could be more horrible than solipsism. And so he trashed everything he'd been lauded for in the "Tractatus" and wrote the" Investigations," which is the single most comprehensive and beautiful argument against solipsism that's ever been made. Wittgenstein argues that for language even to be possible, it must always be a function of relationships between persons (that's why he spends so much time arguing against the possibility of a "private language"). So he makes language dependent on human community, but unfortunately we're still stuck with the idea that there is this world of referents out there that we can never really join or know because we're stuck in here, in language, even if we're at least all in here together. Oh yeah, the other original option. The other option is to expand the linguistic subject. Expand the self.

LM: Like Norman Bombardini in "Broom of the System."

DFW: Yeah, Norman's gag is that he literalizes the option. He's going to forget the diet and keep eating until he grows to "infinite size" and eliminates loneliness that way. This was Wittgenstein's double bind: you can either treat language as an infinitely small dense dot, or you let it become the world--the exterior and everything in it. The former banishes you from the Garden. The latter seems more promising. If the world is itself a linguistic construct, there's nothing "outside" language for language to have to picture or refer to. This lets you avoid solipsism, but it leads right to the postmodern, post-structural dilemma of having to deny yourself an existence independent of language. Heidegger's the guy most people think got us into this bind, but when I was working on "Broom of the System" I saw Wittgenstein as the real architect of the postmodern trap. He died right on the edge of explicitly treating reality as linguistic instead of ontological. This eliminated solipsism, but not the horror. Because we're still stuck. The "Investigation" 's line is that the fundamental problem of language is, quote, "I don't know my way about." If I were separate from language, if I could somehow detach from it and climb up and look down on it, get the lay of the land so to speak, I could study it "objectively," take it apart, deconstruct it, know its operations and boundaries and deficiencies. But that's not how things are. I'm "in" it. We're "in" language. Wittgenstein's not Heidegger, it's not that language "is" us, but we're still "in" it, inescapably, the same way we're in like Kant's space-time. Wittgenstein's conclusions seem completely sound to me, always have. And if there's one thing that consistently bugs me writing-wise, it's that I don't feel I really "do" know my way around inside language--I never seem to get the kind of clarity and concision I want.

LM: Ray Carver comes immediately to mind in terms of compression and clarity, and he's obviously someone who wound up having a huge influence on your generation.

DFW: Minimalism's just the other side of metafictional recursion. The basic problem's still the one of the mediating narrative consciousness. Both minimalism and metafiction try to resolve the problem in radical ways. Opposed, but both so extreme they end up empty. Recursive metafiction worships the narrative consciousness, makes "it" the subject of the text. Minimalism's even worse, emptier, because it's a fraud: it eschews not only self-reference but any narrative personality at all, tries to pretend there "is" no narrative consciousness in its text. This is so fucking American, man: either make something your God and cosmos and then worship it, or else kill it.

LM: But did Carver really do that? I'd say his narrative voice is nearly always insistently "there," like Hemingway's was. You're never allowed to forget.

DFW: I was talking about minimalists, not Carver. Carver was an artist, not a minimalist. Even though he's supposedly the inventor of modern U.S. minimalism. "Schools" of fiction are for crank-turners. The founder of a movement is never part of the movement. Carver uses all the techniques and anti-styles that critics call "minimalist," but his case is like Joyce, or Nabokov, or early Barth and Coover--he's using formal innovation in the service of an original vision. Carver invented--or resurrected, if you want to cite Hemingway--the techniques of minimalism in the service of rendering a world he saw that nobody'd seen before. It's a grim world, exhausted and empty and full of mute, beaten people, but the minimalist techniques Carver employed were perfect for it; they created it. And minimalism for Carver wasn't some rigid aesthetic program he adhered to for its own sake. Carver's commitment was to his stories, each of them. And when minimalism didn't serve them, he blew it off. If he realized a story would be best served by expansion, not ablation, he'd expand, like he did to "The Bath," which he later turned into a vastly superior story. He just chased the click. But at some point "minimalist" style caught on. A movement was born, proclaimed, promulgated by the critics. Now here come the crank-turners. What's especially dangerous about Carver's techniques is that they seem so easy to imitate. It doesn't seem like each word and line and draft has been bled over. That's a part of his genius. It looks like you can write a minimalist piece without much bleeding. And you can. But not a good one.

LM: For various reasons, the sixties postmodernists were heavily influenced by other art forms--television, for instance, or the cinema or painting--but in particular their notions of form and structure were often influenced by jazz. Do you think that your generation of writers has been similarly influenced by rock music? For instance, you and Mark Costello collaborated on the first book-length study of rap ("Signifying Rappers"); would you say that your interest in rap has anything to do with your writerly concerns? There's a way in which I can relate your writing with rap's "postmodern" features, its approach to structure and social issues. Sampling. Recontextualizing.

DFW: About the only way music informs my work is in terms of rhythm; sometimes I associate certain narrators' and characters' voices with certain pieces of music. Rock music itself bores me, usually. The phenomenon of rock interests me, though, because its birth was part of the rise of popular media, which completely changed the ways the U.S. was unified and split. The mass media unified the country geographically for pretty much the first time. Rock helped change the fundamental splits in the U.S. from geographical splits to generational ones. Very few people I talk to understand what "generation gap" 's implications really were. Kids loved rock partly because their parents didn't, and obversely. In a mass mediated nation, it's no longer North vs. South. It's under-thirty vs. over thirty. I don't think you can understand the sixties and Vietnam and love ins and LSD and the whole era of patricidal rebellion that helped inspire early postmodern fiction's whole "We're-going-to-trash-your-Beaver Cleaver-plasticized-G.O.P.-image-of-life-in-America" attitude without understanding rock 'n roll. Because rock was and is all about busting loose, exceeding limits, and limits are usually set by parents, ancestors, older authorities.

LM: But so far there aren't many others who have written anything interesting about rock--Richard Meltzer, Peter Guralnik . . .

DFW: There's some others. Lester Bangs. Todd Gitlin, who also does great TV essays. The thing that especially interested Mark and me about rap was the nasty spin it puts on the whole historical us-vs.-them aspect of postmodern pop. Anyway, what rock 'n' roll did for the multicolored young back in the fifties and sixties, rap seems to be doing for the young black urban community. It's another attempt to break free of precedent and constraint. But there are contradictions in rap that seem to perversely show how, in an era where rebellion itself is a commodity used to sell other commodities, the whole idea of rebelling against white corporate culture is not only impossible but incoherent. Today you've got black rappers who make their reputation rapping about Kill the White Corporate Tools, and then are promptly signed by white-owned record corporations, and not only feel no shame about "selling out" but then release platinum albums about not only Killing White Tools but also about how wealthy the rappers now are after signing their record deal! You've got music here that both hates the white GOP values of the Reaganiod eighties and extols a gold-and-BMW materialism that makes Reagan look like a fucking Puritan. Violently racist and anti-Semitic black artists being co-opted by white owned, often Jewish-owned record labels, and celebrating that fact in their art. The tensions are delicious. I can feel the spittle starting again just thinking about it.

LM: This is another example of the dilemma facing avant-garde wannabes today--the appropriation (and ensuing "taming") of rebellion by the system people like Jameson are talking about.

DFW: I don't know much about Jameson. To me rap's the ultimate distillate of the U.S. eighties, but if you really step back and think not just about rap's politics but about white enthusiasm for it, things get grim. Rap's conscious response to the poverty and oppression of U.S. blacks is like some hideous parody of sixties black pride. We seem to be in an era when oppression and exploitation no longer bring a people together and solidify loyalties and help everyone rise above his individual concerns. Now the rap response is more like "You've always exploited us to get rich, so now goddamn it we're going to exploit ourselves and get rich." The irony, self pity, self-hatred are now conscious, celebrated. This has to do with what we were talking about regarding "Westward" and postmodern recursion. If I have a real enemy, a patriarch for my patricide, it's probably Barth and Coover and Burroughs, even Nabokov and Pynchon. Because, even though their self-consciousness and irony and anarchism served valuable purposes, were indispensable for their times, their aesthetic's absorption by the U.S. commercial culture has had appalling consequences for writers and everyone else. The TV essay's really about how poisonous postmodern irony's become. You see it in David Letterman and Gary Shandling and rap. But you also see it in fucking Rush Limbaugh, who may well be the Antichrist. You see it in T. C. Boyle and Bill Vollmann and Lorrie Moore. It's pretty much all there is to see in your pal Mark Leyner. Leyner and Limbaugh are the nineties' twin towers of postmodern irony, hip cynicism, a hatred that winks and nudges you and pretends it's just kidding.

Irony and cynicism were just what the U.S. hypocrisy of the fifties and sixties called for. That's what made the early postmodernists great artists. The great thing about irony is that it splits things apart, gets up above them so we can see the flaws and hypocrisies and duplicates. The virtuous always triumph? Ward Cleaver is the prototypical fifties father? "Sure." Sarcasm, parody, absurdism and irony are great ways to strip off stuff's mask and show the unpleasant reality behind it. The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, "then" what do we do? Irony's useful for debunking illusions, but most of the illusion-debunking in the U.S. has now been done and redone. Once everybody knows that equality of opportunity is bunk and Mike Brady's bunk and Just Say No is bunk, now what do we do? All we seem to want to do is keep ridiculing the stuff. Postmodern irony and cynicism's become an end in itself, a measure of hip sophistication and literary savvy. Few artists dare to try to talk about ways of working toward redeeming what's wrong, because they'll look sentimental and naive to all the weary ironists. Irony's gone from liberating to enslaving. There's some great essay somewhere that has a line about irony being the song of the prisoner who's come to love his cage.

LM: Humbert Humbert, the rutting gorilla, painting the bars of his own cage with such elegance. In fact, Nabokov's example raises the issue of whether cynicism and irony are really a given. In "Pale Fire" and "Lolita," there's an irony about these structures and inventions and so forth, but this reaction is deeply humanistic rather than being merely ironic. This seems true in Barthelme, for instance, or Stanley Elkin, Barth. Or Robert Coover. The other aspect has to do with the presentation of themselves or their consciousness. The beauty and the magnificence of human artistry isn't merely ironic.

DFW: But you're talking about the click, which is something that can't just be bequeathed from our postmodern ancestors to their descendants. No question that some of the early postmodernists and ironists and anarchists and absurdists did magnificent work, but you can't pass the click from one generation to another like a baton. The click's idiosyncratic, personal. The only stuff a writer can get from an artistic ancestor is a certain set of aesthetic values and beliefs, and maybe a set of formal techniques that might--just might--help the writer to chase his own click. The problem is that, however misprised it's been, what's been passed down from the postmodern heyday is sarcasm, cynicism, a manic ennui, suspicion of all authority, suspicion of all constraints on conduct, and a terrible penchant for ironic diagnosis of unpleasantness instead of an ambition not just to diagnose and ridicule but to redeem. You've got to understand that this stuff has permeated the culture. It's become our language; we're so in it we don't even see that it's one perspective, one among many possible ways of seeing. Postmodern irony's become our environment.

LM: Mass culture is another very "real" part of that environment--rock music or television or sports, talk shows, game shows, whatever; that's the milieu you and I live in, I mean that's the world . . .

DFW: I'm always stumped when critics regard references to popular culture in serious fiction as some sort of avant-garde stratagem. In terms of the world I live in and try to write about, it's inescapable. Avoiding any reference to the pop would mean either being retrograde about what's "permissible" in serious art or else writing about some other world.

LM: You mentioned earlier that writing parts of "Broom of the System" felt like recreation for you--a relief from doing technical philosophy. Are you ever able to shift into that "recreational mode" of writing today? Is it still "play" for you?

DFW: It's not play anymore in the sense of laughs and yucks and non-stop thrills. The stuff in "Broom" that's informed by that sense of play ended up pretty forgettable, I think. And it doesn't sustain the enterprise for very long. And I 've found the really tricky discipline to writing is trying to play without getting overcome by insecurity or vanity or ego. Showing the reader that you're smart or funny or talented or whatever, trying to be liked, integrity issues aside, this stuff just doesn't have enough motivational calories in it to carry you over the long haul. You've got to discipline yourself to talk out of the part of you that loves the thing, loves what you're working on. Maybe just plain loves. (I think we might need windwoods for this part, LM.) But sappy or no, it's true. The last couple years have been pretty arid for me good-work-wise, but the one way I've progressed I think is I've gotten convinced that there's something kind of timelessly vital and sacred about good writing. This thing doesn't have that much to do with talent, even glittering talent like Leyner's or serious talent like Daitch's. Talent's just an instrument. It's like having a pen that works instead of one that doesn't. I'm not saying I'm able to work consistently out of the premise, but it seems like the big distinction between good art and so-so art lies somewhere in the art's heart's purpose, the agenda of the consciousness behind the text. It's got something to do with love. With having the discipline to talk out of the part of yourself that love can instead of the part that just wants to be loved. I know this doesn't sound hip at all. I don't know. But it seems like one of the things really great fiction-writers do--from Carver to Chekhov to Flannery O'Connor, or like the Tolstoy of "The Death of Ivan Ilych" or the Pynchon of "Gravity's Rainbow"--is "give" the reader something. The reader walks away from the real art heavier than she came into it. Fuller. All the attention and engagement and work you need to get from the reader can't be for your benefit; it's got to be for hers. What's poisonous about the cultural environment today is that it makes this so scary to try to carry out. Really good work probably comes out of a willingness to disclose yourself, open yourself up in spiritual and emotional ways that risk making you really feel something. To be willing to sort of die in order to move the reader, somehow. Even now I'm scared about how sappy this'll look in print, saying this. And the effort actually to do it, not just talk about it, requires a kind of courage I don't seem to have yet. I don't see that kind of courage in Mark Leyner or Emily Prager or Bret Ellis. I sometimes see flickers of it in Vollmann and Daitch and Nicholson Baker and Amy Homes and Jon Franzen. It's weird--it has to do with quality but not that much with sheer writing talent. It has to do with the click. I used to think the click came from, "Holy shit, have I ever just done something good." Now it seems more like the real click's more like, "Here's something good, and on one side I don't much matter, and on the other side the individual reader maybe doesn't much matter, but the thing's good because there's extractable value here for both me and the reader." Maybe it's as simple as trying to make the writing more generous and less ego-driven.

LM: Music genres like the blues or jazz or even rock seem to have their ebb and flow in terms of experimentalism, but in the end they all have to come back to the basic elements that comprise the genre, even if these are very simple (like the blues). The trajectory of Bruce Springsteen's career comes to mind. What interests fans of any genre is that they really know the formulas and the elements, so they also can respond to the constant, built-in meta-games and intertextualities going on in all genre forms. In a way the responses are aesthetically sophisticated in the sense that it's the infinite variations-on-a-theme that interests them. I mean, how else can they read a million of these things (real genre fans are not stupid people necessarily)? My point is that people who really care about the forms--the serious writers and readers in fiction--don't want all the forms "broken," they want variation that follows the essence to emerge in new ways. Blues fans could love Hendrix because he was still playing the blues. I think you're seeing a greater appreciation for fiction's rules and limits among postmodern writers of all generations. It's almost a relief to realize that all babies were "not" tossed out with the bathwater back in the sixties.

DFW: You're probably right about appreciating limits. The sixties' movement in poetry to radical free verse, in fiction to radically experimental recursive forms--their legacy to my generation of would-be artists is at least an incentive to ask very seriously where literary art's true relation to limits should be. We've seen that you can break any or all of the rules without getting laughed out of town, but we've also seen the toxicity that anarchy for its own sake can yield. It's often useful to dispense with standard formulas, of course, but it's just as often valuable and brave to see what can be done within a set of rules--which is why formal poetry's so much more interesting to me than free verse. Maybe our touchstone now should be G. M. Hopkins, who made up his "own" set of formal constraints and then blew everyone's footwear off from inside them. There's something about free play within an ordered and disciplined structure that resonates for readers. And there's something about complete caprice and flux that's deadening.

LM: I suspect this is why so many of the older generation of postmodernists--Federman, Sukenick, Steve Katz and others (maybe even Pynchon fits in here)--have recently written books that rely on more traditional forms. That's why it seems important right now for your generation to go back to traditional forms and re-examine and rework those structures and formulas. This is already happening with some of the best younger writers in Japan. You recognize that if you just say, "Fuck it, let's throw everything out!" There's nothing in the bathtub to make the effort worthwhile.

DFW: For me, the last few years of the postmodern era have seemed a bit like the way you feel when you're in high school and your parents go on a trip, and you throw a party. You get all your friends over and throw this wild disgusting fabulous party. For a while it's great, free and freeing, parental authority gone and overthrown, a cat's-away-let's-play Dionysian revel. But then time passes and the party gets louder and louder, and you run out of drugs, and nobody's got any money for more drugs, and things get broken and spilled, and there's a cigarette burn on the couch, and you're the host and it's your house too, and you gradually start wishing your parents would come back and restore some fucking order in your house. It's not a perfect analogy, but the sense I get of my generation of writers and intellectuals or whatever is that it's 3:00 A.M. and the couch has several burn-holes and somebody's thrown up in the umbrella stand and we're wishing the revel would end. The postmodern founders' patricidal work was great, but patricide produces orphans, and no amount of revelry can make up for the fact that writers my age have been literary orphans throughout our formative years. We're kind of wishing some parents would come back. And of course we're uneasy about the fact that we wish they'd come back--I mean, what's wrong with us? Are we total pussies? Is there something about authority and limits we actually need? And then the uneasiest feeling of all, as we start gradually to realize that parents in fact aren't ever coming back--which means "we're" going to have to be the parents.

	Abstract = {After all the attention David Foster Wallace received following the surprising success of his 1996 novel, Infinite Jest, he's dedicated to protecting his privacy. Responses to the one-thousand-seventy-nine-page social satire and human tragedy-which famously included three hundred eighty-eight endnotes-were overwhelmingly positive. He was de scribed as "brilliant" (Kirkus Reviews), "a genius" (Chicago Tribune), and "the funniest writer of his generation" (Village Voice). Wallace followed his celebrated epic with a 1997 collection of nonfiction essays and arguments, A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, and for the next two years he continued to show up regularly in magazines as mainstream as Elle and Spin. Journalists even waxed rhapsodic about his publicity photo, as if it were the very picture of his age-an unshaven young man lost in thought, a bandanna wrapped around his long hair like a bandage protecting a head wound.

DO NOT DISTURB Now, the 37-year-old Wallace, a professor at Illinois State University in Blooming ton-Normal, has warned me that his unlisted telephone number will be good for only another month, when he'll have it changed. "My number has a shelf life of one year," he says. "Then some weird thing happens where I end up getting calls from people that I don't want to get calls from. So you draw the circle in again." His girlfriend has just moved into his house, but they've made a pact not to discuss each other's work. He defends that bargain as a necessary measure to guard their intimacy.

When I first call, he picks up the phone as I'm leaving a message on his machine, and immediately starts laying down ground rules for the interview. First, no photos. "Little, Brown has like twelve different shots of me-can't you use one of those?" he pleads. "I'm tired of having my picture taken." And he doesn't want to meet at his house; instead he directs me to a Cracker Barrel restaurant just off the I-55 interchange in Bloomington. His instructions are painstakingly detailed.

Alexie, Wallace, Jen and Garcia grace Portland Arts and Lectures

by Don Campbell and Daisy Dailey
of the Oregon Live staff   |  TREND SPOTTING IS ALWAYS an inexact science. But luck of the draw and converging book tours brought four of contemporary literature's vital young voices to Portland, giving a near sold-out and erudite Portland Arts & Lectures crowd at least a peek at where the future of fiction in America may be headed.

Sherman Alexie, Gish Jen, Cristina Garcia and David Foster Wallace -- bound only by uncomfortable chairs, a rapt crowd and the educated nudges of moderator Christopher Zinn -- probed themselves and each other for what lay at the heart of their art as novelists. Rather than an exercise in morality vs. entertainment, or high art vs. books sales debate (though it ground that chunk of grist), the hour-and-a-half discussion allowed each writer to examine how he or she came to writing--generally through the back door, the isolation of the craft ("I'm alone with the one person," said David Foster Wallace, "who can drive me completely crazy"), whether or not their work could, would or should change the world and what a reader should know about their respective work before reading the first page.

Here are some tidbits from their discussion:
On writing and how they got there 
Sherman Alexie: Went from reading the Grapes of Wrath at age 6, to wanting to be a pediatrician and then a lawyer. "I tried pre-law. But Indians and lawyers don't have a good history."

After selling his first book of poetry, his publishers asked if he wrote fiction as well. "I said sure, then I started writing fiction. Poetry is my first love. Fiction is an arranged marriage."

Is writing the right thing to do? "Yeah, there's no commute. I just walk downstairs to my office. I do check the traffic report. 'Watch out -- there's lint on the third stair.' Growing up, I'd always be babbling in a corner. Now people pay me to babble."

Gish Jen: Jen, daughter of Chinese immigrants, caromed through pre-med and business before landing in creative writing. "It was the process of elimination," and not always a popular choice with her tradition-bound family. "My mother always acted like this was a terrible affliction."

David Foster Wallace: "A question like this makes me wonder if the universe is wholly random or conspiring to make us happy. When I look back, the steps that lead us to do what we do don't make any sense."

Headed for the sciences, Wallace was waylaid by a college reading group. "It turned me on. My boldest move was getting into creative writing in grad school. The first thing I sent out got bought. It was the first thing I got a lot of praise from." Sometimes, he said, "I worry that I'm doing what I'm doing because it's the first thing I got praise for." But, he continued, "It's a free and rewarding way to make a living. I just wish I could remember that when I'm alone in a room."

Cristina Garcia: Garcia, who immigrated from Cuba as a child, admitted "I came in the back door. I wanted to be a diplomat, but there are no illustrious Cubans in diplomacy." She fell in love with the "cadence and musicality" of writing, and via studies in journalism, stumbled into a job as copygirl at the New York Times. "Sometimes I think I'm better suited for journalism than the solitary slog of writing fiction."

On the isolation and solitude of, and distractions to, writing
CG: "On the best days, it is a splendid isolation that only happens a few days a year. I read poetry a couple of hours before I write. I wait for the images to appear or language or weird juxtapositions."

GJ: "The voices of the public and families are very loud. It's difficult to get away. You can never be alone enough, writers are the only people who think being incarcerated is a good idea."

DFW: "The worst thing about writing -- and there are many good things -- the worst thing is that I'm alone with the one person who can drive me completely crazy."

SA: "People often ask, how do I become a writer? Well, mental illness helps. I love reading and writing more than anything." To be a writer, he says, you have to be incredibly dedicated, on the border of obsessed. "Just know that friends and family will suffer because of your ambitions."

On writers
SA: Alexie used to idolize writers. "But I've been around a lot of writers now. I've never met a group of people more medicated in my life. And these are the people who are supposed to tell us the truth?!"

On their work changing the world
SA: "I want to change the world. [But] we're artists in a capitalistic society--we can't not worry about selling books--that's the contradiction. I come from a life of poverty. I can't afford to be just an artist."

CG: "The best moments for me are by myself, when all things coalesce, I'm alone with my images, my hallucinations."

Mario Vargas Llosa once said to Garcia in an interview, "With writing, you seduce one person at a time." Says Garcia, "That's the seduction for me. It's not [like] mass media."

DFW: "Fiction can do what none of the other arts can do. Fiction lets us pole vault over the walls of self, there's something socially redemptive about that." Wallace visibility wrestled with the part of his psyche that wants him to believe that writers are "entertainers and marketers."

What readers need to know before tackling their books
CG: "No preparation. I want a reader to browse, find my book on a lower shelf, have something catch their eye and let them settle in to read a few pages."

SA: "I'm the exact opposite...I'll take you to dinner. My books are rowdy." All you really need to know about his books, he said, is this: They're about "funny, angry Indians."

DFW: On prepping someone to read Infinite Jest, he said, "This is fairly hard. The job of the book is to induce you to do the work [plowing through the 1,000-plus pages]. If you get 50 or 100 pages into it and the book hasn't done that, then it makes a great paperweight."

On ending a book
SA: Alexie admitted he has trouble ending a book. "I think books should go on forever. Books are abandoned." In Reservation Blues, "I got so sick of my characters, I drove them all off a cliff in a blue van. "

CG: "I want surprise and inevitability."

GJ: "The end should represent human change, to be at a new door, but a different door."

DFW: Admitting to minor depression a couple of months after finishing a project, Wallace commented on what it's like when someone asks what happened to a particular character: "It's like a relative who dies, and you ask, 'So what are they doing now?'"

The thread of humility in each of their respective successes ran through the quartet. All seemed amazed that people would pay money to hear them talk.}}

	Abstract = {There is an inherent risk in studying contemporary fiction. Serious questions form around issues of an author's longevity and legacy, a work's merit and its endurance for later scholarship, and the varieties of current critical reception and methodology against the shifts to come. The attendant difficulty of assessing and analyzing a work before an industry of critical reception has formed also presents challenges. David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest (1996) represents these challenges, and much more; it is at once an encyclopedic novel of 1079 pages, full of both liberal arts and scientific erudition, and an encomium to an apocalyptic end of late millennial American culture. The novel is highly allegorical and operates with three crucial subtexts, in addition to the standard diegetic narrative. In this study, I present three different, though not mutually exclusive, interpretations of this novel, a novel that has presented interpretive difficulties to scholars of contemporary fiction. In Part One, I survey and compare Wallace's aesthetic with the radical, yet self-contained, aesthetic of the poet, G. M. Hopkins; Part Two examines the integral concept of mediation and explores the subtext of the return of the dead author--the novel operates, in part, as a rejoinder to the death-of-the-author critical impasse; Part Three is primarily comparative and analyzes Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov  (1880). Wallace has rewritten (or reimagined) Dostoevsky's novel and translated it into a contemporary context and idiom as a remedy for postmodern American solipsism.}}

	Abstract = {In 1945, Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think," a speculative essay about the organization of knowledge that established the philosophical basis of hypertextual media. Three years later, Norbert Wiener published  Cybernetics  , which he defined as general science of "control and communication in the animal and the machine." In the 1990s, these two theoretical visions came to maturity when developments in science and technology made the idea of cybernetics the foundation for a new understanding of human identity, and computerized media created new ways of constructing and representing the subject. This study examines the literary response to this transformation of these technologies of the self through three novels which address this convergence of the traditional categories of the natural (or Nature) and the technological.

Chapter one describes the development of machine intelligence and virtual selfhood. In Galatea 2.2 , Richard Powers uses the connectionist model of the mind as a controlling metaphor, crafting an apologia for literature. Part autobiography, part novel, Galatea 2.2 argues for the value of literary knowledge by demonstrating the role of narrative in constructing a self over time. The multiple figurations of language ultimately oppose any reductive model of the human.

Chapter two analyzes the notion of virtual culture. In The Diamond Age, Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer . Neal Stephenson imagines an interactive book that teaches the universals of human culture, thus creating ideal readers. Stephenson embraces a cybernetic vision of the future, but consistently subverts this vision. The Diamond Age places American ideology in a Darwinian universe, but celebrates representative individualism and the book as a form of mediation.

Chapter three examines the figuration of the human through the problem of addiction. In Infinite Jest , David Foster Wallace address this crisis in representation and devises a polyphonous and fugal narrative in an effort to restore depth and sentiment to the novel. Wallace's text ends in stasis but demands an active reader.

These three texts thus exemplify the contemporary recuperation of an essentially pragmatic subject through narrative techniques which incorporate in their forms aspects of the technologies to which they are responding.}}

	Abstract = {Drawing on aspects of the French stream of discourse analysis and on poststructural thought in general, this study explores a strain of contemporary American prose fiction that dramatizes and resists the influence of visual, mass media culture on the individual reading-viewing subject. It aims to identify the deliberately modified literary means by which writers respond to the fate of the subject, to an agency which is now configured by both an electronic, commercial media environment and a poststructural paradigm that posits the self as a dissolute and linguistic nexus of repression and loss. From the standpoint of discourse analysis, the argument presents the visual mass media as an ideologically closed mode of unilateral communication that encourages solipsistic contemplation of televisually and cinematically constituted mental image tracks that are installed by a consumerist order decidedly antiegalitarian in nature. From a poststructural purview, the subject is seen as existing in both print and electronic media in a state of flux. "Mediant fiction", so called in this analysis due to the emergent genre's attempted intercession between subjective social agents and corporate semiosis, is presented as embodying both these socio-philosophical positions. However, the manner in which it reconstructs visual media in literary language is shown to open a space for a tentative and idiosyncratic human agency. The subject is denied essential categories but is outlined through the tracing of commercial rhetorics that would fix and control the subject. The mediant fictions of David Foster Wallace, Don DeLillo, Robert Coover, and Thomas Pynchon transpose corporate semiosis into literary language through an adapted form of ekphrasis. This method places the ideologically closed logic of the commercial imperative within language that forces subject categories to remain open. Keeping in mind Eco's claim that semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everything which can be used in order to lie, the argument suggests that the lie that is fiction may counteract the lie that is corporate semiosis, to the benefit of what may loosely be called the democratic self.

An implicit argument is made for a mediant critical approach that can adequately receive mediant fiction and share its conceptual orientations. The critical value of interpretation in the name of interpreters synchromeshes with the fiction's literary value of resistance to ideological closure; the two values taken together constitute a literary/critical mode of thought that could infuse with a self-reflexive and egalitarian minded rigor the home space wherein most interaction with electronic social texts takes place. The reader-viewer may utilize this mode of social thought to contend with power on the site he or she occupies, may in short become Foucault's specific intellectual who uses the specificity of that site as a basis for highly individualized political action.}}

I begin by outlining what I take to be the unique temporality of a nuclear epoch, noting the ways the possibility of instantaneous and total destruction might reshape our experience of time, and hence of narrative. I go on to trace the evolving relationship between imaginations of finitude and narrative in five American authors: John Hersey, John Barth, Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and David Foster Wallace.}}

	Abstract = {This dissertation studies the fictional and non-fictional responses of David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen, and Richard Powers to their felt anxieties about the vitality of literature in contemporary culture. The intangible nature of literature's social value marks the literary as an uneasy, contested, and defensive cultural site. At the same time, the significance of any given cultural artifact or medium, such as television, film, radio, or fiction, is in a continual state of flux. Within that broad context I examine some of the cultural institutions competing with literature for public attention, as well as some of the cultural developments impacting the availability of public attention for literary concerns. With Wallace, I study his efforts in fiction and essays to establish an anti-ironic mode of literary rebellion, in opposition to the culturally pervasive tone of self-protective irony modeled by television. Franzen opens discussion about the transience of cultural authority, a situation in which the imprimatur of the academy, for instance, confers a cultural significance different in kind but not degree from the imprimatur of a popular televised book club. My study of Franzen in particular demonstrates the impact of proliferating sites of cultural authority, addressing the emergence of middlebrow culture and audiences from contested space to authoritative cultural arbiter. The chapter on Franzen also examines the increasing role of corporate interests in the production of cultural artifacts with an eye toward their financial viability more than their cultural impact. And finally, my study of Powers focuses on the animosity between the sciences and the humanities. Powers produces fiction that serves as an indispensable tool for communicating between disparate and otherwise isolated disciplines, and for helping those specialized fields synthesize their information with others.}}

	Year = {2003},
	Abstract = {My dissertation analyzes postwar U.S. fiction as a response to needs, anxieties, and ambitions widely shared amongst the middle class. According to recent scholars, including Janice Radway and Elizabeth Long, middle-class readers often turn to fiction for the same reasons they turn to self-help books: in search of guidance on how to lead their lives and how to negotiate various social and psychological challenges. While serious critics have generally dismissed such practical, "middlebrow" functions, in my view the needs of middle-class readers and the efforts of fiction writers to satisfy them can be quite complex and thus demand scrutiny. I contend that postwar fiction offers these readers fantasy-fulfillment, reassurance, skills and attitudes necessary to navigate various social hierarchies, and also new modes of disaffection and alienation. All of these forms of knowledge make it possible for individuals to cope and succeed within the given social and political structures and hence play a "therapeutic" role, but in many cases they also provoke, paradoxically, the cultivation of dissatisfaction, the articulation of shared grievances, and the production of powerful political critiques.

In each chapter, I situate the literary work in relation to major cultural, social, and political developments, and important self-help texts. In Chapter One, I examine the explosion of suburbia in the 1950s and the strategies John Cheever provides in his collection, The Housebreaker of Shady Hill and Other Stories , for maintaining individuality and mobility within a homogenizing cultural landscape. Chapter Two focuses on the second-wave feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and the various meanings of feminine self-improvement it mobilized; I examine Erica Jong's Fear of Flying and the role her sexually adventuresome protagonist Isadora Wing plays as a source of identification for middle-class women struggling to redefine their identities. In Chapter Three, I investigate the obsession with addiction in the late twentieth century and David Foster Wallace's response in Infinite Jest , offering readers basic humanistic values espoused by Alcoholics Anonymous, including empathy and sincerity, as a replacement for an emphasis on immediate, shallow pleasures and glib postmodern irony, which Wallace sees as conducive to addictive tendencies.}}

I contend that the 1990s marks the beginning of an American literary Renaissance, departing from previous literary modes and generations. Despite the influence of the media and computer technology in the 1990s, literature, and more specifically, the novel, continues to surpass any other art or media form in its ability to capture and interpret culture as a whole. Furthermore, with the rise of new cultures, media forms, literary techniques and technologies in the latter part of the twentieth century, hybridity best characterizes American culture and literature. There are several forms of hybridity manifest in contemporary American literature and culture: psychological, ethnic, technological, philosophical and formulaic. In general, American 'Generation Xers' (born in the 1960s and 70s) are psychologically hybrid in their hedonistic inclinations, in part fueled by the media, coupled with a dispassionate, cynical stoicism, which I argue is a response to information and sensory overload. I also contend that popular culture and mass media have helped produce mass homogenization of hybrid identities, through now ethnically diverse popular culture. In addition, I investigate fiction that considers the cultural and psychological ramifications (both present and future) of the new hybrid technologies of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, hypertext and the Internet.}}

	Abstract = {In the 1980s and 1990s, many scientifically cognizant young novelists turned away from the physics-based tropes of entropy and chaos and chose biological concepts of order, complexity, and self-organization as their dominant metaphors. This dissertation focuses on three novels published between 1991 and 1996 that replace the notion of the encyclopedia as a closed system and model new narrative ecologies grounded in the tenets of the emergent science of complex systems. Thus, Richard Powers's The Gold-Bug Variations (1991) explores the marriage of bottom-up self-organizing systems and top-down natural selection through a narrative lens and cautions us against any worldview which does not grasp life as a complex system; Bob Shacochis's Swimming in the Volcano (1993) illustrates how richly complex global behavior emerges from the local interaction of a large number of independent agents; and, David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest (1996) enacts a collaborative narrative of distributed causality to investigate reciprocal relationships between the individual and the multiple systems in which he is embedded. Unlike many other contemporary authors, the new encyclopedists do not shun the abundance of information in postmodern culture. Instead, as I demonstrate here, the intricate webs of their complex ecologies emerge as narrative circulates through diverse informational networks. Ecologies of Knowledge argues that these texts inaugurate a new naturalism, demanding a reconciliation between humans and the natural world and advocating an increased understanding of life's interdependent patterns and particularities. Grounded in such an awareness of ecological complexity, these large and demanding books are our survival guides for the twenty-first century.}}

	Abstract = {David Foster Wallace's fiction is reminiscent of a literary avantgarde tradition that defines itself in partial terms of its distance from the hegemony of mass culture. Wallace is sympathetic with such cultural and literary theorists as Fredric Jameson, Gerald Graff, and Andreas Huyssen, each of whom is concerned to show capitalism to be largely responsible for the homogenization of the avantgarde and mass culture. This homogenization, from Wallace's perspective, is manifest in mass culture's appropriation of the formal devices of the last "legitimate" avantgarde literature--namely, metafiction. The metafictional device with which Wallace is foremost engaged is self-conscious irony. Perpetrated, for Wallace, primarily by television, the mass appropriation of self-conscious irony has yielded an unprecedented American solipsism. Wallace's novella "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" and his novel Infinite Jest are both concerned to show the possibilities for human communication in a solipsistic and televisual social environment.}}

	Abstract = {This dissertation emerges from a series of questions I continually ask myself and my students: What is reading? Why and how do we read? Engaging these seemingly simple questions has led me to investigate the ethical significance of reading in theory, criticism and pedagogy. This dissertation formulates an ethics of reading, that is, a consideration of the literary not as a static site for textual interpretation, but as an always contextual, always socially-inflected mode of transformation for both reader and text. Rather than reading contemporary literature as an expression or symptom of contemporary reality, this project, using the theoretical writings of Gilles Deleuze and Maurice Blanchot, situates reading not as a decoding of meaning but as a locus of the social forces that inform responses to the literary. Thus configured, reading, as a careful consideration of how we respond to the otherness of texts, becomes a site of ethical force with relevance to both literary (especially postmodern) and cultural studies.

Chapter One, "Saying Yes to Bartleby: Between Reading and Writing," formulates reading as an ethical endeavor that always negotiates how to engage texts, and not as a means for defining or categorizing literature. Taking its impetus from Herman Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener," this chapter locates a common resistance to interpretation and understanding through the characters that populate Susan Daitch's Storytown and David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress , and considers how to respond to literary works that resist a hermeneutic understanding of the world, and how to employ these works in the classroom.

Chapters Two and Three, "Kinds of Stasis in David Foster Wallace," and "The Gift of Nothing in Richard Powers," read these writers as deploying stasis and silence as the primary components of their characters' subjectivities, which in turn leads to a consideration of how reading becomes a blockage of selfhood.

Chapter Four, "Silence Junkies: Maurice Blanchot and Irvine Welsh," engages the configuration of literary subjectivity produced by both writers as spaces of negotiation of class and race politics, national identity, globalism, and psychological conceptions of selfhood.

Chapter Five, "Hauntings: Pynchon, Burroughs, DeLillo," interrogates postmodern literary criticism's focus on the influence of Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo and William S. Burroughs on subsequent writers. This chapter comes last in order to differentiate this project from postmodern literary criticism that employs the work of Pynchon, DeLillo, or Burroughs as defining the parameters of contemporary literature.

	Abstract = {Unlike structural anthropologists, literary critics have long treated family relations and linguistic signification as mutually exclusive, even ideologically irrelevant to each other. Yet a sub-genre of language-obsessed postmodern American fiction struggles to maintain family bonds within the maelstrom of the crisis in meaning that characterizes contemporary culture. This dissertation examines how novels by DeLillo, Wallace, Homes, and Danielewski conceptualize the threat posed to individuals and families by a culture saturated with mediation and simulation, and portray their characters' valiant, if mostly failed, efforts to resist the disaffection and narcissistic solipsism bred by that culture.

Echoing Christopher Lasch's critique that post-industrial culture has become dominated by the image, these novels suggest that society is a mediating machine for reproducing individuals driven by infantile desire. But what their characters desire most is freedom from desire: an escape from the suffering that attends immediate, unfiltered confrontations with life. The novels illustrate the problem of narcissism as theorized by Freud, demonstrating that the ultimate danger of an image-based society lies in its tendency to construct a subject that can no longer direct its energies toward others. They do so largely through the rhetorical mode of irony, deploying it in opposition to the unmediated suffering their characters hope to avoid, and so narrowing the terms in which a literary escape from solipsistic disaffection might be imagined.

Chapter One finds in Don DeLillo's The Names hope in the fact that, next to the murderous and disaffecting idea that language separates us from the painfully human, DeLillo places one man's quest to reconnect with his estranged wife and son through language. His White Noise offers a bleaker vision of language and culture in Chapter Two, demonstrating the selfish benefits of succumbing to a thoroughly dehumanized language that offers only disaffected, infantilizing solipsism. In Chapter Three, David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest illustrates that these destructive tendencies have become a recursive pathology defining both an entire culture and its doomed attempts to cure itself. Finally in Chapter Four, Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves offers a promising alternative by re-imagining media as that which enables both irony and family.}}

	Abstract = {In his novel, Infinite Jest  , David Foster Wallace suggests a vision of identity and subjectivity that is predicated upon the idea of confinement. For Wallace, the subject is in a constant state of struggle to escape the very things that form its identity and status as a subject. The self is something that must be surpassed or transcended; it is to be forgotten or escaped. Wallace's text is thus filled with characters who have fanatically devoted themselves to some pastime or pursuit in order to effect a self-forgetting. Wallace, however, identifies a fundamental paradox that underlies this attempt at escape. All the pursuits that are meant to provide an escape from the self serve only to reemphasize the primacy of the self. This is so because an act of "surrendering" to such a pursuit is still an act of will and thus serves to reassert the self even as it claims to deny it.

Wallace's text thus poses an important question about freedom. His characters are on a continual quest for freedom from something (themselves) that cannot be evaded. Wallace seems to suggest a particularly bleak outlook for the possibility of freedom, but there are moments in his text where he suggests that some kind of freedom is possible. Using the work of Judith Butler and Giorgio Agamben, this paper will explore Wallace's vision of subjectivity and identity and attempt to identify a space of freedom within the framework Wallace has laid out.

A televisual culture substantially different from the contemporary one (circa 1990) David Foster Wallace outlines in ``E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction'' subtends the narrative of his 1996 novel Infinite Jest.  Considering the awareness Wallace evinces in ``E Unibus Pluram'' of the influence of corporate media on a televisual culture, we must account for the manner in which the evolution of corporate media and its production and distribution technologies impacts the televisual culture Wallace creates in Infinite Jest (the majority of which occurs in the Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment, or 2008 according to unsubsidized calendars).  A televisual culture is a culture in which people establish their identities as a direct response to pervasive entertainment and advertising media (including but not limited to internet portals, television networks, cable companies, film studios, radio stations, and book and magazine publishers).  Any reconfiguration of those media outlets would also reconfigure the televisual culture constituted as a series of responses to the content distributed by those media outlets.  In Infinite Jest, Wallace depicts the detrimental effects of technology-based media reconfigurations on a televisual culture when those reconfigurations are undertaken solely to satisfy market dictates.

 

Marshall McLuhan's axiom ``the medium is the message'' speaks to the problem the reconfiguration of media outlets poses to televisual cultures dependent on media stability.  A televisual culture only exists inasmuch as individuals generate similar responses to the content distributed by the media outlets.  As technological innovation reconfigures those media outlets, new distribution mechanisms subtly alter the content distributed over them, because, as McLuhan observes in Understanding Media, ``in such matters'' as the interpretation of a given media fare, ``people [retain] some sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity'' (13).  Individual viewers unconsciously relate to a broadcast -- a program and its advertisements -- as a ``total field'' because the media outlet's distribution mechanism, the medium itself, unifies the broadcast into a ``total effect'' (13, 26).  In his introduction to Understanding Media, Lewis Lapham illustrates how individual viewers interpret broadcasts as unified ``total fields'': ``the sequence of scenes on CBS or CNN teaches the late-twentieth century American catechism: first, at the top of the news, the admonitory row of body bags being loaded into ambulances in Brooklyn or South Miami; second, the inferno of tenement fires and burning warehouses {\ldots} The text of the day's lesson having been thus established, the camera makes its happy return to the always smiling anchorwomen, and so -- with her gracious permission -- to the previews of heaven sponsored by Delta Airlines, Calvin Klein, and State Farms Insurance companies'' (xvi).  Because individual viewers respond to broadcasts as ``total fields,'' the ``total effect'' of a broadcast cannot be defined through an analysis of the program or the advertisements alone, but only by examining their interdependence on and interaction with the medium responsible for their reception as a ``total field.''  The configuration of the constituent parts of this ``total field'' -- the medium, the program, and the advertisement -- determines how individuals will respond to a given broadcast, and from the standpoint of the corporations responsible for the broadcast, the ability to predict and manipulate these individualized responses is crucial to their financial success.  When possible, corporations inculcate their own interpretive methodologies in the televisual culture, thereby enabling them to accurately anticipate the responses of the individuals comprising it.  In Infinite Jest, the inability of the corporate media outlets (initially, the Big Four television networks) to anticipate the ``total effect'' of their broadcasts creates a series of cascading crises that result in an unstable macro-political climate that threatens to destroy the United States.  The following account of the rise of InterLace TelEntertainment clarifies the specific role corporate media performs in the novel's eschatological drama, paying particular attention to its determinative role in the construction of a ``citizen'' in a televisual culture and the detrimental effects of this construction on the constitution of a modern democracy.

 

Prior to the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the mainstream press responded to the conflation of corporate media and televisual culture with syndicated, sound-bite length invectives against whoever dared to display such anti-corporate bias/paranoia publicly.  By the Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment, it's a fact of life.  Efforts to conceal the determinative connection between corporate media and televisual culture were well underway when Wallace wrote ``E Unibus Pluram'' in 1990.  They were redoubled after the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, ``the core premise [of which] was to eliminate restrictions on firms moving into other communication areas -- for example, phone companies moving into cable television and vice versa, or long distance phone companies moving into local service and vice versa -- and then to eliminate as many regulations as possible on these firms' behavior'' (McChesney 74).  Efforts to conceal this connection increased following the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act because the massive corporate conglomeration precipitated by deregulation created a media market even more oligopolistically structured than its predecessor, one in which the content and distribution of information was determined by one of eight transnational corporations: Time Warner, Disney, Viacom, Seagram, News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch), Sony, General Electric, and AT&T-TCI.  The fewer the number of distinct media outlets, the less individualized members of a televisual culture responding to those outlets can be.  Making matters worse, the interdependent structure of their oligopoly ensures the cultivation of homogeneity, because oligopolistic competition creates difference through advertising, not product diversification.  Corporations participating in an oligopolistic market only launch advertising campaigns that impinge on one another's interests if these campaigns can be orchestrated in such a way that the underlying assumptions of a given set of interdependent market relations remain unchallenged.  Robert McChesney gives an excellent example of this logic in Rich Media, Poor Democracy, claiming that ``it does not make sense for Coca-Cola {\ldots} to spend a fortune merely trashing Pepsi {\ldots} because it only matters to Coke ultimately if people buy Coke, and not that they not buy Pepsi'' (263).  Neither corporation wants to legitimize the third, unstated option, that it might be better not to drink carbonated beverages at all, because doing so would undermine the market sector Coca-Cola and Pepsi have so effectively cornered.  The infamous ``Pepsi challenge,'' in which blindfolded contestants were asked whether they preferred carbonated beverage A or B, was not an attempt to claim Pepsi's supremacy over Coke so much as a means of establishing the two soft drink giants as the only two legitimate market options in the cola wars.  The same logic holds for the media oligopolies.

 

Understanding the workings of oligopolistic logic is of crucial importance in any debate on the influence of corporate media on televisual culture (and televisual culture on subject formation) after the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, because media corporations active in markets that function according to its dictates are the determinative agents in the process of individuation in a televisual culture.  In the case of the cola wars, this logic works by limiting the participants in the Pepsi challenge to those corporations that have already established themselves in the soft drink sector.  By limiting the number of viable options, these corporations circumscribe the realm of possible choices, consequently limiting the individual consumer's ability to make an individualized decision.  Therefore, when Wallace documents the role televisual culture performs in constituting individuals as corporate subjects, he implicitly indicts corporate media outlets for producing a certain kind of subject, one progressively more uncritical in its responses to an increasingly sophisticated corporate-controlled televisual culture.  In this respect, Wallace's recapitulation of Mark Crispin Miller's analysis of a different Pepsi advertisement that blurs the line between ironic distance and this uncritical response is telling:

 

[A] special Pepsi sound-van pulls up to a packed sweltering beach and the impish young guy in the van activates a lavish PA system and opens up a Pepsi and pours it into a cup next to the microphone.  And the dense glittered sound of much carbonation goes out over the beach's heat-wrinkled air, and heads turn vanward as if pulled with strings as his gulp and refreshed-sounding spirants and gasps are broadcast.  And the final shot reveals that the sound-van is also a concession truck, and the whole beach's pretty population has now collapsed to a clamoring mass around the truck, everybody hopping up and down and pleading to be served first, as the camera's view retreats to an overhead crowd-shot and the slogan is flatly intoned: `Pepsi: the Choice of a New Generation' {\ldots} But need one point out {\ldots} that the final slogan here is tongue-in-cheek?  There's about as much `choice' at work in this commercial as there was in Pavlov's bell-kennel {\ldots} As Miller argues, it's not really choice that the commercial is selling Joe Briefcase on, `but the total negation of choices.  Indeed, the product itself is finally incidental to the pitch.  The ad does not so much as extol Pepsi per se as recommend it by implying that a lot of other people have been fooled into buying it'{\ldots} The commercial invites Joe to `see through' the manipulation the beach's horde is rabidly buying.  The commercial invites a complicity between its own witty irony and veteran viewer Joe's cynical, nobody's fool appreciation of that irony {\ldots} It congratulates Joe Briefcase, in other words, on transcending the very crowd that defines him'' (60-1).

 

Although Wallace and his ``Joe Briefcase'' are aware of this irony, their presumed transcendently ironic perspective does not mitigate the effect of this association with the advertising agency's perspective on the individual's ability to generate individualized responses to the commercial.  In this example, corporate advertising still abets the formation of an individualized subject (albeit through the appropriation of postmodern irony) by preempting the subject's critical intuitions, thereby preventing them from forming an individualized response to the commercial.  The composite effect of thousands of hours of having their critical intuitions preemptively replaced with a corporate agenda results in an ``individualized'' subject that is little more than a corporate construct, a fact even the dimmest of Wallace's Joe Briefcases must be aware of at some level.  The society-wide internalization of corporate agendas results in the creation of a homogenous consumer culture, one in which certain decisions (``I will drink cola'') become givens, replaced by other, more profitable ones (``Will I drink Coke or Pepsi?'').  This entire process, from corporate conglomeration to the transformation of the individual into a corporate subject, demonstrates the detrimental effects of a profit-driven corporate media culture on the televisual culture it spawns.  A corporate media culture will necessarily attempt to limit Joe Briefcase's ability to make informed choices by limiting the number of products and services it informs him about to those with the greatest profit potential.  If the same corporations oligopolistically control all of the major media outlets, and if those media outlets determine the objects consumers will demand by limiting access to information about alternatives, then individual choice is problematic at best and conceptually obsolete at worst. 

 

In the years since Wallace wrote ``E Unibus Pluram,'' the content of commercials indicates that advertising firms believe the average American consumer has awoken to the overdetermined nature of their ability to ``choose.''  Advertising firms have responded to this problem by employing a self-consciously unironic post-postmodern irony that extols authenticity as the highest of virtues.  (Of course, this self-consciously unironic post-postmodern ironic turn is itself ironic, albeit melodramatically and unironically so, by virtue of its self-consciousness.)  Thomas Franks identifies this shift in ``Blasters of Deceit,'' averring that the advertising industry ``cause[s] our tubes to abound with visions of reprehensible fakeness, of the manipulative manufacture of images, and, conversely, of products that stand outside the evil adman's repertoire of deceit'' (19).  This technique allows the individual consumer to identify with the self-consciously unironic corporate agenda, and ``choose'' whether s/he wants to participate in its furtherance, thus creating a self-consciously ironic nostalgia for ``authentic'' products.  The viewer knows the pitch depends on his awareness of the inauthenticity of the advertisement's presentation of the product, but because s/he knows s/he is supposed to know this, the association with the corporate perspective and the internalization of the corporate agenda continues to plague the televisual culture even after the demise of postmodern irony as an advertising tool.  As this cursory examination of the appropriation of postmodern and post-postmodern irony by the contemporary corporate media culture demonstrates, no corporate media culture can stomach the existence of critical faculties it cannot control.  If it cannot overdetermine responses to its broadcasts, it cannot accurately predict the purchasing habits of the individuals inhabiting its televisual culture.  But as the televisual culture becomes increasingly aware of the manipulations perpetrated by corporate media, it becomes more profitable to re-empower the individual, or, more specifically, to empower an easily manipulated apparition of the empowered individual.  Corporate media must, as footnote 164 indicates, appeal to ``the American ideology committed to the appearance of freedom,'' a concept that is ``almost unanalyzably compelling'' (1031, emphasis in the original). 

 

Before continuing to analyze the role of this ``American ideology'' in Infinite Jest, a more comprehensive knowledge of the novel's macro-political climate is necessary.  The majority of Infinite Jest occurs in what would be 2008 were it not for the subsidization of calendar years, but which is known in the novel as the Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment.  The chief narratives revolve around Hal Incandenza and Don Gately.  Hal is a lexical and tennis prodigy whose father, James Orin Incandenza, was also a tennis prodigy, as well as the founder of the Enfield Tennis Academy and the auteur responsible for the lethally entertaining film Infinite Jest, the dissemination of which augurs the end of civil society.  Gately, a former burglar and drug addict, works at the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House [sic], located at the bottom of the hill the Enfield Tennis Academy sits atop.  Hal and Gately's narratives only intersect in the text itself in a series of unexplained, and quite possibly unexplainable, dream/hallucination sequences.  The macro-political crisis created by the conglomeration of corporate media, the monopolization of technological innovations, and James O. Incandenza's lethally entertaining film connects their narratives on a societal level.  The following cursory examination of the events that precipitated this crisis will help clarify the trajectory of this argument.  An ad campaign created by Viney and Veals advertising for NoCoat tongue scrapers causes the demise of the Big Four networks and a preoccupation with hygiene among the general population.  P. Tom Veals (of Viney and Veals) then orchestrates the political campaign of the hygienically obsessive-compulsive former Vegas singer Johnny Gentle, who runs on the Clean U.S. Party (C.U.S.P.) platform, exploiting the hygiene-consciousness Veals' NoCoat ads created earlier.  After reaching office, Gentle (possibly under the malevolent influence of one Rodney Tine, Sr.) transforms much of New England into a nuclear waste dump and forces Canada, one of the U.S.'s ``interdependent'' partners in the Organization of North America Nations (O.N.A.N.), to annex the dump, thereby ridding the U.S. of the toxic waste.  (To pay for the relocation of the American citizens living in this annexed land, Veals encourages Gentle to sell the rights to name the year to different corporate sponsors, hence, the Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment.)  Because the annexed land is situated immediately next to the insurgent Canadian province of Quebec, many Quebecois nationalists begin to suffer from radiation exposure, and some of them, most notably Remy Marathe and the Wheelchair Assassins, plan to vent their frustration on the U.S. by disseminating the lethally entertaining film Infinite Jest over the InterLace TelEntertainment networks.  (I should note that the actual motivations for this action are far more complex and conspiratorial in the novel, but for the purposes of this short summation, these motivations will suffice.)  Thus, the responsibility for the crisis falls squarely on the shoulders of P. Tom Veals and his efforts in responding to the needs of the media conglomerates, one of which is the need to remain profitable, effected through the creation of the ``appearance of freedom.''

 

In Infinite Jest, the media conglomerates appeal to this American ideology by ``[m]ounting an aggressive hearts-and-minds campaign that derided the `passivity' of hundreds of millions of viewers forced to choose nightly between only four statistically pussified Network broadcasters'' by ``extol[ing] the `empoweringly American choice' of 500-plus esoteric cable options {\ldots} [and] attacking the Four [Networks: NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox] right at the ideological root, the psychic matrix where viewers had been conditioned {\ldots} by the Big Four Networks and their advertisers {\ldots} to associate the Freedom to Choose and the Right to Be Entertained with all that was U.S. and true'' (412).  The American Council of Disseminators of Cable, which hired Viney and Veals' advertising firm to manage this campaign, never wanted to empower individuals to choose, but Viney and Veals' campaign appealed to the ``Freedom to Choose,'' which the corporate media obviously wants associated with ``the Right to Be Entertained.''  However, A.C.D.C.'s definition of ``empowerment'' is as limited as the choices it wants individual consumers to make.  Five hundred options appear reasonably bountiful, but it suffers from the same programming limitations as the networks, only to a lesser degree.  Viney and Veals' campaign weakens the Big Four without destroying them, presumably so the members of the A.C.D.C. can swoop in and purchase the networks' back catalogs and production facilities, meaning that the empoweringly high number of choices offered by the cable systems would be comprised entirely of the same unempoweringly low number of choices offered by the Big Four.  Individuals would be no more empowered by cable than by the networks, but Viney and Veals' campaign convincingly claimed otherwise.  Viney and Veals effectively created the ``appearance of freedom,'' the ``Freedom to Choose.''  However much this assault on the Big Four hastened their demise, it failed to land the coup de grace.

 

Only after Viney and Veals evinced a devastating disregard for the ``total effect'' of a broadcast would that occur.  ``V&V, like most U.S. ad agencies, greedily buttered its bread on every conceivable side when it could, and started taking advantage of the plummeting Big Four advertising rates to launch effective Network-ad campaigns for products and services that wouldn't previously had have been able to afford national image proliferation'' (412).  They attempted to salvage the Big Four's ratings by creating a series of commercials that forsook postmodern and post-postmodern irony, deciding instead to return to the old-fashioned, unironic hard sell.  As an advertising tool, postmodern and post-postmodern irony focus on the necessity of belonging to a target audience (albeit one composed entirely of ``individuals'') more than the product's role in maintaining or supplementing some imaginary baseline contentment level.  Viney and Veals ads for Nunhagen Aspirin, LipoVac Unltd., and NoCoat Inc. employed the tried-and-true technique of creating demand by inducing feelings of sheer, abject horror that ``shook viewers to the existential core'' (414).  For example, the ad for Fond du Lac's NoCoat tongue scraper was ``[s]tylistically reminiscent of those murderous mouthwash, deodorant, and dandruff-shampoo scenarios that had an antihero's chance encounter with a gorgeous desire-object ending in repulsion and shame because of an easily correctable hygiene deficiency'' (413).  The degree to which Viney and Veals depicted this ``easily correctable hygiene deficiency'' differentiated these ads from their stylistic predecessors, as the narrator notes: ``the NoCoats' spots chilling emotional force could be located in the exaggerated hideousness of the near-geologic layer of gray-white material coating the tongue of the otherwise handsome pedestrian who accepts a gorgeous meter maid's coquettish invitation to have a bit of a lick of [an] ice cream cone'' (414).  Instead of appealing to the viewer's misguided belief in their individuality, the NoCoat ads directly did ``what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase'' (414).  The profits for NoCoat Inc. skyrocketed, because the ads tapped into the anxiety of an already hygiene-conscious culture by expanding the definition of cleanliness to include the tongue's coating.  An individual could ``freely'' choose not to use a NoCoat tongue scraper, but only at the cost of being considered unhygienic.  But the effectiveness of these spots backfired on the networks, because they neglected to consider their ``total effect'' on the viewer.

 

The degree of hideousness involved in inducing hygiene-based anxiety in the NoCoat ad was so great that viewers refused to watch the commercials (even though they purchased the tongue scrapers), causing the ratings of the broadcasts during which they aired to plummet.  By neglecting to consider the effect of the NoCoat ads on the ``total effect'' of the broadcast, Viney and Veals' ads damaged the structural integrity of whatever media fare they were packaged with.  The contrast between the ads and the programs could not be reconciled or reconstituted into a single message.  Viewers could choose to watch the programs and ignore the commercials, but most chose to avoid the networks altogether, because of the disgust engendered by the NoCoat spots.  Without viewers, the networks began to rely solely on increasing the advertising fees they charged NoCoat et al, until finally the ratings became too low to justify increasing the advertising fees, and the networks went under.  At this point, Noreen Lace-Forche, along with the remaining executives and production facilities of the Big Four teamed with P. Tom Veals (whose partner, Tobin Viney, committed suicide when the Big Four went down) to form InterLace TelEntertainment, a multi-platform, truly interactive technology that could be delivered through phone or coaxial cable lines.  For the population, this meant near-universal access to the entertainment medium, thereby evading one of the problems plaguing the cable companies.  InterLace TelEntertainment orchestrated an ad campaign attacking the passivity of cable television watching, claiming that ``[t]he cable kabal's promise of `empowerment' {\ldots} was still just an invitation to choose which of the 504 visual spoon-feedings [the viewer would] sit there and open wide for,'' whereas InterLace technology allowed the viewer to ``become her/his own programming director [and] define the very entertainment-happiness it was her/his right to pursue'' (416, 414).  According to this campaign, organized, like A.C.D.C.'s, by P. Tom Veals, cable impinges the viewer's right to pursue happiness (as guaranteed by the Declaration of Independence) by not allowing them to define the substance that will bring them ``entertainment-happiness.''  Veals conflates the two ``rights,'' eliding the distinction between the political and the televisual spheres, and in doing so adversely effects the individual's awareness of themselves as citizens.  Individuals begin to believe they have a positive claim right to be entertained, despite the fact that they lack positive claim rights to healthcare, housing, food, etc.  The ramifications of cable's demise on the ability of the individual to establish their identity in response to media culture are devastating.  With the rise of InterLace TelEntertainment as the sole distributor of media broadcasts, the televisual culture constructed as a response to those broadcasts necessarily becomes increasingly homogeneous.  Individuals could choose to watch any programming, but if the Big Four's news departments merged into a single entity, then the information individuals could gather from it would be severely limited.  However, in one respect, InterLace TelEntertainment did appear to have a positive impact on society.

 

As envisioned by InterLace, individual choice included the choice to never view a program-interrupting commercial again.   Content producers concentrated on creating more pleasing (commercial-free) programs, because profits came directly from downloading revenues and ``[t]he more pleasing a cartridge was, the more orders there were for it from viewers'' (417).  Viewers could purchase a program whenever they wanted and download it onto an InterLace cartridge; because computers (or ``teleputers,'' as the new hybrid device would come to be called) were powerful enough to edit out commercials, eventually the cartridge producers decided not to include them, the logic being that more people would pay to download an entertainment program that did not have commercials. 

 

Despite the fact that independent commercials disappeared from broadcasts, advertising still existed in the form of product placement.  For this reason, the higher ranked players at the Enfield Tennis Academy (like Hal Incandenza) were sought after from the time they arrived: the potential financial windfall for Wilson and Dunlop in terms of advertising outweigh the losses incurred by distributing gear gratis.  Commercials were integrated into the programs themselves, as opposed to the viewer having to integrate them into the ``total field'' of the broadcast.  Integrated commercials pose a serious problem for individuals: if they are integrated into sitcoms and hour-long dramas in the form of product placement, the individual can at least identify with a given target audience (``I want to look like Joey from Friends'').  However, if they are integrated into news sources in the form of ``objectively'' reported ``stories,'' the individual cannot identify the conflicts of interest, and understands the news story to be a news story, worthy of more consideration than a commercial.  This severely limits the citizenry's ability to become informed about the economic and political arenas, because the same corporation that distributes these ``stories'' (InterLace) also places high-ranking executives (P. Tom Veals) in high-level cabinet-like positions. 

 

InterLace's technological innovation allowed it to corner the market, then aggressively maintain control of that market.  But because the welfare of the market, not the citizenry (which was unable to become informed as to the changes occurring around it) drove these innovations, their effect on the citizenry was not considered during or after their implementation.  Benjamin Barber discusses corporate short/blind-sightedness as regards the effect of technological innovation on a televisual culture in an essay entitled ``Three Scenarios for the Future of Technology and Strong Democracy.''  The scenario Barber identifies that is similar to the one Wallace depicts in Infinite Jest is the ``the Pangloss Scenario.''  Advocated by pop-futurologists whose ``view of the future is always relentlessly upbeat and ahistorical [and who are] mindlessly na{\"\i}ve about power and corruption as conditioners of all human politics,'' the Pangloss Scenario involves the implementation of new technologies without ``either having consciously to plan to utilize technology to improve our lives, or having to worry about the insidious consequences of such usage [and] can rely on market forces to realize the perfect technological society.  The invisible hand governs this scenario, carrying with it the presumption that market incentives such as profitability and consumer interest will take technology in socially useful directions without planning of any kind.''  The social consequences of technological innovation in Infinite Jest are, beyond question, negative.  Because InterLace TelEntertainment controls all the distribution networks, they control, albeit passively, the programs that are viewed.  Even if any kind of program can be produced, only a certain number of them can ever be seen.  How viewers gain access to the nearly infinite number of programs available for download becomes the central issue.  Presumably, indexes of available programs exist, but who or what generates those indexes?  Just as portals limit access to the nearly infinite number of sites on the world wide web by selectively choosing what sites will be directly linked from them, indexes of available entertainment would limit the ability of individual viewers to access media programs.  Savvy viewers could find subversive information (just as savvy internet users can), but the majority of viewers would find the large number of programs listed in these indexes overwhelming enough, and choose exclusively from these indexes.  And it goes without saying that the creators of these indexes are not working with value-neutral criteria. 

 

The novel's chief examples of the political problems non-value-neutral and oligopolistically controlled corporate media outlets pose for the televisual societies they engender are the presidencies of Rush Limbaugh and Johnny Gentle.  Although the administration is only mentioned in an aside, some assumptions about the role of media networks in the political arena prior to the rise of InterLace TelEntertainment can be made based on the successful presidential campaign of Rush Limbaugh.  Limbaugh concentrated on traditional media (radio and publishing) to create an audience.  Presumably, Limbaugh's audience's demand for someone like Limbaugh in the White House resulted from Limbaugh's constantly claiming the need for someone like Limbaugh in the White House on his radio program.  The role of talk radio in Infinite Jest cannot be underestimated, because the Joelle Van Dyne, known on-air as Madame Psychosis, was also the performer in James Orin Incandenza's lethally entertaining Infinite Jest, and the subject of intense interest as the novel closes because of her involvement with the film.  The importance of the medium of radio as a technology in the novel points to the incredible significance the teleputer must have had on the political atmosphere.  In Understanding Media, McLuhan distinguishes between ``hot'' and ``cool'' media: ``A hot medium is one that extends {\ldots} in `high definition.'  High definition is the state of being well filled with data [whereas in] a cool medium of low definition {\ldots} little [information] is given and much has to be filled in by the listener'' (22-3).  Even though McLuhan specifically identifies radio as being a hot medium, the terms ``hot'' and ``cool'' are relative, and when compared to the teleputer, radio is a cool medium, because ``[a]ny hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one''  (23).  As outlined above, with the advent of the teleputer, InterLace TelEntertainment created an incredibly participatory -- i.e. cool -- medium.  At least, this is the scenario InterLace and Veals want its millions of clients to believe.  In fact, as I demonstrated above, the essential mandate of the InterLace empire is the creation the ``appearance of freedom,'' not actual choice.  Veals' campaigns appear to ``give the customer what they want,'' when in fact Veals created an anxiety that could be relieved by purchasing a product or a politician.  Teleputing, as a medium, is not ``cool,'' nowhere near as ``cool'' as radio, which in the waning years of the 20th century was still participatory enough to motivate a majority of the population to elect Limbaugh into office. 

 

Significantly then, P. Tom Veals' entrance into the political arena occurs after the establishment of InterLace's technology-based media monopoly.  According to the text, when the cable's fiscal bottom fell out and commercial advertising became obsolete, P. Tom Veals' agency did not resort to taking on product placement accounts because it performed so well in more marginal media markets.  This allowed Veals to consent ``to manage PR for the fringe candidacy of a former crooner and schmaltz-mogul who went around swinging a mike and ranting about literally clean streets and creatively refocused blame and rocketing people's waste into the forgiving chill of infinite space'' (418).  Veals' role in the establishment of this monopoly, as demonstrated by the previous analysis, cannot be underestimated, but at the same time, it cannot be associated with any kind of paranoid structure of knowledge.  Despite the fact that Viney and Veals' advertising agency is responsible for the cable companies rise to power and the Big Four's fall from grace, and that Veals himself is personally responsible for the resurrection of the Big Four under the InterLace aegis and the victorious campaign of Johnny Gentle, Famous Crooner, the narrative does not configure itself around Veals' individual agency.  The conspiratorial narrative that could materialize never does, and if anything, Veals resembles the bureaucratic hero Hal Incandenza identifies, in an essay for submitted in ``Introduction to Entertainment Studies,'' as someone ``with a genius for navigating cluttered fields {\ldots} a virtuoso of triage and compromise and administration'' (141).  Veals creates suitable short-term responses to the exigencies of a given  situation, but these responses by no means add up to a coherent, long-term strategy.  Thus, when the narrative informs the reader that the ``[w]hole new millennial era, under Gentle and Lace-Forche'' is one of ``[t]otal freedom, privacy, [and] choice,'' the fact that Veals himself escapes mention is not surprising when one considers that his role is that of a facilitator, not a visionary (620).  Through advertising, Veals facilitates the dissemination of other people's visions.  But because of Veals' role in the creation of this ``new millennium,'' the narrative's claim that ``[t]otal freedom, privacy, [and] choice'' function as its philosophical foundations is questionable, as the following examination of the role of media in the creation of charismatic figures will demonstrate.

 

Not mentioned in the narrative of Johnny Gentle, Famous Crooner's campaign  (as recounted in Mario Incandenza's reconceptualization of his father's film The ONANtiad) is Veals' role in making it successful.  From Hal's report on the creation of InterLace TelEntertainment (which is interspersed with the viewing of Mario's film, and is the source of the majority of the information recounted above), one can infer that Veals ``consented to manage PR for the fringe candidacy'' of Johnny Gentle prior to events depicted in Mario's film.  This is important because Gentle is the ``founding standard-bearer of the seminal new `Clean U.S. Party,'' whose politics extend from his obsessive-compulsive, ``paralyzing fear of free-floating contamination'' (381-2).  For the two decades prior to his candidacy, Gentle had been ``known unkindly as the `Cleanest Man in Entertainment,''' so the rehabilitation of his image played a central role in the success of his campaign.  Viney and Veals' NoCoat advertising campaign worked by exploiting ``vulnerable psyche of an increasingly hygiene-conscious U.S.A.,'' and the political campaign Veals orchestrated for Johnny Gentle built on that by exploiting that already exploited hygiene-conscious population even further (414).  Since ``there was no real Foreign Menace of any real unified potency to hate and fear {\ldots} the U.S. sort of turned on itself and its own {\ldots} hideous redolent wastes with a spasm of panicked rage,'' propelling Gentle into office (382).  Veals created a hyper-awareness of hygienic practices while working for NoCoat, then exploited that same consciousness to win Gentle the presidency, but this tactic would not have worked were it not for Gentle's charm and charisma.  An obvious spoof of Reagan's ascendancy to the White House, Gentle's campaign ostensibly mimics the typical rise of the charismatic leader, as defined by Max Weber in Economy and Society, in which a magnetic leader, gifted by grace, irrationally compels a population to follow his lead, regardless of the destination.  According to Weber, after the establishment of this irrational seat of power, the authority of the charismatic leader becomes routinized, as the bureaucratic organization it had temporarily replaced reasserts itself so that the routine, everyday needs of the administration can be met.  However, Weber's theory of charismatic authority fails to account for the mechanism that delivers the charismatic leader to the population, corporate media.  Access to the corporate media is essential to establishing a charismatic figure's prominence, and this is perhaps the essential element Veals brings to Gentle's campaign.  He undoubtedly created a social and political environment in which Gentle's C.U.S.P. platform would work, but more importantly, his direct ties to the InterLace TelEntertainment brass was an indispensable tool in acquiring the air-time necessary to rehabilitate Gentle's image.  Despite the fact that this is never explicitly stated, it can certainly be inferred, given Veals relationship with the Big Four and Lace-Forche. 

 

It is here, in the figure of P. Tom Veals as political adjunct, that the corporate media's influence on the general population in Infinite Jest becomes most apparent.  Through the power of pre-InterLace advertising, Veals created an environment Gentle could exploit for political gain; and through the power of corporate media monopolies, Veals could have exclusive access to the means of disseminating information.  As McChesney notes in an article in the Boston Review, ``media perform essential political, social, economic, and cultural functions in modern democracies. In such societies, media are the principal source of political information and access to public debate, and the key to an informed, participating, self-governing citizenry. Democracy requires a media system that provides people with a wide range of opinion and analysis and debate on important issues, reflects the diversity of citizens, and promotes public accountability of the powers-that-be and the powers-that-want-to-be. In short, the media in a democracy must foster deliberation and diversity, and ensure accountability.''  The logic of McChesney's argument underpins subsequent macro-political events in the novel.  Controlling the media, as Veals does, makes the violent usurping of power unnecessary because, as Howard Zinn states in the introduction to Declarations of Independence, ``[i]f those in charge of our society -- politicians, corporate executives, and owners of the press and television -- can dominate our ideas, they will be secure in their power.  They will not need soldiers patrolling the streets.  We will control ourselves'' (2).  Through Veals' actions, the political situation in Infinite Jest deteriorates into the dystopian nightmare of media critics like Zinn and McChesney.  However, the manipulation of the press for specific political ends is, in both the novel and the world we inhabit, a matter of effectively manipulating emerging communication technologies.  In Infinite Jest, Veals' ability to manipulate the development of InterLace TelEntertainment's technological monopoly to his own (and his clients') advantage is central to the creation of a docile public, one which, in Zinn's words, controls itself.  The importance of the relationship of democracy and technology (as the former cedes control of the populace over to market forces, and the latter limits its evolution to profitable ventures) to the macro-political environment in the novel cannot be underestimated.

 

Whether it be their misinformed belief that they are actively choosing their source of political information (when the corporate media system makes whatever ``freedom'' is involved when choosing between pre-selected options highly suspect) or how they will be entertained, based on either direct manipulation by such figures as Limbaugh or indirect manipulation by advertising a relatively ``hot'' media as teleputing as being ``cool,'' the American population in Infinite Jest has been conditioned to delude themselves into thinking they can choose of their own free will.  But as the eventual rise to power of Johnny Gentle demonstrates, the effect of corporate media on the cultural/social/political milieu in Infinite Jest is decidedly detrimental to the well-being of the country, bringing it to the brink of destruction.  Although other factors are typically listed as being the deciding factors in the eschaton that presumably follows the end of the narrative, I have demonstrated that the central factor in creating the environment in which this eschaton could occur is the corporate media structure and its creators, most notably, P. Tom Veals

            David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest seems at first to be an unproblematic example of postmodern literary fiction. Its language is self-conscious, ironic, and playful. Its narrative is unconventional: the book is an ensemble of many narrative threads that are interrelated but never come together satisfactorily. In fact, there is no resolution to the book at all. It frustrates readers expectations with its exploded maximalist bulk of 1079 pages. And it draws attention to itself as a text with 388 footnotes that disrupt the already choppy narrative flow. Reviews of the book make frequent reference to Pynchon, Gaddis, Delillo, Coover, Bartheleme, and Barthes, all figureheads of postmodern literary fiction. In some interviews Wallace has tried to distinguish his work from other postmodernist fiction, but it is hard to understand the difference in the face of so much similarity. It seems almost superfluous that there is a dissertation devoted to detailing characteristics of Infinite Jest that are postmodern. The author of the dissertation, Toon Theuwis, is aware that Wallace does not fully agree with the classification of Infinite Jest as postmodern, but he dismisses Wallace's attempt at differentiation:

I do not doubt that Wallace's notion of postmodernism differs from the generation of writers before him, but he is still so strongly influenced by that previous generation that digressions into shades of differences would merely foreground a generational gap in postmodernist literature that I think is ultimately irrelevant. (6)

I disagree with Theuwis on this issue. There are important distinctions between Wallace and earlier postmodernists, and this paper is intended to explain why an aesthetic and philosophical generation gap between Wallace and the early postmodernists is a useful concept for understanding Infinite Jest.

            In an interview with Larry McCaffery for the Review of Contemporary Fiction, Wallace stated his reservations about the postmodern genre:

For me, the last few years of the postmodern era have seemed a bit like the way you feel when you're in high school and your parents go on a trip, and you throw a party... For a while it's great, free and freeing, parental authority gone and overthrown, a cat's-away-let's-play Dionysian revel. But then time passes and the party gets louder and louder, and you run out of drugs... and you gradually start wishing your parents would come back and restore some fucking order in your house... the sense I get of my generation of writers and intellectuals or whatever is that it's 3:00 A.M. and the couch has several burn-holes and... we're wishing the revel would end. (McCaffery)

 In Wallace's metaphor, postmodernism is a disorder that was once fun, like a party, but has become too much and is now less fun. The disorder is an expression of postmodern experimentation and subversion of conventional narratives, which was innovative but is now tiresome. Wallace wants to find a way to move past the disorder.

We've seen that you can break any or all of the rules... but we've also seen the toxicity that anarchy for its own sake can yield. It's often useful to dispense with standard formulas, of course, but it's just as valuable and brave to see what can be done within a set of rules... There's something about free play within an ordered and disciplined structure that resonates for readers. And there's something about complete caprice and flux that's deadening. (McCaffery)

In this quotation Wallace asserts that experimentation has its place, but it is a mistake to continue breaking conventions forever. There must be some form for meaning to be coherent, and that form must be to some degree shared, or conventional, for meaning to be communicated. A metaphor from mathematics, which Wallace studied as an undergraduate, is useful here. There are different kinds of infinities. There is the boundless one that continues forever, and then there is the kind of infinity within a boundary or set of limits. For example, there are an infinite number of points within a square. Instead of defying narrative conventions (attempting to create a boundless infinity), Wallace is intent on discovering a good conventional narrative system (finding bounded infinities) that he can work within. And this is what differentiates Wallace from first-generation postmodernists.

            Chris Hager, in his essay ``On Speculation: Infinite Jest and American Fiction After Postmodernism,'' agrees with my understanding of Wallace as a second-generation postmodernist. Hager rephrases the predicament of Wallace's generation of writers in this way: ``to assimilate the work of highly experimental postmodern precedents into more straightforward narratives'' (2). In the case of Infinite Jest, Hager concludes that within the book there is hidden a subtle parabolic plot. He supports his theory by a very detailed inspection of page numbers, double entendres, and other minutia. His attractive theory does give a form to Infinite Jest, even though it is not exactly the straightforward narrative he set out to find. But when Hager asserts the complex structure he makes Wallace the kind of writer he abhors: someone who treats ``mere formal ingenuity as an end in itself. [Also known as] cleveritis -- you know, the dreaded grad-school syndrome of like `Watch me use seventeen different points of view in this scene of a guy eating a Saltine.' The real point of this shit is `Like me because I'm clever''' (McCaffery). Experimentalism, no matter how sophisticated, is always just messing with form, and for Wallace form must have some purpose beyond itself.

            Wallace borrows from the narrative form of Alcoholics Anonymous to create a set of limits or rules that structure meaning in Infinite Jest. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is woven throughout Infinite Jest, and AA aesthetics become dominant in the text. In AA, narrative form is functional; it is always used as a tool for a purpose. Both postmodern and AA narratives are responses to disordered and fragmented subjects of the kind that Wallace describes in his party metaphor. But where postmodern texts respond with fragmented narratives, AA life stories are master narratives that make fragmented subjects coherent. AA members all learn to tell their life stories in a new way that restructures their identity. They provide a shared set of narrative conventions that allow members to understand themselves as alcoholics and as members of the AA group. These shared narrative conventions also eliminate conceptual and stylistic differences between members that might block communication. Formally innovative postmodern texts do the opposite. They invent new conceptual and stylistic blocks that make communication more challenging.

             AA is one of many narrative systems that exist simultaneously in Infinite Jest. In the text, no character can stand alone; each is affiliated with a group that limits and orders the structure of his or her life. In the text, a character remarks, ``we are all dying to give ourselves away to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately -- the object seemed incidental to the will to give oneself away, utterly'' (900). The two main characters, Hal Incandenza and Don Gately, are each fully ensconced in a group that organizes their lives, gives meaning to their lives, and is their lives. Hal is a teenage tennis phenom who rarely gets off the grounds of the Enfield Tennis Academy. His friends are all students there, and his family actually runs the academy. Hal eats, sleeps, and lives tennis; in the same way Gately is completely within the culture of AA. He not only attends meetings daily, he has also stayed on to work as a resident in the recovery house that he recently stayed in as a new AA member. Tennis and AA are the two main groups in Infinite Jest. There are many other more minor characters that belong to groups such as terrorism, television, and therapy.

            The text investigates and inhabits these groups and many more, switching back and forth, looking for new possibilities in the narrative form of each one. At the beginning of the book, the constant switching between the different groups makes the text fragmented in a way that is reminiscent of other postmodern texts. By the end of the book, even though the different groups have not been connected into a coherent whole, the narratives of all of the groups are found wanting. Either they do not provide a coherent structured narrative, or they are organized but arbitrary and meaningless, or they do not allow for communication between peers. Only AA fulfills the requirements of Infinite Jest. By the end of the book AA is the master narrative of Infinite Jest.

 

            The constant switching between so many different groups at the beginning of Infinite Jest creates the kind of fragmented disorganized text that is associated with postmodernism. AA does not get introduced for a long time, and trying to keep up with all of the characters and groups in the first part of the book is a difficult task. What does connect the fragments of the story is a certain sensibility applied to the description of all the different groups. The text is always attending to the way the formal narrative conventions of the group work to structure member's lives. There is a delicate balance to be struck between having enough formal constraints to provide a meaningful structure and having too many constraints so the individual has no freedom at all. The self has to be bounded enough so that the individual is not lost to solipsism, but not so bounded that the self becomes insignificant, just an identityless cog in the narrative system. There must be a goal for the group that is meaningful, not arbitrary. It can't be a merely self-serving goal, but it can't be completely unconnected to the self either. Most importantly, the group must provide a structure for communication between equal members. It is apparent from early in the text that communication is very difficult for characters in Infinite Jest. Many characters are inventive and skilled speakers, but they can't break out of themselves enough to gain intersubjectivity. I will analyze the groups of tennis, terrorism, and television because, just as in the text, the way that other narrative groups are described sets up the sensibilities that will later be applied to AA.

            The rules of tennis, including the boundary lines of the court, are limits on the possibilities of the game. However, just like the square with an infinite amount of points inside it, the limits of tennis allow for an unlimited amount of possibilities within the boundaries. Jim Incandenza, Hal's father, is a tennis and math prodigy who realizes the infinite possibilities of tennis. He thinks that:

beauty and art and magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing chaos to pattern... It was a matter not of reduction at all, but -- perversely -- of expansion, the aleatory flutter of uncontrolled, metatastic growth -- each well shot ball admitting of n possible response, 2n possible response to those responses, and so on into what Incandenza would articulate to anyone who shared both his backgrounds as a Cantorian continuum of infinities of possible move and response, Cantorian and beautiful because infoliating, contained, this diagnate infinity of infinities of choice and execution, mathematically uncontrolled but humanly contained, bounded by the talent and imagination of self and opponent, bent in on itself by the containing boundaries of skill and imagination that brought one player finally down, that kept both from winning, that made it, finally, a game, these boundaries of self. (82)

It is common to think of tennis as a chaotic game that can be ordered into statistical facts. There are a certain percentage of successful first serves, unforced errors per set, and so on. Jim, however, conceives of tennis as beginning with an ordered system of rules that creates focused but inconceivably complex play that becomes infinite. It may be counterintuitive, but tennis boundaries create possibilities rather than limit them. If the net and lines were not there, no game could take place. Schitt, a tennis coach who works with Jim, says ``without [the boundary lines of the court] there is something bigger. Nothing to contain and give the meaning. Verstiegenheit'' (83). The boundaries of tennis are like the form of fiction; they create possibilities by limiting.

             Form is not enough by itself, however. Tennis is structured well, but the goal that anchors tennis, winning, is arbitrary. Hal Incandenza is very motivated to earn approval by succeeding, but tennis is not enough to give meaning to his life. Hal has recurring nightmares where he has to play upon an infinitely complex court. This nightmare vision is the flipside to his father's understanding of tennis. ``There are lines going every which way, and they run oblique or meet and form relationships and boxes and rivers and tributaries and systems inside systems'' (67). Where Jim sees beauty in the infinite possibilities of tennis, Hal sees only meaningless complexity.

            Another very controlled and organized narrative system in Infinite Jest is terrorism, but terrorist groups work by diminishing each individual self too much. The two main terrorists are Marathe, an agent of the Canadian insurgents Les Assassins des Fauteuiles Rollents, and Steeply, an agent of the U.S.O.U.S. Both agencies are equally grotesque. Les Assassins has an initiation rite in which members have their legs severed by the wheels of a rushing train, and the U.S.O.U.S. always puts its agents through undercover operations that involve complete humiliation as well as physical mutilation. These physical privations illustrate how the self is always sacrificed for even the smallest needs of the group. The self is limited and given meaning by the group, but it is so excessive that the self becomes completely unimportant. And like winning in tennis, the goals of terrorism -- the political border wars carried out through violence -- never seem like a worthwhile cause in Infinite Jest.

            One function of the terrorists in Infinite Jest is that they are so authoritarian in their domination of the individual self that the importance of the group in AA is mild by comparison. The exaggerated terrorists are a kind of upper bound of highly structured narrative. And even though Marathe is a member of an over-authoritarian organization, his critique of other American groups is astute. Marathe describes an American crisis of faith. It is a succinct explanation of what is being faced by all the characters in the book: they have too much unstructured freedom.

Someone sometime let you forget how to choose, and what. Someone let your peoples forget it was the only thing of importance, choosing... Someone taught you that temples are for fanatics only and took away the temples and promised there was no need for temples. And now there is no shelter. And no map for finding the shelter of the temple. And you all stumble in the dark, this confusion of permissions. The without-end pursuit of a happiness of which someone let you forget the old things which made happiness possible. (319-320)

In this description, Americans have nothing to believe in, have nothing to organize their lives, because they are living in a society without limits. In the confusion of permissions Americans belong to groups that are either meaningless, or do not have well-defined and useful limits, or do not allow communication. This is the lower bound of completely unstructured narrative, and it is a description of postmodernism. These two bounds call for an intermediate narrative system, like AA, where the self is neither completely bound nor completely unbound.

            Television is a good example of the confusion of permissions that Marathe describes. In Infinite Jest television limitlessly provides spectators with choices. Just as cable television moved beyond the limited choices of broadcast television, InterLace TelEntertainment replaces cable. The InterLace ad campaign is based on providing more choices.

The cable kabal's promise of `empowerment,' the campaign argued, was still just the invitation to choose which of the 504 visual spoon feedings you'd sit and open wide for...And so but what if, their campaigns appeal basically ran, instead of choosing the least of 504 infantile evils... what if a viewer could more or less 100% choose what's on at any given time? (416)

Interlace allows the viewer to download or buy each entertainment separately, so that anything that has ever been filmed is available at all times. The ad campaign is based on ``appeals to an American ideology committed to the appearance of freedom'' (1031). The freedom offered by television is apparent rather than actual because even though the offerings of InterLace are unlimited, the only possibility that television really offers the viewer is spectatorship. Television has no formal narrative boundaries except the immediate wishes of a viewer. And in Infinite Jest, without boundaries there is no way to create meaningful possibilities.

            In addition to being a limitless (and therefore uncontained and meaningless) medium, television does not allow for people to communicate. Virtual reality is available but not popular as a form of entertainment, in part because it has a tendency to make viewer's eyes bleed, but also because virtual reality involves an interactive relationship that is less attractive than spectatorship. Television is a one-way medium that allows people to watch without worrying about being watched. One character sums up her attraction to television as ``entertainment is blind'' (237). Television viewers are soothed by the fact that the television, and the actors on the television, can't stare back.

            Not only does television replace interaction, the experience of being a part of a larger group, even if the group is doing nothing but watching, has become a rarity. The technology of television has come so far in the world of Infinite Jest that people stay home instead of going to movie theaters or live events. The resulting isolation makes people wish to be part of a crowd, ``Hence the new millennium's passion for standing live witness to things. A whole sub-rosa schedule of public spectation opportunities, `spect-ops,' the priceless chance to be part of a live crowd, watching. (620)'' Instances of crowds gathering are infrequent, however. For the most part, entertainment has managed to separate people, make them into passive, individual spectators with no chance for interpersonal communication.

 

            Although every group discussed so far is in itself a highly ordered system, the inclusion of all of them (and others too) in Infinite Jest creates chaos, especially with the way that the text cuts back and forth among them. The chaos of the first part of Infinite Jest is somewhat like the present state of literature: the great critical theories have all been debunked and everything is permitted. The idea that there could be a single set of criteria for judging fiction has fallen apart and instead a plurality of non-unified theoretical systems exist simultaneously. Chaos is also the way that AA members conceive of active alcoholism.

             The text of Infinite Jest starts out incoherent, characters appear without introduction, and the different groups all exist simultaneously, with no single narrative system in control of the text. Even though AA is not introduced until page 137, by the end of the book it has grown to control more of the narrative than all of the other groups combined. For one thing, AA characters and AA scenes, though not the focus of the early sections of the book, become more and more prevalent, and AA aesthetics come to dominate the in-text interpretation of the narratives.

            The same thing occurs on the character level. Many characters not associated with AA, such as Hal Incandenza, Joelle van Dyne, and Jim Incandenza, characters who begin as skillful narrators, lose coherence as they reach crises that their narrative abilities can not cope with, and they can no longer synthesize meaning. Don Gately balances their fall by rising with AA. Gately gains enough proficiency to tell his story authoritatively through AA, and takes over the narrative of Infinite Jest.

            Hal Incandenza is a verbal standout in a book where high-speed wit and large vocabulary is the norm, but his skill with words seems to be at least in part a compensation for his stunted emotional ability. In the first chapter, he thinks of his recently acquired inability to communicate as mainly a word problem: ``There are, by the OED IV's count, nineteen nonarchaic synonyms for unresponsive, of which nine are Latinate and four Saxonic'' (17). While it is true that Hal's incoherence is found at the beginning of the text, it is chronologically the end. His incoherence, therefore, is at the end of his development as a character. Hal is a potent example of a narrative system that becomes unable to perform its function of making coherent meaning. Hal has the most language skill of any character in the book. He reads and memorizes the Oxford English Dictionary, he often corrects his friend's grammar, and he outwits the Professional Grief Therapist, among other examples. But he does not have a narrative system that allows him to truly communicate. By the end of Infinite Jest his attempts at communication are misinterpreted as ``'Undescribable.' 'Like an animal.' 'Subanimalistic noises and sounds''' (14).

            As Hal disintegrates, Don Gately gains control. Gately has been off drugs long enough for the initial physical dependence to have subsided. He is now in the process of the more powerful, narrative conversion of AA. His values, language, and understanding of his own life are all being reorganized by AA narrative. So his fear of becoming an active alcoholic is actually incorporated into a new and more abstract fear that the system of AA might break down on him, leaving him lost and meaningless. When Gately gets over his fears and gains faith in AA, he becomes self-assured as a narrator.

            At the start of Infinite Jest, Gately is still unsure of the narrative and language abilities that AA has given him. Gately panics when the AA narrative is questioned by Joelle van Dyne, a new AA member. It is actually a very small detail that she raises, a grammatical concern about an AA cliche.

Her trouble is that `But For the Grace of God' is a subjunctive, a counterfactual, she says, and can make sense only when introducing a conditional clause, like e.g. `But For the Grace of God I would have died on Molly Notkin's bathroom floor,' so that an indicative transposition like `I'm here but But For the Grace of God' is she says, literally senseless, and regardless of whether she hears it or not it's meaningless, and that the foamy enthusiasm with which these folks can say what in fact means nothing at all makes her want to put her head in the Radarange at the thought that Substances have brought her to the sort of pass where this is the sort of language she has to have Blind Faith in. (366)

But for the Grace of God is a meaningful often-repeated phrase in AA regardless of whether it makes grammatical sense. Grammar is an interest of other narrative groups that Joelle has been associated with, such as graduate level film criticism. So the grammatical query is a kind of skirmish between to warring narratives, and it affects Gately deeply: ``and his own heart grips him like an infant rattling the bars of its playpen, and he feels a greasy wave of an old and almost unfamiliar panic, and for a second it seems inevitable that at some point he's going to go back out and get high again'' (366). A baby in a playpen is an image that recurs with Gately in his dreams, in a more complete form of a childhood memory of not being able to get his mother's attention. That he associates this image with a fear of the breakdown of AA's narrative system is apt because a loss of AA for Gately would be a loss of the ability to communicate. Without AA, the limits that organize his story would disappear, and he would be like a baby whose uncontrolled cries are not heard.

            Gately's second big narrative showdown is against a wraith who is the spirit of the late Jim Incandenza, a much more formidable opponent. The wraith of Jim appears in a hospital room where Gately is recovering from gunshot wounds. Gately is handicapped by a tube that is down his throat, making him physically mute. The wraith communicates with Gately by putting thoughts into Gately's head. The wraith explicitly has the power of an author because of this ability. The power to tell a story clearly rests with the wraith of Jim, which is underscored by the description of the process as ``not only creepy but somehow violating, a sort of lexical rape'' (832).

            The wraith tries to elicit pity from Gately by telling Gately his life story, but here Gately begins to gain authority back using the AA narrative system. Gately rejects the wraith's non-AA life story.

Gately's not too agonized and feverish not to recognize gross self-pity when he hears it, wraith or no. As in the slogan `Poor Me, Poor Me, Pour Me a Drink.' With all due respect, pretty hard to believe this wraith could stay sober, if he needed to get sober, with the combination of abstraction and tragically-misunderstood-me attitude he's betraying. (839)

Gately has grown to become an arbiter of narrative, which reverses the dynamic Gately experienced previously with Joelle, who is associated with Jim and his intellectual narrative groups. After a few more protestations in favor of his story, the Jim wraith seemlessly disappears from the scene without even an exit line as the focus shifts completely to Gately's memories of his own life story. It is a key victory for Gately that is built upon in the frequent chapters chronicling his story that occur in the last hundred plus pages.

 

            Anyone only slightly aware of AA -- say, familiar with the phrase ``Hi, my name is Blank, and I'm an alcoholic'' and nothing more -- may associate AA with a more culturallly visible recovery narrative system: therapy. But Infinite Jest emphasizes an essential strangeness of AA to the rest of American culture by demonstrating the differences between AA and therapy. Although AA is based on the sharing of a life narrative, the AA narrative is very different from the therapy narrative. Therapy is an exploration of the self to figure out problems and then fix them. Therapy's focus on the self is at the same level of intensity as television. They may be different in kind -- television tries to fulfill the self while therapy tries to understand it -- but they both serve to inflate the importance of the self. While not going all the way to the self-mutilation of terrorist groups, AA does not inflate the self like television and therapy do. In the AA narrative, all long-term decisions are no longer under the jurisdiction of the self. They are handed over to another entity: a higher power, a personally defined god figure. In addition, alcoholism is not an attribute of the self, like indecisiveness or insanity. Instead it is a disease outside of the auspices of the self. The recovering alcoholic does not, however, shrug all responsibility. He or she just shifts all responsibility to very small units of decision-making. One AA member explains this to Gately when Gately is new in the program.

He told Gately to just imagine he's holding a box of Betty Crocker Cake Mix, which represents Boston AA. The box had directions on the side any eight-year-old could read... It didn't matter one fuckola whether Gately like believed a cake would result, or whether he understood the like fucking baking-chemistry of how a cake would result: if you just followed the motherfucking directions... a cake would result. (469)

Unlike in therapy, in AA belief and understanding are not required. The recovering alcoholic does very short-term physical tasks, like not drinking alcohol at the specific moment, praying (which is at first just kneeling if actual prayer can't be achieved), and attending meetings. This reverses the system of an active alcoholic, where the larger issues are seen to be the domain of the self, but the smaller details are blamed on outside entities or forces. There are multiple differences between the narrative of AA and therapy that result from the groups' different attitudes towards the self.

            The first therapist to appear in the text is the Professional Grief Therapist who treats Hal after Hal's father commits suicide. The therapist isn't helpful to Hal at all because the narrative system of therapy is built on a success-or-failure dichotomy that Hal is already adept at handling. At first Hal is distraught because he can't figure out what is required for success in therapy's narrative system. Hal complains that the Grief Therapist ``was my worst nightmare. Talk about self-consciousness and fear. Here was a top-ranked authority figure and I was failing to supply what he wanted. He made it manifestly clear I wasn't delivering the goods. I'd never failed to deliver the goods before'' (253). In this quotation Hal shows he is unhealthily attached to succeeding, but therapy doesn't help him because the Grief Therapist is equally attached to success. Instead, Hal eventually succeeds in outwitting the therapist's narrative system. Hal figures out that instead of researching books on how to grieve, he has to ``chew through... the section for grief-professionals themselves... How could I know what a professional wanted unless I knew what he was professionally required to want'' (254-255). Hal goes into his next meeting cursing the therapist and working himself into a frenzy while ``subtly inserting certain loaded professional-grief-therapy-terms like validate, process as a transitive verb, and toxic guilt. These were library derived'' (255). This is exactly the type of epiphany that the therapist wants, and Hal fakes it correctly. His ``traumatic grief was professionally pronounced uncovered and countenanced and processed'' (257). Tellingly, the therapist is just as exuberant as Hal. Hal achieves success in therapy just like he does in tennis and academics, but he only plays a narrative game. He does not actually use the therapy's narrative system to restructure himself in a way that would help him grieve his father's loss.

            The AA narrative has no success-or-failure finale. AA members are called recovering -- instead of recovered -- alcoholics, which emphasizes the continual process of AA. If Hal entered the AA he would find himself in an unfamiliar narrative system. There are none of the objective exterior measures of success Hal is accustomed to achieving. Part of the narrative system of AA is that it has no ending. This is a narrative strategy that keeps AA members from thinking about the future and the cumulative sum of all of the temptations and situations that the future holds. Instead, the AA narrative system stops at the eternal present of Recovering. The AA cliche for this is One Day At A Time, but the description of Gately in withdrawl vividly describes it as:

Feeling the edge of every second that went by. Taking it a second at a time. Drawing the time in around him real tight. Withdrawing. Any one second: he remembered: the thought of feeling like he'd be feeling this second for 60 more of these seconds -- he couldn't deal. He could not fucking deal. He had to build a wall around each second just to take it. The whole first two weeks of it are telescoped in his memory down into like one second... An endless Now stretching its gull-wings out on either side of his heartbeat. And he'd never before or since felt so excruciatingly alive. Living in the Present between pulses. (859-860)

This formulation is more extreme than the AA cliche; the second has replaced the day. It strengthens the AA strategy of staying in the moment, but it does something else too. Gately feels more alive than ever before. His focus is on the present instant. By the end of Infinite Jest, Hal has stopped being motivated to succeed, and is paralyzed by the future now that he has given up on an organizing narrative system. ``The familiarity of the Academy took on a crushing cumulative aspect'' (896). Among other images of this accumulation, Hal imagines a pile of all the food he will eat in his lifetime. He is like the addicts discussed elsewhere in the book who leave AA not because of the present moment, but because they imagine their whole future. Hal needs the eternal present aspect of AA narrative when success-or-failure fails him.

            The success-or-failure aspect of therapy necessitates an authority figure to legislate success. In the story of the Grief Therapist, there are two separate sections of scholarship on therapy: one for patients to read, and one for therapists themselves. There is a hierarchy of the two roles, which is a theme continued in detail in the chapter on the psych ward M.D. and clinically depressed Kate Gompert. In the M.D.'s interaction with Kate, the M.D. masks his emotions: ``The doctor's interior state was somewhere between trepidation and excitement, which manifested outwardly as a sort of blandly deep puzzled concern'' (70). The therapist does not express himself because only Kate is supposed to talk about herself. The M.D. instead makes institutionally approved minimal responses: ``The doctor's small nods were designed to appear not as responses but as invitations to continue, what Dretske called Momentumizers'' (72). The limits of therapy strictly govern the M.D.'s words and actions. As a result, the M.D. is overwhelmingly concerned with superficial appearances. He is ``hale and pink-cheeked and poreless, and... almost always smells unusually clean and good'' (68). He takes handwritten notes because he believes laptops give ``a cold impression'' (73). But the M.D.'s detailed awareness of his appearance does not allow for communication. ``Katherine Anne Gompert probably felt that here was another M.D. with zero sense of humor. This was probably because she did not understand the strict methodological limits that dictated how literal he, a doctor, had to be with admits on the psych ward'' (71). The therapist's interior state is so hidden by the form of therapy that Kate doesn't think it exists. The interaction is, like television, one-way; only the patient is up for discussion; the therapist is the spectator: ``Patients on other floors during other rotations had sometimes complained that they sometimes felt like something in a jar he was studying intently through all that glass'' (72). Unfortunately, Kate already suffers from feeling alone, and her interaction with the M.D. can only encourage the feeling since there is no way Kate can break through the glass of the formal hierarchical situation of therapy.

            AA is, by contrast to therapy, based on a non-hierarchal reciprocal relationship. It is the only major narrative system in Infinite Jest without hierarchal relationships. Tennis in Infinite Jest is so highly competitive that the athletes are always aware of their ranking. Terrorism is completely autocratic. Television is a one-way interaction, and even peer groups watching television together don't occur very often in Infinite Jest. AA is refreshingly democratic and peer-based. In AA groups, no individual has power over another individual. There is an almost complete lack of organizational hierarchy. Even the formal conventions of AA are called Suggestions. The Suggestions are never enforced by the actual apparatus of AA: ``they can't kick you out. You're In if you say you're In. Nobody can get kicked out for any reason'' (352).

            The AA narrative system does have power behind it, but the power comes from the outside situation. The suggestions carry a lot of weight because recovering alcoholics are scared that they will succumb to their addiction. One AA member explains the situation: ``compare the totally optional basic suggestion in Boston AA to, say for instance if you're going to jump out of an airplane, they `suggest' you wear a parachute'' (357). The power of AA is ``born not of zealotry or even belief but just of a chilled conviction that you have no faith whatsoever left in yourself'' (351). AA narrative has significant power over its members because it is enforced by the members' fear of their own alcoholism.

            Without any authority figure, and with only the power of the recovering alcoholic's fear of their own addiction, the system of AA is imposed almost completely through the repetition of narratives. AA meetings are a forum for members to meet and tell their story. Slowly, a newcomer learns to reorganize his or her autobiography by internalizing the AA narrative pattern so that it is in line with the examples the newcomer hears. There are also other non-storytelling types of meetings in the real-world AA, but Infinite Jest only includes the storytelling kind, which emphasizes how important the narrative aspect of AA is to Infinite Jest.

            The AA narrative system is homogenized, repetitive, and not innovative. In Infinite Jest, however, the opposite of these traits can be even worse. Dr. Rusk, the staff therapist at the tennis academy, is a personification of therapy at its most intellectual. Her narrative system is not simple or repetitive, it is complex and requires intelligence. Still, it is completely unhelpful. Dr. Rusk is ``regarded by the kids as whatever's just slightly worse than useless'' (437). The reason the kids don't like her is that she retreats into analytical and intellectual scholarship when real people and their emotions are at stake. The one time Dr. Rusk talks to a student in the text, she engages in total psychobabble filled with esoteric therapy terms:

On the level of objects and a protective infantile omnipotence where you experience magical thinking and your thoughts and the behavior of objects' relation to your narcissistic wishes, the counterphobia presents as the delusion of some special agency or control to compensate for some repressed wounded inner trauma having to do with absence of control. (550)

 The student is so lost in this that he thinks counterphobia means fear of linoleum, but Dr. Rusk is stuck in her nonsensical narrative system and unable to explain herself better.             

            I have already shown through the examples of tennis, terrorism, and television the kind of criticisms that Infinite Jest makes of the narrative systems it includes. Therapy is too much like these other systems because it is based on success-failure dichotomy, it has hierarchal relationships, and it is full of over-intellectualized meaningless terms. Therapy is represented negatively because Infinite Jest is an attempt to use narrative systems to talk about very specific problems in the narratives of American culture. Therapy shares too many attributes of its narrative system with other American narratives, so it is not a good narrative form for Infinite Jest to appropriate.

 

            The narrative of AA is well suited to Infinite Jest's situation. I have shown how AA is different from any of the other narrative strategies of Infinite Jest, and how AA comes to dominate the text in Infinite Jest. Now I will discuss how Infinite Jest draws from the form of AA narratives as a way to invent a new literary aesthetic. AA style becomes a new set of criteria for fiction, a counter against the deadening complete caprice and flux that Wallace ascribes to postmodernism. Infinite Jest inculcates its AA-influenced aesthetic by repetition of the AA narrative form, just like actual AA meetings do. There are seven complete AA narratives quoted at length in Infinite Jest, and a few more rendered indirectly. Each AA narrative works as an example of the AA way to tell stories and hear stories. By extension, this becomes the Infinite Jest method of writing and reading literature.

            The non-AA characters in Infinite Jest are truly terrible listeners. Each is solipsistically alone, unable to make interpersonal connections. In Infinite Jest's world phones ``allowed you to presume that the other person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting you not to have to pay anything close to complete attention to her'' (146). A new technology, videophony, is unpopular in part because ``callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest, slightly overintense listeners' expression they had to compose for in-person exchanges'' (146). The word compose hear is key, implying that nobody makes those expressions out of actual sincere communication of interest in another person. The motif of pretending to pay attention reoccurs throughout the book.

            Within AA meetings listening is a skill that is consciously worked on. Gately learns in AA that ``it's hard to really hear'' (365). meaning that although he could listen to the words being said at the meeting, it was difficult for him to acknowledge an actual interpersonal connection between himself and other recovering alcoholics. Then Gately learns the key AA concept of Identifying. Identifying is to realize the basic human similarity between the listener's story and a speaker's story. The opposite of Identifying is Comparing. Comparing is the way listening to stories works outside of the AA narrative system. The listener checks the story the listener hears against the listener's own story for similar events or attitudes as a way to decide if there is a similarity. If the events and attitudes do not match up, the person who Compares rejects the story as different. Gately says of his progress in AA: ``I remember for like the first fifty days or so I couldn't hear shit. I didn't hear nothing. I'd just sit there and Compare, I'd go to myself, like, `I never rolled a car,' `I never bled from the rectum''' (365). The AA narrative overcomes the propensity to Compare because both the speaker and the listener organize their story along the lines of AA narratives, so their stories follow the same narrative arc: ``Identifying, unless you've got a stake in Comparing, isn't very hard to do, here [in AA]. Because if you sit up front and listen hard, all the speakers' stories of decline and fall and surrender are basically alike, and like your own'' (345). Recovering alcoholics can Identify with each other's stories because each story is organized the same way, so that people with different experiences and personalities can all share the same narrative.

            Once Infinite Jest has sufficiently initiated the reader into AA, it challenges the reader to Identify instead of Compare. The first AA story to appear in Infinite Jest is by John L. The story is very generic in its details, and outlines the basic AA form of decline, conversion, and recovering. After John L.'s story there are a few others that impress various points about AA narrative, and habituate the reader to the form of AA narrative. Some of these speakers are negative examples in which the speaker diverges from the AA narrative, and some are positive examples of an orthodox AA narrative that works well. Then, there is the ``meeting's last and maybe best... speaker'' (376). Her story is repugnant. She was a prostitute and freebase addict who smoked cocaine through her pregnancy, even through labor. Her baby is stillborn, but she still keeps the little corpse with her for months until the smell of the corpse (now actually physically stuck to her chest) keeps her from prostituting anymore, and finally the authorities catch up with her and send her to an asylum. This whole story is told with very few references to her interior state and no invocations of pity from the audience. It is mainly a chronicle of events ordered by the AA form. The audience pays this speaker ``the ultimate Boston AA compliment: they have to consciously remember even to blink as they watch her, listening. I.D.ing without effort'' (379). The best stories in AA are the ones that make people lose their own identity and mix with the speaker into a single group identity. The details of the story shouldn't matter as long as the form works. Even though her listeners have never experienced what she has, they feel linked to it. If Infinite Jest has succeeded in recreating AA aesthetics, then the reader will also Identify with the speaker's story, along with the AA audience.

            It should be apparent by now that AA narrative form is not irony. At an AA meeting, the audience is embarrassed for a speaker who tries to use irony.

[The speaker] is dreadfully, transparently unfunny; painfully new put pretending to be at ease, to be an old hand, desperate to amuse and impress them. The guy's got the sort of professional background where he's used to trying to impress gatherings of persons. He's dying to be liked up there. He's performing. The White Flag crowd can see all this. Even the true morons among them see right through the guy. This is not a regular audience. A Boston AA is very sensitive to the presence of ego. When the new guy introduces himself and makes an ironic gesture and says `I'm told I've been given the Gift of Desperation. I'm looking for the exchange window,' it's so clearly unspontaneous, rehearsed... that just a few polite titters resound, and people shift in their seats with a slight but signal discomfort... Speakers who are accustomed to figuring out what an audience wants to hear and then supplying it find out quickly that this particular audience does not want to be supplied with what someone else thinks it wants. (367)

 Irony here is professional not personal, rehearsed not spontaneous, and definitely not sincere. This does not mean that there are no jokes in AA. The ironic speaker's joke doesn't fit because it has only one purpose, to make him look good. But the speaker is painfully new, his life is a wreck. He is not good. So the kind of irony he affects is in a way dishonest, and it is not part of AA narrative form.

            There is a lot of irony Infinite Jest. Irony is the environment of the book, and the habitual form that most of the characters use. Wallace`s style can become, like the ironic speaker above, merely about how it making the author look good. Clair Messud remarked in her review for the Times that ``reading Infinite Jest is not unlike spending a prolonged holiday with a precocious but exasperating adolescent boy.'' Messud is reacting to the overwelmingly impressive style of the book, which she calls adolescent because the style seems like an effusive overcompensation for insecurity. Just as the speaker's joke is primarily about how it is a good joke, Wallace's fiction can be read as being about how it is good fiction, but that does not account for the many passages full of earnest sincerity in Infinite Jest. Nor does it account for Infinite Jest's negative portrayal of the ironic speaker.

            The disputed position of irony in Infinite Jest is part of a larger question about form and communication. Infinite Jest is at the confluence of two narrative systems. Postmodernism is form-conscious and concerned with formal innovation and exploration. AA narrative form is not innovative. AA form attempts to be as unremarkable as possible, so that it does not detract from the listener's attention to Identifying with the story. Infinite Jest is still very innovative in its form, but it retains the idea from AA that narrative should have a purpose beyond itself. AA members go to meetings daily to hear stories that all have roughly the same form. They do this because the stories are all structured for the purpose of allowing Identification. Identification is more than just communication. It is an experience in which the listener forgets him or herself and fuses identity with the speaker. Communication becomes the purpose of good narrative in Infinite Jest, and every formal innovation must have communication as its purpose.

            Some traits of the book associated with postmodernism are actually expressions of AA aesthetics applied to the book. For example, Infinite Jest is a bulky aggregate of innumerable detail, which can be understood in the context of other postmodern magnum opuses. On the other hand, it may have something to do with the way Don Gately habitually takes a front-row seat at AA meetings. He sits ``right up where he could see dentition and pores, with zero obstructions or heads between him and the podium, so the speaker fills his whole vision, which makes it easier to really hear'' (369). The text of Infinite Jest gives the reader all the little teeth and pores that Gately seeks at AA meeting. The book fills the the reader's vision with its level of detail and its interconnected universe of subplots. The reader gets sucked in, which is to say the reader Identifies.

            Infinite Jest lacks resolution, which is another trait it shares with a lot of postmodern literature. But where other postmodern literature has no resolution as a way of subverting conventional narrative, Infinite Jest's type of lack of resolution has more in common with AA's narrative form. I have already explained how AA narratives have, instead of resolution, an eternal present of recovery, because an ending is future oriented, and AA narratives only admit of the most vague possible sense of future. Like Gately in withdrawl, taking it one moment at a time, in Infinite Jest the present moment is always endurable. ``What was undealable-with was the thought of all the instants all lined up and stretching ahead, glittering'' (860). Any reader overly intent on the future, on finishing the book, will be distraught to reach it and find that it does not really exist. But any reader of that sort would probably quit a long time before reaching the end. A New York Times book review said that ``while there are many uninteresting pages in this novel, there are not many uninteresting sentences'' (McInerny). Just like in AA, the reader of Infinite Jest has to be in the moment, otherwise the view of all those sentences, lined up and gleaming, will overwhelm.

            In AA, every member gets to tell his or her story. It's part of the unhierarchical nature of the program. Infinite Jest mimics this by including the back story of an astonishing number of characters. The text emphasizes its aesthetic by making it also a principle in the film work of Jim Incandenza. Anti-figurant is Incandenza's term for his film style of multiple speaking parts. He talks about it as a response to the show Cheers! where bit-actors called figurants would fill the tables of the bar set and mime talking but not actually speak.

[In reaction Jim] goddamn made bloody well sure that either the whole entertainment was silent or else if it wasn't silent that you could bloody well hear every single performer's voice, no matter how far out on the cinematographic or narrative periphery they were; and it wasn't just the self-conscious overlapping dialogue of a poseur like Schwulst or Altman, i.e. it wasn't just the crafted imitation of aural chaos: it was real life's egalitarian babble of figurantless crowds. (835)

 It is significant that the show in which many people are unable to tell their stories is set in a bar, the opposite social arena from AA. In Infinite Jest, like Jim's films, an astonishing amount of characters get their biography inserted somewhere into the text, even if they are quite minor characters. In this way Infinite Jest is like an AA meeting, or a conglomeration of meetings. The fiction is a forum for every story to get told, for every person's life to be organized and made communicable by narrative.

 

            In AA, the purpose of narrative is to allow for Identification, which creates a way of ranking narratives based on how well they allow for identification. When Infinite Jest utilizes AA aesthetics, reinstates a division between good and bad art that contradicts postmodernism.

I'm not saying I'm able to work consistently out of this premise, but it seems like the big distinction between good art and so-so art lies somewhere in the art's heart's purpose, the agenda and the consciousness behind the text. It's got something to do with love. With having the discipline to talk out of a part of yourself that love can instead of the part that just wants to be loved. I know this doesn't sound hip at all. I don't know. But it seems like one of the things that the really great writers do... is `give' the reader something...What's poisonous about the cultural environment today is that it makes this so scary to carry out. Really good work probably comes from a willingness to disclose yourself, open yourself up in spiritual and emotional ways that risk making you really feel something. To be willing to sort of die in order to move the reader, somehow. And the effort to actually do it, not just talk about it, requires a kind of courage that I don't seem to have yet. (McCaffery, 150)

Wanting to be loved is wanting the reader to Compare. It is a hope that the reader will see how well something is written and conclude that the writer is really good. But a writer who writes with love writes to communicate, and wants the reader to Identify with the story. The most interesting part of the quotation is that Wallace says he does not have the courage to really do that yet, only talk about it. It is true that for all of the ways that Infinite Jest incorporates the meaningfulness of AA narratives, Infinite Jest itself is not an AA narrative. And even though Infinite Jest is full of insider information on AA, even though Infinite Jest is wholeheartedly enthusiastic about AA, Infinite Jest still locates its perspective outside AA. The book points out ways that people are not communicating, that systems are meaningless, and that people aren't feeling. Its use of AA narrative is an elegant solution to the problems it raises. But Wallace points to the solution without letting AA solve the problem inside text. He does not write in a fully communicative, meaningful, and emotional way.

             Charles Tavis is a self-reflexive key to Infinite Jest's maximalism, its bulk of 1079 dense pages, which relates to Wallace's self criticism of his own ``courage.'' Tavis, who runs the tennis academy after Jim Incandenza dies, is a maximalist speaker because of ``the pathological openness of his manner, the way he thinks out loud about thinking out loud'' (519). The most succinct example of Tavis' speaking style is that as an adolescent he would hang around ``and lurk creepily on the fringe, listening, but that he'd always say, loudly, in the lull in the group's conversation something like `I'm afraid I'm far too self-conscious and awkward really to join in here, so I'm just going to lurk around creepily at the fringe and listen, if that's all right, just so you know''' (517). Tavis' self-reflexively questions his own motives and humbly denigrates himself so exhaustively that his words become numbing. Tavis acknowledges his own unintelligibility right along with everything else, of course. ``He'd apologize profusely when you had no idea what that sentence meant and say maybe the obfuscation had been unconsciously deliberate, out of some kind of embarrassment [on his part]'' (516).

            This last quotation, out of context, could also read as an apologia for the difficulty of Infinite Jest. Infinite Jest is just as remarkably long and difficult to understand as Tavis' speech. The book provoked, after all, such reviews as ``Infinite Jest billows and sags in ungainly proportion, at least a partial victim of its own ambition'' (Messud) and ``Somewhere in the mess, the reader suspects, are the outlines of a great novel... but it's stuck there, half excavated, unable to break completely free'' (Kakutani). This seems a lot like the ``little razor-to-jugular and hangman's-noose-over-imaginary-cross-beam motions'' (287) that upperclassmen make at Tavis' interminable convocation address.

            Perversely, Tavis' openness is completely unattractive. One character is prompted by the thought of Tavis to say ``that pathological openness is about as seductive as Tourette's syndrome'' (1048). The way Tavis speaks is compared to ``peeling his skull back and exposing his brain to you without any warning or invitation'' (521). Tavis is a disgusting character who shows off the worst aspects of the book. He is a dark mirror where aspects of Infinite Jest's style, such as obsessive self-consciousness and verbal density, are present only as a result of insecurity, but without any noble purpose.

            Tavis is such a maximalist partially because he does not have a set of conventions, like AA narrative, to limit his speech in a structured but inventive way. Equally important is that despite the full verbal disclosure that Charles Tavis always achieves, he is not actually capable of opening up.

Tavis is terribly shy around people and tries to hide it by being very open and expansive and wordy and bluff... Tavis is very open and expansive and wordy, but so clearly uses these qualities as a kind of shield that it betrays a frightened vulnerability almost impossible not to feel for. (517)

 He takes so long to be honest because every attempt to do so raises more attempts to hide that in turn have to be exposed. He has to tell a little girl ``I'm doing my best to cast all this in terms the you you are right now can be comfortable with, Tina. Though I need to tell you I feel uncomfortable adjusting a presentation down or toward anyone in any way, since I'm terribly vain of my reputation for candor'' (521). For Tavis, honesty is an empty form because he can not be honest with himself. He can only state all the possible things he might be feeling, because he doesn't know himself.

He wasn't in it for the Thank-You's, that a person who did a service for somebody's gratitude was more like a 2-D cut out image than a bona fide person, at least that's what he thought, he said what did Hal and Avril and Mario think? was he a genuine 3-D person? Was he perhaps just rationalizing some legitimate hurt? (286)

A simpler character would either mind or not mind doing something without receiving a thank-you, or else mention it. Tavis wonders if he minds, wonders if he should mind, and wonders if his motives for the action that should have been thanked were honest in the first place.

            Infinite Jest's length also arises out of the difficulty of being honest about an inability to be honest. The text criticizes itself throughout in self-castigating meta-commentaries of which Tavis is only one example. The book's title refers to a lethally entertaining film so engrossing that anyone who sees it never pays attention to anything else again. The film is a nightmare version of Identification with television in the place of a story-teller. The film raises the question of whether a big engrossing book like Infinite Jest is wrong for taking people away from their lives. One character becomes so obsessed with the television show M*A*S*H* that he spends the last years of his life withdrawn from his family, scribbling notes about the show that support a deranged theory of apocalyptic prophesies the supposedly encoded in the show. This is a rendering of the referential mania encouraged by Infinite Jest through the many hints of impending apocalypse that are present in the text. Finally, the very structure of the novel is a kind of self-criticism. It elevates a style of narrative (AA) that is not actually its own, which creates the same apologetic situation that Tavis is in. The force of honesty in a book that can not simply state itself honestly causes the text to balloon out of all proportion.

            The first step in the twelve steps of AA is a useful tool for understanding how Infinite Jest invokes the narrative system of AA, makes new aesthetic goals by metaphorically applying AA's system to literature, and then falls short of those very goals, but without being a failure. The first step is to admit that there is a problem. The first step does not require that anything be done about the problem, just that it is admitted. If Infinite Jest is the first step in a progression, then just to realize that the goals are being fallen short of is important. Over a thousand pages is not too long to work out that first step. The book is big enough to create a mark where one generation is pulling away from what has come before, stepping in a different direction from where the momentum of the older generation is headed. Postmodernism exposes rules and conventions, but the ironic exposing of rules and conventions, rather than the rules and conventions themselves, is the environment of literature currently, and to anyone who wants to do something with the structure of narrative besides expose it, the environment is stifling. AA is a set of rules and conventions that empower narrative to achieve some goals not present in postmodernism.

            Where the progression that begins with this first step will really end up is uncertain. Wallace is a young enough writer that the possibilities of what he might do in the future are almost equally as interesting to talk about as what he has done already. His collection of short stories, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, is inconclusive. Many of the stories are about people who are completely self absorbed and cut off from the world, but narrative solutions like AA are not apparent. It may be that Wallace will get the courage to open his writing up completely to the possibility of honest communication through the formal constraints of his choice. It isn't clear right now if that kind of writing would be as interesting as Infinite Jest. His sensibilities and strengths as a writer are well suited to his current predicament: stuck somewhere between the self-conscious, form-conscious writing that is obviously indebted to a postmodern tradition, and a narrative whose purpose is connection and communication.

David Foster Wallace began working on his second novel in the fall of 1991---the outgrowth of an essay he wrote that season called ``Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley''---and by the fall of 1993 had completed a working draft. He made two photocopies of the manuscript, sent one to Michael Pietsch, his editor at Little, Brown, and loaned the second to a young woman whom he was trying to impress at the time (he later told me). Pietsch was enthusiastic about the manuscript but asked Wallace to consider shortening it, so Dave asked me if I'd be willing to read it and suggest cuts. (At that time we were both working in the same town, Normal, Illinois: Dave taught at Illinois State University, and I was managing editor of the Review of Contemporary Fiction/Dalkey Archive Press, located on ISU's campus.) Dave's plan was to compare Pietsch's suggested cuts with mine, and accept the ones on which we both agreed. (He also explained he was planning to add more material, though.) I instantly agreed, jokingly adding the condition that I could keep the manuscript afterward. (I would have read it anyway.) Dave agreed, and on 3 December 1993 he gave me the huge manuscript. I needed both hands to support it.

            Why me? I guess because I'd been an early supporter of his. (What follows sounds uncomfortably like tooting my own horn, so I'll keep it brief.) I had read The Broom of the System when it was published in 1987 and had been very impressed; even if not an entirely successful novel, it struck me as written by someone possessed of genius. A few months later I was invited to guest-edit a special issue of the Review of Contemporary Fiction to be called ``Novelist As Critic.'' It amounted to little more than inviting my favorite novelists to contribute an essay on any literary topic, the working assumption (which I still hold) being that novelists write better criticism than most professional critics. Since all of the authors I invited were well along in their careers, I thought I should have at least one emerging writer, so I wrote to Wallace in care of his publisher and invited him to submit something, an offer he found ``intriguing'' (he had never written an essay for publication before). His ``Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young'' appeared in the fall 1988 issue and confirmed my impression that he was brilliant. (Our typesetter, on the other hand---a wonderful middle-aged woman who had her doubts about much of the stuff we published---thought he sounded snotty.)

            We stayed in touch. I suggested Conjunctions as someplace he might submit future stories (he'd never heard of it). For the summer 1989 issue of RCF, whose staff I had joined by that time, I wrote a favorable review of Girl with Curious Hair, and along about then I invited him to contribute to a special issue we were planning on novelist David Markson. Wallace was going through a difficult period, but he came through with another brilliant essay, ``The Empty Plenum: David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress'' (RCF Summer 1990), which did nothing to alter our typesetter's opinion of him but certainly kept my mine sky-high. In 1992 I informed him of an opening in the English department at ISU, for which he applied and was accepted, and later that year guest-editor Larry McCaffery and I decided he had to be part of the ``Younger Writers Issue'' we were planning for the summer 1993 RCF. For that Wallace submitted what would become his most famous essay, ``E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction'' (which had been rejected by Harper's because of its length) along with several selections of what he had finally decided to call Infinite Jest. (As late as January 1993 he was calling it simply the ``longer thing.'') So perhaps all this support, plus similar tastes in fiction (we both revere William Gaddis, for example), led him to entrust me with his manuscript.

            First, a physical description: It's a mess---a patchwork of different fonts and point sizes, with numerous handwritten corrections/additions on most pages, and paginated in a nesting pattern (e.g., p. 22 is followed by 22A-J before resuming with p. 23, which is followed by 23A-D, etc). Much of it is single-spaced, and what footnotes existed at this stage appear at the bottom of pages. (Most of those in the published book were added later.) Several states of revision are present: some pages are early versions, heavily overwritten with changes, while others are clean final drafts. Throughout there are notes in the margins, reminders to fix something or other, adjustments to chronology (which seems to have given Wallace quite a bit of trouble), even a few drawings and doodles. Merely flipping through the 4-inch-high manuscript would give even a seasoned editor the howling fantods.

            What follows is a description of its contents. I'll cite the manuscript page numbers (hereafter abbreviated MS), and following an = sign will give the equivalent pages in the published version of Infinite Jest (hereafter abbreviated IJ), unless the section was cut, in which case I'll provide a brief summary. (For copyright reasons I'll have to keep my quotations of unpublished material to a minimum.) And I'll add color commentary on points that may be of interest to future scholars.

Title page. Typewritten: ``First Two Sections / Infinite Jest,'' followed by the name and address of Wallace's agent, Bonnie Nadell. (No subtitle; Chris Hager says Wallace wanted to subtitle the novel ``a failed entertainment,'' but that must have been added later, and then rejected by the publisher.) Handwritten are various notes Wallace wrote to himself, e.g., ``Mid-East attach{\'e} in Mexico City. `Good bit of Mexico not answering its phone,''' and what looks like ``DMZ is ultimate phenomenal speed---halluce---believe you have radically sped up, whole world slow, ESP, no speech---Death[.] See Wraith & Gately.'' Other notes concern Mrs. Gately's stroke and the correct spelling of millennium.

A-B. ``Preliminary Throat-Clearings.'' These two pages contain the dedication to Fenton Foster (whom Wallace identified as ``My mother's father, who died before I was born'' in an interview with Valerie Stivers [http://www.stim.com/Stim-x/0596May/Verbal/dfwmain.html]), an epigraph---``Sorrow brings forth'' from Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell---followed by various definitions of addict and addiction. The first is taken from the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, New College Edition, and the rest from Hal's beloved Oxford English Dictionary, including some illustrative quotations. Two of the more relevant ones: ``A man who causes grief to his family by addiction to bad habits'' (Mill, Liberty) and ``Each man to what sports and revels his addiction leads him'' (Shakespeare, Othello 2.2.6). Wallace cut this Moby-Dick-like opening and decided to let Hal summarize his findings: ``The original sense of addiction involved being bound over, dedicated, either legally or spiritually. To devote one's life, plunge in. I had researched this'' (IJ 900).

1-5 = IJ 27-31. The novel originally began with Hal's interview with his father disguised as a ``professional conversationalist.'' This makes thematic sense since Jim Incandenza's failure to communicate with his son leads him to create the Infinite Jest cartridge, but in my report to Wallace I wrote: ``this is wild & funny, but rather too much so; that is, it differs from the rest of the book so much in tone & content that it will give the reader the wrong idea of what kind of novel this is going to be.'' (I suggested he begin instead with what is now IJ 200-11.) The date gave Wallace some trouble: the chapter was originally dated Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken, then changed to Trial-Size Dove Bar before settling on Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad. (Handwritten note: ``Incandenza needs to suicide in Year of Dove Bar.'') Likewise with Hal's age: Wallace originally typed: ``I'll be 14 in December,'' then crossed it out and wrote 13. The first edition of the novel reads ``I'll be thirteen'' (p. 27) but the paperback edition reads ``I'll be eleven.'' (N.B.: Wallace made numerous corrections for the paperback edition of 1997, so that edition is the one scholars should use. Put a Mylar cover on the pretty hardback and leave it on the shelf.) Another interesting change: instead of a crisis in southern Quebec (IJ 29) Wallace originally set the crisis in Sierra Leone.

5A-F = IJ 42-49. The MS. supplies the names of some of Orin's ``Subjects'': instead of ``The Subject after Bain's sister but before the one just before this one'' (IJ 47) Wallace wrote: ``The woman after Helen Slansker and before Binnie van Vleck'' (MS 5D). Leaving them nameless better conveys Orin's attitude toward women. (Orin was originally called Cully.) Test-subject Fenton (IJ 48; note dedicatee above) was originally called Curtis. For Helen Slansker, see 56-56A below.

6-15 = IJ 17-26. Erdedy's dealer ``had promised to get him a fifth of a kilogram of marijuana, 200 grams of unusually good marijuana, for $1250 U.S.'' (IJ 18), metricized and inflated from the MS's ``She had promised to get him a quarter of a pound of marijuana, four ounces of unusually good marijuana, for $550.00'' (MS 6).

15A = IJ 32-33.

16-17 = IJ 37-38. Delores Epps's brother was originally named Rodney, then Londell, before Wallace settled on Columbus Epps (IJ 38).

17A-C = IJ 33-37. Nass, ``the Arabic-language video edition of April's Self magazine'' (IJ 36) was originally an unnamed Arabic edition of Harper's Bazaar. The MS chapter ends ``the viewer's digital display reads 7:20PM'' instead of the book's ``1927h'' (IJ 37). Throughout the MS time is given the old-fashioned way.

18-20 = IJ 39-42. There is no reference to Puccini's Tosca (IJ 41) in the MS version.

20A = IJ 42. Time adjusted from 8:00PM to 2010h.

21 = IJ 38-39. The MS describes Mildred Bonk as ``The kind of dreadful female figure who glides through the sweaty junior-high corridors of a nocturnal emitter's dreamscape.'' Wallace's revision to ``fatally pretty and nubile wraithlike figure'' (IJ 38) anticipates the Joelle van Dyne/Jim Incandenza as wraith/fatal cartridge developments in the novel. The succinct, alliterative summary ``A vision in a sundress and silly shoes'' (IJ 39) replaces the more fanciful MS version: ``A vision. A nymph, you would have described her as. Ninth-grade rumor had it she didn't even go to the bathroom: small forest animals descended with coos and twitters and took the stuff away, inessential as talc, the peristalsand of a creature that lives on light.'' (That p-word means the product of peristalsis, the involuntary contractions that force waste through the alimentary canal.)

21A-B: cut. A brief episode set in the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken describing Avril Incandenza in a post-coital moment with unnamed older lover in the headmaster house's master bedroom in Enfield, before racing to the airport to pick up her ``husband and son.''

21-22 = IJ 130. An early version of the mugging of Burt F. Smith by Poor Tony.

22A-G = IJ 49-54. Jim Struck was originally called Rutherford Poat here and elsewhere in the MS. This is the first point in the MS where footnotes are used (=IJ 983-84, nn. 5-9); a note indicates Wallace intended to include an ONANTA Jr. Tournament Schedule as Appendix X. (The only appendix in the MS is Incandenza's filmography.) The book version of this chapter is much more detailed than the MS, which concludes more abruptly and with an unexpected pronoun: ``It's unclear to me whether or not this is a bad thing.''

22G-1 = IJ 54. Time adjusted from 12:15AM to 0015h.

22H-J: cut. Dated Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, this is a first-person account by Hal of his mother's grammar class, including a sample final exam. (E.g. ``Briefly explain why phrase-structure rules alone are insufficient for the explication of the following clause---`I had three books stolen.''') Several questions have to do with the grammatical structure of ``the opening independent clause of the L. and A. Maude translation of Tolstoi's Anna Karenina---`All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.''' (The wide diversity of unhappy families in IJ could be generated from this classic opening sentence.) There is a reference to the exam on IJ 95. Hal also comments on how Enfield training prepares one to handle ``surreal panic.''

22-23: cut. A young Jim Incandenza tells of a night he accompanied his father to kill a particularly large black widow spider. The episode begins: ``I have one sober memory of my father. . . .''; cf. IJ 157-69, a different memory of Jim's father.

23A-D = IJ 60-63, 67-68. The longer book version dwells more on Troelsch's symptoms, while the MS recounts one of his dreams. The passage on IJ 67-68 is labeled ``HAL SOLIL[OQUY]'' in the MS., which contains an X'ed out earlier version of this passage (MS 23-24).

24-32 = IJ 68-78. Kate's remark ``I was going to say I've thought sometimes before like the feeling maybe had to do with Hope'' (IJ 75) originally detoured into to this comic exchange:

            `I was about to say I've thought before it seems like it maybe has something to do with pot.'

                The doctor's eyebrows became angled with puzzlement before he could stop them. `A pot?'

                `Oh for Christ's sake. Yes, a pot, this piece of cookware my dear sainted mother used to abuse me with.' She saw his pen dip toward her chart. `No, the bloodbath guy, in Cambodia, with the fields. Jesus what am I doing here. Pot. Bob Hope. Smoke.' She made a quick joint-gesture with thumb and finger held to rounded lips.

Kate's reference at the end of the chapter to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest---``That old cartridge, Nichols and the big Indian'' (IJ 78)---originally read ``That old Jack Nicholson movie'' (MS 32). Interesting that Wallace would have Kate misremember the famous actor's name, while making her smart enough to know of the killing fields of Cambodian dictator Pol Pot (1928-98).

32A = IJ 78=79. Time adjusted from 1:00 to 0145h.

32-38 = IJ 79-85. The Nick Bollettieri camp (IJ 79) was originally called a Harry Hopman tennis camp. Next to the physical description of Schtitt (MS 33; IJ 80) Wallace wrote ``vampirish-looking.'' Incandenza's founding Latin motto (IJ 81) was originally LARVARDUS PRODEO---a slip for Larvatus prodeo, ``I advance masked,'' which was the young Descartes' motto. ``Schtitt was educated in pre-Unification Gymnasium under the rather Kanto-Hegelian idea . . .'' (IJ 82) originally read: ``. . . under the classic idea (via Pfau and Wasser's 1936 Spiele und Knaben) . . .'' (MS 35). After the sentence ending ``this flat and short-sighted idea of personal happiness'' (IJ 83) the MS added: ``Schtitt is obsessed with, and never tires of repeating, the fact that in the final year of unsubsidized time, more Americans watched something called Wheel of Fortune than all four network newscasts combined'' (MS 36).

38-40 = IJ 85-87. The flat sentence ``The trees look skeletal'' (IJ 86) was originally flashier: ``Bare trees cast witch-fingers at the sky'' (MS 39). Wallace may have tendency to showboat at times (which I frankly enjoy) but he knows when to pull back when the context demands.

40-[42]: cut. This section begins: ``Hal Incandenza got introduced to drug use for comparatively innocent reasons; he'd wanted to be able to sleep through a recurring bad dream,'' and continues with a brief history of his drug abuse: ``eating mushrooms and tabs with Michael Pemulis and Rutherford Poat and Ortho Slice and all other most sinister players in ETA's chemical crowd, plus of course the liquor stores all through Brighton dispensed wares to anyone whose head cleared the register's counter, and so Hal . . . was an interior wreck by 17 . . .'' But Wallace X'ed this out and wrote in the margin ``BAG---NO 41.'' He revised this on MS 40K-N.

40A-E = IJ 95-105 (but without the Marathe/Steeply interlude on 97). A heavily revised section printed in 8-point type. (Dave told me he did this to disguise the book's length from his editor, who of course wasn't fooled for an instant.)

40E-K = IJ 109-121. Ditto.

40K-N: cut. After ``There is a twinge in a tooth on his mouth's left side'' (IJ 121), the MS continues without a section break with a longer account of Hal's drug history and the ``ghastly nightmares'' that ``are an occupational hazard of serious junior tennis.''

42-47 = IJ 128-35. Originally narrated by an unidentified ``me'' rather than the book's ``yrstruly.''

47-48 = IJ 93.

48-52 = IJ 151-56. Many small revisions but substantially the same. In the MS, one of Pemulis's T-shirts (cf. IJ 156) reads ``Remember Bobby Sands,'' the Irish nationalist who died in prison in 1981 after a hunger strike protesting the British decision to criminalize those previously held as political prisoners.

52A = IJ 87.

52-53 = IJ 63-65. Avril Mondragon (as on IJ 64) was originally called Constance Bilodeau. Though brief, the book version of this chapter is twice as long (i.e., detailed) as the MS.

53-54 = IJ 137-38. MS says the Ennet House was founded in the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad, revised to Year of the Whopper for the book. Similarly the MS has the founder dying at age 56 instead of 68. (The Ennet House was based on Granada House in Brighton, where Wallace lived the first half of 1990.)

54A = IJ 127-28. This description of Lyle was a staple of Dave's readings in the 1990s.

55A-56 = IJ 140-42. The book's heading is longer than the MS's, which stops at ``PASSED FROM THIS LIFE.''

56-56A = IJ 142-44. MS has Helen Slansker instead of Helen Steeply as the author of this heartless Moment article. The closing sentence's power saw (IJ 144) was originally a hatchet.

57-58 = IJ 169-71. From about this point on, fewer and fewer of the chapters are dated in the MS. The MS. had Aldous Huxley considering Leary's invitation to become writer-in-residence at Millbrook in the late 1960s until I reminded Wallace that Huxley died in 1963 (the same day Kennedy was assassinated), so he changed it to Alan Watts (IJ 170; whether it's true Watts received such an offer, I don't know). Instead of the Riverside Hamlet (IJ 171), Hal originally held ``the American Heritage Fourth'' (MS 58).

58-61 = IJ 172-76. The film Hal narrates was originally called Too Much Fun, the title of one of his father's unfinished films (IJ 993), and was dated differently in the headnote. Instead of 81/2 (IJ 175), Wallace originally had One-Eyed Jacks, then crossed that out and inserted ``Powell's Peeping Tom,'' a 1959 British film summarized by Halliwell's thus: ``A film studio focus puller is obsessed by the lust to murder beautiful women and photograph the fear on their faces.''

61-65 = IJ 176-81.

65-76 = IJ 157-69. Originally dated April 1961.

77-81 = IJ 55-60. Moved much closer to the front of the published book, this was another favored piece at Wallace's readings in the 1990s.

81A-K = IJ 491-503. Young Jim's account of helping his father move a mattress was moved back to the middle of the published book. In the upper right-hand corner of p. 81A is a handwritten note: ``Sold to Harper's 5/93.'' It was published in their 9/93 issue with the title ``The Awakening of My Interest in Annular Systems.''

81L = IJ 135-37. The phone call from Orin was greatly expanded for the published version.

81-90 = IJ 181-93. The account of Madame Psychosis's radio program was likewise greatly expanded for the book version, though some sections were cut from the MS., e.g. an ethnic survey of reactions to the radio show's obscure background music: ``Madame Psychosis's cued musics [sic] make Arab MIT students ache for minarets and muezzins' azans, their foreheads itch for the feel of non-representational carpet. German graduate students get lumped-throated envisioning Tubingen roses blooming time-lapse in perfectly ordered rows. The Canadian kids don't think of anything at all. The Swiss kids cop images of prolix clocks,'' and so on. ``Mario's convinced Schtitt would like this music if you could get him to take the Wagner off and try something else for once, in his office'' (MS 88).

90-109 = IJ 219-40 (excluding the interludes on 223 and 227). Joelle van Dyne is called Joelle ver Nooy in the MS. and is described as ``the daughter of a pipe-fitter from Arkansas.'' (Wallace has a note in the margin urging Reconsider; he changed it to ``a low-pH chemist'' for the published novel; the name ver Nooy has some connection with Wallace's alma mater Amherst; ``van Dyne'' is probably meant to evoke ``anodyne,'' which Dave once used in the sense of ``painkiller'' in a letter to me). Wallace cut from the MS Molly Notkin's winning strategy against her examiners for passing her Orals (she ``took a seat not right opposite the three of them but with them . . . they'll attack only from a distance''). The reference to Yugoslav director Dus{\^a}n Makavej at the bottom of IJ 233 was originally to ``late Maillaux'' (MS 103), whoever that is. In the MS Joelle states, ``I am five feet nine inches tall. I weigh 121 pounds, or 55 kilos,'' which Wallace changed to ``I am 1.7 meters tall and weigh 48 kilograms'' (IJ 234).

109-14 = IJ 211-19. Wallace cut another paragraph on Hal's drug history (he ``has in two years gone from Mormonesque [sic] abstinence to a willingness to absorb just about anything at all. . . . Pemulis refers to him with good humor as a garbage-head''). Charles Tavis's surname is Davis in some places in the MS.

114-16 = IJ 240-42. The first-person ``To I think it must be the southwest'' (bottom of IJ 241) isn't in the MS, which suggests Hal is narrating this little geography lesson.

116A-N = IJ 242-58. An immaculate typescript, and very close to the published version.

116O, 117-18 = IJ 193-98.

119-29 = IJ 258-70. John Wayne is said to be from Kirkland, New Brunswick; changed to Montcerf, Quebec, for the novel (IJ 259); Avril was likewise originally from New Brunswick rather than Quebec.

130-37 = IJ 270-81. Geoffrey Day is 49 in the MS, 46 in the book (IJ 270). Numerous similar small changes, e.g., Day originally drove his Saab through the window of a sporting goods store in Somerville, revised to Brookline, and finally to Malden (IJ 272). The MS's Morse Code was changed to ``Morris Code'' for the book (IJ 275), one of numerous instances throughout the finished novel where the narrative employs phonetic spellings and malapropisms even outside of quoted dialogue, what's been called a ``free indirect discourse'' based on the education level of a chapter's protagonist (in this instance, Gately) while maintaining a third-person authorial presence. Before settling on The Fiends in Human Shape (IJ 276), Wallace noted a number of band names: The Husks, Snout, The Green Men, The Exquisite Corpses (top of MS 134). On the top of MS 136 there's a note ``Joelle knows Day from BU.''

137-38 = IJ 281-83. The MS doesn't specify what everyone is reading, as does IJ 281-82. Tavis imitates Richard Nixon in the MS instead of the novel's Pierre Trudeau (IJ 282).

138-42 = IJ 299-306. MS calls him ``Queer Tony'' rather than ``Poor Tony.'' The Year of the Whopper was originally called the Year of the Twinkie (MS 139).

142A-E = IJ 306-12. The classes taught by prorectors in the MS were different: ``Rik Dunkel's `History of Styrofoam,' Mary Esther Thode's `Contemporary Psychoethical Quandaries,' Donni Stott's `Geography of the Rhineland' [crossed out and replaced by Thierry Ontan's `Separatism and Return'], Corbett Thorp's `Deviant Logics,' Aubrey DeLint's `Sport and Society,' Tex Watson's `The Atom in the Mirror: A Lay Look at Annular Fusion,' Tony Nwangi's `Minority Fashions,' etc.'' (cf. IJ 306). After the reference to smallpox variola (IJ 310), Wallace cut from the MS a long passage that begins: ``Hal's maybe favorite anecdote wasn't even in the assigned part of Thevet's Cosmographie---it was the part where the vain and imperious French General Sieur de Roberval, setting sail from France on the second big Canadian expedition in 1541, `. . . took with him his niece, Marguerite, a beautiful and high spirited girl.''' The story continues with a young nobleman, in love with Marguerite, joining the expedition; the disapproving father abandons his niece and her old nurse on Canada's Isle of Demons, to which the nobleman swims. The three eke out a living, Marguerite bears a child, who dies, then Marguerite walks out into the ocean to drown herself. The nobleman takes up with the old nurse, and they are finally rescued and return to Europe, ``where the couple earned a handsome living travelling around Portugal on a kind of lecture-tour describing the incestuous heartlessness of Roberval and the general French character'' (MS 142C-D). I would have guessed Wallace found this anecdote in his friend William T. Vollmann's Fathers and Crows (1992), but a little digging uncovered the source to be not Thevet's impossibly rare book but Francis Parkman's Pioneers of France in the New World (1865), also a major resource for Vollmann. Parkman also supplied a few French-Canadian names in IJ: Poutrincourt, and Pointgrav{\`e} and DesMonts (spelled Pontgrav{\'e} and De Monts in Parkman), the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of IJ.

142-46 = IJ 312-17. In the margin next to the first sentence is the note (re: Mario): ``Mutated because product of incest? Tavis w/ khaki skin and dinosaur eyes?''---an odd question since Tavis and Avril are not biologically related. (See IJ 314 for Mario's khaki skin and dinosaur eyes.) The MS has the Incandenzas living in Beacon Hill, not the Back Bay.

146-67 = IJ 321-42 (+ 1023-25, nn. 123-24). The only heavily footnoted chapter in the MS (with notes and diagrams at the bottom of pages rather than as endnotes) In the MS equivalent to the end of the long paragraph on IJ 330, Pemulis begins adding some long footnotes on hard-core game theory, a ``Pure-Strategy Table,'' other diagrams (one pair is labeled MADAME and PSYCHOSIS), and some very complicated math equations I'm not qualified to describe. (At the end Pemulis says, ``If you got all the way through this my hat's off''---to which Wallace added in the margin ``Particularly to Gerry Howard,'' the editor of his first two books, and who Wallace originally thought would publish this one as well.) In my report I suggested that Dave condense this tour-de-forceful chapter a bit, and perhaps for that reason Pemulis's footnotes got the ax. (This chapter is followed immediately by the brief description of the Statue of Liberty [MS 167], which was moved to the end of the following chapter for the book [IJ 367]. There are a half-dozen versions of the Liberty sentence on various pages in this portion of the MS.)

168-83 = IJ 343-67. Another chapter with some footnotes, including one Wallace discarded: after the phrase ``warm day after cold day'' (IJ 350 bottom), there's this note: ``See for instance photos of people released after long periods in concentration camps; do they look `happy'?'' (MS 172). Wallace wisely decided not to equate brutal internment with reckless addiction, despite the physical similarity between prisoners and addicts. Ferocious Francis was originally called Bobby McCarren, then Bobby Hurst. At one point on p. 176 of the MS---equivalent to the paragraph ending ``abject AA mirth'' on IJ 356---Wallace originally planned to insert pp. 176A-W, but then changed his mind: see next entry.

176A-W = IJ 1007-21. I asked Dave if he moved some sections back to the endnotes as a compromise against eliminating them entirely (since they would take up less space in the smaller point size), but he said no. My copy of the MS is missing pp. 176A-P.

183A-B: cut. A brief episode labeled ``CATATONIC INSERT,'' beginning: ``A couple of the Enfield Marine Hospital security guys Mario'd met when they made `Dial C For Concupiscence' [see IJ 992] sometimes drop by Tequila Mockingbird on Blind Bouncer night when Hal and like maybe Troeltsch are in there.'' These ``young dim big good guys'' describe ``some of the specimens they keep secure'' in Unit #5 (see IJ 196-97).

184-88 = IJ 367-75.

188-90 = IJ 376-79. MS p. 190 is labeled 190-95 to synch it with the succeeding pages.

195A-200 = IJ 380-86. Aubrey DeLint's first name was originally Dana.

200A-B = IJ 379 and 375-76 (``There'd been that first brutal winter night . . .''). The MS is longer because Lyle tells a drunken Incandenza, depressed by harsh criticism (IJ 375), ``the fable of the Smart Old Bee and the Foolish Young Bee,'' about a hyperactive young bee that preferred flying around and enjoying the sights to working at the hive. ``The Smart Old Bee watched the Foolish Young Bee ignore his advice about apollonian motion vs. dyonesian [sic] motion and fly around terrorizing al fresco diners . . . and decided, in true Blakean fashion, that (in an almost ultrasonically high and tiny bee-voice) `You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.''' He asks the Young Bee to spend a day within a flower while ``it opened its petals to drink the light and feed the bees,'' an experience wasted on the Young Bee. ``All he had experienced inside that flower, he complained, was a gradual enlargement of the world outside until he forgot the flower altogether because he was now in the world, and so flew away from the flower that had gradually let him go.''

200-8 = IJ 386-95. This chapter on Lyle begins more simply in the MS: ``No guru's immune to fruitless yearnings, sometimes,'' and was both cut and expanded for the book version. The return to Mario's film (IJ 391-94) comes at a different point in the MS. (There should be a section break at the top of IJ 391; Wallace made verbal corrections for the paperback edition but neglected numerous bad layout problems like this; see, e.g., 692, 701, 736.)

208-18 = IJ 395-410. In the novel, this chapter opens with a passage that originally followed the end---``Like most young people genetically hard-wired for a secret drug problem . . .'' (IJ 395)---which in the MS is accompanied by a handwritten note that seems to read ``addiction fairly gallops in both the Incandenza and Tavis family trees'' (MS 218).

218-26 = IJ 410-18.

226-28 = IJ 430-34.

228A-B = IJ 434-36. At the top of MS 228A is a note ``Pt. II open?'' suggesting (as does the title page) that the novel would be divided into parts. Stavros's ambition to open a women's shoe store isn't discussed in the MS.

228-33 = IJ 436-42.

233A-B: cut. This brief section set in August of the Year of the Trial-Size Dove Bar begins: ``You, Don Gately, 19 [circled with ``20?'' above it], currently and it turns out very temporarily of Lowell, MA, Boston's extreme North Shore, meperidine addict and journeyman burglar, using a hole in a high hedge and some 10X binoculars not your own to scout out potential burglarees . . . become an unsuspected witness to the first ever confirmed U.S.A. sighting of a giant feral infant, a giant feral infant [redundancy sic], south of the Great Concavity within which nothing is ever confirmed.'' Gately watches the wholesome members of the Young Christians Community House prepare a picnic for the hard-luck family living next door when he hears ``Something unspeakable.'' A monster-movie description of the infant on MS 233E was deleted from what is now IJ 447.

233B-F = IJ 442-49. Substantially rewritten, cutting some paragraphs (see above), expanding others.

233F = IJ 449-50.

233G-O = IJ 450-61. The clause ``the thing it's not entirely impossible he may have fathered asleep'' (IJ 451) doesn't appear in the MS, apparently added to give another hint about Tavis's relationship to Mario.

233P-R: cut. This ``Running and Salvation Insert'' describes the E.T.A.s' different conditioning runs and one Friday when Hal, Stice, Troeltsch, and Mario watch a Salvation Army rally.

233-51 = IJ 461-89 (excluding 470-75). The Purity Supreme Market (IJ 461) was originally called simply the Star Market. No mention yet in the MS of Gately's former girlfriend Pamela Hoffman-Jeep (IJ 465; Wallace took that name from a regular RCF reviewer named Lynda Hoffman-Jeep: she had a review in the same ``Younger Writers Issue'' in which he was featured, and he obviously took a shine to her unusual name). In the MS Pat Montesian drives not like ``a maniac'' (IJ 465) but ``like Annie Hall.'' In the pre-metric MS, Gately is described as 6'2" and 280 pounds. The MS has only a paragraph break between the section ending on IJ 469 and its resumption at IJ 475.

The ``new girl Amy J.'' (IJ 475) was originally an ``old male panhandler Danny something'' (MS 240). The transition between Gately and the Antitoi brothers by way of a piece of debris (MS 244; IJ 480) is very Gaddisian, as in his novel J R (1975), which Wallace taught at ISU during this time. Bertraund was originally called Stefe Antitoi, and the store Antitoi Notions. The French phrase ``IL NE FAUT PLUS QU'ON PURSUIVE LE BONHEUR'' (IJ 483) was originally given in English as ``HAPPINESS NEED NO LONGER BE PURSUED'' (MS 247).

251A-C = IJ 550-53. At the top of 251A Wallace wrote ``Misplaced ch[apter]. This ch. should be moved 70 pp. ahead.'' (See MS 314B-D below.) The MS version has Jim Struck interfacing with Dr. Rusk instead Ortho Stice, and stopping after the crack about linoleum. Rusk's door originally had ``two Gothic-script quotes from Andrea Dworkin'' in addition to the sampler. Struck/Stice originally proposed naming his anger Bernard, then Cletis, rather than Horace (IJ 551). What sounds to Pemulis like Tavis exhorting himself ``Total worry total worry'' (IJ 552) in the MS was a military chant: ``One, Two, Three, Four/Every Night I Pray For War . . . Five, Six, Seven, Eight/Kill, Rape, Mutilate'' (MS 251B). Hal's mother is here called Elaine, though usually it's Constance in the MS.

252-58: cut. Labeled ``Catatonic Lady Eavesdrops on Ennet House Conversations'' and dated 11 November, Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, this concerns a catatonic ``Thing'' from the Shed over at Enfield Marine's Unit #3 (i.e., #5: see IJ 196) who is wheeled over to the Ennet House ``to soak up an atmosphere of substance-recovery.'' It's mostly dialogue, similar to the material on IJ 563-65, with some funny-bad puns (``Kid, sex is like a cemetery. Get a lot while you're young'' [MS 256]).

259-71 = IJ 283-99. This chapter is unique in having a centered title and subtitle:

An Inspirational Story

(To Give Up Is To Go On --Moral

In Defense of Apostasy)

 

Here the Moms is called Minovia; in addition to Orwell's ``Politics and the English Language'' (IJ 288) her grammar group reads ``Edwin Newman and William Safire's treatises'' (MS 263). The MS gushingly introduces Joelle as ``a freshman baton-twirler with huge happy hair whose ringlets were discs and whose legs went up to her armpits, who twirled and strutted with immaculate posture and a diffident expression, whose legs were the color of whole milk against the bruised color of the sunrise sky . . . who was quite simply drop-dead pretty'' (MS 264). The novel's gentle note that Orin ``had already drawn idle little sideways 8's on the postcoital flanks of a dozen B.U. coeds'' (IJ 289) replaces the MS's coarser ``had already gone about penetrating a huge cross-section of BU's incoming freshwomen.'' The unnamed ``cleft-chinned and solidly B.U.-connected Dad'' at the top of IJ 291 is revealed to be Dr. Geoffrey Day in the MS. Joelle is the daughter of Joe Lon ver Nooy of Meyer, Arkansas, and though called the ``prettiest girl of all time'' in the MS is not yet acronymed P.G.O.A.T.

271A-D = IJ 503-7. Nearly identical to the published version. This is the selection from the MS, of the three or four Dave offered, I chose to run in the RCF ``Younger Writers Issue'' in spring 1993.

272-91 = IJ 508-27. Trevor Axford's role in this much-revised chapter was originally assigned to a ``Danny Fuller,'' crossed out and replaced by Jim Struck. Following the reference to Brewster's Angle (IJ 511), the MS has this excised, bracketed note: ``[Caroline Sutton, `How Do They That,' angle at which light hits thing so they produce horizontal waves and thus glare].'' (See Sutton's How Do They Do That: Wonders of the Far and Recent Past Explained [1984].) Another e&b'd note reads: ``[Use McLean bldgs., part of McLean's tunnel map, for schema of ETA]'' (MS 275). The ``diddle-check'' goes on a little longer in the MS as the moppets give more explicit examples of inappropriate contact, e.g. Tina Echt's query, ```You mean like when Uncle Rollo back home in Pawtucket likes me to climb on his lap and bounce up and down and play Horsie-With-Progressively-Lumpier-Saddle, he calls it?''' Tiny Gretchen Holt and Jolene Criess ask similar questions (MS 277). A section detailing the more brutal disciplinary methods at other tennis academies in North and South America was cut following the reference to ETA's puker-drills (IJ 515). The footnote to ``Coatlicue Complex'' reads ``No clue'' (IJ 516, 1036 n.216), but the MS helpfully supplies another e&b'd note: ``[Carnes, `Out of the Shadows' p. 69---Aztec mother-god who symbolizes power of life and death that each mother holds over her infant]'' (MS 279). (See Patrick Carnes, Out of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addiction [1990].) As kids Hal and Orin called Tavis Gretel after a cow they'd seen at the Catskill Game Farm with a hole in its stomachs ``with like plastic caps over them, and tubes, so you could look in and see internal digestive processes going on right inside the cow'' (MS 280; cf. IJ 1068). There are a few notes in margins where Wallace considers whether he should make Tavis Avril's biological brother or not; it appears he began with biological and only later changed it to adoptive. Tavis's interview with Tina Echt is much longer in the MS version. At the equivalent to the bottom of IJ 521 the MS reads: ``This is embarrassing, but her [Avril's] diminutive for Harold James Incandenza is Patoot, which don't ask'' (MS 286).

292-96 = IJ 531-38. The MS omits the opening sentence. In the margins Wallace wrote little notes to himself about certain passages, e.g., ``G[ately] needs to be more sensitive,'' Joelle ``needs to be more Southern,'' like a director rehearsing actors. The MS omits the last two sentences of the published version. Typed a few lines later is an idea: ``Joelle as child model, mother and twin brothers just as gorgeous---posed as attractive family in picture frames in picture you buy and discard to put your own imperfect picture in frame.'' But Wallace circled this and dismissed it as ``possibly too cute.''

297-307 = IJ n.324, 1066-72. At the top of the first page of this episode Wallace wrote ``Fix or cut,'' compromising by fixing it up (expanding it to twice its original length) but moving it to the endnotes. Instead of the Russian T-shirt (IJ 1069) Pemulis wears one that's ``pork-colored, with a swine in a police cap counting currency and the words Keep Our Cops Kosher.'' In addition to praising the axiom and the lemma (IJ 1071) Pemulis goes on at length in the MS on the principle of induction, Descartes and St. Augustine, hypothetical math problems, etc., but Wallace wrote ``Too abstract'' at the bottom of one page and abridged most of it. (Pemulis doesn't name the set of mathematicians at the top of IJ 1072, though.)

308-14 = IJ 538-47. In the MS Lenz keeps his stash in ``Blakiston's gargantuan Gould Medical Dictionary'' instead of in James's Principles of Psychology, but at the end of the episode Wallace has this handwritten footnote to the line ``a waste of time and tension and yet still not be able to stop worrying about it'' (IJ 547): ``cf. William James---`Recent works on the psychology of character have had much to say on this point. Some persons are born with an inner constitution which is harmonious and well-balanced from the outset. Their impulses are consistent with one another, their will follows without trouble the guidance of their intellect, and their lives are little haunted by regret. Others are oppositely constituted; and are so in degrees which may vary from something so slight as to result in a merely odd or whimsical inconsistency, to a discordancy of which the consequences may be inconvenient in the extreme.' Varieties [of Religious Experience] p. 141.''

314A = IJ 548.

314B-D = IJ 550-53. A duplicate of MS 251A-C; this one is clean; the earlier one has minor revisions.

315-21 = IJ 553-62 (excluding Hal's interlude on 560). In the MS., instead of looking ``like Warhol with a tan'' (IJ 553), Lenz resembles ``Cesar Romero after a hideous mishap'' (cf. IJ 276, 894). The MS's footnote to ``hydrolysis'' (IJ 557 and n. 232) reveals one of Wallace's drug sources: Anthony B. Radcliffe's Pharmer's Almanac: A Layman's Guide to the Pharmacology of Psychoactive Drugs (1985; rpt. Ballantine, 1991). The stories Lenz and Green exchange (IJ 557-59) are weirder and more exotic in the MS., regarding, e.g., Elvis's twin brother in utero Enos, mirror-cults, and a ``pocket of persons in Rhode Island and Delaware who believe the Biblical Antichrist appeared and walked among the earth for a seven-year period between 1972 and 1979 in the guys [sic] of televised Dating Game game show host Jim Lang.'' (Handwritten at the beginning of this episode is the note ``All typos intentional.'')

321A = IJ 227. In the MS it's ``Helen L. Slansker, 33,'' working out of Tucson rather than ``Erythema AZ'' (IJ 227); there's no such town, of course, but every Gaddis fan will recognize erythema as the skin disease from which Wyatt Gwyon suffers in The Recognitions (p. 43).

322-27 = IJ 563-65. The MS version is much longer because Wallace took some snippets and dispersed them elsewhere in the finished novel.

327-29 = IJ n.90, 1000-02. Day is not quite as verbose in the MS version (which, e.g., lacks his final paragraphs on the un-American, illogical nature of AA [IJ 1002]).

330-42 = IJ 575-89. The MS contains about 400 words at the beginning that Wallace cut (mostly Lenz boasting that many of the Ennet House females ``want him to X them from all possible angles of attack in the worse possible way'' and telling Green about the screenplay he's writing) or moved around (e.g., to n.239). At the equivalent to the end of the paragraph at the top of IJ 578, Wallace cut this amusing bit: ``A Euro-punk now crosses the frame, abundantly leathered, with prolix hair, pale, spikes radiating from skull and wrists, jackboots, pale and with a long jaw, taking forever to cross the alley's mouth. Lenz tells Green there've historically been Euro-punks for decades: he says the definition of a Euro-punk's: two haircuts, one head'' (MS 333). The MS underlines Green's familiarity with Hawaiian music (i.e., it's his consciousness that identifies the Don Ho album): ``A slack-steel guitar. Influences on West Coast jazz circa the 1940s and 1950s. Green had read up on all things Hawaiian, in grade school, sitting silently in the library corner's beanbag chair under a poster of Chuck Norris holding up a book and saying reading is fundamental'' (MS 340).

343-44 = IJ 589-93. This brief sequence shows more revision than any other episode in the manuscript. ``Hugh'' was another early name for Orin. The MS lacks the two paragraphs from ``He keeps trying to imagine Madame Psychosis'' through ``because Mario never changes'' (IJ 590). To Mario, the Ennet House originally ``smells like God'' before Wallace changed that to ``smells like an ashtray'' and reworked the God reference (IJ 591). (It was about this time that Wallace, the son of atheists, got religion.) In the MS Mario hears a recording of a Madame Psychosis show, but ``it's not a live broadcast, because tonight on WYYY Miss Diagnosis is doing a Pig-Latin reading of John's Revelation that Mario could only take five minutes of'' (MS 344). After the line (added by hand) ``It is increasingly hard to find valid art that is about stuff that is real in this way'' (IJ 592), Wallace cut this paragraph, from a letter Mme. Psychosis once read aloud on her show:

``So but I'd always feel strange, then, when we fucked [amended to ``did it'']. It was like an all-body hallucination---that, beginning at opposite ends of the world, we hurtle toward each other, each bound for the opposite point that had launched the other, and that in the best of worlds we'd pass each other in opposite flight, impossibly close, sliding past each other like two planes of glass, too smooth to touch. But that here we snag somehow. I get caught on you. Something catches, keeps us from hurtling on past each other to the place we need to get to, each other's place. We're caught on each other in mid-hurtle. We struggle and thrash, trying to disengage. It's no use.'' (MS 344)

344-46 = IJ 593-96. Another heavily revised interlude.

347-53 = IJ 200-11. This is the chapter I suggested to open the novel, and while Wallace obviously didn't agree, he did move it closer to the front. He originally wrote ``severe cyctic acne'' before substituting the all-purpose Boston adjective ``wicked'' (IJ 200). After the sentence ending ``techniques and public relations, etc.'' (IJ 203), the MS has a 2500-word footnote (pp. 348A-D) concerning a ``professional stem-artist'' named Gordon W. Eagan, ``a three-decade heroin addict who claimed without bravado to have raised and fed into his right arm sums equal to the yearly GNP of most small Caribbean nations.'' Set in November YDAU, it details his various scamming techniques; one of his cons was fellow-Ennet resident Ken Erdedy, who now reacts ``with a kind of celebrity-recognition-type fervor.'' In the MS the cummings tatt is spelled correctly (cf. IJ 208).

353-66 = IJ 601-19. The MS version of the climactic fight scene is very close to the final version, footnotes included. Lenz seems to be wired on cocaine, not ``Bing'' (IJ 605; in fact, many of the amusing slang terms, like ``eating cheese'' for ratting, were added later). The Nuck's .44 was originally a mere .22. At this point in the MS there's a handwritten page, 360A, describing the shooter's stance: IJ 609.

366A-E = IJ 596-601. Orin is age 26 in the MS version of this interlude, which is about half the length of the book version.

367-76 = IJ 620-26. Instead of ``Hal and Mario have both been to a few'' (IJ 622), the MS reads: ``I've been to a few'' (MS 370), one of many indications that Hal is in some sense the narrator of the novel. (On the other hand, see 433-43 below.) The MS has Luria P--- instead of Hugh Steeply in Tine's office (IJ 622); the WYYY engineer has a spine-split copy of The Tao of Physics instead of Metallurgy of Annular Isotopes (IJ 624).

377-88 = IJ 627-38. The Syrian Satelliter and Moment profiler were added later to the chapter's first paragraph. The descriptions of the students' eating habits were greatly expanded for the novel. The Darkness gives an extended account of one of his parents' ``connubial battles'' (MS 378-79). Mrs. Incandenza originally used green pens rather than blue (IJ 631; MS 381 has the note: ``change all pens she chews on to green pens''; contemplate for a moment going through the entire novel looking for such instances). After Stice cites his old man's dictum (IJ 633) someone in the MS adds: ``A Bedouin contortionist'' (MS 382). In the MS Struck taunts the others by relating ``how he was on the phone to this girl in 16s down at the Bradenton School he was going to X before 1 Jan. or die in the effort, says he was on the line to this girl and how she relates that her doubles partner had an attack of the moists for one of Struck's intimate circle up at ETA, very casually,'' then goes on to describe her with as much attention to her tennis style and equipment as her physical attributes (MS 383-84). Struck: ``But so Fern says she knows the guy by sight but isn't sure of the name. . . . She says the one with the long arms and the hands like a strangler.'' ``That's half the guys at this school,'' someone objects (MS 385). (Turns out Troeltsch is the lucky guy, which is greeted with incredulity all around.)

388-97 = IJ 651-62. The MS's opening paragraph is more perfunctory the novel's (which still economically sets the scene with short sentences). Stice's service motion is in only the McEnroe tradition; expanded to McEnroe-Esconja for the novel. The MS description of Gately in the hospital is much more crowded; instead of asleep alone (IJ 654), he is ``thrashing'' in bed from pain: ``Calvin Thrust is at Gately's bedside, arms crossed, gasper unlit, watching Gately thrash and flush fever-bright. Pat Montesian, Joelle ver N., Bruce G., and Gately's sponsor Bobby H are down the corridor in the CC reception area, listening to the vending machines hum and gurgle and want coins, waiting to go in and be there for Don Gately. The US Marshal stationed at Gately's room's door has received notice of one visitor at a time, he said'' (MS 390-91). After the reference to ``Queer'' Tony, the MS pictures Randy Lenz on the north side of the Mass Pike trying to thumb a ride westward. Orin embraces not the ``Swiss'' hand-model but ``the Italianate wife of the Italianate mayor of a Phoenix suburb'' (MS 391).

397-413 = IJ 666-82. The MS has only one footnote (n.272) to the novel's seven for this chapter, a typical ratio. Traub is called Farb in the MS. The MS notes ``a concentration of adolescent-high graffiti on the wall,'' e.g., ```All Hail Alberta. O.I. 'N E.I.' in a heart, with arrows'' [Orin Incandenza + Elaine (as Avril is called a few pages earlier) Incandenza?], ``Spore-factor Six---13 Million Triobonds Can't Be Wrong,'' ``Gone fission,'' and higher than the rest, ``Happiness Need No Longer Be Pursued'' (MS 401-2; cf. 233-51 above).

Thierry's last name is Ontan in the MS. Pat Cash is ``in asylums by the mid twenties'' rather than simply ``vanished by the twenties of age'' (IJ 676). (There are many similar handwritten changes to imitate French syntax in this chapter.) Thierry's interpolations on IJ 679 were added later. In the MS DeLint notes that ``The founder's Academy motto was `I CARRY MY MASK IN FRONT OF ME AT ALL TIMES''' (see 32-38 above) but that Schtitt changed it to ```CONTRARIA SUNT COMPLEMENTA,' which is from the man Niels Bohr, who meant substances and events are of necessity the same things, the players and the games are the opposites that are just the two sides of of [redundancy sic] the one thing they must transcend, to achieve it''' (MS 412; see IJ 81 for the final motto, but and also see IJ 713 and n. 298 for an extremely loose translation). Wallace cut some interesting comparisons that DeLint makes: ``Hal to me is reminiscent of a girl named Goolagong, Australian, the 1970s, same touch and control, a sentient stick, the best pure female player in the era of late King and the young Evert, but she'd have these Incandenza-like lapses where she'd go what her coach Tony Roche called going `Walkabout,' an Australian mumbojumbo term, a kind of trance where she'd kind of zone out, puncture her gestalt, seem not to care. Also this girl Mandlikova in the 80s era of Navratilova and Austin. Face like Jimmy Connors but the best little hiney in the history of tennis. Incredible strokes, natural player, but would leave herself and hover'' (MS 412-13).

414-17 = IJ 682-86. Matty is 26 in the MS instead of 23. Note 278 (IJ 1052) was originally the episode's last paragraph.

417-19 = IJ 548-49. With a few exceptions (pp. 448-60, 474-76), the MS is very clean from here to the end, with justified margins, and sequentially paginated (by hand) without alphabetical inserts.

419-22 = IJ 686-89. In the MS DeLint isn't described in detail as he is in the novel, and Hal watches a different set of cartridges: ``He watches the Alberto V05 parody [Cage; see 469 below] and `Pre-Nuptual [sic] Agreement Between Heaven and Hell' and `Dark Logics' and then `Adultery In a Narrow Bunk,' . . . He watches `Death in Scarsdale' and `Transparent Tigers' and `Homo Duplex' and `Kinds of Pain'' (MS 419-20), followed by Medusa v. Odalisque and Wave Bye-Bye to the Bureaucrat.

422-24 = IJ 689-91. Not dated in the MS.

424 = IJ 692. Note how the spacing is off in the published version: there should be a 3-line section break at the top of 692.

424-30 = IJ 692-98. The MS lacks the introductory sentence. A first-person ``I'' appears a few times in this chapter of the MS. Ernest Feaster was originally surnamed Harris.

430-32 = IJ 698-700. Again, not dated in the MS. At the end there's a note ``section not finished''; the episode is resumed at IJ 714.

432-33 = IJ 700-01. The MS has only the Troeltsch and Schtitt/Mario interludes; the other three were added later. Again, there should be a 3-line section break at the top of IJ 701.

433-43 = IJ 701-11. In the MS, Bridget watches Blood Sister alone with Hal at first (and indulges in Haagen-Dazs instead of yogurt). Fran is ``pie-faced'' in the MS rather than ``hanuman-faced'' (IJ 703, an Indian monkey). The novel's  ``It remains to be determined . . .'' (IJ 707) was originally ``It's unclear to me whether Joelle ver Nooy, whom Hal doesn't personally know . . .'' (MS 438), which complicates the question of who exactly narrates this novel. In the MS, Joelle thinks of Gately with ``unabashed'' rather than ``fearful sentiment'' (IJ 707). The MS has ``jig'' for the novel's ``colored'' during the Mattapan man's story (IJ 707-11; i.e., Wallace decided to filter it through the Southerner Joelle's sensibility rather than the black Bostonian's).

443-47 = IJ 711-14.  The MS continues beyond the point where the novel ends this sequence as Bridget offers to tell Hal the funny thing Pemulis did earlier that day (IJ 702-3). Pemulis gave her a lift in the truck, and at a stoplight noticed a blind man with cane and sunglasses. As the man crossed in front of him, Pemulis put the truck in neutral and gunned the engine, scaring the blind man half to death. ``Section not finished'' scribbled at bottom.

448-60 = IJ 755-69. At the top of the first page Wallace has written ``Found Drama II.'' In the opening paragraph Bernadette Longley and Fran Unwin were on the courts, but Wallace replaced them because this episode apparently occurs while they're watching Blood Sister with Hal. The MS, like the novel, has a ``second tenor'' mysteriously turn into a ``baritone'' within a few sentences (IJ 756). The Gilbert Treffert poster (IJ 757) was originally Gilbert LaTouche. The 49-star U.S.A. flag (IJ 761) originally had 46 stars. Both MS and novel end with one of Wallace's prettiest paragraphs (IJ 769).

461-68 = IJ 769-74, 782-85. The Moms' dog was originally called Roger rather than S[amuel?]. Johnson. After Hal says he doesn't know whether he misses Orin or not (IJ 771), Mario asks: ``Remember when you were really little and Himself would always call you his Little Button, like Come To Papa My Little Button, and one day in the driveway in Weston you disagreed, you made your hands like fists down at your sides and put one foot down hard and went to Himself you went I Am Not A Little Button. And Orin was there and he went That's What All The Little Buttons Say, Kid'' (MS 463). There is no break or interruption in the MS version.

469-73: cut. Six short sections; if one analogue to IJ's ``anticonfluential'' structure is channel-surfing, one can think of these as mildly interesting snippets until the main program resumes. The first is entitled ``JAMES INCANDENZA'S FIRST ATTEMPT EVER AT SOMETHING FILMED, `CAGE I,' NEVER PUBLICLY SEEN BECAUSE IT'S DULL AND HEAVY, A 28-SECOND PARODY OF AN ALBERTO V05 COMMERCIAL, FEATURING AN OLD PRE-DIGITAL TELEVISION SET, A CLEAN WALL MIRROR, AND TWO IMAGES IN BOTH, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE.'' A brief script follows, with the model saying things like: ``Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Hate yourself because you're not.''

The second is ``HAL INCANDENZA'S FIRST 2 WRITTEN COMMENTS ON ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY ECONOMIC . . .,'' in which young Hal praises the penny, concluding: ``Pennies seem more like a synecdoche of fear and aggression---have pennies at the ready, ready to direct them outward, lest the pennies come back your way, for you to have to lug around, or keep in a jar.''

The third section lacks a title and reads in its entirety: ``Assuming you're not bedridden or institutionalized for detoxification or something, ie. assuming you're just like an average US person, can you remember the last time a whole day went by without your buying something? No matter how small. Something. Is this a bit weird?'' (MS 470).

The fourth section has like a 150-word title about what Geoffrey Day thinks about after waking up in the middle of the night, feeling like ``A SMALL PALE SOUL PREY TO THE WHIMS OF A GREAT ROARING NATURE, LIKE PASCAL UNDER REMOTE SKIES, AT NIGHT:'' ``We are romantics, Americans, today,'' it begins. ``Romantics believe that nature is the spirit's repository and projector''; unlike ``the farmers of yore,'' who treated nature with respect, modern-day Americans like Lenz say ``the great thing about nature is it's one big toilet.'' (It's a subtle passage that resists abridgement.)

The fifth section explains ``WHERE THE TRADEMARK OPENING LINES OF MADAME PSYCHOSIS'S `SIXTY MINUTES MORE OR LESS WITH MADAME PSYCHOSIS' ON WYYY CAME FROM: DR. JAMES INCANDENZA'S THIRD SHORT FILM, `DARK LOGICS,' ALSO UNSEEN PUBLICLY BECAUSE IT'S TERRIBLY OBLIQUE AND DRY, CONSISTING MOSTLY OF STILL SHOTS OF ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS HAVING THEIR PAGES TURNED BY A SKELETAL HAND: FRAUDULENT MATHEMATICAL DERIVATIONS OF GHASTLY THEOREMS FROM BENIGN AXIOMS, THE ADOLESCENT DIARIES OF FAMOUS DICTATORS, EXCERPTS FROM POST-GENESISTIC CHAPTERS OF A KIND OF PSEUDO-CONTEMPORARY BIBLICAL-TYPE THING, VIZ:'' This is followed by quotations from the Book of Perry and Clive, Book of Otto, and the Book of Betsi and Brad, all in a parody of Genesis.

The final section is ``HAL INCANDENZA'S ONE EXTANT WRITTEN THING ON DUCKS, SUBMITTED 21 NOVEMBER YR./WHOPPER FOR THEN-PRORECTOR JANICE SNEE'S OPTIONAL AND PRETTY EASY `NEW ENGLAND ECOLOGY WORKSHOP,' A KIDS' CLASS, HAL BEING ONLY TEN AT THE TIME, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR A CERTAIN STRAINED, TIP-TOE-LIKE QUALITY TO THE PROSE OF HIS MEDITATION ON THE DUCKS IN BOSTON'S PUBLIC GARDEN.'' Hal notes that ``ducks' trade secret'' for flourishing in their cold, wet environment is their ``oily exudationary layer,'' which if compromised by ``a mom using a spray bottle with a weak boric acid solution to scrub the duck clean and oil-free before a son picks it up'' will cause the duck to ``fall prey to the full fury of the wet, cold environment in which it makes its natural home.''

474-75 = IJ 785-87. In the MS Hal's conversation is described as ``upscale Boston speech.''

475-86 = IJ 795-808. MS is almost identical to the book version.

487-520 = IJ 809-45, 846-51. The MS has fewer paragraph breaks in this long sequence. MS reads ``your display of reluctant virtue'' instead of ``reluctant se offendendo'' and its accompanying note (IJ 814). Wallace expanded the paragraph now spanning IJ 817-18 to include the details about Pat's (and Joelle's) red hair and physical appearance. Mrs. Lopate (IJ 818) is called ``the Thing, the catatonic lady from the Shed'' in the MS. There's no section break in the MS as on IJ 827. Cheers!'s Norm is spelled correctly in the MS. The poseur ``Schwulst'' (IJ 835) replaces the MS's ``Bochco.'' (Steven Bochco is a writer/producer best known for his work on Hill Street Blues; Schwulst is a German word for ``swelling, tumor,'' or figuratively, ``bombast, turgidity.'') Wallace shortened the MS's ``the car-switching hour'' to ``the switching hour'' (IJ 837), probably to bring out the pun on ``witching hour'' (and maybe even to allude to Hamlet's ``the very witching time of night'' [3.2.413].) No section break in MS between IJ 845-46.

520-23 = IJ 851-54. The MS lacks a date and the details about the Boards and A.P.s being three weeks away (IJ 851). In the MS ``the opponents were to be the Ukrainian Jr. Davis and Jr. Wightman Cup teams,'' and through the rest of the MS it's the Ukrainians rather than the Quebecois who are expected.

523-32 = IJ 854-64. In the MS, Orin's ``only aesthetic interest in Joelle had been in a face he could make into anything anybody watching might wish'' rather than ``first aesthetic and then anti-aesthetic'' (IJ 855). At the point where the novel states, ``What's unendurable is what his own head could make of it all'' (IJ 860), the MS has Gately remember Ferocious Francis describing at length what his head made of his problems (MS 528-29). Joelle's family bull was originally called ``Big Nig''; her Uncle Lum was originally Uncle Punk. At the point where the novel's episode ends, the MS continues with Gately's ``memory of the summer at 13 he worked in Beverly for old Gus Carty the lobsterman. . . . The thing Gately remembers best, besides the odor, is the way all the trapped lobsters' eye-stalks were always stuck out protruding between the reticular bars of the trap, every single eye-stalk of every single one, so the eyes always looked out at open space. The advantage of eyes that projected way forward: the eyes never had themselves behind bars. A lobster's ommatophoric Denial'' (MS 532, a variant on ommatophorous, ``bearing an eye, as an eye-stalk'' [OED]; cf. IJ 891).

532-42 = IJ 864-76. In both MS and book the digital display reads ``11-18-EST0456'' (IJ 865), even though this scene is presumably a continuation of IJ 851-54, dated 11-20. ``The window was unobserved above The Darkness's breath-line'' (IJ 865) originally read ``above the Wraith's breath-line.'' And in fact, there are several places in this episode where ``The Darkness'' originally read ``the Wraith.'' Hal even calls him ``Wraithster'' at one point (MS 539). (Q.v. IJ 943, where Stice ``thinks he's been somehow selected or chosen to get haunted or possessed by some kind of benefactor or guardian ghost.'') In addition to imagining his father's ghost and black spiders (IJ 870), Himself ``claimed to be tormented by an apparition of Ethel Merman that wouldn't shut up and let him sleep'' (MS 538; Wallace probably remembered he already used Merman earlier w/r/t the DMZ'd soldier [IJ 214]). After Stice shrieks ``Jesus God put it back!'' the MS continues: ``The little second face's blue eyes protruded like ommataophorous [sic---that word again!] eyes'' instead of ``like cartoon eyes'' (IJ 871).

543-53 = IJ 883-96. Wallace added to the MS the foreshadowing to ``Fackelmann's eliminated map after the insane scam on Sorkin'' (IJ 886). Gately's girlfriend's name is abbreviated in the MS Pamela H.-J.

553-61 = IJ 896-902, 906-11. The MS begins with reference to ``Stice's detachment,'' not ``defenestration'' (which would be correct only if you decide ``fenestration'' can mean getting stuck to a window, which it usually doesn't). In the MS Hal experiences not a panic attack but ``an attack of jeda-vu'' (another interesting word choice). The oft-mentioned film cartridges are described as ``the size of old 45-rpm records but had the glassy shine and diffractory reflective qualities of the first-generation compact disks Disney Leith had brought in to class'' (MS 554). All of the material from ``Her smile in the wedding photo is homodontic'' to ``the Moms and C.T. have never represented themselves as anything other than unrelated but extremely close'' (IJ 901) isn't in the MS. There is no section break in the MS.

            Wallace added the first paragraph after the section break on 906 to the resumption of this episode. In the MS, the Moms had Himself interred in her family cemetery in Ste. Th{\'e}r{\`e}se des Monts, Quebec, rather than in L'Islet Province (IJ 907); similarly, Hal flew to ``Ste. Th{\'e}r{\`e}se des Monts, a small town built around spud-storage facilities fewer then twenty clicks south of the Baie des Chaleurs'' rather than St. Adalbert (IJ 910). Kieran McKenna was first described as having a ``little retrouss{\'e} nose'' before it got downgraded to a ``little porcine snout'' (IJ 909). ``Peterson's The Cage'' (IJ 911) isn't in the MS (which suggests Wallace learned of this ``1947 classic'' [IJ 986, n.b] after he already gave the title to three Incandenza films). The MS identifies the quotation ``For while clinamen and tessera . . .'' (IJ 911) as coming from Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence, pp. 122-29 (which Wallace coyly acknowledges in n.366).

561-85 = IJ 902-6, 911-38 (excepting the interlude on 916). A long, uninterrupted sequence in the MS, very close to the book version. Gately's ``cognomen'' (IJ 902) was originally a ``moniker.'' In the MS, the wienie recites Howl more plausibly in Pig Latin instead of Chaucerian English (IJ 906). In the MS, Otis P. Lord for a while is in the bed next to Gately's, there to get the Hitachi monitor over his head removed, but Wallace later deleted all these references except for the bed-frame assembly-work on IJ 918-22. The Dworkinite protest group was originally called Womyn's Sexploitation-Preventionand-Protest Phalanx: WEPPP rather than FOPPP (IJ 929). The crucial paragraph on IJ 934 beginning ``His fever is way worse'' is only partly present in the MS (and the brief interlude not at all), which then continues ``And so but the next morning found Gately and Fackelmann still there in the corner. . . .''

585-98 = IJ 941-58. Again Hal refers occasionally to The Darkness as the Wraith or Wraithster in the MS. Originally there was no reference to the ``print of Lang directing Metropolis'' (IJ 951). The ``another attack'' mentioned at the bottom of IJ 951 reads ``another attack of jamais-vu,'' which is maybe what he meant earlier by ``jeda-vu.'' (Jamais is French for ``never.'') The MS lacks the reference to Consummation of the Levirates (IJ 952; Levirates follow the Jewish practice where the brother of a deceased man marries his widow; Hal's illustrated rug presumably depicts an orgy of such weddings. The biblical Onan refused to consummate his Levirate duty and had his map eliminated by his god as a result, but lives on in the various O.N.A.N. puns in IJ). Wallace added the three paragraphs on IJ 954-55 from ``Then it occurred to me'' through ``to cripple myself to avoid (or forgo).''

598-99: cut. Two pages of brief AA testimonials, e.g.:

            ``If you're having trouble with spirituality, welcome to the club.'' --Charlie M., Brookline Young People's Group, Monday, 11/16/YDAU

            ``I came in to save my ass and found my soul was attached.'' --Cheryl U., BYP, Monday, 11/16/YDAU

            ``They say it's good for the soul, but I don't feel nothing inside you could call a soul.'' --Nell G., The Allston Group, Friday, 11/13/YDAU

599-601 = IJ 958-60.

601-2: cut. Orin leaves distracted phone messages on Hal's answering machine. He notes how moths and insects are attracted at night by his lighted window, trying to get in, then wonders if ``this is what we are to God, little night-things whapping at a lit window, trying to get in'' (MS 602).

602-9 = IJ 972-81. The main narrative of the MS concludes just as the novel does; Wallace knew early on how he wanted it to end. But after the final sentence's ``and the tide was way out,'' there are these enigmatic lines:

18 -- Hal and Helen, Hal and Exhibition, Pemulis and DMZ

19 -- Gately and Joelle. `They sewed his eyes open and Superglued the back of his head to the wall and propped the TP viewer in front of him and put something in the viewer. The chinks had propped up mirrors all around him so he couldn't look away'

Then there's a handwritten note ``SECTION UNFINISHED,'' followed by ``Resume sec. after filmography.'' No clue.

610-16 = IJ 985-93. The MS version of Incandenza's film bibliography, added as an appendix, is close to the novel's, with a few exceptions: in the MS, the authors of ``The Laughing Pathologists'' (IJ 985, n.24a) were limited to Comstock and Posner, and they treated Michael Snow (instead of E. and K. Snow) as well as John Waters. Following Union of Theoretical Grammarians in Cambridge, the MS adds:

Union of Publicly Hidden in Lynn. B.S. Meniscus Films, Ltd. Documentary cast w/ narrator P.A. Heaven; 78 mm.; 60 minutes; color; sound. Filmed proceedings in a Boston, MA suburb of ``anonymous'' meeting of the Union of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed, a support group for aesthetically challenged persons struggling with issues around light and sight. MAGNETIC VIDEO, PRIVATELY RELEASED BY MENISCUS FILMS, LTD.

Cage III and No Troy appear in different positions than in the novel.

---

And so but it should be obvious by now that not only did Wallace make very few cuts---about 40 pages, and almost none of the ones I suggested, as it happens---he wound up adding a considerable amount of new material. In 1994 and 1995 Wallace added the opening sequence (IJ 3-17, set a year later than the main narrative rather than several years in the past, as he originally had it), the mold-eating incident (10-11), several scenes featuring Orin (65-66, 565-67, 574-75, 971-72, 1038-44), Pemulis's drug lecture (66-67), all of the Marathe/Steeply dialogues outside Tucson and most of the Wheelchair Assassins material, Mario's first and only romantic encounter (121-26), the hilarious e-mail about the bricklayer's accident (138-40), the explanation for why videophony didn't work (144-51), the workout (198-200), the helpful calendar of subsidized time (223), the discussion of the ``billowing shape'' (648-51), the Bain/Steeply correspondence (663-65, 1047-52), all of the material on pp. 714-55, the funny scene with Marathe and Kate Gompert in a bar (775-82), several Rod Tine scenes and related interrogations, Pemulis hiding then losing the old sneaker containing the DMZ (700, 916), Joelle's apprehension and release (934, 938-41, 958), the Assistant District Attorney's talk with Pat Montesian (960-64), the forthcoming exhibition f{\^e}te (964-71), and maybe half of the endnotes. That is, Wallace added at least 200 pages of material, plus expanded many of the previously written episodes, and yet it's been said the publisher cut 300-400 pages, which puzzles me. (I suppose it's possible that, after revising and expanding the original manuscript, then adding some 200 pages of new material, Wallace went on to write an additional 300 pages, all while teaching at ISU, but that seems a bit much even for a prodigy like him.) At any rate, it's to his editor's credit that, instead of insisting on further reductions, Pietsch decided to market the novel's gargantuan size as part of its appeal.

            The finished novel was delivered mid-1995 to Little, Brown, which issued a first state of galleys in two volumes, offset and reduced from Wallace's final typescript. A second state of galleys, the ``Signed Advance Reader's Edition'' (whose print run has been variously estimated at 200, 500, and 1000 copies), was produced in the fall of 1995, and the handsome book appeared in January of 1996.

            As a coda, I'd like to reprint the review I wrote of the published novel for the Review of Contemporary Fiction (vol. 16, no. 1 [Spring (i.e., January) 1996]: 141-42), some of which was misquoted on the jacket of IJ, which I'll explain below. (That Spring 1996 issue was not uncoincidentally the ``Future of Fiction'' issue Wallace guest-edited.) Friends aren't supposed to review the books of friends, but we were pretty lax about that sort of thing at RCF. Dave later told me his editor liked my review enough to enlarge and post it on his office wall, and that I was the only reviewer to note that, while set in the future, the novel was a response to ``the need to excel in the Reagan eighties.''

David Foster Wallace. Infinite Jest. Little, Brown, 1996. 1,079 pp. $29.95.

 

While reading William Gass's The Tunnel last year at this time, I feared I was witnessing the last of a dying breed, the encyclopedic American novel that began with Gaddis's Recognitions in 1955, hit its stride in the sixties and seventies (Giles Goat-Boy, Gravity's Rainbow, Gaddis again with J R, The Public Burning, LETTERS), went baroque in the eighties (Darconville's Cat, Take Five, Women and Men, You Bright and Risen Angels), then raged against the dying of the light in the nineties with Powers's Gold-Bug Variations and Gass's massive masterpiece. Who was left to write such novels, or to read them at a time when some scorn such books as elitist, testosterone-fueled acts of male imperialism? For those of us who regard these works as our cultural milestones, not as tombstones in patriarchy's graveyard, David Foster Wallace demonstrates that the encyclopedic novel is still alive and kickin' it.

            As with The Tunnel, sheer style is the first attraction of Infinite Jest. Even in his precocious first novel, The Broom of the System (1987), Wallace was unfurling long, complex sentences, by turns sonorous and satirical, that were a joy to behold. Infinite Jest displays a wider range of styles---from the subliterate monologue of a poverty-stricken abused woman to technical explications of the properties of various pharmaceuticals---but the main narrative style is both casual and complex, slangy and erudite, a kind of slacker mandarin with comically manic specificity of detail. Even if you have trouble following the multiplex narrative at the macro level Wallace offers huge entertainment value at the micro level, flaunting (but in a good way) an amazing command of late-twentieth-century English, with its proliferating technical terms, street slang, and babble of late capitalism. Only Gaddis and Pynchon have this range, and Wallace takes the language places even those two don't go.

            At the macro level, Infinite Jest consists of numerous ``anticonfluential'' (Wallace's word) episodes set a dozen years or so in the future (as was The Broom), at a time when numerical designations for years have been sold to corporate sponsors: hence we have the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment (in which most of the novel takes place), the Year of Glad, the Year of Dairy Products from the American Heartland, and so on. The narrative focuses on two suffering individuals: Hal Incandenza, a brilliant student and gifted tennis player attending the Enfield Tennis Academy and smoking way too much pot; and Don Gately, a petty criminal and recovering narcotics addict on staff at the nearby Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House (``Redundancy sic''), and the narrative shuttles between these two locations (both in the metro Boston area) with occasional side-trips to Arizona, where Hal grew up and where other members of the Incandenza family live. (There is a subplot concerning Quebecois separatists and a lethally entertaining video cartridge.) Thematically, the narrative shuttles between addiction and recovery.

            Addiction struck William S. Burroughs at midcentury as an encompassing metaphor for many facets of American life, and at century's end Wallace finds a similar metaphor in the recovery from addiction. While Burroughs dwelled with sadistic glee on the horrors of addiction, Wallace takes on the horrors of withdrawal; addiction in Burroughs was largely a response to the need to conform in the Eisenhower fifties, while in Wallace addiction is a response to stress, to the need to excel in the Reagan eighties (the novel's ``ethical'' setting, if not its historic one). Again like Burroughs---who is named in the text and seems a pretty clear influence---Wallace uses insect imagery to heighten the repugnance of addiction and detoxification. Infinite Jest is a Naked Lunch for the nineties.

            But there's more: tennis as a metaphysical activity; a hundred pages of endnotes, some with their own footnotes; a parody of an annotated filmography; mindbending excursions into game theory; a Workers Comp claim worthy of a Roadrunner cartoon; an essay-length explanation of why video-phones are doomed to fail; and some incredibly sad stories of damaged human beings with more problems than you'll ever have. The novel is so brilliant you need sunglasses to read it, but it has a heart as well as a brain. Infinite Jest is both a tragicomic* epic and a profound study of the postmodern condition.

*I originally wrote ``comic,'' but changed it to the more accurate ``tragicomic'' right before sending the issue to press; unfortunately, the version sent to Little, Brown was the earlier, uncorrected proof copy (some magazines do this to give publishers time to quote from it if they wish, as LB did here), hence the ``comic'' in the blurb that appeared in the cloth and paperback editions.

            I now regard Infinite Jest as perhaps the most important novel published in the 1990s and am grateful I had the opportunity to follow its gestation. Dave paid me a fine if underserved compliment by inscribing my copy of the first edition ``For Steve---Thank you. Your suggestions in 93/94 made this better.''

THE BLINDFOLD
By Siri Hustvedt

The Poseidon Press. 221 pp. $20

What is it to be a woman? 
To be contained, to be a vessel? 
To prefer a window to a door?
A pool to a river? . . . 
- Theodore Roethke

The point of this review is going to be that The Blindfold is a really good book.

The first neat thing about it is that the jacket copy and blurbs are interesting. Don DeLillo is arguably the best living fiction writer in the United States, and he rarely blurbs anybody except his good friend Paul Auster, and so DeLillo's endorsement carries weight, and on the back cover he calls this novel "completely urban and modern but working at the reader's emotions with the undistanced intimacy of a traditional tale." What's cunning about this blurb is that Siri Hustvedt's "tale," which is really four interconnected novellas, is "traditional" only in a very specific
sense.

Though features of The Blindfold will remind readers of any number of novelistic touchstones - Beckett's Molloy, Sartre's Nausea and Camus' The Fall, Fowles' The Magus and Auster's New York Trilogy - Hustvedt's accomplishment is hard to appreciate fully without reference to a loopy philosophical tradition that runs from Descartes to R.D. Laing and then back to Bishop Berkeley. Because the most impressive thing about this novel is its ingenious distaff inversion of that most haunting preoccupation of modern art-fiction, the problem of philosophical skepticism.

The problem of skepticism is Cartesian and phallocentric and presumes the ontological priority of the Subject: I know I exist OK, but how can I trust my perceptions enough to be equally sure that any of the non-me Objective stuff I seem to see around me exists, etc. Since your thinking man avoids solipsism at just about any cost, this skeptical Subjective insecurity - in which the integrity of the self depends on an efferent relation between the Subject as active perceiver and world as reliable Object - sits brooding astride the whole canon of Anglo-American 20th-century lit, from Eliot and Joyce to Bellow and Larkin.

A defining characteristic of this century's important feminist fictions, though, has been its obversion of the skeptical dilemma. The best feminist lit has co-opted ideas such asquantum theory's axiom that any observation affects its object, post-structuralism's revolt against the "metaphysics of presence," and existentialism's (Heidegger's, Sartre's, Laing's) idea that the really significant ontological insecurity is that of the self about itself, all to alter the skeptical angst-dynamic in their best fictions from Subject-ive to Object-ive.

Instead of a secure Subject brooding Cartesianishly over the reliability of an Exterior's appearance, most interesting feminist novels involve the ontological insecurity of a female whose sense of her own authentic existence is bound up with how she herself is perceived by other (male) Subjects. The philosophical touchstone of important novels such as Jean Rhys' Good Morning, Midnight or Kathy Acker's The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula is not Descartes but Bishop Berkeley, whose ultra-empiricist tenet that existence consists all and only in being perceived is way more congenial to a gender whose sense of authenticity has for a long time been dependent on an afferent relation between the self as alluring Object and the world as a male Subject whose attention defines her sexual (the equivalent, for these feminists, of ontological) security.

The Blindfold is the best novel I've ever read in this Berkeley/Laing mode. In contrast to Rhys, whose portraits of disintegrating female selves were prescient but sort of simplistic and freighted with a passive self-pity, and Acker, who's up on all kinds of cutting-edge French theory but is crippled by easy anger and a penchant for cute, easy formal tricks like rendering her females' ontological fragmentation through sharp juxtapositions of different narratives and enraged autobiography, Hustvedt's protagonist Iris (her name both an inversion of the author's "Siri" and, literally, a perceiving eye) struggles to establish an actual self - literally to make herself up - in the face of relentless and surreal objectification by the males she's drawn to. Here the book's jacket copy is not only accurate but incisive: It describes The Blindfold as "a story particular to our time, when a woman no longer expects to move from parents to husband but must forge a separate identity to hold at bay that which others impose upon her."

Written in self-consciously simple English, this intricate novel's best complexity is the neurasthenic Iris' ambivalence about her objectification by Others - all of whom both attract and repel her - so that she's split not only existentially but emotionally. This seems real. And her ambivalence is justified by the hypnotic power with which Hustvedt constructs Iris' manipulative Others: the weird old hack writer who hires Iris to compose descriptions of a murdered girl's personal effects; the demented, ''disintegrated" old woman who sees in an invalided Iris a reflection of her own shattered identity; the gifted photographer whose truncated portrait of Iris becomes a triangular third character and destroys her relation with a lover who prefers the photo to the real woman; the academic superstar whose translation of a fake (?) novella called The Brutal Boy plunges Iris into a schizoid transsexual identification with the story's sadistic protagonist.

None of these synopses does the jeweler-fine complexity of the four narratives' plots justice. It's not surprising that a couple of them won great praise and Best-Of anthologizing when they were published as short stories in literary magazines: each of the novellas ends up a moving, troubling story about metaphysical erasure: In her struggle to construct a self in a relationship with males and elders (rather than in some cruder, Ackerish opposition to them), Iris ends up dismantling others' psyches to the precise extent that she preserves the integrity of her own.

What is remarkable is the haunting effect of these novellas' combination. Hustvedt has created in Iris both a stunning synecdoche of female skepticism - a fecund, symbolic exploration of the question whether a distinctively female character is even possible - and a compelling, utterly three-dimensional fictional character, a heroine in every old and some new senses of the world.

The Blindfold both intrigues and annoys in its efforts to align itself with another tradition, too. It's not surprising that Don DeLillo's praise adorns the jacket, because The Blindfold is clearly a feminist reworking of some of the central themes of DeLillo and his literary compadre, Paul Auster. Lines like "'What you've forgotten is that some things are unspeakable. . . . Words may cover it up for a while, but then it comes howling back"' and "There is no end to such discussions. They wind in on themselves" sound almost straight out of Great Jones Street or White Noise.

Hustvedt's preoccupation with silence and the untellable, inanimate objects and their spatial arrangement, the modal potency of names, the geometric expansion of images, even the urban-blighted surrealism of the novel's setting are overwhelmingly reminiscent of DeLillo and Auster. And so are her prose rhythms, developed carefully via short sentences and oblique repetitions. A problem is that The Blindfold's prose lacks both DeLillo's wit and ear for speech and Auster's lapidary compression and lucidity.

Blurbers praise this novel's "brainwave-altering prose," but I think they confuse style here with tone. The narrative tone is masterly - at once flat and sharp, disassociated and intimate - but the prose itself is sometimes so clunky it seems as if it has been poorly translated from some foreign language. Besides dialogue that often sounds stilted and written, The Blindfold is also pocked with ponderous bits of exposition like "The connection seemed rife with meaning, and yet it spawned nothing inside me but a feeling akin to guilt" and "I didn't know what the words meant, but they seemed to identify an amorphous truth."

It seems fair to point out the ways Hustvedt is inferior to DeLillo and Auster, since she seems to try so hard to associate her work with theirs. Besides the DeLilloish meditations, The Blindfold is dedicated to Auster, has characters eating in restaurants named after Auster novels like Moon Palace, and is studded with weird throw-aways like "I heard someone shout the name Paul. I waited for an answer. None came." Since Hustvedt is Auster's spouse, I guess some of these are at least explainable. But a little of this stuff goes a long way. At certain points the reader gets the sense that The Blindfold is in some ways a roman a clef, except a cozy inter-author roman a clef, with inside jokes and references from which those outside a small circle are consciously excluded.

I am giving these flaws so much attention because they're just about the only ones I could find. I don't know that I'd call this novel fun to read, but it's very powerful, and awfully smart and well-crafted, a clear bright sign that the feminist and post-modern traditions in America are far from exhausted. For its sensitive, surreal illumination of the Objectified psyche, The Blindfold is likely to end up recognized as one of the more important first novels to appear in this decade.}}

By David Foster Wallace
Fiction Writer Magazine, September 1998

The best metaphor I know of for being a fiction writer is in Don DeLillo's "Mao II," where he describes a book-in-progress as a kind of hideously damaged infant that follows the writer around, forever crawling after the writer (dragging itself across the floor of restaurants where the writer's trying to eat, appearing at the foot of the bed first thing in the morning, etc.), hideously defective, hydrocephalic and noseless and flipper-armed and incontinent and retarded and dribbling cerebo-spinal fluid out of its mouth as it mewls and blurbles and cries out to the writer, wanting love, wanting the very thing its hideousness guarantees it'll get: the writer's complete attention.

The damaged-infant trope is perfect because it captures the mix of repulsion and love the fiction writer feels for something he's working on. The fiction always comes out so horrifically defective, so hideous a betrayal of all your hopes for it -- a cruel and repellent caricature of the perfection of its conception -- yes, understand: grotesque because _imperfect_. And yet it's yours, the infant is, it's _you_, and you love it and dandle it and wipe the cerebro-spinal fluid off its slack chin with the cuff of the only clean shirt you have left (you have only one clean shirt left because you haven't done laundry in like three weeks because finally this one chapter or character seems like it's finally trembling on the edge of coming together and working and you're terrified to spend any time on anything other than working on it because if you look away for a second you'll lose it, dooming the whole infant to continued hideousness). And but so you love the damaged infant and pity it and care for it; but also you hate it -- _hate_it_ -- because it's deformed, repellent, because something grotesque has happened to it in the parturition from head to page; hate it because its deformity is _your_ deformity (since if you were a better fiction writer your infant would of course look like one of those babies in catalogue ads for infant wear, perfect and pink and cerebro-spinally continent) and its every hideous incontinent breath is a devastating indictment of _you_, on all levels...and so you want it dead, even as you dote and wipe it and dandle it and sometimes even apply CPR when it seems like its own grotesqueness has blocked its breath and it might die altogether.

The whole thing's all very messed up and sad, but simultaneously it's also tender and moving and noble and cool -- it's a genuine _relationship_, of a sort -- and even at the height of its hideousness the damaged infant somehow touches and awakens what you suspect are some of the very best parts of you: maternal parts, dark ones. You love your infant very much. And you want others to love it, too, when the time finally comes for the damaged infant to go out and face the world.

FOOLISH OR FOOLING?

So you're in a bit of a dicey position: You love the infant and you want others to love it but that means that you hope others won't see it _correctly_. You want to sort of fool people; you want them to see as perfect what you in your heart know is a betrayal of all perfection.

Or else you don't want to fool these people; what you want is you want them to see and love a lovely, miraculous, perfect, ad-ready infant and to be _right_, _correct_, in what what they see and feel. You want to be terribly wrong, you want the damaged infant's hideousness to turn out to have been nothing but your own weird delusion or hallucination. But that'd mean you were crazy; you have seen, been stalked by, and recoiled from hideous deformities that in fact (others persuade you) aren't there at all. Meaning you're at least a couple of fries short of a Happy Meal, surely. But worse: It'd also mean you see and despise hideousness in a thing _you_ made (and love), in your spawn and in certain ways _you_.

And this last, best hope -- this'd represent something way worse than just very bad parenting; it'd be a terrible kind of self-assault, almost self-torture. But that's still what you most want: to be completely, insanely, suicidally wrong.

FUN WHERE YOU FIND IT

But it's still a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong. As to the nature of that fun, I keep remembering this strange little story I heard in Sunday school when I was about the size of a fire hydrant. It takes place in China or Korea or someplace like that. It seems there was this old farmer outside a village in the hill country who worked his farm with only his son and his beloved horse. One day the horse, who was not only beloved but vital to the labor-intensive work on the farm, picked the lock on his corral or whatever and ran off into the hills. All the old farmer's friends came around to exclaim what bad luck this was. The farmer only shrugged and said, "Good luck, bad luck, who knows?" A couple days later the beloved horse returned from the hills in the company of a whole priceless herd of wild horses, and the farmer's friends all come around to congratulate him on what good luck the horse's escape turned out to be. "Good luck, bad luck, who knows?" is all the farmer says in reply, shrugging. The farmer now strikes me as a bit Yiddish-sounding for an old Chinese farmer, but this is how I remember it. But so the farmer and his son set about breaking the wild horses, and one of the horses bucks the son off his back with such wild force that the son breaks his leg. And here come the friends to commiserate with the farmer and curse the bad luck that had ever brought these accursed horses onto the farm. The old farmer just shrugs and says, "Good luck, bad luck, who knows?" A few days later the Imperial Sino-Korean Army or something like that comes marching through the village, conscripting every able-bodied male between like 10 and 60 for cannon-fodder for some hideously bloody conflict that's apparently brewing, but when they see the son's broken leg, they let him off on some sort of feudal 4F, and instead of getting shanghaied the son stays on the farm with the old farmer. Good luck? Bad luck?

This is the sort of parabolic straw you cling to as you struggle with the issue of fun, as a writer. In the beginning, when you first start out trying to write fiction, the whole endeavor's about fun. You don't expect anybody else to read it. You're writing almost wholly to get yourself off. To enable your own fantasies and deviant logics and to escape or transform parts of yourself you don't like. And it works -- and it's terrific fun. Then, if you have good luck and people seem to like what you do, and you actually start to get paid for it, and get to see your stuff professionally typeset and bound and blurbed and reviewed and even (once) being read on the a.m. subway by a pretty girl you don't even know it seems to make it even _more_ fun. For a while. Then things start to get complicated and confusing, not to mention scary. Now you feel like you're writing for other people, or at least you hope so. You're no longer writing just to get yourself off, which -- since any kind of masturbation is lonely and hollow -- is probably good. But what replaces the onanistic motive? You've found you very much enjoy having your writing liked by people, and you find you're extremely keen to have people like the new stuff you're doing. The motive of pure personal starts to get supplanted by the motive of being liked, of having pretty people you don't know like you and admire you and think you're a good writer. Onanism gives way to attempted seduction, as a motive. Now, attempted seduction is hard work, and its fun is offset by a terrible fear of rejection. Whatever "ego" means, your ego has now gotten into the game. Or maybe "vanity" is a better word. Because you notice that a good deal of your writing has now become basically showing off, trying to get people to think you're good. This is understandable. You have a great deal of yourself on the line, writing -- your vanity is at stake. You discover a tricky thing about fiction writing; a certain amount of vanity is necessary to be able to do it all, but any vanity above that certain amount is lethal. At some point you find that 90% of the stuff you're writing is motivated and informed by an overwhelming need to be liked. This results in shitty fiction. And the shitty work must get fed to the wastebasket, less because of any sort of artistic integrity than simply because shitty work will cause you to be disliked. At this point in the evolution of writerly fun, the very thing that's always motivated you to write is now also what's motivating you to feed you writing to the wastebasket. This is a paradox and a kind of double-bind, and it can keep you stuck inside youself for months or even years, during which period you wail and gnash and rue your bad luck and wonder bitterly where all the _fun_ of the thing could have gone.

TRY TO REMEMBER

The smart thing to say, I think, is that the way out of this bind is to work your way somehow back to your original motivation -- fun. And, if you can find your way back to fun, you will find that the hideously unfortunate double-bind of the late vain period turns out really to have been good luck for you. Because the fun you work back to has been transfigured by the extreme unpleasantness of vanity and fear, an unpleasantness you're now so anxious to avoid that the fun you rediscover is a way fuller and more large-hearted kind of fun. It has something to do with Work as Play. Or with the discovery that disciplined fun is more than impulsive or hedonistic fun. Or with figuring out that not all paradoxes have to be paralyzing. Under fun's new administration, writing fiction becomes a way to go deep inside yourself and illuminate precisely the stuff you don't want to see or let anyone else see, and this stuff usually turns out (paradoxically) to be precisely the stuff all writers and readers everywhere share and respond to, feel. Fiction becomes a weird way to countenance yourself and to tell the truth instead of being a way to escape yourself or present yourself in a way you figure you will be maximally likable. This process is complicated and confusing and scary, and also hard work, but it turns out to be the best fun there is.

The fact that you can now sustain the fun of writing only by confronting the very same unfun parts of yourself you'd first used writing to avoid or disguise is another paradox, but this one isn't any kind of bind at all. What it is is a gift, a kind of miracle, and compared to it the rewards of strangers' affection is as dust, lint.

What's the difference between a Hollywood special-effects blockbuster like "Terminator 2" and a hard-core porn film? Very little, claims novelist, essayist and footnote fetishist David Foster Wallace.

1990s moviegoers who have sat clutching their heads in both awe and disappointment at movies like "Twister" and "Volcano" and "The Lost World" can thank James Cameron's "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" for inaugurating what's become this decade's special new genre of big-budget film: Special Effects Porn. "Porn" because, if you substitute F/X for intercourse, the parallels between the two genres become so obvious they're eerie. Just like hard-core cheapies, movies like "Terminator 2" and "Jurassic Park" aren't really "movies" in the standard sense at all. What they really are is half a dozen or so isolated, spectacular scenes -- scenes comprising maybe twenty or thirty minutes of riveting, sensuous payoff -- strung together via another sixty to ninety minutes of flat, dead, and often hilariously insipid narrative.

"T2," one of the highest-grossing movies in history, opened six years ago. Think of the scenes we all still remember. That incredible chase and explosion in the L.A. sluiceway and then the liquid metal T-1000 Terminator walking out of the explosion's flames and morphing1 seamlessly into his Martin-Milner-as-Possessed-by-Hannibal-Lecter corporeal form. The T-1000 rising hideously up out of that checkerboard floor, the T-1000 melting headfirst through the windshield of that helicopter, the T-1000 freezing in liquid nitrogen and then collapsing fractally apart. These were truly spectacular images, and they represented exponential advances in digital F/X technology. But there were at most maybe eight of these incredible sequences, and they were the movie's heart and point; the rest of "T2" is empty and derivative, pure mimetic polycelluloid.

It's not that "T2" is totally plotless or embarrassing -- and it does, admittedly, stand head and shoulders above most of the F/X Porn blockbusters that have followed it. It's rather that "T2" as a dramatic narrative is slick and cliche and calculating and in sum an appalling betrayal of 1984's "The Terminator." "T1," which was James Cameron's first feature film and had a modest budget and was one of the two best U.S. action movies of the entire 1980s,2 was a dark, breathlessly kinetic, near-brilliant piece of metaphysical Ludditism. Recall that it's A.D. 2027 and that there's been a nuclear holocaust in 1997 and that chip-driven machines now rule, and "Skynet," the archonic diabolus ex machina, develops a limited kind of time-travel technology and dispatches the now classically cyborgian A. Schwarzenegger back to 1984's Los Angeles to find and terminate one Sarah Connor, the mother-to-be of the future leader of the human "Resistance," one John Connor;3 and that apparently the Resistance itself somehow gets one-time-only access to Skynet's time-travel technology and sends back to the same space-time coordinates a Resistance officer, the ever-sweaty but extremely tough and resourceful Kyle Reese, to try desperately to protect Ms. Sarah Connor from the Terminator's prophylactic advances,4 and so on. It is, yes, true that Cameron's Skynet is basically Kubrick's HAL, and that most of "T1"'s time-travel paradoxes are reworkings of some fairly standard Bradbury-era science fiction themes, but "The Terminator" still has a whole lot to recommend it. There's the inspired casting of the malevolently cyborgian Schwarzenegger as the malevolently cyborgian Terminator, the role that made Ahnode a superstar and for which he was utterly and totally perfect (e.g. even his goofy 16-r.p.m. Austrian accent added a perfect little robofascist tinge to the Terminator's dialogue5). There's the first of Cameron's two great action heroines6 in Sarah Connor, as whom the limpid-eyed and lethal-lipped Linda Hamilton also turns in the only great performance of her career. There is the dense, greasy, marvelously machinelike look of "The Terminator"'s mechanized F/X;7 there are the noirish lighting and Dexedrine pace that compensate ingeniously for the low budget and manage to establish a mood that is both exhilarating and claustrophobic.8 Plus "T1"'s story had at its center a marvelous "Appointment-in-Samarra"-like irony of fate: we discover in the course of the film that Kyle Reese is actually John Connor's father,9 and thus that if Skynet hadn't built its nebulous time machine and sent back the Terminator, Reese wouldn't have been back here in '84, either, to impregnate Sarah C. This also entails that meanwhile, up in A.D. 2027, John Connor has had to send the man he knows is his father on a mission that J.C. knows will result in both that man's death and his (i.e. J.C.'s) own birth. The whole ironic mess is simultaneously Freudian and Testamental and is just extraordinarily cool for a low-budget action movie.

Its big-budget sequel adds only one ironic paradox to "The Terminator"'s mix: in "T2," we learn that the "radically advanced chip"10 on which Skynet's CPU is (will be) based actually came (comes) from the denuded and hydraulically pressed skull of "T1"'s defunct Terminator...meaning that Skynet's attempts to alter the flow of history bring about not only John Connor's birth but Skynet's own, as well. All "T2"'s other important ironies and paradoxes, however, are unfortunately unintentional and generic and kind of sad.

Note, for example, the fact that "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," a movie about the disastrous consequences of humans relying too heavily on computer technology, was itself unprecedently computer-dependent. George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, subcontracted by Cameron to do "T2"'s special effects, had to quadruple the size of its computer graphics department for the T-1000 sequences, sequences which also required digital-imaging specialists from around the world, thirty-six state-of-the-art Silicon Graphics computers, and terabytes of specially invented software programs for seamless morphing, realistic motion, digital "body socks," background-plate compatibility, congruence of lighting and grain, etc. And there is no question that all the lab work paid off: in 1991, "Terminator 2"'s special effects were the most spectacular and real-looking anybody had ever seen. They were also the most expensive."T2" is thus also the first and best instance of a paradoxical law that appears to hold true for the entire F/X Porn genre. It is called the Inverse Cost and Quality Law, and it states very simply that the larger a movie's budget is, the shittier that movie is going to be. The case of "T2" shows that much of the ICQL's force derives from simple financial logic. A film that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make is going to get financial backing if and only if its investors can be maximally -- maximally -- sure that at the very least they will get their hundreds of millions of dollars back11 -- i.e. a megabudget movie must not fail (and "failure" here means anything less than a runaway box-office hit) and must thus adhere to certain reliable formulae that have been shown by precedent to maximally ensure a runaway hit. One of the most reliable of these formulae involves casting a superstar who is "bankable" (i.e. whose recent track record of films shows a high ROI). The studio backing for "T2'''s wildly sophisticated and digital F/X therefore depends on Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger agreeing to reprise his Terminator role. Now the ironies start to stack, though, because it turns out that Schwarzenegger -- or perhaps more accurately "Schwarzenegger, Inc.," or "Ahnodyne" -- has decided that playing any more malevolent cyborgs would compromise the Leading Man image his elite and bankable record of ROI entails. He will do the film only if "T2"'s script is somehow engineered to make the Terminator the Good Guy. Not only is this vain and stupid and shockingly ungrateful,12 it is also common popular knowledge, duly reported in both the trade and the popular entertainment media before "T2" even goes into production. There's consequently a weird postmodern tension to the way we watch the film; we're aware of what the bankable star's demands were, and we're also aware of how much the movie cost and how important bankable stars are to a big-budget movie; and so one of the few things that keeps us on the edge of our seats during the movie is our suspense about whether James Cameron can possibly weave a plausible, non-cheesy narrative that meets Schwarzenegger's career needs without betraying "T1"'s precedent.

Cameron does not succeed, at least not in avoiding heavy cheese. Recall the premise he settles on for "T2": that Skynet once again uses its (apparently not all that limited) time-travel device, this time to send a far more advanced liquid metal T-1000 Terminator back to 1990s L.A., this time to kill the ten-year-old John Connor (played by the extremely annoying Edward Furlong,13 whose voice keeps cracking pubescently and who's just clearly older than ten), and that the intrepid human Resistance has somehow captured, subdued, and "reprogrammed" an old Schwarzenegger-model Terminator -- resetting its CPU's switch from TERMINATE to PROTECT, apparently14 -- and then has somehow once again gotten one-time access to Skynet's time-travel technology15 and sent the Schwarzenegger Terminator back to protect young J.C. from the T-1000's infanticidal advances.16

Cameron's premise is financially canny and artistically dismal: it permits "Terminator 2"'s narrative to clank along on the rails of all manner of mass-market formulae. There is, for example, no quicker or easier ingress to the audience's heart than to present an innocent child in danger, and of course protecting an innocent child from danger is heroism at its most generic. Cameron's premise also permits the emotional center of "T2" to consist of the child and the Terminator "bonding," which in turn allows for all manner of familiar and reliable devices. Thus it is that "T2" offers us cliche explorations of stuff like the conflicts between Emotion and Logic (territory already mined to exhaustion by "Star Trek") and between Human and Machine (turf that's been worked in everything from "Lost in Space" to "Blade Runner" to "Robocop"), as well as exploiting the good old Alien - or - Robot - Learns - About - Human - Customs - and - Psychology - From - Sarcastic - and/or - Precocious - but - Basically - Goodhearted - Human - with - Whom - It - Bonds formula (q.q.v. here "My Favorite Martian" and "E.T." and "Starman" and "The Brother From Another Planet" and "Harry and the Hendersons" and "Alf" and ad almost infinitum). Thus it is that the 85% of "T2" that is not mind-blowing digital F/X sequences subjects us to dialogue like: "Vhy do you cry?" and "Cool! My own Terminator!" and "Can you not be such a dork all the time?" and "This is intense!" and "Haven't you learned that you can't just go around killing people?" and "It's OK, Mom, he's here to help" and "I know now vhy you cry, but it's somesing I can never do"; plus to that hideous ending where Schwarzenegger gives John a cyborgian hug and then voluntarily immerses himself in molten steel to protect humanity from his neural net CPU, raising that Fonziesque thumb as he sinks below the surface,17 and the two Connor hug and grieve, and then poor old Linda Hamilton -- whose role in "T2" requires her not only to look like she's been doing nothing but Nautilus for the last several years but also to keep snarling and baring her teeth and saying stuff like "Don't fuck with me!" and "Men like you know nothing about really creating something!" and acting half-crazed with paramilitary stress, stretching Hamilton way beyond her thespian capacities and resulting in what seems more than anything like a parody of Faye Dunaway in "Mommy Dearest" -- has to give us that gooey "I face the future with hope, because if a Terminator can learn the value of human life, maybe we can, too" voiceover at the very end.

The point is that head-clutchingly insipid stuff like this puts an ever heavier burden of importance on "T2"'s digital effects, which now must be stunning enough to distract us from the formulaic void at the story's center, which in turn means that even more money and directional attention must be lavished on the film's F/X. This sort of cycle is symptomatic of the insidious three-part loop that characterizes Special Effects Porn --

ONE: Astounding digital dinosaur / tornado / volcano / Terminator effects that consume almost all the director's creative attention and require massive financial commitment on the part of the studio;

TWO: A consequent need for guaranteed megabuck ROI, which entails the formulaic elements and easy sentiment that will assure mass appeal (plus will translate easily into other languages and cultures, for those important foreign sales...);

THREE: A director -- often one who's shown great talent in earlier, less expensive films -- who is now so consumed with realizing his spectacular digital vision, and so dependent on the studio's money to bring the F/X off, that he has neither the leverage nor the energy to fight for more interesting or original plots / themes / characters.

-- and thus yields the two most important corollary formulations of the Inverse Cost and Quality Law:
(ICQL(a)) The more lavish and spectacular a movie's special effects, the shittier that movie is going to be in all non-F/X respects. For obvious supporting examples of ICQL (a), see lines 1-2 of this article and/or also "Jurassic Park," "Independent Day," "Forrest Gump," etc.

(ICQL (b)) There is no quicker or more efficient way to kill what is interesting and original about an interesting, original young director than to give that director a huge budget and lavish F/X resources. The number of supporting examples of ICQL (b) is sobering. Have a look, e.g., at the difference between Rodriguez's "El Mariachi" and his "From Dusk to Dawn," between DeBont's "Speed" and "Twister," between Gilliam's "Brazil" and "Twelve Monkeys," between Bigelow's "Near Dark" and "Strange Days." Or chart Cameron's industry rise and artistic decline from "T1" and "Aliens" through "T2" and "The Abyss" to -- dear Lord -- "True Lies." U.S. entertainment media report that Cameron's new "Titanic," currently in American release, is (once again) the most expensive and technically ambitious film of all time. Doubtless, Britons have been pricing trenchcoats and lubricants in anticipation of its arrival in the UK.

1 (Actually defined in the film as "mimetic polyalloy," whatever that's supposed to mean.)
2 The 1980s other B.U.S.A.M. was Cameron's second feature, the 1986 "Aliens," also modestly budgeted, also both hair-raising and deeply intelligent.
3 (Whose initials, for a prophesied saviour of humanity, are not particularly subtle.)
4 The fact that what Skynet is attempting is in effect a retroactive abortion, together with the fact that "terminate a pregnancy" is a pretty well-known euphemism, led the female I first saw the movie with in 1984 to claim, over coffee and pie afterwards, that "The Terminator" was actually one long pro-choice allegory, which I said I thought was not w/o merit but maybe a bit too simplistic to do the movie real justice, which led to kind of an unpleasant row.
5 Consider, for example, the now famous "I'll be back" line took on a level of ominous historical resonance when uttered by an unstoppable killing machine with a German accent. This was chilling and brilliant commercial postmodernism at its best; but it is also what made "Terminator 2"'s in-joke of having Ahnode repeat the line in a good-guy context is so disappointing.
6 It is a complete mystery why feminist film scholars haven't paid more attention to Cameron and his early collaborator Gale Ann Hurd. "The Terminator" and "Aliens" were both violent action films with tough, competent female protagonists (incredibly rare) whose toughness and competence in no way diminish their "femininity" (even more rare, unheard of), a femininity that is rooted (along with both films' thematics) in notions of maternity rather than just sexuality. For example, compare Cameron's Ellen Ripley with the panty-and-tank-top Ripley of Scott's "Alien." In fact it was flat-out criminal that Sigourney Weaver didn't win the '86 Oscar for her lead in Cameron's "Aliens." Marlee Matlin indeed. No male lead in the history of U.S. action films even approaches Weaver's second Ripley for emotional depth and sheer balls -- she makes Stallone, Willis, et. al. look muddled and ill.
7 (There is a ponderous, marvelous built-looking quality (complete with ferrous clanks and/or pneumatic hisses) that -- oddly enough -- at roughly the same time also distinguishes the special effects of Gilliam's "Brazil" and Paul Verhoeven's "Robocop." This was not cool only because the effects were themselves cool, but also because here were three talented young tech-minded directors who rejected the airy, hygenic look of Spielberg's and Lucas's F/X. The grimy density and preponderance of metal in Cameron's effects suggested that he was looking all the way back to M{\'e}{\'e}li{\`e}{\`e}s and Lang for visual inspiration.)
8 (Cameron would raise the use of light and pace to near-perfection in "Aliens," where just six alien-suited stuntmen and ingenious quick-cut editing resulted in some of the most terrifying Teeming Rapacious Horde scenes of all time. (By the way, sorry to be going on and on about "Aliens" and "The Terminator." It's just that they're great, great, commercial cinema, and nobody talks about them enough, and they're a big reason why "T2" was such a tragic and insidious development not only for 90s films but for James Cameron, whose first two films had genius in them.))
9 (So actually I guess it would be more like "Luke Skywalker's Appointment in Samarra" -- nobody said this was Art-Cinema or anything.)
10 (Viz. a "neutral net processor" based on an "uncooled superconductor," which I grieve to report is a conceit ripped off from Douglas Trumbull's 1983 "Brainstorm.")
11 The industry term for getting your money back plus that little bit of extra that makes investing in a movie a decent investment is ROI, which is short for Return on Investment.
12 Because Schwarzenegger -- compared to whom Chuck Norris is Olivier -- is not an actor or even a performer. He is a body, a form -- the closest thing to an actual machine in the history of the S.A.G. Ahnode's elite bankable status in 1991 was due entirely to the fact that James Cameron had had the genius to understand Schwarzenegger's essential bionism and to cast him in "T1."
13 It augurs ill for both Furlong and Cameron that within minutes of John Connor's introduction in the film we're rooting vigorously for him to be Terminated.
14 A complex and interesting scene where John and Sarah actually open up the Terminator's head and remove Ahnode's CPU and do some further reprogramming -- a scene where we learn a lot more about neural net processors and Terminative anatomy, and where Sarah is strung out and has kind of an understandable anti-Terminator prejudice and wants to smash the CPU while she can, and where John asserts his nascent command presence and basically orders her not to -- was cut from the movie's final version. Cameron's professed rational for cutting the scene was that the middle of the movie "dragged" and that the scene was too complex: "I could account for the Terminator's behavior changes much more simply." I submit that the Cameron of "T1" and "Aliens" wouldn't have talked this way. But another big-budget formula for ensuring ROI is that things must be made as simple for the audiences as possible; plot and character implausibilities are to be handled through distraction rather than resolved through explanation.
15 (Around which the security must be shockingly lax.)
16 That's the movie's main plot, but let's observe here that one of "T2'''s subplots actually echoes Cameron's Schwarzenegger dilemma and creates a kind of weird meta-cinematic irony. Whereas "T1" had argued for a certain kind of metaphysical passivity (i.e., fate is unavoidable, and Skynet's attempts to alter history serve only bring it about.) "Terminator 2"'s metaphysics are more active. In "T2," the Connors take a page from Skynet's book and try to head off the foreordained nuclear holocaust, first by trying to kill Skynet's inventor and then by destroying Cyberdyne's labs and the 1st Terminator's CPU (though why John Connor spends half the movie carrying the deadly CPU chip around in his pocket instead of just throwing it under the first available steamroller remains unclear and irksome). The point here is that the protagonists' attempts to revise the "script" of history in "T2" parallel the director's having to muck around with "T2"'s own script in order for Schwarzenegger to be in the movie. Multivalent ironies like this -- which require that film audiences know all kinds of behind-the-scenes stuff from watching Entertainment Tonight and reading Premiere magazine -- are not commercial postmodernism at it's finest.
17 (His hair doesn't quite catch on fire in the molten steel, though, which provokes intriguing speculation on what it's supposed to be made of.)}}

Vonnegut look humble and lovable, but as a response to the stuff

Good art is a kind of magic. It does magical things for both artist

describe the way this magic works, but the plain fact is that good art
is magical and precious and cool. It's hard to try and make good art,
and it seems to me wholly reasonable that good artists should be
concerned with their work's cultural reception. I thought it was brave
of Franzen to offer not only "lofty explanations" but honest and
intimate descriptions of how it feels to try and make good, serious
art in a culture that doesn't seem to value it very much. And I was
disappointed that the _Harper's_ Letters editor chose to run only
sneery, disparaging letters about the essay. I've spoken with way too
many readers and writers who admired Franzen's piece to believe
disparaging letters were all _Harper's_ got. I suppose one reason it
was brave of Franzen to publish his essay is that it made it easy for
other writers to look humble and adorable at his expense.

	Abstract = {DEMOCRACY AND COMMERCE AT THE U.S. OPEN 

By DAVID FOSTER WALLACE 

Our correspondent labored on Labor Day weekend at last year's U.S. Open: He noted--and footnoted--beauty on court and rampant free enterprise everywhere else 

Right now it's 1530h. on 3 September, the Sunday of Labor Day Weekend, the holiday that's come to represent the American summer's right bracket. But L.D.W. always falls in the middle of the U.S. Open;1 it's the time of the third and fourth rounds, the tournament's meat, the time of trench warfare and polysyllabic names. Right now, in the National Tennis Center's special Stadium--a towering sextagon2 whose N, S, E, and W sides have exterior banners saying "WELCOME TO THE 1995 U.S. OPEN--A USTA Event"--right now a whole inland sea of sunglasses and hats in the Stadium is rising to applaud as Pete Sampras and the Australian Mark Philippoussis are coming out on court, as scheduled, to labor. The two are coming out with their big bright athletic bags and their grim-looking Security escorts. The applause-acoustics are deafening. From down here near the court, looking up, the Stadium looks to be shaped like a huge wedding cake, and once past the gentler foothills of the box seats the aluminum stands seem to rise away on all sides almost vertically, so vertiginously steep that a misstep on any of the upper stairs looks like it would be certain and hideous death. The umpire sits in what looks like a lifeguard chair with little metal stirrups out front for his shoes,3 wearing a headset-mike and Ray-Bans and holding what's either a clipboard or a laptop. The DecoTurf court is a rectangle of off-green marked out by the well-known configuration of very white lines inside a bigger rectangle of off-green; and as the players cross the whole thing E-W to their canvas chairs, photographers and cameramen converge and cluster on them like flies clustering on what flies like--the players ignore them in the way that only people who are very used to cameras can ignore cameras. The crowd is still up and applauding, a pastel mass of 20,000+. A woman in a floppy straw hat three seats over from me is talking on a cellular phone; the man next to her is trying to applaud while holding a box of popcorn and is losing a lot of popcorn over the box's starboard side. The scoreboards up over the Stadium's N and S rims are flashing pointillist-neon ads for Evian water. Sampras, poor-postured and chestless, smiling shyly at the ground, his powder-blue shorts swimming down around his knees, looks a little like a kid wearing his father's clothes.4 Philippoussis, who chronologically really is a kid, is 6'4" and 200+ and is crossing the court with the pigeon-toed gait of a large man who's trying not to lumber, wearing the red-and-white candy-stripe Fila shirt so many of the younger Australians favor. The PM sun is overhead to the W-SW in a sky with air so clear you can almost hear the sun combusting, and the tiny heads of the spectators way up at the top of the W bleachers are close enough to the sun's round bottom to look to be almost on fire. The players dump their long bags and begin to root through them. Their racquets are in plastic they have to unwrap. They sit in their little chairs hitting racquet faces together and cocking their heads to listen for pitch. The cameramen around them disperse at the umpire's command, some trailing snakes of cord. Ball boys take crumpled bits of racquet plastic from under the players' chairs. 

A lady making her way in that sideways-processional way past seats in the row right beneath me wears a shirt advising all onlookers that they ought to Play Hard because Life Is Short. The man on her arm wears a (too-large) designer T-shirt decorated with images of U.S. currency. A firm/pleasant usher stops them halfway across the row to check their tickets. 1,500 citizens of the borough of Queens are employed at the Open today. Weekend labor. The ushers are at their fat chains stretched across the Stadium tunnels, all wearing chinos and but-ton-down shirts. The Security guys (all large and male, not a neck or a smile in sight) wear lemon-yellow knit shirts that do not flatter their guts. Chewing gum seems to be part of Security's issued equipment. The ball boys5 are in blue-and-white Fila, while the line judges and umpires are in (Fila) shirts of vertical red-black stripes that make them look like very hip major-sport refs. The Stadium's capacity is supposedly 20,000 and there are at least 23,000 people here, mostly to see Pete. If there were rafters people would be hanging from them, and I will be shocked if there isn't some major screaming fall-down-the-steps- or topple-backwards-over-the-rim-of-the-wall-type disaster before the match is done. The crowd down here near the court is for the most part adult-looking, businessish--in the Box Seats and pricey lower stands are neckties, sockless loafers, natty slacks, sweaters w/ arms tied across chests, straw boaters, L.L. Bean fishing hats, white caps with corporate names, jewelled bandeaux, high heels and resplendent feminine sunhats--with a certain very gradual casualizing as the fashion-eye travels up (and up) past the progressively cheaper seats, until the vertiginous top sections of the bleachers feature a NYC sporting event's more typical fishnet shirts and beer hats and coolers and makeshift spittoons, halter tops and fluorescent nail polish and rubber thongs, w/ attendant coarse NYC-crowd noises sometimes drifting down from way up high overhead.6 But apparently over 50% of tickets for this year's Open were pre-sold to corporations, who like to use them for the cultivation of clients and the entertainment of their own executives, and there is indeed about the Stadium crowd down here something indefinable that strongly suggests Connecticut license plates and very green lawns. In sum, the socioeconomic aura here for the day's headline match is one of management rather than labor. 

The players' umbrellas and chairs and big EVIAN-labeled barrels of drinks are on either side of the umpire's chair at the base of the Stadium's western cliff face, in a long thin patch of shade that ripples when the heads of the people way overhead move, and it's cool in that shade--it's cool for me, as well, in the shade of the very large man next to me, who's wearing a gorgeous blue cord three-piecer and what seems to be a kind of huge sombrero--but the sunlight is summery, the sun (as mentioned) explosive, seeming to swell as it lowers, at 1535h. positioned about 40 degrees above the Stadium's W battlements; and the Grandstand Court, attached to the Stadium's E flank, is knife-sliced by the well-known PM Grandstand shadow that Jim Courier is even now using to vivisect Kenneth Carlsen in full view of diners at Racquets (the impossible-to-get-into glass restaurant built into the wall that separates the Grandstand's W flank from the Stadium's E) and the 6,000+ crowd in there, a lot of whose nationalistic whistles and applause intrude into the Stadium's sonic fold and lend a kind of surreally incongruous soundtrack to Sampras's and Philippoussis's exchanges as they warm up. Sampras is hitting with the casual economy that all the really top pros seem to warm up with, the serene nonchalance of a creature at the very top of the food chain. The Wimbledon champion's presence aside, this third-rounder has a particular romance about it because it features two Greeks neither of whom are in fact from Greece, a kind of postmodern Peloponnesian War. Philippoussis, just 18, Patrick Rafter's doubles partner, ranked in the top 100 in this his first year on tour, potential superstar and actual heartthrob,7 resembles Sampras, somewhat--same one-handed backhand and slight loop on the forehand's backswing, same cafe-au-lait coloring and Groucho eyebrows and very black hair that gets glossy with sweat--but the Australian is slower afoot, and in contrast to Sampras's weird boneless grace he looks almost awkward, perilously large, his shoulders square the way heavy guys with bad backs' shoulders are square. Plus he seems to have aggression-issues that need resolving: He's hitting the ball as hard as he can even in warm-up. He seems brutish, Philippoussis does, Spartan, a big slow mechanical power-baseliner8 with chilly malice in his eyes; and against him, Sampras, who is not exactly a moonballer, seems almost frail, cerebral, a poet, both wise and sad, tired the way only democracies get tired, his expression freighted with the same odd post-Wimbledon melancholy that's dogged him all summer through Montreal, Cincinnati, etc. Thomas Enqvist's epic 2-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 first-rounder against Rios and Agassi's second-round squeaker against Corretja notwithstanding, it's tempting to see this upcoming match as the climax of the Open so far: two ethnically agnate and archetypally distinct foes, an opposition not just of styles of play but of fundamental orientations toward life, imagination, the uses of power . . . plus of course economic interests. 

Covering the four walls down around the Stadium Court is a kind of tarp, chlorine-blue,9 and on it, surrounding the court, are the white proper nouns FUJI-FILM, REDBOOK MAGAZINE, MASSMUTUAL, U.S. OPEN '95--A USTA Event, CAFE de COLOMBIA (complete w/a dotted white outline of Juan Valdez and devoted burro), INFINITI, TAMPAX, and so on.10 Professional tennis always gets called an international sport, but it would be more accurate to call it a multinational sport: Fiscally speaking, it exists largely as a marketing subdivision of very large corporations, and not merely of the huge Tour-underwriting conglomerates like IBM and Corel. The hard core of most professional players' earnings comes from product endorsement. Absolutely every venue and piece of equipment associated with pro events has some kind of ad on it. Even the official names of most pro tournaments are those of companies that have bid to be a "title sponsor": The Canadian Open this year was the "du Maurier Ltd. Open" (for a Canadian cigarette company), Munich was the "BMW Open," New Haven was the "Volvo International" (in '96 it's to be the "Pilot Pen International"), Cincinnati the "Thriftway ATP Championship," and so on. The U.S. Open,11 being a Slam and a national championship, doesn't have a title sponsor like Munich or Montreal; but instead of decommercializing the event, the tournament's Slam-status just makes the number of different commercial subsidizations more dizzying. The Open has an official sponsor not just for the tournament but for each of the tournament's various individual events: Infiniti sponsors the Men's Singles, Redbook the Women's Singles, MassMutual the Junior Boys, and so on.12

Now the umpire has ordered Play and Sampras is getting ready to serve, lifting the toe of his front foot on the toss's upswing in that distinctive way he has. I've never gotten to see Sampras play live before, and he's far more beautiful an athlete than he appears to be on TV. He's not particularly tall or muscley, but his serve is near-Wagnerian in its effect, and from this close up you can see that it's because Sampras has got some magic blend of flexibility and timing that lets him release his whole back and trunk into the serve--his whole body can snap the way normally just a wrist can snap--and that this has something to do with the hunched, coiled way he starts his service motion, lifting just the toe of his front foot and sighting over the racquet like a man with a crossbow, a set of motions that looks ticcy and eccentric on TV but in person makes his whole body look like one big length of muscle, a kind of angry eel getting ready to writhe. Philippoussis, who likes between points to dance a little in place, awaits service without facial affect. His headband matches his candy-stripe shirt. The scoreboards' displays are now set for keeping score instead of flashing ads. Philippoussis's name eats up a large horizontal section of each board. The wall between Stadium and Grandstand (so on our E) is topped by the press box, which runs along the wall's whole length and basically looks like the world's largest mobile home, all its windows' tinted shades now pulled against the PM sun. Three points have now yielded an ace, a service-return winner, and a long rally that ends when Philippoussis comes in on an approach that's not quite in the exact backhand corner and Sampras hits an incredibly top-heavy short angle past him into the ad service court. The fierceness of Sampras's backhand is something else that TV doesn't communicate well, his racquet-head control more like that of one of those stocky clay-courters with forearms like joints of mutton, the top-spin so heavy it distorts the ball's shape as the pass dips like a dropped thing. The malevolent but cyborgian Philippoussis hasn't betrayed anything like an actual facial expression yet. He also doesn't seem to perspire.13 Two older guys in the row right behind me are exhorting Sampras in low tones, addressing him as "Petey," and I can't help thinking they're friends of the family or something. And propped up over the press box--so at about the height of a radio station's aerial--is the 1995 U.S. Open's own ad for itself. It's an enormous pointillist pastel print of an N.T.C. Stadium's crowd around an outsized court, the perspective weirdly foreshortened, and then with the well-known Manhattan skyline ballooning in the immediate background in a way it decidedly does not in the real Flushing, Queens; and then above and beyond the billboard is the big zucchini of the Fuji Inc. blimp floating slowly against the cerulean of far and away the best summer sky I have ever seen around New York City. Not only is the '95 Open's L.D.W. air unhumid and in the 80s, the sunshine astringent and the breeze feathery and the sky the overvivid blue of a colorized film, but the sky's air is clean, the air smells fine and keen and sweet the way line-dried laundry smells, the result not only of a month without rain but also this weekend of a freak high-pressure front that's spiralled SW out of Nova Scotia's upper air and is blowing the oxides and odors that are NYC's deserved own out over New Jersey. The Stadium's bowl of air gets finer and keener the higher up in the stands you go, until, standing on top of somebody's smuggled Michelob cooler in the top row of bleachers14 and peering over the wall due E past the edge of the press box, looking down over the big sign that says you can see them, Them, coming, an enormous serpentine mass, the crowd, still at 1615h. coming, what looks from this distance like everybody in the city who hasn't retreated to the Hamptons for the long summer weekend. The U.S. Open is a big deal for NYC. Mayor Dinkins is gone--the Dinkins who used to reroute landing patterns at LaGuardia just for the Open--but even under Rudy Giuliani, for a fortnight a city that ordinarily couldn't give two chomps of its gum for a sport as patricianly non-contact as tennis is into the game in a very big way. 30-year-old arbitrageurs in nonrented tuxes at the Bowery Bar dissect matches and speculate on how Seles's hiatus from the game will affect her endorsement contracts now that she's back. Croatian doormen bemoan Ivanisevic's early departure. On the subway, a set of tough chicks in leather and fluorescent hair concur that even though Graf and Seles and that Spanish what's-her-face with the hymen15 in her name might rule let's don't for a second count out the U.S.'s Zina G. who this is her swan-song before, like, the bow-out. Or e.g., Friday, 1 September, the day after Agassi's five-set comeback against Corretja, a Lebanese driver on the Grey Line bus in from LaGuardia and a cigar-chewing old passenger he doesn't know from Adam bond over their shared assessments of Agassi's rehabilitation as a man: 

"It is like he used to be brat, arrogant--you know what I am saying?" 
"He grew up. Now he's got balls." 
"Last night, this was a great game he played. This is what I am saying." 
"He used to just be this hairball. Now he's grown up. Now he's a person."16

But so they're coming, 40,000 yesterday and 41,000 today, ready to shell out $25-$30 for a ticket if they can even get one.17 They come by infernal and Stygian IRT subway out to the end of the #7 line, the Shea-Willets stop. They converge on NE Queens via the Van Wyck and L.I. and Whitestone Expressways, the Interborough, the Grand Central Parkway, the Cross Bay, bringing much ready cash and whatever religious medals apply to parking spaces. City dwellers navigate by limo, cab or bus the empty canyons of L.D.W.'s Manhattan, bound for 36th St. and the Tunnel or 59th and the Queensborough Bridge, then travel forever up Northern Boulevard, bringing coolers and blankets and racquets and butt-cushions with GIANTS and JETS on them and sunscreen and souvenir hats from last year's Open, up Northern Blvd. under circling air traffic until the landmarks start emerging--the squat neutron-blue ring of nearby Shea Stadium; the huge steel armillary sphere and Tinkertoy-shaped tower of the '39 World's Fairgrounds that adjoin the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow Corona Park.18

The N.T.C.'s Main Gate is on the grounds' NE side, connected to the #7 train's subway stop and parking lots by a broad concrete promenade that leads from the commuter stations S past Park Rangers' offices and a couple of big open communitarian circles--the kind of open urban venues that look like they ought to have spurting fountains in the center, though these don't--with green benches and complex skateboarding and vigorous sinister underground commerce. At some point the promenade curves sharply W so that the Open's moving crowds pass within sight of rampant picnicking and soccer in F.M.C. Park (the "Meadow" part, apparently); then the walk-way's final blacktop straightaway's enclosed by high fences topped with flags of all nations as you head for the parallel lines for actual entry at the tournament's Main Gate, the Gate's own tall fencing black iron and almost medievally secure-looking and itself topped only by good old U.S. flags, with the Open's/USTA's familiar greeting and self-assertion in bright brave 160-point caps on a banner hanging over the turnstiles, of which turnstiles there are six total but never more than three in actual operation. The turnstiles are only for those who already have tickets19--the East-Bloc-length line for AM tickets at the Box Office evaporates every day by around 1100h., when stern megaphones announce the day's sellout. 

Besides the Stadium/Grandstand, there are three other N.T.C. "Show Courts," i.e., courts with serious bleachers. At 1640h., Court 16 is running men's doubles with Eltingh-Haarhuis, the world's #1 team, and its little wedge of aluminum stands isn't even full. American tennis crowds seem decisively singles-oriented. Court 17 has Korda and Kulti against the Mad Bahamian Mark Knowles and his 1995 partner Daniel Nestor, the Canadian who's fun to watch because he looks so much like an anorectic Mick Jagger. Court 18 has women's doubles with four players whose names I don't recognize and exactly 31 people in the stands. (All four of the females on 18 have bigger forearms than I do.) Natasha Zvereva, looking incomplete without Gigi, is warming up against Amy Frazier in the Grandstand. In the Stadium, Philippoussis and Sampras have split the first two sets, 6 and 5. What a big match sounds like outside the Stadium is brief strut-rattling explosions of applause and whistles and then the odd flat amplification of the umpire speaking into the abrupt silence his speaking has created. Daniel Nestor's last name, while also Hellenistic, is Homerian,20 thus allusive to a wartime way before Athens v. Sparta. The fact that Sampras has won so many Grand Slam titles may have a lot to do with the fact that Slams' males' matches are the best-of-five sets. Best-of-fives require not just physical endurance but a special kind of emotional flexibility: in best-of-fives you can't play with full-bore intensity the whole time; you have to know when to kind of turn it on and when to lay back and conserve your psychic resources.21 Philippoussis won the tie-break of a first set in which you got the impression that Sampras was sort of adjusting the idle on his game, trying to find the exact level he needed to reach. The suspense of the match isn't so much whether Sampras will win but how hard he'll have to play and how long it'll take him to find this out. Philippoussis hits very hard but has no imagination and even less flexibility. He's like a machine with just one gear: Unless forced out of his rhythm by a wide-angle shot, he moves exclusively in forward-backward vectors. Sampras, on the other hand, seems to float like dander all over the court.22 Philippoussis is like a great and terrible land army; Sampras is more naval, more of the drift-and-encircle school. Philippoussis is oligarchic: He has a will and seeks to impose it. Sampras is more democratic, i.e., more chaotic but also more human: His real job seems to be figuring out what his will exactly is. Not a lot of people remember that Athens actually lost the Peloponnesian War--it took 30 years, but Sparta finally ground them down. Nor do most people know that Athens in fact started the whole bloody thing in the first place by picking on maritime allies of Sparta who were cutting into Athens's sea trade. Athens's clean-cut nice-guy image is a bit overdone--the whole exhausting affair was about commerce right from the beginning. 

What's fun about having a U.S. Open '95 Media Pass is that you can go in and out of the Main Gate as often as you want. For paying customers there's no such luck: a sign by the turnstiles says ALL EXITS FINAL with multiple exclamation points. And the lines for entry at the three active turnstiles resemble those grim photos of trampling crowds at Third World soccer matches. Wizened little old men are paid by the tournament to stand by the turnstiles and take people's tickets--the same sort of wizened little old men you see at sporting-event turnstiles everywhere, the kind who always look like they should be wearing Shriners hats. Going through one turnstile right now at 1738h. is a handsome bald black man in an extremely snazzy Dries Van Noten camelhair suit. Pushing hip-first through the next turnstile23 is a woman in an electric-blue pantsuit of either silk or really good rayon. At the third active turnstile, a young foreignish-looking guy in an expensive flannel shirt w/ Ray-Bans and a cellular phone is in an argument with the turnstile's ticket-taker. The guy is claiming that he bought tickets for 9/3 but has mistakenly left them at home in Rye and will be damned if he is going to be forced by a minimum-wage little wizened ticket-taker into going all the way back to Rye to get them and then coming all the way back down here. He has his cellular phone in his hand, leaning over the ticket-taker: Surely, he insists, there's some way to verify his ticket-holding status without his going and coming all the way back to produce the actual stupid cardboard rectangles themselves. The ticket-taker, in a blue suit that makes him look a bit like a train's conductor, is shaking his gnarled little head and has his arms raised in that simultaneously helpless but firm gesture of Can't Help You, Mac. The young man in flannel from Rye keeps flipping his cellular open and starting to dial it in a menacing way, as if threatening to get the ticket-taker in Dutch with some shadowy figures from the Open's Olympian management heights; but the stolid little attendant's resolve stays firm, his face stony and his arms raised,24 until crowd pressure from customers at the flannel man's rear and flank force him to withdraw the field. 

The first thing you see when you come inside the Main Gate is teams of extremely attractive young people giving away free foil packets of Colombian Coffee from big plastic barrels with outlines of Juan Valdez & devoted burro on them. The young people, none of whom are of Colombian extraction, are cheery and outgoing but don't seem to be terribly alert, because they keep giving me new free samples every time I go out and then come in again, so that my bookbag is now stuffed with them and I'm not going to have to buy coffee for months. The next thing you see is a barker on a raised dais urging you to purchase a Daily Drawsheet for $2.0025 and a Program+Drawsheet for a bargain $8.00. Right near the barker is a gorgeous spanking-new Infiniti automobile on a complicated stand that places the car at a kind of dramatic plunging angle. It's not clear what the relation between a fine new automobile and professional tennis is supposed to be, but the visual conjunction of car and plunging angle is extremely impressive and compelling, and there's always a dense ring of spectators around the Infiniti, looking at it but not touching it. Then, over the Daily Drawsheet pitchman's right shoulder and situated suspiciously close to the Advance Ticket Window, is what has to be one of the largest free-standing autotellers in the Western world, with its own shade-awning and three separate cash stations with controls of NASA-like sophistication and complexity and enormous signs that say the autoteller's provided through the generosity of CHASE and that it is equipped to disgorge cash via the NYCE, PLUS, VISA, CIRRUS and MASTERCARD networks of auto-withdrawal. The lines for the autoteller are so long that they braid complexly into the lines for the nearest concession stands. These concession stands seem to have undergone a kind of metastasis since the year before: They now are absolutely everywhere on the N.T.C. grounds. One strongly suspects that the inside story. on how a concession at the U.S. Open is acquired would turn out to involve levels of intrigue and gamesmanship that make the tournament's on-court dramas look pallid, because it's clear that the really serious separation of spectator from his cash takes place at the N.T.C.'s concession venues, all of which are doing business on the sort of scale enjoyed by coastal grocery and hardware stores during a Hurricane Warning. The free-standing little umbrella'd venues for Evian and Haagen-Dazs are small potatoes: There are entire miniature strip-malls of refreshment stands gauntleting almost every sidewalk and walkway and easement on the grounds--even the annular ground-level tunnel of the Stadium/Grandstand--offering sodapop for $2.50-$3.50, $3.00 water, $3.00 little paper troughs of nachos or crosshatched disk-shaped French fries whose oil immediately soaks through the trough, $3.50 beer, $2.50 popcorn,26 etc.27

Now a huge roar that makes the whole Stadium's superstructure wobble signifies that the forces of democracy and human freedom have won the third set.28 It's quite clear that Sampras has found his cruising altitude and that Philippoussis is going to take the first set he won and treasure it and go home to do more bench-presses in preparation for the ATP's indoor season. 

I do not know who a certain Ms. or Mr. Feron is, but s/he must be a fearsomely powerful figure in the New York sports-concession industry, because a good 80% of all concession booths at the '95 Open have signs that say FERON'S on them. This goes not only for the edible concessions--whose stands have various names but all of whose workers seem to have pale-blue FERON'S shirts on--but also for the endless rows of souvenir-and tennis-related-product booths that flank whatever of the grounds' Hellesponts aren't flanked by food booths already. The really hard-core, big-ticket souvenirs are sold on the Stadium's E side, in an area between the plunging Infiniti and the IBM Match-In-Progress Board. There's racquetry and footwear and gear bags and warm-ups and T-shirts for sale at separate booths for Yonex, Fila, Nike,29 Head and William Serbin. There's a USTA booth offering free USTA T-shirts with a paid membership. But any item with a "U.S. OPEN '95"-mention on it is sold exclusively out of a FERON'S booth. Of these booths there are "0/40 at FERON'S," "FERON'S U.S. Open Silks," and "FERON'S U.S. Open Specials." It's not at all clear what the term "Specials" is meant to signify in terms of price: U.S. Open '95 T-shirts are $22 and $25. Tank-tops even more. Visors $18 and up. Sweatshirts are $49 and $54, depending on whether they're the dusty, acid-washed autumn colors so popular in '95. 

It's also clear that the sea-lanes of trade between FERON'S itself and the good old United States Tennis Association are wide open, because no official FERON'S souvenir says "U.S. Open '95" without also saying "A USTA Event" right underneath. 

The grounds don't exactly empty out between the end of the afternoon's slate of matches and the start of the evening's,30 but the crowds do thin a bit. Flushing Meadow gets chilly and pretty as the twilight starts. It's about 1900h., that time when the sun hasn't gone down yet but everything seems to be in something else's shadow. The ticket-takers at the Main Gate's turnstiles change shifts, and the consumers coming down the promenade are now dressed more in jeans and sweaters than shorts and thongs. Lights over all the N.T.C. courts go on together with an enormous thunk. The courtlight gives the underbelly of the hanging Fuji Blimp a weird ghostly glow. There's more serious, 5-Food-Group, dinnerish eating now going on at the International Food Village and in the Corporate Hospitality Areas. Sampras and Philippoussis have quit the field in the Stadium, Sampras bearing his shield and the Australian carried out upon his own (as it were). Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez are now warming up on the Stadium Court while people in the bleachers try to stagger very carefully down the steps to get out, lugging their coolers and cushions, looking simultaneously sunburned and cold. Coming up on the Grandstand Court is a mixed-doubles match I'm looking forward to because one of the teams on the program has the marvelous name "Boogert-Oosting." Various tangential singles matches are under way on Courts 16-18, and something that's fun is to go over to these Show Courts and not to go all the way in and sit in the little sets of stands but to stand on the path outside the heavy green windscreens around the Show Courts and watch the little stripe of bare fence near the bottom for the movement of feet and to try to extrapolate from the feet's movement what's going on in each point. One unbelievably huge pair of sneakers under the screen on Court 16 turns out--sure enough--to belong to Richard Krajicek, the 6'6" Dutchman who plays like a mad crane. These shoes have to be 16EEEs at least; you wouldn't believe it. I am holding a $4.00 kraut-dog and sodapop I would very much like to find someplace isolated and quiet to consume.

It is not at all quiet outside the Main Gate as true evening falls. Not only does the combined em- and immigration of crowds for the different Sessions make the whole promenade from Gate to subway stop and parking lots resemble the fall of Saigon. It's especially unquiet out here economically. I don't know whether this magazine will run an apercu of what all's going on out here as the sun falls, but I don't see why not, because it's not all that surprising. Since the 1995 U.S. Open is primarily--unabashedly--about commerce, and since commerce is by its nature uncontainable, it shouldn't be at all surprising that the most vigorous crepuscular commerce is taking place out here, outside the tournament's fence and Gate, in markets of all shade and hue. I have, e.g., in the last 20 minutes received three separate solicitations to buy pot (all wildly overpriced). The sweet burnt-pine smell of reefer is in the air all over out here, and one young guy in oversized fatigue pants is smoking a bone on a bench right next to a very neat and dapper old gentleman who's sitting with his hands folded primly and not giving any indication he smells anything untoward.31 Scalpers have upped the pressure of their pitches in the lengthening shadows and are practically applying half-nelsons to anybody on the promenade who seems even possibly to be looking for something, even if that something is just a quiet isolated place to eat a kraut-dog.32 As mentioned supra, I'm the proud possessor of a U.S. Open '95 Media Pass--which consists of a necklace of nylon cord from which hangs a large plastic card w/a direly unflattering little photo of me that hangs against my chest at about the level of a sommelier's tasting cup--and twice this evening outside the Main Gate I've been approached by somebody wanting to borrow the Media Pass and then slip it back to me through the black fence once they've strolled inside. One offer was a straight-out bribe, but the other involved a distinguished and corporate-looking gray-haired guy in green golfer's slacks who had a complex tale of woe about a tubercular niece or something who'd paid a surprise long-distance visit to NYC and whose fondest wish was to get in to the U.S. Open and that tickets were sold out, etc.33 I observed at least one turnstile's ticket-taker (not the flinty-eyed Throgs Neck ticket-taker) receive some sort of subtle maitre-d'ish payment for allowing somebody to bring in something spectators were by no stretch of the imagination allowed to bring into the N.T.C. If you don't have a Stadium ticket but have the NYC savvy and financial resources, certain Stadium ushers are said (by two separate reliable sources) to be willing to place you in a vacant seat--sometimes a really up-close and desirable seat--for a sub-rosa fee, and a percentage of this fee is then apparently kicked back to a certain enterprising person or persons in the National Tennis Center who know of seats that for one reason or another aren't going to be occupied during a certain interval and relay this information to ushers (for a price). Part of the beauty of the tennis here is the way the artistry and energy are bounded by specific lines on court, but the beauty of the commerce is the way it's un- and never bounded. It's all sort of hypnotic at night. The plunging Infiniti's leather interior gets somehow mysteriously illuminated when the sun goes down, so that from a distance the car seems like a beacon. Trash-can fires appear in F.M.C. Park's distance, and the #7 train's interior's also alit as it pulls into the overground Shea stop to the north. At about 2015h. there's a fracas near the I.F. Village involving some unscrupulous/enterprising employee of whatever company actually makes the" '95 Open"--emblazoned T-shirts and hats and c. for the souvenir booths, who's apparently diverted boxes and boxes of the shirts and stuff and is going around the grounds selling them on the sly at prices way below the booths' prices,34 and N.T.C. Security's involved, as well as--incongruously--what look like two Fire Department guys in slickers and fireman hats. It's on the whole kind of a younger and rowdier and more potentially sinister crowd that's coming in for the evening session. Their faces are stonier; eye contact seems hazardous the way eye contact on subways can be hazardous. 

Plus food: the various extracurricular food scares haven't yet been mentioned. Imagine the opportunities--not only the all-cash concession stands but the enormous tented kitchens for the Corporate Hospitality Areas and the "U.S. Open Club" for V.I.P.'s and so on, the massive sizzle and clatter of high-volume prep from these kitchens off along the south parts of the Main Gate. Let's not even get into the little easements behind the strips of food stands, the furtive and on the whole unauthorized-looking deliveries and removals of large boxes, the various transactions and scurryings. Forget examples of that. Here's a different incident. Let's close L.D.W. with this: 

Some of the time it's hard even to know what it is you re watching take place. In one of the big communitarian fountainless circles that the promenade opens into as it leads to the Main Gate--the circle closest to the Gate, this one is--one of the circle's green benches is controlled by gypsy-cab and -limo drivers waiting for anybody exiting who needs a gypsy-type ride back to Rye or Rockaway or wherever. Half a dozen of these guys sit on this bench in their cabbies' berets, waiting around, smoking cigars, talking s - - t, etc. I'm on the next bench trying to organize my notes. This is at about 2100h., late. From this circle you can see the rear flaps of some of the tented high-volume kitchens. Through one of these flaps now emerges a stocky young guy in the unmistakable tall hat and whites of a kitchen worker (though on his feet are $200 Air Jordans so new they glow in the N.T.C.'s ambient light, so he looks like he's floating). The kitchen worker's carrying a broad low cardboard box through the employee- and Media Pass-entrance in the Gate and down the promenade and across the circle, making for the bench with the cabbies. The cabbies are making gestures like: Finally, thank God. One of the cabbies rises and moves out and meets the kitchen worker; something subtle occurs between their hands that indicates a transfer of funds; and now the cabbie bears the box back to the bench, where the rest of the drivers circle and grab and reveal that the box is full of supper--burgers, chicken legs, wieners, etc. Vague contented noises from the cabbies on the bench as they dig in. 

"Goddamn rip-off," says a well-dressed Italian man next to me on my bench. I say, "Pardon me?" "Ripping the f - - - ing place off," the well-dressed Italian man says, indicating with a hand gesture the kitchen worker, who's now making his way quickly back to the kitchen tent, hand in his pocket. The Italian man has a small filtered cigar in his mouth and a disgusted look and is sitting back with his legs crossed and his elbows up on the bench's back's top in that insouciant way savvy New Yorkers sit on park benches. He has heavy brows and shoes with spats and a Eurocut silk pinstripe suit of the type that Cagney-era gangsters wore. You half expect him to have a white fedora and violin case. But it turns out, when he gives me his card, that he's a legit businessman, a concessioneer, here to labor instead of recreate/consume; he's here scouting out possibilities for opening a couple of stands here at the '97 Open, when the new Stadium will be up and even more vigorous attendance and commerce can be foreseen. The stands he wants to open'll sell gyros, he says. He's not Italian after all.

1 "A USTA Event."
2 Actually, if you count the Grandstand Court's annex, the whole thing looks more like an ablated head w/ neck-stump.
3 There's always something extremely delicate and precarious and vulnerable-looking about the umpire's shoes projecting out over the court from a height in little metal stirrups--the blend of authority and precarious vulnerability is just one of the things that makes an umpire such a compelling part of the whole show.
4 The tentish tops and near-Bermuda-length shorts of M. Jordan and the NBA have clearly infiltrated tennis. Nearly half the men in the 128 draw are wearing clothes that seem several sizes too big, and on players as fundamentally skinny and woebegone-looking as Sampras the effect is more waifish than stylish--though I have to say that weirdly oversized clothes aren't near the visual disaster that Agassi's new clunky black sneakers (also imported from basketball fashion) are.
5 (looking more like hall grad students, here, actually--several have earrings and leg hair, and one on the S side's got a big ginger beard)
6 The Open's crowds, I know, are legendary for being loud and vulgar and generally psycho, but I've got to say that most of the audiences for most of L.D.W.'s matches seem like people you'd be proud to take home and introduce to the folks. The odd hit of audible nastiness does sometimes issue from way up top in the Stadium's bleachers, but then usually only when there's been some flagrant injustice.
7 Females in the crowds of this year's Australian Open apparently screamed and fainted and made with Beatlemania-like histrionics whenever Rafter or Philippoussis appeared, and it's true that on the court they are both extremely handsome guys; but it's also true that Mark Philippoussis, close up, looks amazingly like Gaby Sabatini--I mean amazingly, right down to the walk and the jawline and the existentially affronted facial expression.
8 The Open's slow DecoTurf, which various rumors allege has had some kind of extra abrasive mixed in to make it even slower, favors the power-baseline game of Agassi, Courier et al.--even netophiles like Edberg and Krajicek have been staying back and whaling through the first two rounds.
9 The Open's administration is smart about providing the right visual backdrop for world-class play. The Stadium Court at the du Maurier Ltd. in Montreal this July had yellow bleachers at the north end that, according to players, made it tough to track balls coming from that end, whereas the N.T.C.'s Stadium's got blue tarps and white chairs and gray chairs, and even the bleachers are high-contrast red--there's nothing even close to the YG part of the spectrum unless you count the pale-yellow shirts of the Security guys who stand court-side with the crossed arms and beady eyes of Secret Servicemen.
10 The tarp ads around pro tennis courts function like ads on subways, I think. Ads on subways exploit the fact that subway rides present both a lot of mental downtime and a problem with what to look at--the windows are mostly dark, and looking directly at other people on the subway is an action that the lookee can interpret in a number of ways, some of which are uncomfortable or even hazardous--and the ads up over the windows are someplace neutral and adverting to rest the eye, and so they usually get a lot of attention. And tennis is also full of down-time--periods between points, changeovers between odd games--where the eye needs diverting. Plus, during play, the tarp acts as the immediate visual background to the players, and the eyes and cameras always follow the players--including TV--so that having your company's name hovering behind Sampras as the camera tracks him is a way both to get serious visual exposure for your company and to have that name associated, even on a subliminal level, with Sampras and tennis and excellence in general, etc. It all seems tremendously sophisticated and shrewd, psychologically speaking.
11 See FN1 again--the strong sense I got was that you are never to say "The U.S. Open" in any kind of public way without also saying "A USTA Event." Let's let the USTA's promotional appendix be implicit from now on; I don't feel like saying it over and over. The USTA gets something like 75% of its yearly operating revenues from the U.S. Open, and it's probably understandable that it would want to attach its name like a remora to the tournament's flank, but the constant imposition of "A USTA Event" all over the place got a little tiresome, I found, overtaxing the way relentless self-promotion is overtaxing, and I got a kind of unkind thrill out by the Main Gate's turnstiles when so many people coming in for the evening session of matches pointed up at the big sign over the Main Gate and asked each other what the hell "USTA" was, making it rhyme with a Boston pronunciation of "buster" or "Custer."
12 The names of all the various sponsors are on a big (very big) blue board just inside the National Tennis Center's Main Gate, with the bigger events' "presenting sponsors" on the left in huge caps, and in smaller caps on the right the names of pres. spons. of smaller events--Men's 35s Doubles, Mixed Doubles Masters--as well as other sponsors whose role is unclear beyond having paid a fee to sell concessions where appropriate and/or to have a PR booth on the grounds and a venue to call their own inside the Corporate Hospitality Areas (plus of course having their name on the v.b. blue board).
13 Another sort of endearing thing about Sampras is the way he always sweats through his baby-blue shorts in an embarrassing way that suggests incontinence and lets the world see just where his athletic supporter's straps are. This even TV's crude pictures can capture, and I think I like it so much because it humanizes Sampras and lets me identify with him in a way that the sheer preternatural beauty of his game does not. For me similar humanizing foibles in transcendent players were McEnroe's irrational fits of pique, Lendl and Navratilova's habit of every once in a while getting so nervous and choking so badly on a point that they looked almost spastic and the ball would actually hit the ground before it reached the net, and Connors's compulsive on-court touching and adjustment of his testes within his jock, as if he needed to know just where they were at all times.
14 Ascending in the Stadium goes like this: past 10 rows of dark-blue seats--actual plastic chairs, the Box Seats--then 15 rows of light-blue seats, then 18 of noticeably less comfortable gray, molded-plastic seats, then (the steps by now so steep they feel the way staircases feel to a small child) uncountable rows of plain red bleachers, the land of backwards Mets caps and tattoos and hightop sneakers w/ laces untied, the thick honk of Brooklyn accents, a great mass clicking of empty breeze-blown Liquor Bar cups on the cement of the bleachers' aisles . . . it's a climb during which the ears actually pop and the O2 gets thin and the perspective on the court below becomes horrific, like a skyscraper's, the players looking insectile and the crowd moving and heaving in a nauseous way that makes the place's whole structure seem slightly to heave and sway.
15 (sic--no kidding)
16 Agassi's new cybercrewcut, black sneakers, and weird new French-Resistance-fighter-style shirts have, at this year's Open, made him way more popular with male fans and only slightly less fascinatingly sexy for female fans. (Agassi's sex-symbolism's a phenomenon of deep mystery to most of the males I know, since we agree that we can all see clearly that Agassi's actually a runty, squishy-faced guy with a weird-shaped skull [which the crewcut's now made even more conspicuous] and the tiny-strided pigeon-toed walk of a schoolkid whose underwear's ridden up; and it remains completely inexplicable to us, Agassi's pull and hold on women.)
17 The National Tennis Center Box Office opens at 1000h., and people start lining up as early as 0600 hoping to get one of the day's Grounds Passes, and the various incentives and dramas in this AM line of street-savvy New Yorkers are a whole other story in themselves.
18 This is the actual name of the park that the USTA's National Tennis Center is in, a name almost perfect in its unconscious capture of NE Queens's summertime essence, connoting as it does equal parts urban sewage, suburban pastora, and bludgeoning sun.
19 Scalpers are asking and getting $125 for a Grounds Pass and (in at least one case) twice that for an 11th-row Stadium seat for the afternoon's matches. The last straightaway of the walkway to the Gate has its healthy share of scalpers making their elliptical pitches from the grassy edge, but (weirdly) there are just as many furtive-looking parties standing at the edges asking loudly whether anyone passing by has an extra ticket for sale, or would like perhaps to sell their own, as there are scalpers. The scalpers and weird people asking to be scalped seem not even to notice one another, all of them calling softly at once, and this makes the last pre-Gate stretch of the promenade kind of surreally sad, a study in missed connection.
20 (wise king of Pylos and all that)
21 In 1979 I once played two best-of-five matches in one day in a weird non-USTA junior thing in suburban Chicago, and one match went five sets and the other four, and even though I was just 17 I walked like a very old man for days afterward. And since emotional flexibility is almost impossible for a jr., I remember noticing that all of us who'd played 3/5's left the site looking utterly wrung-out emotionally, hollow-eyed, with the 1,000-yard stare of pogrom-survivors. I've had a special empathic compassion for male players in Slam events ever since, when I watch.
22 Sampras has a way of making it look like he hits a shot and dematerializes and then rematerializes someplace else in perfect position for the next shot. I have no theories about how he does this. Ken Rosewall is the only other male player in my memory who could seem to flicker in and out of existence like this. (Evonne Goolagong could do it, too, but not consistently.)
23 NYC being one of the most turnstile-intensive cities in the world, New Yorkers push through turnstiles with the same sort of elegantly casual elan that really top players evince when warming up.
24 This ticket-taker, who emerged as without a doubt my favorite character at the whole '95 Open, agreed to a brief interview but wanted his name withheld--the tournament apparently really does have shadowy Olympian upper-management figures whose wrath the employees fear. This ticket-taker is 61, has worked the" 'stiles" (as he calls them) at every U.S. Open since Ashe's stirring five-set defeats of both Graebner and Okker at Forest Hills in '68, thinks the Flushing Meadow N.T.C. inferior in every conceivable respect to good old Forest Hills, claims that the new half-built Stadium looming over the southern horizon is grotesque and pointless since its size will place the cheap seats at the very outer limits of human eyesight and a match seen from there will look like something seen from an incoming Boeing, plus that the new Stadium's been a boon-doggle from the get-go and is lousy with corruption and malfeasance and general administrative rot the guy is incredibly articulate and anecdotal and downright moving in his fierce attachment to a game he apparently has never once personally played, and he definitely in my opinion deserves a whole separate TENNIS magazine profile next year. His stint at the Open each year is his two-week vacation from his regular job as a toll-taker at the infamous Throgs Neck Bridge between Queens and the southern Bronx, which fact may account for his flinty resolve in the face of intimidating tactics like somebody brandishing a cellular phone at him.
25 The Daily Drawsheet has the distinction of being the single cheapest concession at the 1995 U.S. Open. A small and ice-intensive sodapop comes in second at $2.50.
26 (This popcorn being the deep-yellow, highly salty kind that makes an accompanying beverage all but mandatory--same deal with the concessions' big hot doughy pretzels, Manhattan-street-corner-type pretzels glazed with those nuggets of salt so big that they just about have to be bitten off and chewed separately. U.S. Open pretzels are $3.00 except in the International Food Village on the Stadium's south side, a kind of compressed orgy of concession and crowded eating, where pretzel prices are slashed to $2.50 per.)
27 Take, e.g., a skinny little Haagen-Dazs bar--really skinny, a five-biter at most--which goes for a felonious $3.00, and as with most of the food-concessions here you feel gouged and outraged about the price right up until you bite in and discover it's a seriously good Haagen-Dazs bar. The fact is that when you're hungry from the sunshine and fresh air and match-watching and gushing sympathetic saliva from watching everybody else in the crowds chow down, the Haagen-Dazs bars aren't worth $3.00 but are worth about $2.50. I should also add that Colombian Coffee was FREE at all concession stands on the N.T.C. grounds over Labor Day Weekend--part of this year's wildly aggressive Juan Valdez-marketing blitz at Flushing Meadow. This seemed like a really good deal until it turned out that 90% of the time the concession stands would claim to be mysteriously "temporarily out" of Colombian Coffee, so that you ended up forking over $2.50 for an overiced cup of Diet Coke instead, having at this point spent way too much time in the concession line to be able to leave empty-handed. It is not inconceivable that the concession stands really were out of coffee--"FREE" representing the price at which the demand curve reaches its most extreme point, as any marketer knows--but the hardened U.S. consumer in me still strongly suspected that a coffee-related bait-and-switch was in operation at some of these stands, at which the guys behind the counter managed to give the impression that they were on some kind of Rikers Island work-release program or were moonlighting from their real occupation as late-night threatening-type lurkers at Port Authority and Penn Station. Nevertheless, the point is that every concession stand in the N.T.C. had constant long lines in front of it and that a good 66% of the crowds in the Stadium and Grandstand and at the Show Courts could be seen ingesting some sort of concession-stand item at any given time.
28 And in order to be properly impressed by the volume of concessions consumption, you need to keep in mind what a hassle it is to go get concessions when you're watching a pro match. Take the Stadium for example. You can leave your seat only during the 90-second break after odd games, then you have to sort of slalom down crowded Stadium ramps to the nearest concession stand, hold your place in a long and Hobbesian line, hand over a gouge-scale sum, and then schlep back up the ramp, bobbing and weaving to keep people's elbows from knocking your dearly bought concessions out of your hands and adding them to the crunchy organic substratum of spilled concessions you're walking on . . . and of course by the time you find the ramp back to your section of seats the original 90-second break in the action is long over--as, usually, is the next one after that, so you've now missed at least two games--and play is again under way, and the ushers at the fat chains prevent re-entry, and you have to stand there in an unventilated cement corridor with a sticky and acclivated floor, mashed in with a whole lot of other people who also left to get concessions and are now waiting until the next break to get back to their seats, all of you huddled there with your ice melting and kraut congealing and trying to stand on tip-toe and peer ahead to the tiny chained arch of light at the end of the tunnel and maybe catch a green glimpse of ball or some surreal fragment of Philippoussis's left thigh as he thunders in toward the net or something . . . New Yorkers' patience w/ respect to crowds and lines and gouging and waiting is extraordinarily impressive if you're not used to it; they can all stand quiescent in airless venues for extended periods, their eyes' expressions that unique NYC combination of Zen meditation and clinical depression, clearly unhappy but never complaining.
29 The single most popular souvenir at the '95 Open seems to be a plain white bandanna with that little disembodied Nike trademark wing that goes right on your forehead if you wrap the thing just right over your head. A fashion accessory made popular by you know whom. Just about every little kid I spotted at Flushing Meadow was sporting one of these white Nike bandannas, and a fairly common sight on Sunday was a harried parent trying to tie a bandanna just right to position the Nike wing over a junior forehead while his kid stood on first one foot and then the other in impatience. (You do not want to know the retail price of these bandannas.)
30 Tickets are sold separately for the day and evening sessions, and there are very complicated mechanisms in place to keep people with day-session tickets from lurking past 2000h. and mooching free evening spectation.
31 New Yorkers also have an amazing ability to mind their own business and attend to themselves and not notice anything untoward going on, an ability that impresses me every time I come here and that always seems to lie somewhere on the continuum between Stoicism and catatonia.
32 You'll doubtless by the way be happy to know that I did, over half an hour later, find a quiet place to hunch and gnaw supper. One of the gratuitously cool things the '95 Open does is open up a few of the minor N.T.C. courts to regular public play once the sun's gone down. This is why some of the people in the Stadium crowd had racquets, I bet. Anyway, it seems decent of them, and you can imagine what a thrill it must be for a couple of little kids to play on a court with vestigial rubber from an afternoon of pro sneakers still on it--the civilians playing clearly feel important, and they get a lot of attention from passersby on the paths who are now conditioned to watch intently whenever they hear ball sounds, and it's interesting to watch the passersby's faces change after two or three seconds when they realize who and what they're watching. The little sets of bleachers for these minor public-play courts are, understandably, empty; and it was on one such little set of stands that I ate. A 30ish guy and his wife were playing, the wife wearing a sun visor that looked a little gratuitous, the husband overhitting the way an afternoon of watching pros whale the hell out of the ball will make a man overhit. The only other person in the stands was one of the attractive young P.R. people who'd given me so much free coffee all day out by the M.G., sitting in her Valdez-outline T-shirt and eating something steamy out of a partitioned Styrofoam tray whose attached lid was folded back, Her professional smile and eye-twinkles were gone, so that she looked now more like the tough young New Yorker she was. As she ate she stared impassively at the husband whaling balls at his wife. She was clearly there for the same reason I was, to have some space and quiet while she ate, plus some downtime in which to rest her face from its cheery marketing expression. I felt a kind of bond between us, and from the opposite end of the bleachers where I was eating I cleared my throat and said, "Boy, it's good to find a place to be alone for a minute, isn't it?" The lady never looked around from the court as she cleared her mouth and said, "It was until a second ago."
33 (Both these solicitations had their appeal--the straight-out-bribe one especially--and only a fear of getting caught and of having to inform TENNIS magazine that my Media Pass had been revoked because I'd been nabbed renting it out on the black market kept me from making my own stab at '95 Open free enterprise.)

BEYOND CENTER COURT
My Story
By Tracy Austin with Christine Brennan

William Morrow. 288 pp. $20

I am a longtime rabid fan of tennis and life stories in general, and of Tracy Austin in particular. I've rarely looked forward to reading a new book I was supposed to criticize as I looked forward to Beyond Center Court: My Story. And I don't think I've ever felt as down and disillusioned and
cheated by a book.

Here's Tracy Austin on the first set of her final against Chris Evert at the 1979 U.S. Open: "At 2-3, I broke Chris, then she broke me, and I broke her again, so we were at 4-4."'

And Tracy Austin 's epiphany after winning that final: "I immediately knew what I had done, which was to win the U.S. Open, and I was thrilled."

Tracy Austin on the psychic challenge of pro competition: "Every professional athlete has to be so fine-tuned mentally." Tracy Austin on her parents: "My mother and father never, ever pushed me."

On Robin Williams: "What an intelligent man."

Meditating on excellence: "There is that little bit extra that some of us are willing to give and some of us aren't. Why is that? I think it's the challenge to be the best."

I guess this breathtakingly insipid book has helped me understand why the whole genre of ghostwritten athletic bios is so disappointing. Uniformly rotten and yet ubiquitous, these sports memoirs sell because they seem to promise something more than the regular old name-dropping celebrity autobiography.

But these corporate-PR sports bios, chock-full of truisms, never deliver, and Beyond Center Court: My Story is especially appalling. It fails not just because it's poorly written, which it is. (I don't know what ghostwriting sportswriter Christine Brennan's enhancing function was supposed to be here, but I don't see how Austin herself could have done any worse than 200-plus deadening pages of "Tennis took me like a magic carpet to all kinds of places and all kinds of people," enlivened only by howlers like "Injuries - the signature of the rest of my career - were about to take hold of me.") It fails, too, because it manages to commit what any high school senior knows is the capital crime in expository prose: It forgets its audience.

Quite simply, the first loyalty of a successful autobiography has to be to the reader. Austin has allegiances aplenty in Beyond Center Court, but none are to the poor paying customer. This author's first loyalty seems to be to her family and friends. Whole pages are given over to retina-numbing, Academy-Award-style tributes to parents, siblings, coaches, trainers and agents, plus glowing little burbles of praise for pretty much every athlete and celebrity she's ever encountered. Martina Navratilova: 

"She is a wonderful person, very sensitive and caring"; Dick Enberg: "Dick is such a professional"; Liz Taylor: "She was exquisite"; ad nauseam.

Austin is also loyal in her service to her own public image, her endorsement-lucrative position as a media Role Model: "Even with all this early success, I still considered school more important than tennis"; "I have never, ever tried drugs of any kind, marijuana, anything."

There's also a weird loyalty here to the very biographic cliches by which we tend to mythologize sports stars. One such cliche-myth is of course that the person who's an extraordinary athlete on the field is really just plain folks off the field. Beyond Center Court devotes much of its space to
showing that the off-the-court Tracy Austin was just a normal American teenager. The obvious problem is that, since normal American teenagers tend to be rather shallow and uninteresting creatures, we're flooded with data such as that Austin enjoyed watching television ("Charlie's
Angels, Happy Days and Welcome Back Kotter, especially"), and that she got her braces removed at age 15 - "What a feeling!"

Sometimes her fondness for press-release-type truisms forces Austin to adopt an almost surreal narrative naivete. She protests with great energy that her tennis-fan mother never forced her into tennis at age 2, apparently never considering the fact that someone who's 2 doesn't have sufficient awareness of choices to require any sort of "forcing."

But the biggest reason Beyond Center Court is especially disappointing is that it could have been so much better than the average I-was-born-to-volley memoir.

The raw facts of Austin's life and rise and fall are almost classically tragic. She was the first of pro tennis' now-ubiquitous nymphet prodigies, and her rise was meteoric. Picked out of the crowd by coaching guru Vic Braden as a toddler, Austin was on the cover of World Tennis magazine at age 4. She played her first junior tournament at 7; by the time she was 10 she had won the national girls' 12-and-under championship both indoors and out, and was being invited to play public exhibitions. At 13, she had won national titles in most age groups, been drafted as a professional by World Team Tennis, and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated under
the legend "A Star Is Born."

At 14, having chewed up every American female under 19, she entered the qualifiers for her first professional tournament, and won not only the qualifiers but the whole tournament, which is roughly equivalent to someone who's ineligible for a learner's permit winning the Indy 500. She played Wimbledon at 14, turned professional as a ninth grader, won the U.S. Open at 16, and was ranked No. 1 in the world at 17, in 1980, the same year her body started to fall apart.

She spent the next four years effectively crippled by injuries and bizarre accidents, playing sporadically and watching her ranking plummet, and was pretty much retired from tennis at age 21. Her only serious attempt at a real comeback, in 1989, ended on the way to the U.S. Open - literally on the way, driving to the stadium - when a van ran a light and nearly killed her.

The basic problem, of course, is that top athletes turn out not to be articulate about just those qualities and experiences that constitute their attraction and our compulsion. The basic question is why this fact is so bitterly disappointing. The answer might be that products like these PR-
memoirs seem to promise precisely what they can't deliver: personal communicative access to an essentially public performative genius.

But U.S. audiences aren't stupid; we'd catch on after a while, and it wouldn't be so profitable for the publishers to keep churning these things out.

Maybe what keeps us obsessed and buying is the persistent desire both to experience genius in the concrete and to universalize genius in the abstract. And maybe our disappointment at the vacuousness of their memoirs is our own fault. Maybe the truth is that we wrongly expect geniuses in motion to be also geniuses in reflection, and their failure to be that is no more cruelly disillusioning than Eliot's inability to hit the curve ball or Kant's glass jaw.

Encouraged by the success of Scarlett (over 2 million copies sold), the sequel to Gone With the Wind, book editors everywhere have been scrambling to find literary "properties" suitable for extension. Ever wonder what happened to Heathcliff? Now you can read H: The Story of Heathcliff's Joumey Back to Wuthering Heights, published last month by Pocket Books. Did Huck make it to the territories? An answer can be found in Mister Grey, the further adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which Four Walls Eight Windows published last May. Lara's Child, a sequel to Dr. Zhiva- go, is due out from Doubleday next year. Occupying a dubious place in the culture, these sequels are literary piecework, created to order and calculated to ride on the success of their illustrious progenitors. But what if a gifted writer reversed the order of the publisher's priority and depended on an inspiration more aesthetic than commercial? What if the basis for a sequel was merely the pleasure of the literary imagination? With these questions in mind, the editors of Harper's Magazine invited six distinguished authors to write a sequel to a favorite work of literature. 

RABBIT RESURRECTED ~~~~~~~~ By David Foster Wallace 

In this sequel to Rabbit at Rest, which ended with the hero on his deathbed, beset with transmural infarctions and the consequences of his own appetites, Rabbit Angstrom, ambivalent hero of four Really Big Novels, athlete, adulterer, Republican, duly designated observer of the U.S. scene, and synecdoche of a generation's pathos, negotiates the pitfalls of post-life America in his own erratic way, and learns some very special truths he'd suspected all along... 

The bright bed of happy unfeeling from which his son's straining face recedes has not deserted him, Rabbit Angstrom feels. The bed merely tilts at the foot and erects itself, rising, Rabbit with it. Behind his eyes the red cave he had thought was the exit reveals itself to have been his brain's own color, its red music; darkness now flows like spilled ink in at all sides until the color shrinks to the frozen star of a television's last point of light, then out. Not darkness but whatever is its absence. Rabbit hears earlessly the blank whine of the heart monitor and his family's Kabuki cries of self-concerned grief, the chud of defibrillation paddles trying to stun what is no longer his. He is not his body--can I keep my prick in heaven? is his first wild thought, and on its heels the toothier question of heaven itself, of just where is he off to, floating. 

Instead of the cacophony of his big body's constant reminders, Rabbit's sense of himself is now merely as huge and clean, a white idea, untethered, rising like a red balloon whose red is less the color of candy apples than of a squat, solid Amish barn in the oblique light of a Pennsylvania mid-to-late afternoon. As beneath him the slate roofs of the Deleon hospital complex first form a pattern of tile with other roofs and then melt into the blue and green gem the Atlantic wears, Rabbit finds the star expanding, his inner vision restored but altered. As an astringent light the same bleached blue as the Deleon ICU yawns out from both sides of a gassy pink warmth he screams at leaving, as a slap's sharp sting on his tiny plum of a bottom meets the inverted face of the obstetrician who holds him by a heel, replaced immediately by the moon of his mother's face rising and breaking into crescents over the edge of a crib, then the sight of the nubbly rug rushing up to slap him as his first fat steps fail, Rabbit realizes all those fags in sandals had been right, and he was about to re-experience, in time lapse, every sensuous experience he'd ever had. Here they all are, each minutely described: 

ILLUSTRATION: 

. . . in air tinged the bloody lavender of a sunrise over an Ipswich dune, Rabbit was heartsore. How quickly, in the dim Cineplex of recall, the associations rose and passed! How little the lyrical metaphors his head conjured for everything he saw, the poetic analogies that had bloomed beside milk boxes and damp screens, pubic hair and Toyotas, plumber's helpers and Janice's poor slotted mouth, images hovering palsied like the faint UHF ghosts that shadowed televised images before everybody all of a sudden had to have those cable hookups, or like the odd clover's fourth leaf, jutting so vainly with its Valentine creases between what was complete in itself . . . or maybe more like the echo of a yodel in a void, because how damned little they added up to, these unlikely observations of a self-centered clod, these locations of literary meaning in the angle of light on prefab siding in the smooth hiss of a public fart, these strings of pedestrian epiphanies that he had presumed lifted him above the herd of all other self-centered pedestrian clods to become the distillate of an American generation. All ghosts, gone the moment seen. 

He is alone, rising erect in the cerulean space above the dazzling frozen gauze of the clouds--boiling, radiant, motionless, terrible, silent, and clumped. He is by himself. No voice booms off his skull or plucks at his gown's sleeve. Rabbit dislikes being by himself. Will there be no one to guide him on a flight that has become less upward than stolidly out, expanding? No one to banter with? To hear his opinions, views? Would there be perhaps some way to get laid, maybe? If disembodied, is he unmanned? His idea of heaven is not wings' flutter or robes' flow. Rabbit's heaven, as ecumenical in its spirituality as Tertullian's hell, comprises an infinity of snatch. He rises, erect, meditative. Would there be vaginas where he was going, vaginas finally freed from the shrill silly vessels around them, bodiless, pungent, and rubicund, swaddled in angelic linen or straining plump around some Unitarian G-string? The odd breast or two, detached, obliging? Arabs saw heaven as for men, the accredited dead enjoying the spicy favors of black-eyed virgins for all eternity. Was it too late to convert? Would a lapsed Episcopalian who slapped the bottoms of ministers' wives stand a chance at bliss at the top of this rise? Rabbit asks of the airless blue: to Whom will he be held accountable? The well-dressed, sad-smelling God of the Springer's airless church? Some Catholic intercessor with an infant at her tit? Weedy, beaming Eastern gods with hookahs and pelican bellies? Some stem Dutch Reform personage with the black coat and pale dour face of a Hals oil? 

And he begins to wonder, as he rises, weightless and squeezed into the navy blue dome, rising like a bubble in beer, less pushed by any pressure than drawn by pressure's absence, rising it seems to some surface where he fears he will, as in life, merely spread, refract light for a while, and disappear with a thin pop, what he will be held to answer for. How stood his accounts? Surely Whoever decided must make allowances for a character damned at conception to act out all America's narcissistic, grimly prurient drama. And surely Rabbit's balance sheet is written in two inks. The sun fills the cone of his upward sight, expands without heat. Surely each late afternoon a Hassy riding a squealing Mim on his handlebars canceled out an occasion on which he'd seen a woman and wondered how she would do instead of who she was. Surely his exasperated kindness toward Nelson the child appeared opposite such snafus as a dead Jill or the briefest of just-once slips with a daughter-in-law who'd been asking for it for years. Only human, after all. Surely Rabbit is headed for a heaven he's never left. 

Much bolstered, Rabbit is able to close his eyes; color blooms behind his lids. How sweet to see stars clotted around a lit sun. The stars bum bright and cold as lit ice, and as what is left of him leaves the rest behind, Rabbit sees the stars, and the stars behind the stars, coalesce into the image of a tree. The tree is a rood, and does not visually or metaphorically resemble any other tree, or any other thing, which for obvious reasons disturbs Rabbit a lot. But hung aloft the schematized branches, and subtending the light-spike roots like leafy brachts, hanging and sitting, like baubles, objects for Rabbit's observation and (though not connection) pleasure, is everyone he's ever known who died and rose: Mom, Pop, baby Becky in her tomb of gray water, Skeeter, Jill, old man Springer, Thelma with her rash-covered arms out, poor walleyed Peggy Gring, Mr. Abendroth the postman who went house to house like doctors used to, the obstetrician who'd yanked him from the infinity he dreamed of and spanked him awake, all the rest, more than anyone could ever count: shades: pale wisps of images, as yet insubstantial as lit gauze, as mist off a dawn Susquehanna. It's a solipsist's heaven, full of his own dead perceptions. 

Here they all are, Rabbit's tree's decorations, crying out to the white animal who twists upward toward them in an erect bed, crying out to Rabbit to be resurrected, reseen, by He whose attention had made them. And Rabbit dispenses mercy, in a heaven he's never left, to these supplicant ghosts of his life's sight. Here they all are: minutely described. Each.

	Abstract = {This review may well be subjective to the point of ickiness, because this reviewer has believed Greil Marcus is a genius ever since I first read the essay on Elvis in his 1975 "Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music."

That book, like all Marcus' best work, is a study in social aesthetics, an enterprise concerned not so much with why certain artworks are entitled to certain predicates, but with just how and why some very few artists are able to move audiences, move them radically, terribly, redemptively and forever. Because he is interested in art that is jacked pretty much directly into people's emotions, Marcus writes about music, and because he is interested in these transferences of feeling and value on a large scale (and because he is an American), he specializes in popular music, rock and its progenitors.

The central concern of Marcus' work-why some pop music moves audiences and has meaning for them-devolves into two big questions. The first is why certain seminal rock 'n' roll performers are able to change the way whole groups of people feel about themselves in the world. Marcus' 1975 "Elvis: Presliad," one of the greatest essays ever written about music, traces the career and appeal of Elvis Presley as a synecdoche of America itself.

Rather than just being the lucky white guy who first discovered how to breed Negroid blues with Caucasian country, Marcus' Elvis illustrated the American tension between the confirming community of white pop and the dangerous adrenaline of delta blues. Marcus locates Elvis' early genius in his ability to focus tension rather than resolve it, and in all seriousness and with impressive argumentation, Marcus portrays Elvis as no less an enveloping American symbol than Melville's whale or Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha.

What was brilliant in the "Presliad" was Marcus' ability to present Elvis as emblematic of American popular culture and then pop culture itself as America's deepest self-perception writ large and bright. If pop is the argument between sub-culture (as conceived by the cultural outsider when that outsider happens to be a genius) and the redemptive, relentlessly consuming appetite of the community, then the arc of Elvis' career, from starving white trash to musical insurgent to heartthrob to B-movie mainstay to corpulent Vegas schmaltz-king "performing a kind of enormous victory rather than winning it" ("Mystery Train"), limns also the living and fatal paradox of all popular U.S. art: that this art, which is produced via raw difference, the special fecund anguish of non-inclusion, attacks, seduces and is devoured by a mass-art market that redeems and even deifies the artist while it drains his productions of the denial and pain that is its voice.

The Elvis of the years before his death, for Marcus, was the transcendent purveyor of America's Empty Yes, an artist who didn't so much fall into as thrive on the pop trap of satisfying the audience's surface craving for confirmation instead of its deeper, more ragged need to be moved-"He sings with such a complete absence of musical personality that none of the old songs matter at all, because he has not committed himself to them; it could be anyone singing, or no one. It is in this sense, finally, that an audience is confirmed, that an America comes into being; lacking any real fear or joy, it is a throw-away America where nothing is at stake. The divisions America shares are simply smoothed away" ("Mystery Train").

Since so many of the awesome and hideous public phenomena that have attended the death of Elvis Presley in 1977 were predicted and explained in Marcus' "Presliad," I approached "Dead Elvis" feeling simultaneously that there was no one more qualified to write about "the ubiquity, the playfulness, the perversity, the terror, and the fun of this, of Elvis Presley's second life," and that Marcus' virtuoso dissection of the living King in the earlier book makes any present post-mortem kind of redundant.

But "Dead Elvis" isn't otiose at all. It's different from the "Presliad," less rhetorical, more a travelogue than an argument, but no less precious, since it carves out and addresses the second of Marcus' great informing questions: What is it about the audience that is America that makes it receptive to the combination of art and junk and appearance and reality and devotion and repulsion an idea like Elvis purveys?

Marcus observes-sometimes analyzing, but mostly observing, raptly, in pellucid prose-the culture that has risen around the unrisen Elvis Presley, his image's persistence in black velvet, ashtrays and liquor bottles, films, night-club impersonations, novels, McDonald's commercials, poetry, tabloids, the jagged spirituality that still defines the margins Elvis came from, avant-garde art, the Whole Elvis Thing, "a great common art project, the work of scores of people operating independently of each other, linked only by their determination to solve the same problem: Who was he, and why do I still care?"

Thus, like the "Presliad," "Dead Elvis" is less about Elvis than it is about our popular culture, "the culture he inherited, the culture he made, and the culture that then to such a great degree remade itself according to these promises, complexities, contradictions, and defeats."

"Dead Elvis" is a collection of Elvis-related pieces Marcus has written from 1977 to 1990. There are "Presliad"-esque essays like 1981's "Elvis: The Ashtray" and 1990's "Still Dead: Elvis Presley Without Music." There are sharp, dark reviews of books about Elvis and rock music, schlock and otherwise. There are parodic screenplays, discussions of William Eggleston's photographs of a very empty Graceland, illustrations, lavish photos of Elvis with German whores in 1959, Elvis as usurped and abstracted by contemporary artists, in underground conceptual archetriptychs-Elvis Hitler, Elvis Christ-Elvis in underground comics, Elvis as sung about by nihilist punks who love the King too well for betraying all he'd been consigned to stand for.

A lot of "Dead Elvis" is just listening to a huge national conversation. Greil Marcus is a great listener. 1989's "The Last Breakfast" describes a San Francisco morning DJ's Breakfast With Elvis show, in which listeners call in each weekday morning with menus-from the exotic to the troubling-for feeding a King "as he dropped dead on 16 August 1977: a glutton bloated beyond memory." The piece is hilarious and moving, then scary when counterpointed by 1990's "A Corpse in Your Mouth," a weird discussion of cartoons, postcards, album covers and underground fanzine jokes about eating Elvis, Elvis-burgers, Sid-Vicious-patties, the ultimate consumption of what celebrity offers.

We could go on. This is a marvelous and I think profound book about a cultural symbol of cultural symbol-making. The critical acuity of the "Presliad" has, in "Dead Elvis," become emotional genius. Marcus acknowledges that the cults that have "oozed from the fissures of culture" since Elvis' death could easily be reduced and explained in terms of "working-class bad taste or upper-class camp."

Maybe they should be, but Marcus offers eloquent testimony to the contrary. He chases and witnesses the spasms of love, hatred, devotion, betrayal, lust and art that Elvis Presley's explosion has sent raining out and down, witnesses with neither Warholian fake-hip credulity nor ironic fake-hip condescension.

He writes for two glass-clear pages about a woman who divorced her husband after seeing "Blue Hawaii" on her honeymoon. She now lives in Memphis, a professional pilgrim. A sort of priestess. She is known as the Button Lady-"She wears so many Elvis badges she clinks when she walks. . . . You can't laugh at her; you can't even blink."

Marcus' rapt attention to what Elvis continues to mean is both transmitted and justified in a splendid piece of critical art.

THE DOORMAN 

By Reinaldo Arenas 

Translated from the Spanish by Dolores M. Koch

Grove Weidenfeld. 208 pp. $16.95

The Doorman , a small, strange novel, is the mid-'80s product of probably the best Cuban-born writer since Alejo Carpentier - Reinaldo Arenas . His life was as sad and difficult as any in 20th-century letters.

Arenas , born in 1943, left home at 15 to join the anti-Batista forces, and, at 22, established himself as a major literary figure in Fidel Castro's revolutionary Cuba with his first novel, Singing From the Well. His second novel was denied Cuban publication because of its treatment of homosexuality; he was arrested on charges of immorality and "extravagance" at 25, and two more novels and a story collection were suppressed in Cuba but published in Mexico and Uruguay to acclaim.

Then his life took another turn for the worse. In 1970, Arenas was convicted by old Communist Party comrades of being a "social misfit," and he was sentenced to two years of cane-cutting at a labor camp, an experience about which he wrote in El Central: A Cuban Sugar Mill, a Spanish-language classic not published in America until a few years ago. After a decade of prison terms for various counterrevolutionary activities, punctuated by periods of low-profile-keeping in Havana, Arenas finally escaped to the United States during the Mariel boat lift of 1980.

He lived in obscure poverty in a Hell's Kitchen apartment in New York, spurned for his anti-Castro leanings by the same literati who praised him when he was in prison. His American career was revived in the mid-'80s with the translation of several of his early books and contracts to write three more (including The Doorman ) - just in time for Arenas to be diagnosed with AIDS. Close to death, Arenas rejected a final trip to the hospital and committed suicide in late 1990.

The facts of Arenas ' life and death lend a gray weight to the opening of The Doorman : "This is the story of Juan, a young man who was dying of grief." Like Arenas , Juan has fled persecution in Cuba in 1980, though he is exactly 20 years younger than Arenas was when he got out. Dreamy, weird, passive and speaking little English, Juan has a hard time holding any of the menial jobs secured for him by a shadowy community of successful Cuban emigres.


As the book opens in 1992, Juan is a doorman at a luxury apartment building in Manhattan. It is as a doorman that Juan finds his niche as an immigrant, his raison as a human being, and the grief that defines and ruins his life:

For suddenly our doorman discovered (or thought he had discovered) that his tasks could not be limited to just opening the door of the building - but that he, the doorman , was the one chosen, elected, singled out (take your pick)

from all mankind to show everyone who lived there a wider door, the door to their own lives, which Juan described as - and we must quote him exactly even though it may seem (and, in fact, be) ridiculous - "the door to true happiness."

The intrusive narrative voice here, the "we," belongs to the one million-member community of Cubans who emigrated at Fulgencio Batista's fall, who have now made American-dream successes of themselves and, for obscure reasons, have had Juan under particular surveillance and protection since his arrival in 1980.

Though the stilted, interpolated commentary that this "we" indulges in can get irritating after a while, Arenas ' choice of a whole community to narrate Juan's story ends up being apt, because The Doorman is less a disguised autobiography or even a novel than a dark fable about the very
possibility of community.

Hence, the fact that each of Juan's building's tenants - characters who are introduced, enter and engage Juan in some bizarre exploitive encounter, one after the other - is a parody of American isolation, fear and obsessive attachment. As Juan tries to proselytize his tenants on the need to find a ''wider door" than the glass one he opens, each tenant tries to involve Juan in some monomaniacal focus that the character has decided ensures community and fulfillment.

One tenant believes that giving out candies is the way to make connections between people, and his apartment is a confectioner's warehouse. Another believes that the key to happiness is ultra-white teeth, and he tries to get Juan to trade his own set for some movie-star caps.

There's a senescent playboy whose worship of sex is undercut by his impotence. There's the Ecuadoran founder of the Church of Love Through Friendly and Constant Contact, who espouses a goopy, Buscaglia-type touching as the way to bring people into true relation.

There's a wacky inventor who preaches the virtues of the totally prosthetic body; a former movie star who's such a miser that she's getting ready to live on the streets to cut overhead; a beautiful thanatophile whose suicide attempts keep getting thwarted; two aging gay men desperate for a
dream-love; a blowsy alcoholic; a Marxist academic who wants to "rehabilitate" Juan, and so on.

These overtly symbolic caricatures, so privileged, lonely, blinded by narcissism and obsession, so oddly American, enter stagily, subjecting Juan to some diatribe or misadventure, and then disappear. They make the first half of The Doorman seem like a slighter version of Kafka's Amerika - another dark picaresque with a tortured foreign ingenue adrift amid all the nation's bright promise and sad reality, Juan as a Karl Rossman defined by questions of freedom and relationship instead of guilt and penance.

It's in The Doorman 's second half that the book abandons all pretense of being anything more than an ingenious parable about slavery and freedom, collectivities and outsiders.

Each tenant has a pet - a million-dollar Egyptian dog, a polar bear, a parrot, a goldfish, an orangutan - and the pets, unlike their owners, are keenly interested in Juan's vague ideas of escape and big doors. They can speak. They invite Juan to secret meetings in the building's basement, where they advocate a particular Xanadu to which they can escape.

Juan and the Egyptian dog struggle to get them to transcend their own tastes and prejudices about freedom and submit to the greater chance of freedom that's a function of compromise and community.

Eventually, Juan's pet conspiracy is found out by the tenants; he is committed to an insane asylum (each of whose inmates is a brilliant pathological double of a tenant's neurosis); is liberated by the animals, who tear the bars from his window and carry him off, and is made the leader of a growing army of rebellious animals, who stop squabbling and unite to create their own state somewhere "near the equator."

The reader is struck by the resemblance, for Arenas , between house pets and immigrants, both removed from a "wild" exterior at once crueler and more real than privileged captivity, both objects of either derision or sloppy condescension, both imprisoned by the same promise of freedom and safety that has robbed them of the will to get truly free.

The constant narrative interruptions that apologize for the outlandish plot developments and assure the reader that every word is true do not create realism. But they do help establish the novel's sardonic counterpoint - the hostility between the established Cubans who fled Castro's revolution and the brutalized victims of the revolution who, like Arenas, arrived in Florida's refugee camps 20 years later.

Arenas has the narrators assume a self-congratulatory tone as they assure us that they'd done all they could for Juan when they abandoned him in the asylum: "To go beyond this point would have meant to endanger our hard-earned reputation as a reliable and powerful community in this
country." And then he has them claim, contradictorily, that Juan who now presides over an army of liberated pets, is the Cuban community's "secret lethal weapon."

Arenas communicates a marvelous disgust at these old anti-Castroites, who, once through the great door to freedom that America represents, have become more concerned with their own place in the enslaving hierarchy of power and privilege than with helping pull other humans through the same door.

Much of The Doorman 's weird moral force concerns Arenas ' idea of America as a false door, presenting itself as a utopia for huddled masses who, once they arrive, find either brutal exploitation, or the "freedom" to start doing their own exploiting . . . which of course is still slavery.

The figure of Juan, vague, driven, nutty, shy, obsessed with a doorway that he admits he can't conceive of, so much like Arenas but so much younger, communicates the author's own idea of happiness in such a poignantly paradoxical way that it manages to avoid seeming trite or sentimental even to Americans for whom so much, today, seems banal.

Arenas ' central idea is a tragic one: that the possibility of happiness exists only for those who cannot be frightened or seduced into settling for substitutes, and that actual happiness consists simply in giving oneself up to a design greater than one's own happiness.

Finding the door, for Juan/ Arenas , is nothing other than helping others to find the door. Happiness equals grief equals the integrity to experience either. The community of doors becomes, resides in, the individual. The end of The Doorman imagines a marvelous system of doors, a different one for each seeker:

And through these doors everyone, finally, will eagerly rush in. That is, all except me, the doorman, who on the outside will watch them disappear forever.

BRITAIN's J.G. Ballard is not a great fiction writer, but he is an important one. If that seems like an inconsistent judgment, be advised that American readers who know Ballard only via his moving, Spielbergable memoir Empire of the Sun do not know the real J. G. Ballard. The real Ballard has since the early '60s been a pioneer of a certain sort of literary science fiction I like to call Psy-Fi. Psy-Fi, often parodic, surreal and grotesque, and almost always set in some near and recognizable future, seeks to explore the psychopathology of post-atomic life, stuff like high technology, mass-media, advertising, PR, totalitarianism, etc.

Ballard's 1973 cult novel Crash, a coldly theoretical fable about the eroticism of automobile accidents and the relations of violence to orgasm and deformity to celebrity, ranks with Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange and William Burroughs' Naked Lunch as basically defining the Psy-Fi genre. And, forays into memoir and mass-market appeal notwithstanding, Ballard has toiled and produced his best work in the metal arbor of this weird allegorical techno-lit. His latest U.S. release, War Fever, a collection of short stories written between the mid-'70s and the late '80s, is vintage Ballardian Psy-Fi, and its most successful pieces show Ballard at his engaging, exasperating best. And Ballard at his best helps show why the Psy-Fi masters have had such a profound influence on contemporary American fiction writers, not only genre-restricted cyberpunks like William Gibson but serious postmodern artists like Don DeLillo, William T. Vollmann and Mark Leyner.

Clinical, dogmatic, relentlessly reifying and world-class imaginative, Ballard is really more a social critic than a storyteller. And, except for a couple of hard-core science fiction pieces like "Report on an Unidentified Space Station," all of War Fever's 14 stories grow out of the parodic expansion of some single angst-producing feature of modern social life. In "The Secret History of World War 3," Ronald Reagan is brought back from advanced senescence for a third presidential term in '92, and when the U.S. electorate, "Watching this robotic figure with his goofy grins . . . began to ask if the President was brain-dead, or even alive at all," Reagan's handlers begin releasing exhaustive reports on his health, updates and panel discussions that so mesmerize a nation of TV-watchers (for whom the President's EKG-trace is finally broadcast like stock quotations at the bottom of all programming) that the people ignore a spasmodic nuclear exchange with the U.S.S.R. in favor of expert analyses of presidential bowel-function and the First Lady's cosmetic tucks.

In "Dream Cargoes," a scuttled garbage barge spills toxic wastes onto the shores of a Caribbean atoll, spawning gorgeous new life forms and metamorphosizing human consciousness into a kind of techno-mysticism until the Navy steps in with flamethrowers to stop the "pollution." In the collection's title story, the factional warfare in Beirut is revealed to be orchestrated by the U.N., which has been protecting 30 years of complete global peace by fueling paranoia and hatred among the Beirut combatants, using the fighting as a controlled experiment in mutating "the virus of war."

War Fever is an unusually tight, unified story collection, not only because its author has three or four basic Psy-Fi obsessions he simply works and reworks, but also because Ballard uses such a distinctive set of styles and techniques. Structurally, every one of this book's stories is exoskeletal: its symbols and meanings are right on the surface, right in your face; and they, rather than plot or character, provide the story's developmental drive. As is S.O.P. for Ballard, many of War Fever's selections are narrated in the first-person, with the narrator adopting this "I'm-the-last-and-only-person-who-can-articulate-what's-happened" tone so common to science fiction. And Ballard, as always, loves his formal fun. A diehard experimentalist, he has stories here in the form of an index to the autobiography of some eminent fictional 20th-century guy ("The Index," cute but slight, like a concrete poem), and, in the labyrinthine "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," in the form of numbered scholarly glosses on a one-sentence fragment of an unfinished essay detailing a famous neurosurgeon's plunge into schizophrenia and murder. This last story, my favorite in the collection, is not only a Borgesian marvel of involution, it's an ingenious study in dissociation, in which the academic objectivity of the glosses and the pathological pathos of the notes' subject counterpoint and dance and finally marry in the creepy revelation of just who's authoring the glosses. One of Ballard's finest stories ever, "Notes Towards . . ." alone makes War Fever worth the purchase.

Yet another unifying feature of this collection is that here Ballard betrays all three of his biggest weaknesses as a Psy-Fi writer. The first is that his tone is so very cold. It's not an accident that most of War Fever's characters manifest dissociation's numbness and automatism, nor that Ballard's most effective narrative persona here is that of a detached clinical-report-writer (four of these stories are narrated by M.D.'s, with academics, surgeons, psychiatrists and scientists playing key roles in another six). The genre of Psy-Fi, postmodern to the quick, seems to demand this flat, scholarly narrative voice, an air of lab technicians looking at stuff under glass. But the poverty of affect here makes Ballard's stories at once creepier and empty of human quality; too many of the pieces seem loud but empty, like screams.

Another of this collection's troubles is that Ballard's prose isn't all that great. His narrators have consistent penchants for stilted rhetorical questions, for clunky, bombastic pronouncements, and for rather cliched descriptions.

Ballard's third and worst weakness is that he's about the least subtle major writer going. As do many Psy-Fi fictions, Ballard's stories wield their themes like black-jacks, rarely give their readers a chance to exercise discernment or insight. You never really get a chance to read Ballard. His narrators pontificate constantly, declaiming on the meaning of symbols, the irony of twists, the significance of everything even remotely significant. These lead-footed intrusions, together with the fact that Ballard's fictions are basically one-trick ponies, all working off some single surreal metaphor, can often leave the audience wanting less. Still, the stories in War Fever are surprisingly and consistently compelling. They're predictable and sometimes annoying, but they're usually under 10 pages; and Ballard's inverted, thoroughly post-industrial philosophy of fiction - which is basically that delusion, hallucination and rationalization are today's mediation, attempts to construct an inner psychic reality in the face of an empty, mechanized, mass-marketed and fictional modern world - has, since the '60s, been worth readers' attention.

The short story, a mode where Ballard can dispense with developed character and diachronic plot, and where he can use his great gift for formal ingenuity to afford the reader freshness and variety, seems to me to be J.G. Ballard's strongest form. Short, dense, vivid, hallucinatory, sometimes pompous, often truly disturbing, these pieces in War Fever are Ballard's Psy-Fi gems, and they have value. - David Foster Wallace's most recent books are the short-story collection "Girl With Curious Hair" and, with Mark Costello, "Signifying Rappers," an essay about music and race.

By Clive Barker

Harper & Row. 550 pp. $19.95

Today less an art than an industry, a pop genre like horror is nevertheless its own literary province with its own evaluative standards. Good horror fiction knows its job and proceeds to do it efficiently. Aiming to stimulate pretty basic parts of the readerly psyche-to titillate, shock, agitate, scare, to provide both escape and reassurance-quality horror takes care to seem above all unpretentious: i.e., to keep its conceits simple and its settings banal enough to be familiar. By these modern standards, the fictions of Stephen King up through, say, "Cujo" represent nearly perfect American pop horror: Ensouled appliances run darkly amok in a world of Fritos, flatulence and trailer-park angst.

By the same standards, King's putative heir, Clive Barker, has produced in "The Great and Secret Show" a really disappointing novel. A Manichaean soap opera billed by the author as about "Hollywood, Sex and Armageddon," Barker's novel is really just a derivative mix of King's apocalyptic "The Stand," the hell-beneath-suburbia shticks of "Poltergeist" and "Blue Velvet," the celebrity-bashing voyeurism of a Jackie Collins or Sidney Sheldon, and the sophomoric metaphysics of undergrad fantasy. Plus it's pretentious beyond belief.

One R. Jaffe, an unhappy postal worker, happens on an ultra-secret cabal of crazies who keep informing each other (through the U.S. mail!) that "America had a secret life ... the world was not as it seemed." Jaffe commits some murder, does some time-hitchhiking, makes the sort of windy proclamations to the audience we associate with cartoon villains, and before we know it has coerced a brilliant but fatally flawed all-purpose professor, one R. Fletcher, into developing a mysterious alchemical cordial that seems able to enhance evolution, alter body into spirit, induce psychosis, raise the dead or give people nasty Christlike stigmata, depending on authorial whim. This stuff transforms Jaffe and Fletcher, now "Dynasty"-type nemeses, into sort of odd archetypes of Really Good and Really Bad. Jaffe is the bad one. He keeps announcing to whoever will listen that he wants to use "The Art" to draw aside "The Veil" to reveal "The Shoal," "The Ephemeris" and the oceanic "Quiddity" that separates "The Cosm" from "The Metacosm" and the latter's sinister residents, "The Iad Uroboros."

Few of these ponderous terms are even explained, much less given referents, except via pronouncements like: "Quiddity is the sea. And in it are islands, called the Ephemeris"; and "This was an Art in defiance of flesh. All the profoundest certainties were forfeit in the face of it."

Amid all this forfeiture of profound certainties, the superhuman but awfully randy Jaffe and Fletcher are busily impregnating virgins in the small California town where their battle's brought them. The resultant hyper-evolved offspring grow up in a few pages, hate each other or fall desperately in love, and in The Present release the entombed spirits of their opposed fathers on the community and the universe. The resulting melodrama of sex, gore, celebrity, bad science and worse cosmology, drawn out to an excruciating 500-plus pages, leads to a mysterious Art-induced tear in reality's "screen," the epiphany that "The whole ... world's a movie," an imminent invasion by meta-creatures who resemble mountains covered with fleas, some heroic mystical puzzle-solving by a Hollywood screenwriter and a burned-out tabloid journalist, and salvation by atomic blast.

Lots of things make this novel too pretentious to like. The misuse of scientific and philosophic terms, for one thing. There's lots of alarming prose, here, stuff like: "It was twenty years since that life-shattering day when he'd found the symbol of The Shoal"; "He wasn't the only one reeling before this revelation"; "Reason could be cruel; logic could be lunacy."

But most of the pretension in this novel is a function of the fact that Clive Barker demands that the reader take him seriously but declines to do the artistic work necessary to make his story believable or even coherent. A contempt for his characters-none of whom even comes close to being 3-D-is matched by an odd condescension toward the reader that has Barker constantly telling you how to think and feel about everything in the book-e.g., the evil characters "shamble" and "cackle"; the good guys "stride" and "laugh heartily"-and playing fast and loose with the very concepts and theories he litters the story with. Physical laws are suspended and then restored (a nuclear explosion can vanquish creatures and seal holes that are in defiance of all physics) as it suits the author. One minute people are reeling before hideous revelations and shaking fists at the sky and declaring their shattered lives will never again be the same, and the next minute they're eating a bologna sandwich and negotiating with their editors about how to write the world's end as an Enquirer expose'.

The novel is not without some cool sections: a parodic battle between the TV stars who represent human dreams and the icky caterpillars that embody our fears; and a wonderful description of a talk-show comedian's plunge down a haunted hole would make a great short story: "Johnny Carson in Hell." But, for the most part, the same dull dispiritedness the British Barker so relentlessly attributes to his American characters pervades his own "The Great and Secret Show." Too long by half, and basically just silly, it seems the work of one of those dreaded commercial successes who've become so impressed with themselves they no longer think they have to work at being interesting. Perhaps, if this tome doesn't do well, Barker will return to the gooey enthusiasm for straight pop horror that made him an '80s staple.

The reviewer's books include "Girl With Curious Hair" and, with Mark Costello, the forthcoming "Signifying Rappers: Race and Pop in the Urban '80s."}}

HEADLINE: Matters of Sense and Opacity

BODY:

To the Editor:

I enjoyed Jacques Barzun's essay ''A Little Matter of Sense'' (June 21). Doubtless the inflated jargon of some contemporary criticism perpetrates a kind of double fraud: a critic trying to sound smarter than he is; a critical piece whose demands on readers' patience and dictionaries are out of all proportion to reward. But there are serious problems in Mr. Barzun's position -one whose common-sense surface barely covers a reactionary and kind of reductive approach to the issue of ''sense'' in technical esthetics. 

Literary criticism is itself an artistic endeavor, and will naturally sometimes sacrifice transparency for creative richness; literary theory, on the other hand, is a branch of esthetics, which is essentially philosophy, and is often engaged in honest efforts at such rarefied heights that things are going to get unavoidably abstract and technical; literary criticism and theory, by their natures, operate in dialogue with art, with each other, and with themselves; such a tangle of reference and referents cannot but lead to some occlusion and prolixity. It's the price of admission.

That there are serious opacity problems in criticism is clear. What ought to be done about them, and to what degree, is less so. ''A Little Matter of Sense'' was not rife with corrective options. We may indeed erect a primer-ish set of ''sensible'' critical terms and insist that good critics adhere to standard usage. Or we may, as readers and critics and writers, work to expand the semantic and esthetic horizons of the terms we now possess - as the late (and surely offensively oblique) Paul de Man did when he revolutionized theoretical discussions about metaphor and allegory by pointing to deep contexts of their use that no simple field guide to criticism could countenance.

Mr. Barzun's essay was funny, erudite and level-headed. Exaggerate his stance just a bit, though, and you risk getting a dull Ockham's razor. Not all theorists are trying to erect walls of impenetrability around the very stuff they're trying to penetrate. Some might just be trying to come to grips with what they love. With all his rhetorical power, Mr. Barzun might do well to write another essay, one for us young readers and readees, one about the value of cool-headed restraint in critical housecleaning. There's babies in that bathwater, dude.

The story 'Girl with Curious Hair,' appeared on pages 122-43 of an
anthology called 'Voices of the Xiled: A Generation Speaks for
Itself.' Edited by Michael Wexler and John Hume, published by Main
Street Books/Doubleday, 1994.

DFW's bio, on page 122: 

David Foster Wallace was born in 1962 in New York, grew up in
Illinois, was educated in Amherst College and the University of
Arizona at Tucson, is the author of a novel, 'The Broom of the System'
(Viking/Avon), and a collection of stories of which the following
piece is the title (Norton/Avon), and with Mark Costello (the lawyer,
not the writer), of a nonfiction book about rap music and racial
issues, 'Signifying Rappers' (Ecco Press), is working on something
long for Little, Brown that looks like it will NOT be in by the
contracted 1/1/94 deadline, has never before been late with anything,
anywhere, ever, and is not in a good space about this at all, and is
currently teaching English, for reasons connected less with salary
than with health insurance, at Illinois State University at
Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.

PERSONAL TIDBIT W/R/T 'GIRL WITH CURIOUS HAIR': a close female
acquaintance severed all connections with DFW shortly after the story
was written and (in an ill-considered move) shown to her, claiming
that anyone who could write such a thing was clearly a very troubled
young man indeed, a conclusion DFW did and still does deny.}}

This explains a couple ASFTINDA acknowledgements:

http://rockcritics.com/interview/glennkenny.html

Jim was going through the inventory and he came upon a piece that had
been commissioned two editors before him--David Foster Wallace's essay
on David Lynch, centered around Wallace's visit to the set of Lost
Highway. It had been assigned by Susan Lyne, it had come in, in
gargantuan form, and Kristen van Ogtrop took a stab at reducing its
mass. Premiere had published very long articles before, but this one
flummoxed a lot of people, particularly on account of the footnotes.
In any case, Kristen was on her way out--not because of the Pecker
thing, she had got a more genial (I presume) gig at Home and Garden or
some such title--and Jim was aware that I had actually read all of
Infinite Jest, so he handed me this massive manuscript and had me look
over Kristen's cuts, and then told me to contact Wallace and "mollify"
him about the massive cuts and, having done so, commence with a line
edit. This, in the event that anyone is even remotely interested, is
why Kristen is nicknamed "The Blunt Machete" and I am dubbed "The
Mollifier" on the acknowledgements page of Wallace's A Supposedly Fun
Thing I'll Never Do Again. In any case, the mollifying went pretty
well and Dave and I had a really good time working on that piece, as
we also would, up to a point, working on the piece he wrote for the
September '98 issue of the magazine under a dual pseudonym about the
AVN awards. In any case, "David Lynch Keeps His Head" (Sept. 96 issue)
proved to be a pretty big deal--got nominated for an ASME award and
all that--and I think that convinced Jim to put me on staff, which he
did in January of '97.

    Title:  Fighting to write: a short reminiscence of D.F. Wallace.
   Author:  Mark Costello

 Abstract:  Mark Costello's reminiscence of David Foster Wallace, his roommate
and co-author in the Summer of 1989, adds insight to Wallace's creative
periods and living conditions at that time. Wallace believed rap music had
some Nietzschean tendencies, read contemporary fiction on the toilet, and was
equally at home watching television or writing 25,000 words a day. While
Wallace's finished product may be sublime, the writing of it could be a
frantic affair.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

Between April Fool's Day and the Fourth of July, 1989, I wrote a small book
with David Foster Wallace.

Wallace and I were splitting a two-bedroom flop in the soot-path of the
Monsignor McGrath Highway, Boston. Wallace studied philosophy at Harvard. I
practiced something not dissimilar at a securities firm downtown. Bush was
president, TV sucked, and the natives were restless.

When you live in squalor, everybody gets the same flu. Our germ arrived, as
most germs do, from New York City. An old beatnik buddy of mine, freeloading
over the weekend, carried the infection in his luggage. I remember shooting
hoops a raw Saturday at Saint Anthony of Padua's, wiping our runny noses on an
increasingly slimy, rocklike basketball. Back at our tenement, the freeloader
blasted an unmarked tape: It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by
something called Public Enemy.

That was the summer Tone Loc's "Funky Cold Medina" hit number one, the
fastest-selling single ever, going triple platinum in August. There was live
rap at the Middle East in Central Square. College radio stations, playing
chicken with the FCC, aired incitements named "911 Is a Joke" and "Fuck tha
Police." Whole afternoons were spoken for among racks of new and used EPs and
LPs at Sam Goody's and Underground Sound and four other record stores that no
longer exist. Boston was waking up to a nasty little gang war and the BPD was
seizing N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton, as if the tape were wanted for
murder.

Wallace thought rap the assassin of language, culture, order. He said this as
if he were rather fond of the trio, and would miss them when they were dead.
But his was an engrossed, doting hatred. He listened to rap five times more
intensely than anybody else. Maybe Wallace was rooting for language and
culture. Then again, maybe not.

Don't be misled. I wrote a book with David Foster Wallace, but was never his
collaborator. Our co-authorship was more like chess by mail. Wallace was up to
his butt in Girl with Curious Hair publicity and research for a massive
nonfiction piece about porn actors, while more or less getting a Ph.D. in
aesthetics. I'd write a thousand words about Dr. King or the Fresh Prince or
whatever seemed burningest then, and give my work to Wallace. He would
disappear, inhale Pop Tarts, exhale cigarettes, curse his keyboard, and emerge
three hours later with an urgent twenty-page reply.

There was no shortage of chaos around 35 Houghton Street, apartment 2. Lost
bills went unpaid. The phone rang at 3:00 A.M. and women banged on the back
door two hours later. The big books were Vollmann's Rainbow Stories, Bangs's
Psychotic Reactions, Didion's Slouching towards Jerusalem, all of which sat
stacked, bindings broken, atop the john, a place of readerly honor. Our
downstairs neighbor was a burly furniture mover and self-proclaimed World's
Biggest David Foster Wallace Fan, who never missed an opportunity to stop by
and watch cop shows with his Favorite Living Writer. "Not that Broom of the
System isn't a piece of shit, mind you," the furniture mover informed Wallace.
"It's just less of a piece of shit than anything else being published." The
furniture mover's girlfriend was called "the Lizard," a runaway debutante who
wore 82nd Airborne T-shirts. The Lizard also enjoyed Wallace's work. Public
Enemy seemed to cap the decor.

Things were a little better in the daylight. Wallace set timetables for his
work, intricate as the Croton-on-Hudson local. Get up. Talk on phone with porn
actress famous for giving screen blow jobs. Hang up. Ask: is the porn queen an
actress? Look up actress in the OED. Actress: a female actor. Look up actor:
one who acts in a drama. Surely a blow job is an act. OK then: is a blow job
drama?

For relief, dig Kool Moe Dee while taking the morning's second shower. Ask: is
knowledge power, as KMD exults? Or does the rapper really mean power is
knowledge?

Goddamn, Wallace realizes, toweling down, that's Friedrich frickin' Nietzsche!
Listen again to Kool Moe Dee with German aesthetic fascism in mind; picture
Nietzsche in raparound shades, the blood-and-iron gangsta of hip-hop, yelling
I'M HUGE into a mike, now out in the alley kicking the shit out of a hapless
Walt Whitman. I'm bigger than you, Kool Moe Neetzsche jabbers at Whitman,
Yeah, I'm in the muthafuckin house!

Now Wallace must rush: boot it up to write it down, eight hours of mad
scribbling and crossing-out, trips to the dictionary, the shower, the
dictionary, ransacking the thought, and through five rewrites, the Nietzsche
flash becomes thirty-seven pages, some of which will make sense to their
creator the next day. Or the day after, if it turns out tomorrow is a fine day
to restore culture and order to the sock drawer.

Wallace is the smartest human I have ever known, plus the quickest, but he
fights to write, which is odd considering the plenty of his talents. I could
never tell who, or what, he was fighting with. He's both brutal worker and
brutal blow-off. He could bleed to death watching game shows, yet routinely
puts out twenty-five thousand careful words a day, then rides back slashing,
an editorial Idi Amin.

You will see no trace of this on his published page - no sign of struggle, as
crime scene cops say. A reviewer once called David Foster Wallace a
"loquacious angel." And, yes, his writing is often sublime, but his writing of
it is more like a Hell's Angel than a loquacious one.

A crucial passage in David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest occurs in the middle
of an encounter between the ghostly "wraith" figure of avant-garde director
James O. Incandenza and the gunshot-wounded convalescent Don Gately (832). As
Gately wonders if he is dreaming or hallucinating, a series of words and
phrases race into his consciousness. These "ghost words," which Gately does
not know "from a divot in the sod" (832), recapitulate Incandenza's life. The
capitalized series of obscure terms interpolated in the text are mainly
medical or optical in origin. The word "LUCULUS," however, is elusive. Listed
in the Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources as a rare alternate
spelling of "louculus," a small box or reliquary, the word has many other
potential meanings and evokes many aspects of the novel. By exploring what
this scene reveals about Incandenza's fatally addictive film "Infinite Jest"
(presented in quotation marks here to distinguish it from the novel), I will
explain some potential allusions and suggest why Wallace may have chosen the
unconventional spelling.

The phrase infinite jest alludes to the graveyard scene in Hamlet (5.1.159),
and Incandenza much identifies with the play. One of his production companies
was called "Poor Yorick Entertainment Unlimited" (Wallace 990), and he
requested in his will that several of his films (including the master copy of
"Infinite Jest") be buried with him. They were to be placed in a small box (or
"luculus") inside his coffin. If Incandenza had recognized the deadliness of
his creation, he may have been consciously attempting to re-create the
graveyard scene. There are two other direct references to Hamlet in the
interpolated terms: "LAERTES" and "POOR YORICK" (832). Gately's role in the
events surrounding the search for "Infinite Jest" may strike Incandenza as
being analogous to Laertes' role, as one of the director's innovations was the
parodic concept of "found drama": "A few people are randomly selected, and
whatever happens to them in a set period of time constitutes the 'drama'"
(1028).

Two of the other words have less obvious references to Hamlet. "LEVIRATE
MARRIAGE" could describe not only Claudius and Gertrude's situation but
Incandenza's as well. His wife Avril now lives in his former home with her
half-brother Charles Tavis, though they are not openly involved. "LUCULUS"
itself may allude to the play. If the meaning intended is "little grove," from
the Latin "lucus," then it suggests the Ghost's speech to Hamlet (1.5.59)
describing the poisoning in the orchard. Incandenza's eldest son, Orin,
believes that his mother--and possibly Tavis--drove his father to suicide.
Incandenza's purgatorial, wraithlike state, like King Hamlet's, allows him to
"hear the symphonic thoughts of animate men in toto" (839), but he does not
explicitly mention any plots or ask for revenge.

The word "lucus" is derived from "lux" (light); and the paradox that it means
"grove," or a small area shaded by trees, was the subject of Quintilian's
epigram: lucus a non lucendo ("a grove [so-called] from the absence of light")
(CEO). Incandenza was a brilliant optical physicist, and many of the other
words and phrases in the list refer to lenses and human sensory perception:
"NEUTRAL DENSITY POINT, "MENISCUS," "CHRONAXY," and "PRO-PRIOCEPTION," for
example. (832). His son Hal, who along with Gately is the closest candidate
for the novel's protagonist, has an eidetic memory and has committed a future
version of the QED to memory. Incandenza suffered from delusions during the
last years of his life that Hal had lost his ability to communicate, which
prefigures Hal's apparent descent into infantilism (literally,
"speechlessness") at the end of the narrative chronology. The cause of Hal's
malady is one of Infinite Jest's main mysteries, and the paradox inherent in
the etymology of "luculus" may offer a clue t o Hal's fate: Hal, like
Incandenza, has been shaded from the world by his parents, and the "little
light" let through has blinded him to human interaction.

The questions of legacy and judgment that arise in the ghostly hospital
encounter may allude to Brecht's The Trial of Lucullus, a play about the
epicurean Roman general whose exploits were detailed by Plutarch; his name is
sometimes spelled "Luculus" (as the "ghost words" are all capitalized, it is
impossible to tell if they are meant to be proper nouns). In Brecht's play,
Lucullus has died and is being tried in a purgatorial court by a jury of the
people whose lives his wars have decimated. Though the jurists are themselves
shades, they represent the living mass of humanity. The dead are judged based
on their actual contribution to the living. Incandenza's film, which he hoped
would "reverse thrust on a young self's [Hal's] fall into the womb of
solipsism" (839), has instead become his deadly testament to the living.

The phrase immediately following "LUCULUS" in the ghost words is "CERISE
MONTCLAIR" (832). Although most directly a reference to Incandenza's father's
beloved cherry-red car, "cerise" may also be an allusion to Brecht's play. In
that play, the only thing that the jury credits Lucullus with is bringing a
single cherry tree back from an Asian conquest. As the Farmer says,
hen all the plunder
Of both Asias has long turned to rot
This, the smallest of your trophies
Will stand upon the windly hills and wave
Each spring its bloom-white branches to the living. (Brecht 127)


The general's plunder did not help the Roman people, and he failed to
understand why his efforts were unappreciated. Incandenza's "most serious wish
was: to entertain" (839 emphasis in original), but instead he opened an abyss.
Both of them have failed to communicate: Lucullus with the people he led, and
Incandenza with the son he fathered. One reason for Incandenza's obsession
about being able to communicate with his son is his feeling that his own
father could not hear him. Incandenza's father describes his 1956 Mercury
Montclair in the scene where he decides to make his son into a tennis prodigy
(159), and the car has become a symbol of artificial perfection that
Incandenza could not achieve. He nearly attained perfection with the creation
of "Infinite Jest," but it was a perfection fatal to others--just like
Brecht's Lucullus.

As Frank L. Cioffi notes, Infinite Jest "[blurs] the boundary between a real
world and a fictive one" (163). One way in which the novel achieves this
effect is by its density. The significance of the one word outlined above
gives every impression of purposefulness, yet serious effort is required to
uncover the relation of that purpose to the rest of the narrative. That which
is most hidden is often most important; and of all the words Incandenza thinks
at Gately, "LUCULUS" is the most obscure. It contains within its history many
of the novel's own contacts between the fictive and the real.

    Title:  An interview with David Foster Wallace. (Interview)
   Author:  Larry McCaffery

 Abstract:  David Foster Wallace believes that irony and cynicism have become
so cliched that they are no longer enlightening. Fiction should focus on what
it means to be a human being in a time when it is hard to be anything but a
cynic. The post-structuralist/postmodern tendency to disassociate writing with
understanding any 'other' has led to a collapse of meaningful fiction. Fiction
today is not allowed to make the strange seem familiar, so it should focus on
making the familiar seem strange.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

Larry McCanery: Your essay following this interview is going to be seen by
some people as being basically an apology for television. What's your response
to the familiar criticism that television fosters relationships with illusions
or simulations of real people (Reagan being a kind of quintessential example)?

David Foster Wallace: It's a try at a comprehensive diagnosis, not an apology.
U.S. viewers' relationship with TV is essentially puerile and dependent, as
are all relationships based on seduction. This is hardly news. But what's
seldom acknowledged is how complex and ingenious TV's seductions are. It's
seldom acknowledged that viewers' relationship with TV is, albeit debased,
intricate and profound. It's easy for older writers just to bitch about TV's
hegemony over the U.S. art market, to say the world's gone to hell in a basket
and shrug and have done with it. But I think younger writers owe themselves a
richer account of just why TV's become such a dominating force on people's
consciousness, if only because we under like forty have spent our whole
conscious lives being part of TV's audience.

LM: Television may be more complex than what most people realize, but it seems
rarely to attempt to challenge or disturb its audience, as you've written me
you wish to. Is it that sense of challenge and pain that makes your work more
"serious" than most television shows?

DFW: I had a teacher I liked who used to say good fiction's job was to comfort
the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. I guess a big part of serious
fiction's purpose is to give the reader, who like all of us is sort of
marooned in her own skull, to give her imaginative access to other selves.
Since an ineluctable part of being a human self is suffering, part of what we
humans come to art for is an experience of suffering, necessarily a vicarious
experience, more like a sort of generalization of suffering. Does this make
sense? We all suffer alone in the real world; true empathy's impossible. But
if a piece of fiction can allow us imaginatively to identify with characters'
pain, we might then also more easily conceive of others identifying with our
own. This is nourishing, redemptive; we become less alone inside. It might be
just that simple. But now realize that TV and popular film and most kinds of
"low" art - which just means art whose primary aim is to make money - is,
lucrative precisely because it recognizes that audiences prefer 100 percent
pleasure to the reality that tends to be 49 percent pleasure and 51 percent
pain. Whereas "serious" art, which is not primarily about getting money out of
you, is more apt to make you uncomfortable, or to force you to work hard to
access its pleasures, the same way that in real life true pleasure is usually
a by-product of hard work and discomfort. So it's hard for an art audience,
especially a young one that's been raised to expect art to be 100 percent
pleasurable and to make that pleasure effortless, to read and appreciate
serious fiction. That's not good. The problem isn't that today's readership is
dumb, I don't think. Just that TV and the commercial-art culture's trained it
to be sort of lazy and childish in its expectations. But it makes trying to
engage today's readers both imaginatively and intellectually unprecedentedly
hard.

LM: Who do you imagine your readership to be?

DFW: I suppose it's people more or less like me, in their twenties and
thirties, maybe, with enough experience or good education to have realized
that the hard work serious fiction requires of a reader sometimes has a
payoff. People who've been raised with U.S. commercial culture and are engaged
with it and informed by it and fascinated with it but still hungry for
something commercial art can't provide. Yuppies, I guess, and younger
intellectuals, whatever. These are the people pretty much all the younger
writers I admire - Leyner and Vollmann and Daitch, Amy Homes, Jon Franzen,
Lorrie Moore, Rick Powers, even McInerney and Leavitt and those guys - are
writing for, I think. But, again, the last twenty years have seen big changes
in how writers engage their readers, what readers need to expect from any kind
of art.

LM: The media seems to me to be one thing that has drastically changed this
relationship. It's provided people with this television-processed culture for
so long that audiences have forgotten what a relationship to serious art is
all about.

DFW: Well, it's too simple to just wring your hands and claim TV's ruined
readers. Because the U.S.'s television culture didn't come out of a vacuum.
What TV is extremely good at - and realize that this is all it does - is
discerning what large numbers of people think they want, and supplying it. And
since there's always been a strong and distinctive American distaste for
frustration and suffering, TV's going to avoid these like the plague in favor
of something anesthetic and easy.

LM: You really think this distaste is distinctly American?

DFW: It seems distinctly Western-industrial, anyway. In most other cultures,
if you hurt, if you have a symptom that's causing you to suffer, they view
this as basically healthy and natural, a sign that your nervous system knows
something's wrong. For these cultures, getting rid of the pain without
addressing the deeper cause would be like shutting off a fire alarm while the
fire's still going. But if you just look at the number of ways that we try
like hell to alleviate mere symptoms in this country - from
fast-fast-fast-relief antacids to the popularity of lighthearted musicals
during the Depression - you can. see an almost compulsive tendency to regard
pain itself as the problem. And so pleasure becomes a value, a teleological
end in itself. It's probably more Western than U.S. per se. Look at
utilitarianism - that most English of contributions to ethics - and you see a
whole teleology predicated on the idea that the best human life is one that
maximizes the pleasure-to-pain ratio. God, I know this sounds priggish of me.
All I'm saying is that it's shortsighted to blame TV. It's simply another
symptom. TV didn't invent our aesthetic childishness here any more than the
Manhattan Project invented aggression. Nuclear weapons and TV have simply
intensified the consequences of our tendencies, upped the stakes.

LM: Near the end of "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way," there's a
line about Mark that "It would take an architect who could hate enough to feel
enough to love enough to perpetrate the kind of special cruelty only real
lovers can inflict." Is that the kind of cruelty you feel is missing in the
work of somebody like Mark Leyner?

DFW: I guess I'd need to ask you what kind of cruelty you thought the narrator
meant there.

LM: It seems to involve the idea that if writers care enough about their
audience - if they love them enough and love their art enough - they've got to
be cruel in their writing practices. "Cruel" the way an army drill sergeant is
when he decides to put a bunch of raw recruits through hell, knowing that the
trauma you're inflicting on these guys, emotionally, physically, physically,
is just part of a process that's going to strengthen them in the end, prepare
them for things they can't even imagine yet.

DFW: Well, besides the question of where the fuck do "artists" get off
deciding for readers what stuff the readers need to be prepared for, your idea
sounds pretty Aristotelian, doesn't it? I mean, what's the purpose of creating
fiction, for you? Is it essentially mimetic, to capture and order a protean
reality? Or is it really supposed to be therapeutic in an Aristotelian sense?

LM: I agree with what you said in "Westward" about serious art having to
engage a range of experiences; it can't be merely "metafictional," for
example, it has to deal with the world outside the page and variously so. How
would you contrast your efforts in this regard versus those involved in most
television or most popular fiction?

DFW: This might be one way to start talking about differences between the
early postmodern writers of the fifties and sixties and their contemporary
descendants. When you read that quotation from "Westward" just now, it sounded
to me like a covert digest of my biggest weaknesses as a writer. One is that I
have a grossly sentimental affection for gags, for stuff that's nothing but
funny, and which I sometimes stick in for no other reason than funniness.
Another's that I have a problem sometimes with concision, communicating only
what needs to be said in a brisk efficient way that doesn't call attention to
itself. It'd be pathetic for me to blame the exterior for my own deficiencies,
but it still seems to me that both of these problems are tracable to this
schizogenic experience I had growing up, being bookish and reading a lot, on
the one hand, watching grotesque amounts of TV, on the other. Because I liked
to read, I probably didn't watch quite as much TV as my friends, but I still
got my daily megadose, believe me. And I think it's impossible to spend that
many slack-jawed, spittle-chinned, formative hours in front of commercial art
without internalizing the idea that one of the main goals of art is simply to
entertain, give people sheer pleasure. Except to what end, this
pleasure-giving? Because, of course, TV's real agenda is to be liked, because
if you like what you're seeing, you'll stay tuned. TV is completely unabashed
about this; it's its sole raison. And sometimes when I look at my own stuff I
feel like I absorbed too much of this raison. I'll catch myself thinking up
gags or trying formal stunt-pilotry and see that none of this stuff is really
in the service of the story itself; it's serving the rather darker purpose of
communicating to the reader "Hey! Look at me! Have a look at what a good
writer I am! Like me!"

Now, to an extent there's no way to escape this altogether, because an author
needs to demonstrate some sort of skill or merit so that the reader will trust
her. There's some weird, delicate, I-trust-you-not-to-fuck-upon-me
relationship between the reader and writer, and both have to sustain it. But
there's an unignorable line between demonstrating skill and charm to gain
trust for the story vs. simple showing off. It can become an exercise in
trying to get the reader to like and admire you instead of an exercise in
creative art. I think TV promulgates the idea that good art is just that art
which makes people like and depend on the vehicle that brings them the art.
This seems like a poisonous lesson for a would-be artist to grow up with. And
one consequence is that if the artist is excessively dependent on simply being
liked, so that her true end isn't in the work but in a certain audience's good
opinion, she is going to develop a terrific hostility to that audience, simply
because she has given all her power away to them. It's the familiar love-hate
syndrome of seduction: "I don't really care what it is I say, I care only that
you like it. But since your good opinion is the sole arbiter of my success and
worth, you have tremendous power over me, and I fear you and hate you for it."
This dynamic isn't exclusive to art. But I often think I can see it in myself
and in other young writers, this desperate desire to please coupled with a
kind of hostility to the reader.

LM: In your own case, how does this hostility manifest itself.?

DFW: Oh, not always, but sometimes in the form of sentences that are
syntactically not incorrect but still a real bitch to read. Or bludgeoning the
reader with data. Or devoting a lot of energy to creating expectations and
then taking pleasure in disappointing them. You can see this clearly in
something like Ellis's American Psycho: it panders shamelessly to the
audience's sadism for a while, but by the end it's clear that the sadism's
real object is the reader herself.

LM: But at least in the case of American Psycho I felt there was something
more than just this desire to inflict pain - or that Ellis was being cruel the
way you said serious artists need to be willing to be.

DFW: You're just displaying the sort of cynicism that lets readers be
manipulated by bad writing. I think it's a kind of black cynicism about
today's world that Ellis and certain others depend on for their readership.
Look, if the contemporary condition is hopelessly shitty, insipid,
materialistic, emotionally retarded, sadomasochistic and stupid, then I (or
any writer) can get away with slapping together stories with characters who
are stupid, vapid, emotionally retarded, which is easy, because these sorts of
characters require no development. With descriptions that are simply lists of
brand-name consumer products. Where stupid people say insipid stuff to each
other. If what's always distinguished bad writing - flat characters, a
narrative world that's cliched and not recognizably human, etc. - is also a
description of today's world, then bad writing becomes an ingenious mimesis of
a bad world. If readers simply believe the world is stupid and shallow and
mean, then Ellis can write a mean shallow stupid novel that becomes a mordant
deadpan commentary on the badness of everything. Look man, we'd probably most
of us agree that these are dark times, and stupid ones, but do we need fiction
that does nothing but dramatize how dark and stupid everything is? In dark
times, the definition of good art would seem to be art that locates and
applies CPR to those elements of what's human and magical that still live and
glow despite the times' darkness. Really good fiction could have as dark a
worldview as it wished, but it'd find a way both to depict this dark world and
to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it. You can
defend Psycho as being a sort of performative digest of late-eighties social
problems, but it's no more than that.

LM: Are you saying that writers of your generation have an obligation not only
to depict our condition but also to provide the solutions to these things?

DFW: I don't think I'm talking about conventionally political or
social-action-type solutions. That's not what fiction's about. Fiction's about
what it is to be a fucking human being. If you operate, which most of us do,
from the premise that there are things about the contemporary U.S. that make
it distinctively hard to be a real human being, then maybe half of fiction's
job is to dramatize what it is that makes it tough. The other half is to
dramatize the fact that we still are human beings, now. Or can be. This isn't
that it's fiction's duty to edify or teach, or to make us good little
Christians or Republicans; I'm not trying to line up behind Tolstoy or
Gardner. I just think that fiction that isn't exploring what it means to be
human today isn't good art. We've got all this "literary" fiction that simply
monotones that we're all becoming less and less human, that presents
characters without souls or love, characters who really are exhaustively
describable in terms of what brands of stuff they wear, and we all buy the
books and go like "Golly, what a mordantly effective commentary on
contemporary materialism!" But we already all know U.S. culture is
materialistic. This diagnosis can be done in about two lines. It doesn't
engage anybody. What's engaging and artistically, real is, taking it as
axiomatic that the present is grotesquely materialistic, how is it that we as
human beings still have the capacity for joy, charity, genuine connections,
for stuff that doesn't have a price? And can these capacities be made to
thrive? And if so, how, and if not why not?

LM: Not everyone in your generation is taking the Ellis route. Both the other
writers in this issue of RCF seem to be doing exactly what you're talking
about. So, for example, even though Vollmann's Rainbow Stories is a book that
is in its own way as sensationalized as American Psycho, the effort there is
to depict those people not as flattened, dehumanized stereotypes but as human
beings. I'd agree, though, that a lot of contemporary writers today adopt this
sort of flat, neutral transformation of people and events into fiction without
bothering to make the effort of refocusing their imaginations on the people
who still exist underneath these transformations. But Vollmann seems to be
someone fighting that tendency in interesting ways.

This brings us back to the issue of whether this isn't a dilemma serious
writers have always faced. Other than lowered (or changed) audience
expectations, what's changed to make the task of the serious writer today more
difficult than it was thirty or sixty or a hundred or a thousand years ago?
You might argue that the task of the serious writer is easier today because
what took place in the sixties had the effect of finally demolishing the
authority that mimesis had assumed. Since you guys don't have to fight that
battle anymore, you're liberated to move on to other areas.

DFW: This is a double-edged sword, our bequest from the early post-modernists
and the post-structuralist critics. On the one hand, there's sort of an
embarrassment of riches for young writers now. Most of the old cinctures and
constraints that used to exist-censorship of content is a blatant example -
have been driven off the field. Writers today can do more or less whatever we
want. But on the other hand, since everybody can do pretty much whatever they
want, without boundaries to define them or constraints to struggle against,
you get this continual avant-garde rush forward without anyone bothering to
speculate on the destination, the goal of the forward rush. The modernists and
early postmodernists - all the way from Mallarme to Coover, I guess - broke
most of the rules for us, but we tend to forget what they were forced to
remember: the rule-breaking has got to be for the sake of something. When
rule-breaking, the mere form of renegade avant-gardism, becomes an end in
itself, you end up with bad language poetry and American Psycho's
nipple-shocks and Alice Cooper eating shit on stage. Shock stops being a
by-product of progress and becomes an end in itself. And it's bullshit. Here's
an analogy. The invention of calculus was shocking because for a long time it
had simply been presumed that you couldn't divide by zero. The integrity of
math itself seemed to depend on the presumption. Then some genuine titans came
along and said, "Yeah, maybe you can't divide by zero, but what would happen
if you could? We're going to come as close to doing it as we can, to see what
happens."

LM: So you get the infinitesimal calculus - the "philosophy of as if."

DFW: And this purely theoretical construct wound up yielding incredible
practical results. Suddenly you could plot the area under curves and do
rate-change calculations. Just about every material convenience we now enjoy
is a consequence of this "as if." But what if Leibniz and Newton had wanted to
divide by zero only to show jaded audiences how cool and rebellious they were?
It'd never have happened, because that kind of motivation doesn't yield
results. It's hollow. Dividing-as-if-by-zero was titanic and ingenious because
it was in the service of something. The math world's shock was a price they
had to pay, not a payoff in itself.

LM: Of course, you also have examples like Lobochevsky and Riemann, who are
breaking rules with no practical application at the time - but then later on
somebody like Einstein comes along and decides that this worthless
mathematical mind game that Riemann developed actually described the universe
more effectively than the Euclidean game. Not that those guys were breaking
the rules just to break the rules, but part of that was just that: what
happens if everybody has to move counter-clockwise in Monopoly. And at first
it just seemed like this game, without applications.

DFW: Well, the analogy breaks down because math and hard science are
pyramidical. They're like building a cathedral: each generation works off the
last one, both its advances and its effors. Ideally, each piece of art's its
own unique object, and its evaluation's always present-tense. You could
justify the worst piece of experimental horseshit by saying. "The fools may
hate my stuff, but generations later I will be appreciated for my
ground-breaking rebellion." All the beret-wearing artistes I went to school
with who believed that line are now writing ad copy someplace.

LM: The European avant-garde believed in the transforming ability of
innovative art to directly affect people's consciousness and break them out of
their cocoon of habituation, etc. You'd put a urinal in a Paris museum, call
it a "fountain," and wait for the riots next day. That's an area I'd say has
changed things for writers (or any artist) - you can have very aesthetically
radical works today using the same features of formal innovation that you'd
find in the Russian Futurists or Duchamp and so forth, only now these things
are on MTV or TV ads. Formal innovation as trendy image. So it loses its
ability to shock or transform.

DFW: These are exploitations. They're not trying to break us free of anything.
They're trying to lock us tighter into certain conventions, in this case
habits of consumption. So the form of artistic rebellion now becomes comes ...

LM: ... yeah, another commodity. I agree with Fredric Jameson and others who
argue that modernism and postmorodenism can be seen as expressing the cultural
logic of late capitalism. Lots of features of contemporary art are directly
influenced by this massive acceleration of capitalist expansion into all these
new realms that were previoisly just not accessible. You sell people a memory,
reify their nostalgia and use this as a hook to sell deodorant. Hasn't this
recent huge expansion of the technologies of reproduction, the integration of
commodity reproduction and aesthetic reproduction, and the rise of media
culture lessened the impact that aesthetic innovation can have on people's
sensibilities? What's your response to this as an artist?

DFW: You've got a gift for the lit-speak, LM. Who wouldn't love this jargon we
dress common sense in: "formal innovation is no longer transformative, having
been co-opted by the forces of stabilization and post-industrial inertia,"
blah blah. But this co-optation might actually be a good thing if it helps
keep younger writers from being able to treat mere formal ingenuity as an end
in itself. MTV-type co-optation could end up a great prophylactic against
cleveritis - you know, the dreaded grad-school syndrome of like "Watch me use
seventeen different points of view in this scene of a guy eating a Saltine."
The only real point of that shit is "Like me because I'm clever" - which of
course is itself derived from commercial art's axiom about audience -affection
determining art's value.

What's precious about somebody like Bill Vollmann is that, even though there's
a great deal of formal innovation in his fictions, it rarely seems to exist
for just its own sake. It's almost always deployed to make some point
(Vollmann's the most editorial young novelist going right now, and he's great
at using formal ingenuity to make the editorializing a component of his
narrative instead of an interruption) or to create an effect that's internal
to the text. His narrator's always weirdly effaced, the writing
unself-conscious, despite all the "By-the-way-Dear-Reader" intrusions. In a
way it's sad that Vollmann's integrity is so remarkable. Its remarkability
means it's rare. I guess I don't know what to think about these explosions in
the sixties you're so crazy about. It's almost like postmodernism is fiction's
fall from biblical grace. Fiction became conscious of itself in a way it never
had been. Here's a really pretentious bit of pop analysis for you: I think you
can see Cameron's Terminator movies as a metaphor for all literary art after
Roland Barthes, viz., the movies' premise that the Cyberdyne NORAD computer
becomes conscious of itself as conscious, as having interests and an agenda;
the Cyberdyne becomes literally self-referential, and it's no accident that
the result of this is nuclear war, Armageddon.

LM: Isn't Armageddon the course you set sail for in "Westward"?

DFW: Metafiction's real end has always been Armageddon. Art's reflection on
itself is terminal, is one big reason why the art world saw Duchamp as an
Antichrist. But I still believe the move to involution had value: it helped
writers break free of some long-standing flat-earth-type taboos. It was
standing in line to happen. And for a little while, stuff like Pale Fire and
The, Universal Baseball Association was valuable as a metaesthetic
breakthrough the same way Duchamp's urinal had been valuable.

LM: I've always felt that the best of the metafictionists - Cover, for
example, Nabokov, Borges, even Barth - were criticized too much for being only
interested in narcissistic, self-reflexive games, whereas these devices had
very real political and historical applications.

DFW: But when you talk about Nabokov and Cover, you're talking about real
geniuses, the writers who weathered real shock and invented this stuff in
contemporary fiction. But after the pioneers always come the crank-turners,
the little gray people who take the machines others have built and just tum
the crank, and little pellets of metafiction come out the other end. The
crank-turners capitalize for a while on sheer fashion, and they get their
plaudits and grants and buy their IRAs and retire to the Hamptons well out of
range of the eventual blast radius. There are some interesting parallels
between postmordern crank-turners and what's happened since post-structural
theory took off here in the U.S., why there's such a big backlash against
post-structuralism going on now. It's the cranktuners' fault. I think the
crank-tuner's replaced the critic as the real angel of death as far as
literary movements are concerned, now. You get some bona fide artists who come
along and really divide by zero and weather some serious shit-storms of shock
and ridicule in order to promulgate some really important ideas. Once they
triumph, though, and their ideas become legitimate and accepted, the
crank-turners and wannabes come running to the machine, and out pour the gray
pellets, and now the whole thing,'s become a hollow form, just another
institution of fashion. Take a look at some of the critical-theory Ph.D.
dissertations being written now. They're like de Man and Foucault in the mouth
of a dull child. Academia and commercial culture have somehow become these
gigantic mechanisms of commodification that drain the weight and color out of
even the most radical new advances. It's a surreal inversion of the
death-by-neglect that used to kill off prescient art. Now prescient art
suffers death-by-acceptance. We love things to death, now. Then we retire to
the Hamptons.

LM: This is also tied to that expansion of capitalism blah blah blah into
realms previously thought to be uncommodifiable. Hyperconsumption. I mean,
whoever thought rebellion could be tamed so easily? You j ust record it, turn
the crank, and out comes another pellet of "dangerous" art.

DFW: And this accelarates the metastasis from genuine envelope-puncturing to
just another fifteen-minute form that gets cranked out and cranked out and
cranked out. Which creates a bitch of a problem for any artist who views her
task as continual envelope-puncturing, because then she falls into this
insatiable hunger for the appearance of novelty: "What can I do that hasn't
been done yet?" Once the first-person pronoun creeps into your agenda you're
dead, art-wise. That's why fiction-writing's lonely in a way most people
misunderstand. It's yourself you have to be estranged from, really, to work.

LM: A phrase in one of your recent letters really struck me: "The magic of
fiction is that it addresses and antagonizes the loneliness that dominates
people." It's that suggestion of antagonizing the reader that seems to link
your goals up with the avant-garde program - whose goals were never completely
hermetic. And "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" seems to be your
own meta-metafictional attempt to deal with these large areas in ways that are
not merely metafiction.

DFW: "Aggravate" might be better than "antagonize," in the sense of
aggravation as intensification. But the truth is it's hard for me to know what
I really think about any of the stuff I've written. It's always tempting to
sit back and make finger-steeples and invent impressive-sounding theoretical
justifications for what one does, but in my case most of it'd be horseshit. As
time passes I get less and less nuts about anything I've published, and it
gets harder to know for sure when its antagonistic elements are in there
because they serve a useful purpose and when they're just covert
manifestations of this "look-at-me-please-love-me-i-hate-you" syndrome I still
sometimes catch myself falling into. Anyway, but what I think I meant by
"antagonize" or "aggravate" has to do with the stuff in the TV essay about the
younger writer trying to struggle against the cultural hegemony of TV. One
thing TV does is help us deny that we're lonely. With televised images, we can
have the facsimile of a relationship without the work of a real relationship.
It's an anesthesia of form. The interesting thing is why we're so desperate
for this anesthetic against loneliness. You don't have. to think very hard to
realize that our dread of both relationships and loneliness, both of which are
like sub-dreads of our dread of being trapped inside a self (a psychic self,
not just a physical self), has to do with angst about death, the recognition
that I'm going to die, and die very much alone, and the rest of the world is
going to go merrily on without me. I'm not sure I could give you a
steeple-fingered theoretical justification, but I strongly suspect a big part
of real art-fiction's job is to aggravate this sense of entrapment and
loneliness and death in people, to move people to countenance it, since any
possible human redemption requires us first to face what's dreadful, what we
want to deny.

LM: It's this inside/outside motif you developed throughout The Broom of the
System.

DFW: I guess maybe, though there it's developed in an awful clunky way. The
popularity of Broom mystifies me. I can't say it's not nice to have people
like it, but there's a lot of stuff in that novel I'd like to reel back in and
do better. I was like twenty-two when I wrote the first draft of that thing.
And I mean a young twenty-two. I still thought in terms of distinct problems
and univocal solutions. But if you're going to try not just to depict the way
a culture's bound and defined by mediated gratification and image, but somehow
to redeem it, or at least fight a rearguard against it, then what you're going
to be doing is paradoxical. You're at once allowing the reader to sort of
escape self by achieving some sort of identification with another human psyche
- the writer's, or some character's, etc. - and you're also trying to
antagonize the reader's intuition that she is a self, that she is alone and
going to die alone. You're trying somehow both to deny and affirm that the
writer is over here with his agenda while the reader's over there with her
agenda, distinct. This paradox is what makes good fiction sort of magical, I
think. The paradox can't be resolved, but it can somehow be mediated -
"re-mediated," since this is probably where post-structuralism rears its head
for me - by the fact that language and linguistic intercourse is, in and of
itself, redeeming, remedy-ing.

This makes serious fiction a rough and bumpy affair for everyone involved.
Commercial entertaimnent, on the other hand, smooths everything over. Even the
Terminator movies (which I revere), or something really nasty and sicko like
the film version of A Clockwork Orange, is basically an anesthetic (and think
for a second about the etymology of "anesthetic"; break the word up and think
about it). Sure, A Clockwork Orange is a selfconsciously sick, nasty film
about the sickness and nastiness of the postindustrial condition, but if you
look at it structurally, slo-mo and fast-mo and arty cinematography aside, it
does what all commercial entertainment does: it proceeds more or less
chronologically, and if its transitions are less cause-and-effect-based than
most movies', it still kind of eases you from scene to scene in a way that
drops you into certain kinds of easy cerebral rhythms. It admits of passive
spectation. Encourages it. TV-type art's biggest hook is that it's figured out
ways to reward passive spectation. A certain amount of the form-conscious
stuff I write is trying-with whatever success - to do the opposite. It's
supposed to be uneasy. For instance, using a lot of flash-cuts between scenes
so that some of the narrative arrangement has got to be done by the reader, or
interrupting flow with digressions and interpolations that the reader has to
do the work of connecting to each other and to the narrative. It's nothing
terribly sophisticated, and there has to be an accessible payoff for the
reader if I don't want the reader to throw the book at the wall. But if it
works right, the reader has to fight through the mediated voice presenting the
material to you. The complete suppression of a narrative consciousness, with
its own agenda, is why TV is such a powerful selling tool. This is McLuhan,
right? "The medium is the message" and all that? But notice that TV's mediated
message is never that the medium's the message.

LM: How is this insistence on mediation different from the kind of
meta-strategies you yourself have attacked as preventing authors from being
anything other than narcissistic or overly abstract or intellectual?

DFW: I guess I'd judge what I do by the same criterion I apply to the
self-conscious elements you find in Vollmann's fiction: do they serve a
purpose beyond themselves? Whether I can provide a payoff and communicate a
function rather than just seem jumbled and prolix is the issue that'll decide
whether the thing I'm working on now succeeds or not. But I think right now
it's important for art-fiction to antagonize the reader's sense that what
she's experiencing as she reads is mediated through a human consciousness, one
with an agenda not necessarily coincident with her own. For some reason I
probably couldn't explain, I've been convinced of this for years, that one
distinctive thing about truly "low" or commercial art is this apparent
suppression of a mediating consciousness and agenda. The example I think of
first is the novella "Little Expressionless Animals" in Girl with Curious
Hair. Readers I know sometimes remark on all the flashcuts and the distortion
of linearity in it and usually want to see it as mimicking TV's own pace and
phosphenic flutter. But what it's really trying to do is just the opposite of
TV - it's trying to prohibit the reader from forgetting that she's receiving
heavily mediated data, that this process is a relationship between the
writer's consciousness and her own, and that in order for it to be anything
like a real full human relationship, she's going to have to put in her share
of the linguistic work.

This night be my best response to your claim that my stuff's not "realistic."
I'm not much interested in trying for classical, big-R Realism, not because
there hasn't been great U.S. Realist fiction that'll be read and enjoyed
forever, but because the big R's form has now been absorbed and suborned by
commercial entertainment. The classical Realist form is soothing, familiar and
anesthetic; it drops us right into spectation. It doesn't set up the sort of
expectations serious 1990s fiction ought to be setting up in readers.

LM: The Broom of the System already displays some of the formal tendencies
found in the stories in Girl with Curious Hair and in your new, work - that
play with temporal structure and flash-cuts, for instance, for heightened
rhetorical effects of various sorts, for defamiliarizing things. Would you say
your approach to form/content issues has, undergone any radical changes since
you were a "young twenty-two"?

DFW: Assuming I understand what you mean by "form/content," the only way I can
answer you is to talk about my own background. Oh boy, I get to make myself
sound all fascinating and artistic and you'll have no way to check up. Return
with us now to Deare Olde Amherst. For most of my college career I was a
hard-core syntax wienie, a philosophy major with a specialization in math and
logic. I was, to put it modestly, quite good at the stuff, mostly because I
spent all my free time doing it. Wienieish or not, I was actually chasing a
special sort of buzz, a special moment that comes sometimes. One teacher
called these moments "mathematical experiences." What I didn't know then was
that a mathematical experience was aesthetic in nature, an epiphany in Joyce's
original sense. These moments appeared in proof-completions, or maybe
algorithms. Or like a gorgeously simple solution to a problem you suddenly see
after filling half a notebook with gnarly attempted solutions. It was really
an experience of what I think Yeats called "the click of a well-made box."
Something like that. The word I always think of it as is "click."

Anyway, I was just awfully good at technical philosophy, and it was the first
thing I'd ever been really good at, and so everybody, including me,
anticipated I'd make it a career. But it sort of emptied out for me somewhere
around age twenty. I just got tired of it, and panicked because I was suddenly
not getting joy from the one thing I was clearly supposed to do because I was
good at it and people liked me for being good at it. Not a fun time. I think I
had kind of a mid-life crisis at twenty, which probably doesn't augur real
well for my longevity.

So what I did, I went back home for a term, planning to play solitaire and
stare out the window, whatever you do in a crisis. And all of a sudden I found
myself writing fiction. My only real experience with fun writing had been on a
campus magazine with Mark Costello, the guy I later wrote Signifying Rappers
with. But I had had experience withchasing the click, from all the time spent
with proofs. At some point in my reading and writing that fall I discovered
the click existed in literature, too. It was real lucky that just when I
stopped being able to get the click from math logic I started to be able to
get it from fiction. The first fictional clicks I encountered were in Donald
Barthelme's "The Balloon" and in parts of the first story I ever wrote, which
has been in my trunk since I finished it. I don't know whether I have much
natural talent going for me fiction-wise, but I know I can hear the click,
when there's a click. In Don DeLillo's stuff, for example, almost line by line
I can hear the click. It's maybe the only way to describe writers I love. I
hear the click in most Nabokov. In Donne, Hopkins, Larkin. In Puig and
Cortazar. Puig clicks like a fucking Geiger counter. And none of these people
write prose as pretty as Updike, and yet I don't much hear the click in
Updike.

But so here I am at like twenty-one and I don't know what to do. Do I go into
math logic, which I'm good at and pretty much guaranteed an approved career
in? Or do I try to keep on with this writing thing, this artiste thing? The
idea of trying to be a "writer" repelled me, mostly because of all the foppish
aesthetes I knew at school who went around in berets stroking their chins
calling themselves writers. I have a terror of seeming like those guys, still.
Even today, when people I don't know ask me what I do for a living, I usually
tell them I'm "in English" or I "work free-lance." I don't seem to be able to
call myself a writer. And terms like "postmodernist" or "surrealist" send me
straight to the bathroom, I've got to tell you.

LM: I spend time in toilet stalls myself. But I noticed you didn't take off
down the hall when I said earlier that your work didn't seem "realistic." Do
you really agree with that?

DFW: Well, it depends whether you're talking little-r realistic or big-R. If
you mean is my stuff in the Howells/Wharton/IUpdike school of U.S. Realism,
clearly not. But to me the whole binary of realistic vs. unrealistic fiction
is a canonical distinction set up by people with a vested interest in the
big-R tradition. A way to marginalize stuff that isn't soothing and
conservative. Even the goofiest avant-garde agenda, if it's got integrity, is
never, "Let's eschew all realism," but more, "Let's try to countenance and
render real aspects of real experiences that have previously been excluded
from art." The result often seems "unrealistic" to the big-R devotees because
it's not a recognizable part of the "ordinary experience" they're used to
countenancing. I guess my point is that "realistic" doesn't have a univocal
definition. By the way, what did you mean a minute ago when you were talking
about a writer "defamiliarizing" something?

LM: Placing something familiar in an unfamiliar context - say, setting it in
the past or within some other structure that will re-expose it, allow readers
to see the real essence of the thing that's usually taken for granted because
it's buried underneath all the usual sludge that accompanies it.

DFW: I guess that's supposed to be deconstruction's original program, right?
People have been under some sort of metaphysical anesthesia, so you dismantle
the metaphysics' axioms and prejudices, show it in cross section and reveal
the advantages of its abandonment. It's literally aggravating: you awaken them
to the fact that they've been unconsciously imbibing some narcotic pharmakon
since they were old enough to say Momma. There's many different ways to think
about what I'm doing, but if I follow what you mean by "defamiliarization," I
guess it's part of what getting the click right is for me. It might also be
part of why I end up doing anywhere from five to eight total rewrites to
finish something, which is why I'm never going to be a Vollmann or an Oates.

LM: You've mentioned the recent change about what writers can assume about
their readers in terms of expectations and so on. Are there other ways the
postmodeern world has influenced or changed the role of serious writing today?

DFW: If you mean a post-industrial, mediated world, it's inverted one of
fiction's big historical functions, that of providing data on distant cultures
and persons. The first real generalization of human experience that novels
tried to accomplish. If you lived in Bumfock, Iowa, a hundred years ago and
had no idea what life was like in India, good old Kipling goes over and
presents it to you. And of course the post-structural critics now have a field
day on all the colonialist and phallocratic prejudices inherent in the idea
that writers were presenting alien cultures instead of "re-presenting" them -
jabbering natives and randy concubines and white man's burden, etc. Well, but
fiction's presenting function for today's reader has been reversed: since the
whole global village is now presented as familiar, electronically immediate -
satellites, microwaves, intrepid PBS anthropologists, Paul Simon's Zulu
back-ups - it's almost like we need fiction writers to restore strange things'
ineluctable strangeness, to defamiliarize stuff, I guess you'd say.

LM: David Lynch's take on suburbia. Or Mark Leyner's take on his own daily
life --

DFW: And Leyner's real good at it. For our generation, the entire world seems
to present itself as "familiar," but since that's of course an illusion in
terms of anything really important about people, maybe any "realistic"
fiction's job is opposite what it used to be - no longer making the strange
familiar but making the familiar strange again. It seems important to find
ways of reminding ourselves that most "familiarity" is mediated and delusive.

LM: "Postmodernism" usually implies "an integration of pop and 'serious'
culture." But a lot of the pop culture in the works of the younger writers I
most admire these days - you, Leyner, Gibson, Vollmann, Eurudice, Daitch, et
al. - seems to be introduced less to integrate high and low culture, or to
valorize pop culture, than to place this stuff in a new context so we can be
liberated from it. Wasn't that, for example, one of the things you were doing
with Jeopardy in "Little Expressionless Animals"?

DFW: One new context is to take something almost narcotizingly banal - it's
hard to think of anything more banal than a U.S. game show; in fact the
banality's one of TV's great hooks, as the TV essay discusses - and try to
reconfigure it in a way that reveals what a tense, strange, convoluted set of
human interactions the final banal product is. The scrambled, flash-cut form I
ended up using for the novella was probably unsubtle and clumsy, but the form
clicked for me in a way it just hadn't when I'd done it straight.

LM: A lot of your works (including Broom) have to do with this breakdown of
the boundaries between the real and "games," or the characters playing the
game begin to confuse the game structure with reality's structure. Again, I
suppose you can see this in "Little Expressionless Animals," where'the real
world outside Jeopardy is interacting with what's going on inside the game
show - the boundaries between inner and outer are blurred.

DFW: And, too, in the novella what's going on on the show has repercussions
for everybody's lives outside it. The valence is always distributive. It's
interesting that most serious art, even avant-garde stuff that's in collusion
with literary theory, still refuses to acknowledge this, while serious science
butters its bread with the fact that the separation of subject/observer and
object/experiment is impossible. Observing a quantum phenomenon's been proven
to alter the phenomenon. Fiction likes to ignore this fact's implications. We
still think in terms of a story "changing" the reader's emotions,
cerebrations, maybe even her life. We're not keen on the idea of the story
sharing its valence with the reader. But the reader's own life "outside" the
story changes the story. You could argue that it affects only "her reaction to
the story" or "her take on the story." But these things are the story. This is
the way Barthian and Derridean post-structuralism's helped me the most as a
fiction writer: once I'm done with the thing, I'm basically dead, and probably
the text's dead; it becomes simply language, and language lives not just in
but through the reader. The reader becomes God, for all textual purposes. I
see your eyes glazing over, so I'll hush.

LM: Let's go back for just a moment to your sense of the limits of
metafiction: in both your current RCF essay and in the novella "Westward" in
Girl with Curious Hair, you imply that metafiction is a game that only reveals
itself, or that can't share its valence with anything outside itself - like
the daily world.

DFW: Well, but metafiction is more valuable than that. It helps reveal fiction
as a mediated experience. Plus it reminds us that there's always a recursive
component to utterance. This was important, because language's
self-consciousness had always been there, but neither writers nor critics nor
readers wanted to be reminded of it. But we ended up seeing why recursion's
dangerous, and maybe why everybody wanted to keep linguistic
self-consciousness out of the show. It gets empty and solipsistic real fast.
It spirals in on itself. By the mid-seventies, I think, everything useful
about the mode had been exhausted, and the crank-turners had descended. By the
eighties it'd become a godawful trap. In "Westward" I got trapped one time
just trying to expose the illusions of metafiction the same way metafiction
had tried to expose the illusions of the pseudo-unmediated realist fiction
that came before it. It was a horror show. The stuff's a permanent migraine.

LM: Why is meta-metafiction a trap? Isn't that what you were doing in
"Westward"?

DFW: That's a Rog. And maybe "Westward"'s only real value'll be showing the
kind of pretentious loops you fall into now if you fuck around with recursion.
My idea in "Westward" was to do with metafiction what Moore's poetry or like
DeLillo's Libra had done with other mediated myths. I wanted to get the
Armageddon-explosion, the goal metafiction's always been about, I wanted to
get it over with, and then out of the rubble reaffirm the idea of art being a
living transaction between humans, whether the transaction was erotic or
altruistic or sadistic. God, even talking about it makes me want to puke. The
pretension. Twenty-five-year-olds should be locked away and denied ink and
paper. Everything I wanted to do came out in the story, but it came out as
just what it was: crude and naive and pretentious.

LM: Of course, even The Broom of the System can be seen as a metafiction, as a
book about language and about the relationship between words and reality.

DFW: Think of The Broom of the System as the sensitive tale of a sensitive
young WASP who's just had this mid-life crisis that's moved him from coldly
cerebral analytic math to a coldly cerebral take on fiction and
Austin-Wittgenstein-Derridean literary theory, which also shifted his
existential dread from a fear that he was just a 98.6 [degress] calculating
machine to a fear that he was nothing but a linguistic construct. This WASP's
written a lot of straight humor, and loves gags, so he decides to write a
coded autobio that's also a funny little post-structural gag: so you get
Lenore, a character in a story who's terribly afraid that she's really nothing
more than a character in a story. And, sufficiently hidden under the
sex-change and the gags and theoretical allusions, I got to write my sensitive
little self-obsessed bildungsroman. The biggest cackle I got when the book
came out was the way all the reviews, whether they stomped up and down on the
overall book or not, all praised the fact that at least here was a first novel
that wasn't yet another sensitive little self-obsessed bildtingsroman.

LM: Wittgenstein's work, especially the Tractatus, permeates The Broom of the
System in all sorts of ways, both as content and in terms of the metaphors you
employ. But in the later stages of his career, Wittgenstein concluded that
language was unable to refer in the direct, referential way he'd argued it
could in the Tractatus. Doesn't that mean language is a closed loop - there's
no permeable membrane to allow the inside from getting through to the outside?
And if that's the case, then isn't a book only a game? Or does the fact that
it's a language game make it somehow different?

DFW: There's a kind of tragic fall Wittgenstein's obsessed with all the way
from the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in 1922 to the Philosophical
Investigations in his last years. I mean a real Book-of-Genesis-type tragic
fall. The loss of the whole external world. The Tractatus's picture theory of
meaning presumes that the only possible relation between language and the
world is denotative, referential. In order for language both to be meaningful
and to have some connection to reality, words like tree and house have to be
like little pictures, representations of real trees and houses. Mimesis. But
nothing more. Which means we can know and speak of nothing more than little
mimetic pictures. Which divides us, metaphysically and forever, from the
external world. If you buy such a metaphysical schism, you're left with only
two options. One is that the individual person with her language is trapped in
here, with the world out there, and never the twain shall meet. Which, even if
you think language's pictures really are mimetic, is an awful lonely
proposition. And there's no iron guarantee the pictures truly are mimetic,
which means you're looking at solipsism. One of the things that makes
Wittgenstein a real artist to me is that he realized that no conclusion could
be more horrible than solipsism. And so he trashed everything he'd been lauded
for in the Tractatus and wrote the Investigations, which is the single most
comprehensive and beautiful argument against solipsism that's ever been made.
Wittgenstein argues that for language even to be possible, it must always be
a.function of relationships between persons (that's why he spends so much time
arguing against the possibility of a "private language"). So he makes language
dependent on human community, but unfortunately we're still stuck with the
idea that there is this world of referents out there that we can never really
join or know because we're stuck in here, in language, even if we're at least
all in here together. Oh yeah, the other original option. The other option is
to expand the linguistic subject. Expand the self.

LM: Like Norman Bombardini in Broom of the System.

DFW: Yeah, Norman's gag is that he literalizes the option. He's going to
forget the diet and keep eating until he grows to "infinite size" and
eliminates loneliness that way. This was Wittgenstein's double bind: you can
either treat language as an infinitely small dense dot, or you let it become
the world - the exterior and everything in it. The former banishes you from
the Garden. The latter seems more promising. If the world is itself a
linguistic construct, there's nothing "outside" language for language to have
to picture or refer to. This lets you avoid solipsism, but it leads right to
the postmodern, post-structural dilemma of having to deny yourself an
existence independent of language. Heidegger's the guy most people think got
us into this bind, but when I was working on Broom of the System I saw
Wittgenstein as the real architect of the postmodern trap. He died right on
the edge of explicidy treating reality as linguistic instead of ontological.
This eliminated solipsism, but not the horror. Because we're still stuck. The
Investigation's line is that the fundamental problem of language is, quote, "I
don't know my way about." If I were separate from language, if I could somehow
detach from it and climb up and look down on it, get the lay of the land so to
speak, I could study it "objectively," take it apart, deconstruct it, know its
operations and boundaries and deficiencies. But that's not how things are. I'm
in it. We're in language. Wittgenstein's not Heidegger, it's not that language
is us, but we're still in it, inescapably, the same way we're in like Kant's
space-time. Wittgenstein's conclusions seem completely sound to me, always
have. And if there's one thing that consistently bugs me writing-wise, it's
that I don't feel I really do know my way around inside language - I never
seem to get the kind of clarity and concision I want.

LM: Ray Carver comes immediately to mind in terms of compression and clarity,
and he's obviously someone who wound up having a huge influence on your
generation.

DFW: Minimalism's just the other side of metafictional recursion. The basic
problem's still the one of the mediating narrative consciousness. Both
minimalism and metafiction try to resolve the problem in radical ways.
Opposed, but both so extreme they end up empty. Recursive metafiction worships
the narrative consciousness, makes it the subject of the text. Minimalism's
even worse, emptier, because it's a fraud: it eschews not only self-reference
but any narrative personality at all, tries to pretend there is no narrative
consciousness in its text. This is so fucking American, man: either make
something your God and cosmos and then worship it, or else kill it.

LM: But did Carver really do that? I'd say his narrative voice is nearly
always insistently there, like Hemingway's was. You're never allowed to
forget.

DFW: I was talking about minimalists, not Carver. Carver was an artist, not a
minimalist. Even though he's supposedly the inventor of modem U.S. minimalism.
"Schools" of fiction are for crank-turners. The founder of a movement is never
part of the movement. Carver uses all the techniques and anti-styles that
critics call "miniinalist," but his case is like Joyce, or Nabokov, or early
Barth and Coover - he's using formal innovation in the service of an original
vision. Carver invented - or resurrected, if you want to cite Hemingway - the
techniques of,minimalism in the service of rendering a world he saw that
nobody'd seen before. it's a grim world, exhausted and empty and full of mute,
beaten people, but the minimalist techniques Carver employed were perfect for
it; they created it. And minimalism for Carver wasn't some rigid aesthetic
program he adhered to for its own sake. Carver's commitment was to his
stories, each of them. And when minimalism didn't serve them, he blew it off.
If he realized a story would be best served by expansion, not ablation, he'd
expand, like he did to. "The Bath," which he later turned into a vastly
superior story. He just chased the click. But at some point his "minimalist"
style caught on. A movement was born, proclaimed, promulgated by the critics.
Now here come the crank-turners. What's especially dangerous about Carver's
techniques is that they seem so easy to imitate. It doesn't seem like each
word and line and draft has been bled over. That's part of his genius. It
looks like you can write a minimalist piece without much bleeding. And you
can. But not a good one.

LM: For various reasons, the sixties postmodernists were heavily influenced by
other art forms - television, for instance, or the cinema or painting - but in
particular their notions of form and structure were often influenced by jazz.
Do you think that your generation of writers has been similarly influenced by
rock music? For instance, you and Mark Costello collaborated on the first
book-length study of rap (Signifying Rappers); would you say that your
interest in rap has anything to do with your writerly concerns? There's a way
in which I can relate your writing with rap's "postmodern" features, its
approach to structure and social issues. Sampling. Recontextualizing.

DFW: About the only way music informs my work is in terms of rhythm; sometimes
I associate certain narrators' and characters' voices with certain pieces of
music. Rock music itself bores me, usually. The phenomenon of rock interests
me, though, because its birth was part of the rise of mass popular media,
which completely changed the ways the U.S. was unified and split. The mass
media unified the country geographically for pretty much the first time. Rock
helped change the fundamental splits in the U.S. from geographical splits to
generational ones. Very few people I talk to understand what "generation gap"
's implications really were. Kids loved rock partly because their parents
didn't, and obversely. In a massmediated nation, it's no longer North vs.
South. It's under-thirty vs. overthirty. I don't think you can understand the
sixties and Vietnam and loveins and LSD and the whole era of patricidal
rebellion that helped inspire early postmodern fiction's whole
"We're-going-to-trash-your-Beaver-Cleaver-plasticized-G.O.P
-Image-of-life-in-America" attitude without understanding rock |n' roll.
Because rock was and is all about busting loose, exceeding limits, and limits
are usually set by parents, ancestors, older authorities.

LM: But so far there aren't many others who have written anything interesting
about rock-Richard Meltzer, Peter Guralnik ...

DFW: There's some others. Lester Bangs. Todd Gitlin, who also does great TV
essays. The thing that especially interested Mark and me about rap was the
nasty spin it puts on the whole historical us-vs.-them aspect of postmodern
pop. Anyway, what rock |n' roll did for the multicolored young back in the
fifties and sixties, rap seems to be doing for the young black urban
community. It's another attempt to break free of precedent and constraint. But
there are contradictions in rap that seem perversely to show how, in an era
where rebellion itself is a commnodity used to sell other commodities, the
whole idea of rebelling against white corporate culture is not only impossible
but incoherent. Today you've got black rappers who make their reputation
rapping about Kill the White Corporate Tools, and are then promptly signed by
white-owned record corporations, and not only feel no shame about "selling
out" but then release platinum albums about not only Killing White Tools but
also about how wealthy the rappers now are after signing their record deal!
You've got music here that both hates the white GOP values of the Reaganoid
eighties and extols a gold-and-BMW materialism that makes Reagan look like a
fucking Puritan. Violently racist and anti-Semitic black artists being
co-opted by white-owned, often Jewish-owned record labels, and celebrating
that fact in their art. The tensions are delicious. I can feel the spittle
starting again just thinking about it.

LM: This is another example of the dilemma facing avant-garde wannabes today -
the appropriation (and ensuing "taming") of rebellion by the system people
like Jameson are talking about.

DFW: I don't know much about Jameson. To me rap's the ultimate distillate of
the U.S. eighties, but if you really step back and think not just about rap's
politics but about white enthusiasm for it, things get grim. Rap's conscious
response to the poverty and oppression of U.S. blacks is like some hideous
parody of sixties black pride. We seem to be in an era when oppression and
exploitation no longer bring a people together and solidify loyalties and help
everyone rise above his individual concems. Now the rap response is more like
"You've always exploited us to get rich, so now goddamn it we're going to
exploit ourselyes and get rich." The irony, self-pity, self-hatred are now
conscious, celebrated. This has to do with what we were talking about
regarding "Westward" and postmodern recursion. If I have a real enemy, a
patriarch for my patricide, it's probably Barth and Coover and Burroughs, even
Nabokov and Pynchon. Because, even though their self-consciousness and irony
and anarchism served valuable purposes, were indispensable for their times,
their aesthetic's absorption by U.S. commercial culture has had appalling
consequences for writers and everyone else. The TV essay's really about how
poisonous postmodern irony's become. You see it in David Letterman and Gary
Shandling and rap. But you also see it in fucking Rush Limbaugh, who may well
be the Antichrist. You see it in T. C. Boyle and Bill Vollmann and Lorrie
Moore. It's pretty much all there is to see in your pal Mark Leyner. Leyner
and Limbaugh are the nineties' twin towers of postmodern irony, hip cynicism,
a hatred that winks and nudges you and pretends it's just kidding.

Irony and cynicism were just what the U.S. hypocrisy of the fifties and
sixties called for. That's what made the early postmodernists great artists.
The great thing about irony is that it splits things apart, gets us up above
them so we can see the flaws and hypocrisies and duplicities. The virtuous
always triumph? Ward Cleaver is the prototypical fifties father? Sure.
Sarcasm, parody, absurdism and irony are great ways to strip off stuff's mask
and show the unpleasant reality behind it. The problem is that once the rules
for art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses
are revealed and diagnosed, then what do we do? Irony's useful for debunking
illusions, but most of the illusion-debunking in the U.S. has now been done
and redone. Once everybody knows that equality of opportunity is bunk and Mike
Brady's bunk and Just Say No is bunk, now what do we do? All we seem to want
to do is keep ridiculing the stuff. Postmodern irony and cynicism's become an
end in itself, a measure of hip sophistication and literary savvy. Few artists
dare to try to talk about ways of working toward redeeming what's wrong,
because they'll look sentimental and naive to all the weary ironists. Irony's
gone from liberating to enslaving. There's some great essay somewhere that has
a line about irony being the song of the prisoner who's come to love his cage.

LM: Humbert Humbert, the rutting gorilla, painting the bars of his own cage
with such elegance. In fact, Nabokov's example raises the issue of whether
cynicism and irony are really a given. In Pale Fire and Lolita, there's an
irony about these structures and inventions and so forth, but this reaction is
deeply humanistic rather than being merely ironic. This seems true in
Barthelme, for instance, or Stanley Elkin, Barth. Or Robert Coover. The other
aspect has to do with the presentation of themselves or their consciousness.
The beauty and the magnificence of human artistry isn't merely ironic.

DFW: But you're talking about the click, which is something that can't just be
bequeathed from our postmodern ancestors to their descendants. No question
that some of the early postmodernists and ironists and anarchists and
absurdists did magnificent work, but you can't pass the click from one
generation to another like a baton. The click's idiosyncratic, personal. The
only stuff a writer can get from an artistic ancestor is a certain set of
aesthetic values and beliefs, and maybe a set of formal techniques that might
- just might - help the writer to chase his own click. The problem is that,
however misprised it's been, what's been passed down from the postmodern
heyday is sarcasm, cynicism, a manic ennui, suspicion of all authority,
suspicion of all constraints on conduct, and a terrible penchant for ironic
diagnosis of unpleasantness instead of an ambition not just to dagnose and
ridicule but to redeem. You've got to understand that this stuff has permeated
the culture. It's become our language; we're so in it we don't even see that
it's one perspective, one among many possible ways of seeing. Postmodern
irony's become our environmgnt.

LM: Mass culture is another very "real" part of that environment - rock music
or television or sports, talk shows, game shows, whatever; that's the milieu
you and I live in, I mean that's the world ...

DFW: I'm always stumped when critics regard references to popular culture in
serious fiction as some sort of avant-garde stratagem. In terms of the world I
live in and try to write about, it's inescapable. Avoiding any reference to
the pop would mean either being retrograde about what's "permissible" in
serious art or else writing about some other world.

LM: You mentioned earlier that writing parts of Broom of the System felt like
recreation for you - a relief from doing technical philosophy. Are you ever
able to shift into that "recreational mode" of writing today? Is it still
"play" for you?

DFW: It's not play anymore in the sense of laughs and yucks and non-stop
thrills. The stuff in Broom that's informed by that sense of play ended up
pretty forgettable, I think. And it doesn't sustain the enterprise for very
long. And I've found the really tricky discipline to writing is trying to play
without getting overcome by insecurity or vanity or ego. Showing the reader
that you're smart or funny or talented or whatever, trying to be liked,
integrity issues aside, this stuff just doesn't have enough motivational
calories in it to carry you over the long haul. You've got to discipline
yourself to talk out of the part of you that loves the thing, loves what
you're working on. Maybe that just plain loves. (I think we might need
woodwinds for this part, LM.) But sappy or no, it's true. The last couple
years have been pretty arid for me good-work-wise, but the one way I've
progressed I think is I've gotten convinced that there's something kind of
timelessly vital and sacred about good writing. This thing doesn't have that
much to do with talent, even glittering talent like Leyner's or serious talent
like Daitch's. Talent's just an instrument. It's like having a pen that works
instead of one that doesn't. I'm not saying I'm able to work consistently out
of the premise, but it seems like the big distinction between good art and
so-so art lies somewhere in the art's heart's purpose, the agenda of the
consciousness behind the text. It's got something to do with love. With having
the discipline to talk out of the part of yourself that can love instead of
the part that just wants to be loved. I know this doesn't sound hip at all. I
don't know. But it seems like one of the things really great fiction-writers
do - from Carver to Chekhov to Flannery O'Connor, or like the Tolstoy of "The
Death of Ivan Ilych" or the Pynchon of Gravity's Rainbow - is give the reader
something. The reader walks away from real art heavier than she came to it.
Fuller. All the attention and engagement and work you need to get from the
reader can't be for your benefit; it's got to be for hers. What's poisonous
about the cultural environment today is that it makes this so scary to try to
carry out. Really good work probably comes out of a willingness to disclose
yourself, open yourself up in spiritual and emotional ways that risk making
you look banal or melodramatic or naive or unhip or sappy, and to ask the
reader really to feel something. To be willing to sort of die in order to move
the reader, somehow. Even now I'm scared about how sappy this'll look in
print, saying this. And the effort actually to do it, not just talk about it,
requires a kind of courage I don't seem to have yet. I don't see that kind of
courage in Mark Leyner or Emily Prager or Brett Ellis. I sometimes see
flickers of it in Vollmann and Daitch and Nicholson Baker and Amy Homes and
Jon Franzen. It's weird - it has to do with quality but not that much with
sheer writing talent. It has to do with the click. I used to think the click
came from, "Holy shit, have I ever just done something good." Now it seems
more like the real click's more like, "Here's something good, and on one side
I don't much matter, and on the other side the individual reader maybe doesn't
much matter, but the thing's good because there's extractable value here for
both me and the reader." Maybe it's as simple as trying to make the writing
more generous and less ego-driven.

LM: Music genres like the blues or jazz or even rock seem to have their ebb
and flow in terms of experimentalism, but in the end they all have to come
back to the basic elements that comprise the genre, even if these are very
simple (like the blues). The trajectory of Bruce Springsteen's career comes to
mind. What interests fans of any genre is that they really know the formulas
and the elements, so they also can respond to the constant, built-in
meta-games and intertextualities going on in all genre forms. In a way the
responses are aesthetically sophisticated in the sense that it's the infinite
variations-on-a-theme that interests them. I mean, how else can they read a
million of these things (real genre fans are not stupid people necessarily)?
My point is that people who really care about the forms - the serious writers
and readers in fiction - don't want all the forms broken, they want variation
that allows the essence to emerge in new ways, Blues fans could love Hendrix
because he was still playing the blues. I think you're seeing a greater
appreciation for fiction's rules and limits among postmodern writers of all
generations. It's almost a relief to realize that all babies were not tossed
out with the bathwater back in the sixties.

DFW: You're probably right about appreciating limits. The sixties' movement in
poetry to radical free verse, in fiction to radically experimental recursive
forms - their legacy to my generation of would-be artists is at least an
incentive to ask very seriously where literary art's true relation to limits
should be. We've seen that you can break any or all of the rules without
getting laughed out of town, but we've also seen the toxicity that anarchy for
its own sake can yield. It's often useful to dispense with standard formulas,
of course, but it's just as often valuable and brave to see what can be done
within a set of rules - which is wby formal poetry's so much more interesting
to me than free verse. Maybe our touchstone now should be G. M. Hopkins, who
made up his own set of formal constraints and then blew everyone's footwear
off from inside them. There's something about free play within an ordered and
disciplined structure that resonates for readers. And there's something about
complete caprice and flux that's deadening.

LM: I suspect this is why so many of the older generation of postmodernists -
Federman, Sukenick, Steve Katz and others (maybe even Pynchon fits in here) -
have recently written books that rely on more traditional forms. That's why it
seems important right now for your generation to go back to traditional forms
and re-examine and rework those structures and formulas. This is already
happening with some of the best younger writers in Japan. You recognize that
if you just say, "Fuck it, let's throw everything out!" there's nothing in the
bathtub to make the effort worthwhile.

DFW: For me, the last few years of the postmodern era have seemed a bit like
the way you feel when you're in high school and your parents go on a trip, and
you throw a party. You get all your friends over and throw this wild
disgusting fabulous party. For a while it's great, free and freeing, parental
authority gone and overthrown, a cat's-away-let's-play Dionysian revel. But
then time passes, and the party gets louder and louder, and you run out of
drugs, and nobody's got any money for more drugs, and things get broken and
spilled, and there's a cigarette burn on the couch, and you're the host and
it's your house too, and you gradually start wishing your parents would come
back and restore some fucking order in your house. It's not a perfect analogy,
but the sense I get of my generation of writers and intellectuals or whatever
is that it's 3:00 a.m. and the couch has several burn-holes and somebody's
thrown up in the umbrella stand and we're wishing the revel would end. The
postmodern founders' patricidal work was great, but patricide produces
orphans, and no amount of revelry can make up for the fact that writers my age
have been literary orphans throughout our formative years. We're kind of
wishing some parents would come back. And of course we're uneasy about the
fact that we wish they'd come back - I mean, what's wrong with us? Are we
total pussies? Is there something about authority and limits we actually need?
And then the uneasiest feeling of all, as we start gradually to realize that
parents in fact aren't ever coming back - which means we're going to have to
be the parents.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1997 Time, Inc.

Words like "brilliant" and "virtuoso" are routinely used to describe David
Foster Wallace. Words like "succinct" and "breezy" are not. Infinite Jest, his
acclaimed, anvil-size 1996 novel, ran to a whopping 1,079 pages, while A
Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, his new collection of seven "essays
and arguments" originally published in magazines and journals, clocks in at a
hefty 353.

His latest book had a chance at being called breezy, but Wallace would not
leave well enough alone. "I wanted to go through some of these pieces," he
explains, "and do a director's cut." The expanded, wickedly funny essays--on
an eclectic array of topics like filmmaker David Lynch and the Illinois State
fair--would confirm Wallace's standing as one of generation X's most important
voices, if only he were part of generation X. "Technically," he says, "I'm a
baby boomer. I was born in 1962."

At 34, he's certainly more mature than when his first two books (a 1987 novel
The Broom of the System and 1989's short-story collection Girl with Curious
Hair) made him a literary celebrity. "I was a shy, nerdy person who spent an
enormous amount of time alone," says Wallace, "and all of a sudden, in a
weirdly small world, I became notorious." He experimented with drugs and
embarked on a lifestyle "I vaguely understood to be expected of me," he says,
"and discovered I didn't have the constitution for it." Two weeks in the
psychiatric ward of a Boston hospital straightened him out. "It was an
unpleasant experience," says Wallace, "and I got highly motivated not to
repeat it."

These days, the unmarried author likes to visit with friends in Bloomington,
Ill., where he owns a home, to watch Frasier, NYPD Blue and...vasectomies?
"When it's surgery night on the science channel, we get together and make
popcorn," says Wallace, who otherwise seems normal. "I don't regard myself as
particularly interesting," he adds. "I'm uncomfortable getting a lot of
attention, mostly because it makes me self-conscious. And that makes it hard
to write." Though not that hard.

The problem is that once the rules for art are debunked, and once the
unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, then what
do we do?

--David Foster Wallace

In Rabelais and His World, Mikhail Bakhtin applied the symbolic hierarchical
inversions of medieval carnival to literature and galvanized intellectual
interest in carnival as an analytic, literary, and political model for
transgression. For Bakhtin and those influenced by his theory, carnival
provided an ideal setting for what he termed the "dialogic imagination,"
because it involved a temporary suspension of official order that allowed for
a creative and therapeutic admixture of the symbolic forms of cultural life.
As Wilson Yates succinctly explains in The Grotesque in Art and Literature,
this heterogeneous festivity also served as a "revolutionary vision and
understanding of a new world freed from both bourgeois and totalitarian
cultures" (22). In the postmodern era, carnival's liberatory vision has been
used to counter hegemonic notions of stable identity, gender, language, and
truth in the contemporary work of such authors as Ishmael Reed, Angela Carter,
William Burroughs, and Thomas Pynchon. In the recent novel Infinite Jest,
however, David Foster Wallace turns the carnivalesque against itself to reveal
a literary vision that foregrounds the line between transgression for its own
sake and the use of art for redemptive purposes. Although carnival's masks,
disguises, ironies, and intertextualities are used in Bakhtin's vision to
negate unitary interpretations of reality, Wallace articulates the
carnivalesque qualities of postmodern culture as a permanent, though
superficially heterogenous, mask that is used to avoid confrontation with a
wider scope of human vision than its "cult of ambiguity" accommodates. Under
these conditions, Wallace establishes a setting where attempting to engage the
dynamism of reality, rather than professing its fictionality, becomes a
radical act of dialogue appropriate to late-twentieth-century life.

The popularity of carnival as a postmodern theoretical framework can in large
part be traced to its co-extensivity with the poststructuralist,
Nietzschean-influenced, and culturally deterministic discourse that dominates
current academic circles. M. Keith Booker echoes these sentiments in
Techniques of Subversion in Modern Literature, explaining that "Bakhtin has
risen to prominence in contemporary literary criticism, where adjectives of
boundary-crossing like `hybrid,' `interdisciplinary,' and `multigeneric' reign
supreme" (3). Indeed, that transgressive spirit is evident in Michel
Foucault's archaeologies of knowledge, which, like Bakhtin's heteroglossia,
expose the stratification undergirding apparently sturdy notions of identity,
sexuality, science, madness, and medicine. As Foucault explains in Language,
Counter-Memory, Practice, "genealogy is history in the form of a concerted
carnival" (161). In feminist theory, the dialogic, oppositional aspect of
carnival also coincides with Julia Kristeva's idea of a "semiotic" flux
disrupting the patriarchal symbolic order. Bakhtin's work features prominently
in Desire in Language, in which Kristeva asserts, "carnivalesque discourse
breaks through the laws of a language censored by grammar and semantics and,
at the same time, is a social and political protest" (65). The transgressive
spirit of carnival is likewise harmonious with Jacques Derrida's linguistic
interrogations of stable meaning. In American Fiction and the Metaphysics of
the Grotesque, Dieter Miendl argues that the popularity of deconstruction in
postmodern culture has created an endless carnival "manifesting itself in the
play of language, in the enactment of linguistic games," and "in the collision
and superposition of incongruous discursive patterns" (172). Regardless of
their disciplinary orientations, these influential poststructuralist theorists
are concerned with the breakdown of epistemic truths consistent with
carnival's riotous celebration of heterodoxy, and their resonance with
Bakhtin's theory has surely strengthened the popularity of carnival as an
intellectual telos.

At first glance, Wallace's novel appears to be a rather straightforward
postmodern text that uses bodily and linguistic grotesques to satirize
contemporary culture. Set in the eerily familiar near-future, Wallace's
America has merged with Canada and been rechristened O.N.A.N. (Organization of
North American Nations). In a classic Bakhtinian inversion of the hierarchical
distinctions between high and low, the new republic is presided over by a
former Las Vegas crooner named Johnny Gentle, who bears the distinction of
being "the first U. S. President ever to swing his microphone around by the
cord during his inauguration speech" (Wallace 383). Time, the perennial
yardstick of teleology, has ceased to depict the progression of linear history
and has been replaced by "subsidization," in which the temporal has yielded to
the timelessness of corporate-sponsored years. That the thrust of the novel's
action takes place in the "Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment" presents the
ideal milieu for a culture where the "lower stratum" of the body is
emphasized. The novel's action is split primarily between the lives of the
Incandenza family, who reside at an elite tennis academy (Enfield), and the
residents of a drug recovery halfway house (Ennett House). The Incandenza
family consists of three boys, all with exterior physical deformities. Mario's
entire body was deformed at birth; Hal, a seventeen-year-old addicted to
marijuana, has a distended forearm from training for professional tennis; and
Orin, a professional football player, has an unusually large knee from
repetitive punting. The boys' mother, Avril, is loving, supportive, and
generous to the point of pathology, whereas their deceased father, an
avant-garde filmmaker and optics genius who committed suicide by sticking his
head in a microwave oven, is the novel's self-proclaimed "infinite jester."
Residents of Ennett House include Don Gately, an ex-barbiturate addict with an
unnaturally large head, and Joelle Van Dyne, a recovering crack addict whose
face has been deformed by acid. "Rapacial feral hamsters," "insects of
Volkswagen size," and the presence of giant infants who roam the republic and
occasionally crush houses underfoot (573) are among the litany of grotesque
creatures peppering the text. The novel's circuitous plot involves the
simultaneous struggle of Hal Incandenza and the Ennett residents to overcome
their loneliness and drug dependencies while Quebecois insurgents and O.N.A.N.
intelligence operatives fight for possession of a lethal "Infinite Jest"
entertainment cartridge that is literally amusing O.N.A.N.'s citizens to
death. Thus, on the surface at least, Infinite Jest includes references to the
kinds of grotesques that signal Bakhtinian multiplicity and heterogeneity.

On the level of language as well, Infinite Jest seems thoroughly
carnivalesque. Bakhtin termed carnival's tendency to dissolve linguistic
sociolects into a new, aggregated version of egalitarian language, a form of
"dialogic heteroglossia" (Dialogic 273). Like literary notions of the
"intertextual" or "polyphonic" text, its aggregate composition resists the
idea of a unitary, nonpartisan language. In the same vein as this style,
Wallace has expressed his intention for readers to experience a sense of
"mediated [...] consciousness" (McCaffery 138) that continually denies
linguistic neutrality. As such, material in Infinite Jest is often filtered
through various media, including third- and first-person narrations, personal
letters (1006), e-mails (138-9), interview transcripts (176, 1026),
bureaucratic form letters (1007), mathematical diagrams (1023, 1024),
bibliographic references (1034, 1037) academic essays (140-42, 307), newspaper
headlines (391-94, 398-400), and even puppet-show scripts parodying
presidential cabinet meetings (400-04, 439-42). Perhaps his most predominant
intertextual conceit is the use of more than 200 footnotes that, in the vein
of carnival's inversion of "high" and "low" bodily strata, blur the
distinction between foot and head, errata and material central to the story.
(1) At the word level, Wallace foregrounds Bakhtinian heteroglossia by the
prodigious use of acronyms and esoteric jargon from various professional and
social spheres. He weaves medical terminology such as "hyperauxetic" and
"bradyauxesis" with pharmaceutical drug terms like "pentazocine hydrochloride"
and "Talwin-NX" into a constant stream of jargon from Alcoholics Anonymous,
academia, commercial culture, professional sports, teenage slang, and
terminology that requires a deskside Oxford English Dictionary for
translation. In crafting this superdialogized textual landscape, Wallace
depicts a linguistic environment ever teetering on the brink of centrifugal
disintegration.

Despite his ample use of these postmodern carnivalesque techniques, closer
investigation makes clear that Wallace's text does not draw a direct
correlation between human liberation and the mere transgression of bodies,
language, and cultural signs. Although the title itself, with its reference to
Hamlet's Poor Yorick--"a fellow of infinite jest, most excellent fancy"
(Shakespeare 5.1)--reflects the potential for wit to mock authority without
attending to its displacement, Wallace's interviews and essays also indicate a
skepticism toward postmodernism's prevailing attitude of critical negation. In
an interview with Larry McCaffery, Wallace takes issue with much postmodern
art for its inability to marry avant-gardism with a vision conducive to social
transformation. As he explains,
   What's been passed down from the postmodern heyday is sarcasm, cynicism, a
   manic ennui, suspicion of all authority, suspicion of constraints on
   conduct, and a terrible penchant for ironic diagnosis of unpleasantness
   instead of an ambition not just to diagnose and ridicule, but to redeem.
   (McCaffery 147)

In his estimation, this redemption begins not with aesthetic nonconformity,
but in the act of confronting what is truly, perhaps existentially, fearful.
In the McCaffery interview, Wallace asserts that, "any possible human
redemption requires us first to face what's dreadful, what we want to deny"
(136). In Infinite Jest, he exposes the potential of the postmodern
carnivalesque to become a sort of literary Prozac that alters perception
rather than attends to the alienation, despair, and isolation that the
unmedicated perceive. Under these circumstances, countenancing, rather than
fleeing, this sober reality becomes an even more revolutionary act than
deliberately seeking out its distortions.

Perhaps the first indication that Wallace's polyphonic, heterogeneously
peopled textual universe falls short of Bakhtin's utopian ends is the
troubling presence of a dark chasm that lurks around its kaleidoscopic edges.
Wallace weaves a dense skein of carnivalesque intertextuality only to rupture
it with glimpses of a fearful Otherness (2) that cannot be assimilated into
its cacophonous dialogue. Despite their athletic celebrity and prodigious
intelligence, the brothers Hal and Orin Incandenza suffer from harrowing
nightmares. Orin awakes from these dreams "soaked, fetally curled, entombed in
that kind of psychic darkness where you're dreading whatever you think of"
(42) and filled with "the soul's certainty that the day will have to be not
traversed but sort of climbed, vertically, and then that going to sleep again
will be like falling, again, off something tall and sheer" (46). When he
showers, Orin, is beset by hordes of "enormous roaches" with "Kevlar-type
cases" that doggedly resist extermination (44). Yet the Incandenza brothers
are not alone in glimpsing this dark underside. The residents of Enfield
Tennis Academy refer to their inexplicable fears as the "howling fantods."
Depression victims Kate Gompert and Ken Erdedy describe a "large, dark shape
[...] billowing [... and] flapping" that encompasses "total psychic horror:
death, decay, dissolution, cold, empty black malevolent lonely space"
(649-50). The recovering drug addicts at Ennett House refer to "centerless
eyes and a ravening maw ... the Face in The Floor" that lurks beneath the
"smiley-face" substances they once abused (347). This encounter with fear is
perhaps best articulated by an anonymous "I" whose monologue is inserted into
the beginning of the novel. "I am coming to see that the sensation of the
worst nightmares, a sensation that can be felt asleep or awake," he explains,
"is identical to those worst dreams' form itself: the sudden intra-dream
realization that the nightmares' very essence and center has been with you all
along, even awake: it's just been overlooked" (61). The sense that this horror
is everywhere, yet unseen, highlights its suppression beneath a postmodern
mosaic so dazzling that it can blind readers to what lies below its surface.

One of Wallace's more ingenious depictions of this suppression involves the
carnivalesque, yet insular, nature of O.N.A.N.'s physical landscape. Although
Bakhtin's grotesques were meant to evoke nature's constant state of renewal,
Wallace replaces these images of regeneration with those of thinly veiled
redundancy. Perhaps the best example of this strategy involves the "annular
fusion" energy system that fuels the new republic's environment. Like a
harlequin transformed into a jack-in-the-box, annular fusion is likened to
"somebody doing somersaults with one hand nailed to the ground" (570), and it
fittingly produces "a type of fusion that can produce waste for a process
whose waste is fuel for the fusion" (572). Apropos of the "Year of The Adult
Undergarment," this system is "as if nature itself had desperately to visit
the lavatory" (Wallace 573). Whereas Bakhtin viewed bodily emissions such as
urination and defecation as evidence of the human form in a constant state of
growth and change, Wallace's annular fusion produces waste that only
perpetuates stasis. The effect of annular fusion on O.N.A.N.'s physical
landscape has deformed the terrain itself into an image of grotesque
circularity. This apparently ideal process has become so successful at ridding
the environment of toxins that it has also eliminated all inhibitors to
organic growth. The result has split the region into "a rainforest on
sterebolic anoids" and a land resembling a desert. Thus, the topography has
been warped into two halves, the "Great Concavity" and the "Great Convexity"
which, though clearly distorted, combine to form the closed system of a
self-reflexive mirror. In this respect, a theory that appears to celebrate
"excess" actually insulates and perpetuates stagnation.

Within this closed system, the potentially regenerative "openness" that is
most pervasively denied resides at the emotional level. As Bakhtin stresses,
one of the distinguishing features of the grotesque body is its emphasis on
apertures that allow the human form to become an open conduit for change.
Emotional vulnerability, like the porous body, also serves as an image of
metamorphosis because it leaves its bearer open to the risks inherent in
growth and renewal. Most of Wallace's characters, however, have an abiding
terror of this particular brand of openness and numb it with every drug
imaginable. For Kate Gompert, depression victim and
marijuana-addict-turned-alcoholic, an escape from her own emotional
vulnerability entails transforming the world into a drug-induced
mediation--what she calls a "Novocaine of the soul" (775)--that begs the
question of her own suffering. After being incarcerated in a mental hospital
for attempted suicide, Kate is asked by her physician to describe her
feelings. She replies, "It's more like horror than sadness. [...] Lurid is the
word [...] everything sounds harsh, spiny and harsh-sounding like every sound
you hear all of a sudden has teeth. And smelling bad even after I just got out
of the shower" (73). Kate's description of her feelings, with its imagery of
sharpness, stench, and heightened sensitivity, becomes an emotional grotesque
in comparison to the way she encounters her environment under the influence of
drugs. She is so terrified of this feeling that she begs for electroshock
therapy as a happy alternative to the terrible resensitization that
accompanies sobriety. Like most of the characters in Infinite Jest, Kate never
considers that this fear might be the actual state of facing life without the
aid of synthetic compounds that replace her emotional vulnerability with a
chemically induced callousness. Instead, she considers herself "recovered"
when she discovers that alcohol keeps the fear under better control than
marijuana. Despite the stigma of difference usually attached to clinical
depression, Kate's condition proves the norm rather than the exception in
Infinite Jest. James Incandenza commits suicide because he cannot face his
"psychic pain" without the benefit of Wild Turkey (694-95); Remy Marathe
recalls feeling habitually "moribund" and "chained in a cage of the self, from
the pain" (777); and Ken Erdedy recounts a depression so horrifying that he
"understood on an intuitive level why people killed themselves" (651). By
depicting the ubiquitousness of depression, Wallace creates a context for
viewing social reality rather than an individual's mental state as the source
of despair. In so doing, he highlights the evasive, rather than therapeutic,
value of using drugs and denial to avoid facing what emerges in this context
as the requisite pain of existence.

In Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin explains that the mask reveals "the essence
of the grotesque" (40). With its ability to confer an identity at odds with
the wearer's stable, homogenous sense of self, "the mask is connected with the
joy of change [...] transition, metamorphoses, the violation of natural
boundaries" (40). The liberating aspect of these temporary disguises in
masquerades and carnival festivities creates a sense, as in all of Bakhtin's
imagery, of the human potential to become open to the world by transgressing
its fixed appearances. Geoffrey Gait Harpham emphasizes the mask's
permeability when he explains that, like "belching and farting," the "carnival
mask [...] with its bulging eyes, open mouth, and outsized nose all `go out to
meet the world'" (108). In Infinite Jest, on the other hand, masks are used to
conceal identities that are already rendered as grotesquely "open." One of the
novel's more humorous examples of this technique involves the republic's
reaction to the invention of video telephone conferencing. When faced with the
apparent boon of this new opportunity for face-to-face electronic interaction,
characters become so frightened of their own faces that they begin donning
celebrity look-alike cut-outs and air-brushed, computer-enhanced masks of
themselves whenever making phone calls. The particular quality of this
self-repulsion reflects Wallace's inversion of the mask's manifestation of
flux: The public does not find themselves merely unattractive without their
"masks," their naked faces themselves are blurred:
   It wasn't just "Anchorman's Bloat," that well-known impression of extra
   weight that video inflicts on the face. It was worse. Even with high-end
   TPs' high-def viewer-screens, consumers perceived something essentially
   blurred and moist-looking about their phone-faces, a shiny pallid
   indefiniteness. (147)

Similarly, an entire support group has sprung up in Infinite Jest around the
prospect of masking deformity. The group is called, fittingly, U.H.I.D. (Union
of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed), and its "aesthetically challenged"
(187) members adopt veils to hide their facial deformities. The group's
purpose, unlike the liberatory purpose of mask wearing in carnival, encourages
hiding. Its philosophy involves teaching members "to be open about their
essential need for concealment" (535). The use of masks to hide rather than to
address what appears monstrously open takes a dark turn in a scenario
involving a "catatonic," "soggy," "invertebrate" girl referred to only as
"It," whose father finds it more stimulating to rape her after pinning a
Raquel Welch mask on her face (371). This image, perhaps more than any other,
implies that embracing the mask's "joy of change" and "metamorphosis" without
regard for human sensitivity and dignity, achieves an end considerably less
than liberating.

Like masks, costumes and disguises are part of the festive imagery used in
carnival to interrogate the stable identity-constructions of the official
culture. In Infinite Jest, however, the official culture is perpetuated by the
use of grotesque costumes. As part of their routine operations, the members of
O.N.A.N.'s FBI (now called the "Office of Unspecified Services") are required
to take on carnivalesque identities. The Office routinely casts
   men as women, women as longshoremen or Orthodox rabbinicals, heterosexual
   men as homosexual men, Caucasians as Negroes or caricaturesque Haitians and
   Dominicans, Healthy males as cephalic boys or epileptic public-relations
   executives. (419)

In the traditional carnival setting, these "costumes" would have suggested
transgression, but that implication is undermined by the fact that such
disguises are used to cloak a conservative group of government agents that is
elsewhere described as a "white-suited" gang responsible for requiring
citizens to "scrub and mask and then walk through chlorinated footbaths as at
public pools" before interacting with their employer, a president equally
concerned with hygiene. (3) The strangely comforting effect of these
undercover disguises is indicated by agent M. Hugh/Helen Steeply's reaction to
his transvestite field operation uniform: "the more grotesque or unconvincing
he seemed likely to be as a disguised persona the more nourished and
actualized his deep parts felt" (420). Steeply's discomfort with self-exposure
is displaced by donning heterodox costumes that further the surveillance,
information gathering, and violence that serve as instruments of social
control rather than subversion.

Even in the case of physical deformity, such as Hal's huge forearm or Orin's
protracted knee, the apparent "regenerative becoming" of bodily protuberances
can serve as repressive costumes. Both Hal and Orin acquired these deformities
in pursuit of perfection that will ultimately transform them into closed,
tangible objects of consumable entertainment. As fledgling professional
athletes, they gained their distended limbs through the rigorous training
required of those hoping to become stars in the international circuit, or what
is regularly referred to in the novel as "the Show." Wallace makes the
nonempancipatory nature of such seemingly carnivalesque distortions clear in a
reference to one of James Incandenza's films, entitled "Cage III--Free Show,"
in which
   The figure of Death [...] presides over the front entrance of a carnival
   sideshow whose spectators watch performers undergo unspeakable degradations
   so grotesquely compelling that the spectators' eyes become larger and
   larger until the spectators themselves are transformed into gigantic
   eyeballs in chairs, while on the other side of the sideshow tent the figure
   of Life uses a megaphone to invite fairgoers to an exhibition in which, if
   the fairgoers consent to undergo unspeakable degradations, they can witness
   ordinary persons gradually turn into gigantic eyeballs. (988)

Like the professional athletes whose ravaged bodies become sources of
curiosity, the figures in this spectaclized carnival are grotesques
reminiscent of P. T. Barnum's freak shows. And, like the participants and
spectators of such shows, both are reduced to alienated objects that use the
consumption of grotesquerie to further insulate themselves.

For Orin Incandenza, carnival's celebration of relativistic truth now helps
him to assuage his own fears of emotional vulnerability through serial
womanizing. Referring to his ongoing parade of lovers as "the Subjects," he
paradoxically requires their attention to continue his solipsistic denial of
emotional openness. As he explains, his encounters are not "about love or
about whose love you deep-down desire" but about assuring himself of a
self-containment so airtight that "he is both offense and defense and she
neither" and that, during sex "there is now inside her a vividness vacuumed of
all but his name: O.,O. That he is the One" (566). The constant threat of
dissolution into the frightening chasm of vulnerability that he approaches
each night in his dreams attests to the necessity for Orin continually to
reinscribe himself as a sealed object, or, as he explains,
   why, maybe, one Subject is never enough, why hand after hand must descend
   to pull him back from the endless fall. For were there for him just one,
   now, special and only the One would be not he or she but what was between
   them, the obliterating trinity of You and I into We. (566)

The fact that this interior monologue is spoken as Orin glances at himself in
the mirror (566) completes the association between sex and a detached,
decidedly unregenerative form of masturbation.

Orin's strategy for picking up the women he needs for his analgesic purposes
relies for its success on a valorization of cynicism that, like U.H.I.D.'s
veils, enables him to "hide openly." Described by one of his former tennis
colleagues as "the least open man" he knows, Orin nonetheless is able to pick
up women by affecting a "pose of poselessness" that stems from an
educationally adopted view of "the truth as constructed rather than reported"
(1048). Describing Orin's methodology, the friend recounts:
   He has a way of being almost pathologically open and sincere about the
   whole picking-up enterprise, but also has this quality of
   Look-At-Me-Being-So
   -Totally-Open-And-Sincere-I-Rise-Above-The-Whole-Disengenuous
   -Posing-Process-Off-Attracting-Someone-, -And-I-Transcend-The
   -Common-Disengenuity
   In-A-Bar-Herd-In-A-Particularly-Hip-And-Witty-Self-Aware-Way-,
   -And-If-You-Will-Let-Me-Pick-You-Up-I-Will-Not-Only-Keep-Being-This-Hip
   -and-Witty-, -Transcendently-Open-, -But-Will-Bring-You-Into-This-World
   -Of-Social-Falsehood-Transcendence. (1048)

The irony of this passage is that, in inserting falsehood into the
transcendent space formerly reserved for truth, Orin is cleverly able to sleep
with women whose desire for emotional transcendence fulfills his solipsistic
yearnings, while he is acquitted of the need to reciprocate those feelings by
a rhetorical loophole. In that respect, Orin's character provides one of the
most visceral examples of the fact that physical and philosophical openness
can also become a way of perpetuating emotional closedness.

The propensity for postmodern irony to entrap rather than liberate reaches its
apex in the character and work of James Incandenza. The novel's "infinite
jester," Incandenza, like the medieval fool, could qualify as a one-man show
of entertaining, though tautological, strategies. He not only invented the
republic's "annular fusion" energy system, directed over seventy witty,
metafictional films that mirror the novel's own plots and are often produced
by "Poor Yorick Entertainment" (985-93); but he created the lethal "Infinite
Jest" "entertainment cartridge" that systematically kills O.N.A.N.'s citizens
by rendering them helplessly enthralled by its recursively looping contents.
That Incandenza is an optics genius fascinated by mirrors whose films, such as
"Cage [...] a soliloquized parody of a broadcast--television advertisement for
shampoo, utilizing four convex mirrors, two planar mirrors, and one actress"
(986), focus on self-reflexivity and mass media's mediating cultural function
and make him at the very least a chimerical blend of a latter-day John
Barth-Thomas Pynchon disciple. As Tom LeClair has pointed out, Incandenza's
films "often resemble--in their themes and parodic methods--outtakes from
Gravity's Rainbow and Pynchon's other work" (17). Wallace has declared "Barth
and Coover and Burroughs, even Nabokov and Pynchon" as "patriarchs for" his
"patricide" in an era when their techniques have been co-opted by consumer
culture (McCaffery 146). Incandenza's films and his veiled, distant
personality demonstrate the way that metafictional forms can medicate rather
than agitate.

Despite his incessant production of art that foregrounds the constructed
nature of reality, Incandenza is frequently described as intensely concealed.
His son Orin describes him as "so blankly and irretrievably hidden that Orin
said he'd come to see him as like autistic, almost catatonic" (737).
Similarly, Joelle Van Dyne categorizes Incandenza's work as that of "a
brilliant optician and technician who was an amateur at any kind of real
communication" whose films were "lampoons of `inverted' genres: archly funny
and sometimes insightful, but with something provisional about them, like the
finger exercises of someone promising who refused to really sit down and play
something to test that promise" (742). In refusing to connect with the
audience while enabling a paradoxical transcendence of suffering, Incandenza's
films serve a purpose much in line with Orin's womanizing. This transcendent
quality is implied by Joelle's analysis of a Blake parody aptly titled
Pre-Nuptial Agreement of Heaven and Hell. It is in this otherwise ironic film
that Joelle notices the connection between an extended shot of Bernini's
Ecstasy of St. Teresa and the "self-forgetting [...] of religion/art" (742).
As she explains, "[t]he mediated transcendence of self was just what the
apparently decadent statue of the orgasmic nun claimed for itself as subject"
(742). That Joelle herself frequently envisioned the Ecstasy of St. Teresa
while simultaneously inhaling crack cocaine and cleaning her apartment "within
an inch of its life" (235) only enhances the connection between Incandenza's
art and escapism.

Of all of Incandenza's creations, it is the lethal Infinite Jest entertainment
cartridge that best reveals the escapist quality of polyphonic media. For,
contrary to what readers may expect from an irresistibly enthralling cinematic
tour de force, this video is nothing like the blockbuster fantasies of an
Aaron Spelling or Steven Spielberg. According to Joelle Van Dyne, one of the
film's stars--whose estimation is the only one the readers have to go on, due
to the instant catatonia of the film's viewers--it is "nothing more than an
olla podrida of depressive conceits strung together with flashy lensmanship
and perspectival novelty" (791). More specifically, it involves one scene of
Joelle whirling around a revolving doorway with a hermaphroditic actor and
another in which she repeatedly apologizes to an audience whose point of view
has been made, through use of a special lens, to mimic an infant's perspective
(939). What becomes lethally addictive about this film affirms McLuhan's claim
that the medium is the message. Although the subject matter, with its
hybridized, amorphous hermaphrodite and its permanently recursive flux, is
indeed a relativistic theme, the real star of "The Entertainment" is the
film's lens. In mimicking the undifferentiating gaze of an infant, the lens
itself ensures that its viewers will remain in a perpetual state of liminality
that does not require their active participation. The fact that this state
renders its viewers so enraptured that they become catatonic and eventually
die implies that liminality itself, like the recurrent image of The Ecstasy of
St. Teresa, can become an opiate of the masses. A constant state of
uncertainty can be just as comforting as religion when it takes the form of a
terminal cynicism that interdicts the question of human agency.

Although the majority of Wallace's characters remain firmly entrenched in
their dogged habits of escapism, the efforts of Hal Incandenza and Don Gately
to resist this end offer the seeds of redemption within Wallace's unflinching
portrayal of late-twentieth-century culture. Hal moves from experiencing life
through the "hip, empty mask, ahedonia," which "cloaks his hideous internal
self, incontinent of sentiment and need" (659), to trying to address emotional
issues in his own voice; and Gately progresses from numb addiction to physical
suffering as he steadfastly struggles to remain sober within a drug-lubricated
society. Although these characters superficially manifest some of the same
qualities as those retreating behind carnival's heterogeneous "masks," the
trajectory of their transformation is one of restoring personal agency by
turning the self inside-out rather than suppressing it beneath deliberate
artifice. Although both register as grotesquerie, in the concealment-obsessed,
entertainment-enthralled culture of O.N.A.N. only a commitment to
self-disclosure rather than self-fashioning lays the groundwork for positive
change.

Hal's encounter with and expression of his own identity becomes noticeable
roughly around the time he begins using the first-person pronoun and abstains
from smoking marijuana on "20 November, Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment"
(841). From that moment on, the discrepancy between Hal's inner feelings and
outward expressions begins to diminish. It is as if his poker-faced detachment
has melted to reveal the gooey, emotional self that previously "pulsed and
writhed" (659) beneath its cool surface. The slow metamorphosis is first
noticed by a classmate who thinks that Hal is wearing "a hilarity face." He
tells the bewildered Hal, "Your face is a hilarity face. [...] At first it
merely looked a-mused. Now it is open-ly cach-inated. You're almost doubled
over" (875). Even when Hal attempts to compose his face, his friend finds it
"mirth-ful" (876). Finally, when Hal looks in the mirror, he is struck by an
image not unlike those confronted by the video phone's early adopters. He
reflects, "I looked sketchy and faint to myself, tentative and ghostly" (876).
This facial distortion reaches its apogee in the novel's opening scene (which
is temporally its closing scene), in which Hal tries to communicate sincerely
about his feelings during a college entrance interview. In marked contrast to
the boy who, as formerly described, had not "had a bona fide
intensity-of-interior-life-type emotion since he was tiny" and found "terms
like joie and value to be like so many variables in rarefied equations" (694),
this Hal speaks with conviction. After being instructed by his elders to
affect a "neutral and affectless silence" (9), Hal nonetheless reveals his
inner thoughts, declaring, "I am not a machine. I feel and believe. I have
opinions. [...] I'm not just a creatus, manufactured, conditioned, bred for a
function. [...] Please don't think I don't care" (12). The degree to which
this transformation poses a threat to the values of Infinite Jest's dominant
culture is underscored by the terror his spoken sentiments incur. In a manner
resonant with the reaction to other unmasked images suppressed throughout the
novel, Hal is perceived by the committee as "subanimalistic," "waggling," like
"some sort of awful ... growth" (14) and is eventually carted off in an
ambulance to where he can no longer disrupt the anesthetic text/ure of social
life.

Like Hal's efforts to become independently sentient, Don Gately's commitment
to forgoing his drug addictions ultimately renders him incomprehensible and
marginalized with respect to the novel's dominant culture. After receiving a
gunshot wound while saving another's life, Don struggles to remain drug-free
in a hospital environment where Demerol, like Jell-O and I.D. bracelets, has
become gratuitous. Not only does Don's sobriety force him to experience what
can only be described as the grotesque detail of physical injury--delirium,
incontinence, I.V. needles, catheters, vomiting--but his inability to either
speak or write illustrates the social as well as physical border that Don
crosses by remaining sober. For, like Hal, when Don attempts to communicate
from this position of marginality, his words are literally unreadable. He
becomes, like the scrawled pen-and-ink drawing that Wallace uses to convey
Don's inarticulateness [??] (1884), a messy, dramatic mark set against the
streamlined symbolic order of the surrounding culture. Thus, in a radical
dialogization of the tenets of postmodern carnival, Wallace associates a
commitment to experiencing the world without the deliberate alterations of
perception--drugs, veils, disguises, entertainments--as itself a subversive
foray into the no man's land of human experience.

To a large extent, the resistant aspect of Don and Hal's vertiginous sobriety
takes on new significance within the context of Wallace's unique writing
style. In a seeming contradiction, Wallace uses irony, metafiction, and
polyphonic intertextuality not only to de-center empty avant-gardism
throughout Infinite Jest, but to defamiliarize the hallmarks of classic
realism. The intent of this technique is divulged by a "wraith" (4) who
appears at the bedside of the delirious Don Gately and expresses a lifelong
artistic desire to portray "real life's real egalitarian babble of
figurantless crowds, of the animate world's real agora, the babble of crowds
every member of which was the central and articulate protagonist of his own
entertainment" (836). The wraith calls the style "radical realism," and as Tom
LeClair has argued, its "anti-confluential" yet history-mining attention to
character, narrative, and etymology also provides an accurate description of
Wallace's own approach to crafting Infinite Jest (32-35). As LeClair explains,
"[t]hese methods produce, not just length, but a prodigious density because
parts do not disappear into conventional and easily processed wholes" but into
an "infolding" aesthetic that disrupts the tranquilizing flow of conventional
fiction (35). When viewed within that context, the transformation experienced
by Hal and Don becomes one of moving through the alienation denied by their
carnivalesque masks to begin expressing themselves as vocal "figurants" whose
incoherent voices may eventually coalesce into an audible, collective human
hum capable of restoring dialogue to a decidedly monologic culture.

The metamorphoses of Hal Incandenza and Don Gately bring the artistic vision
of Infinite Jest full circle through the self-consciously adopted masks of
postmodern multiplicity and polyphony to arrive at a view of contemporary
human "reality" that is more fully grotesque than its instrumentalized
counterparts. Although Bakhtin's carnivalesque marketplace has furnished
postmodern art with an aesthetic antidote to conformist ideology, the human
agora of Wallace's radical realism erupts the "anesthesia of form" (5) that
entertains but fails to heal postmodern culture. This garbled, pluralistic
human outburst prefigured by Don and Hal's unintelligible voices provides a
way out of the vicious circles that encage the environment and citizens of
Infinite Jest. Clearly, Wallace's "radical reality" is far from the soothing
naturalism that once prompted Jean-Francois Lyotard to proclaim that
"so-called realistic representations can no longer evoke reality except as
nostalgia or mockery" (74). On the contrary, it bears estimable witness to
Wallace's assertion that "`realistic' doesn't have a uni-vocal definition"
(McCaffery 140) and re-emphasizes the obligation once inherent within the
grotesque form to reach toward more profound truths, even as it embraces
ambiguity. At a time in history when the forces of capitalism and commercial
entertainment are fueled by the production of heterogeneous diversions,
Wallace reminds us that literature has a continued responsibility not only to
press beyond its own limits, but to expand the limits of human understanding.

NOTES

(1.) In "The Prodigious Fiction of Richard Powers, William Vollman, and David
Foster Wallace," Tom LeClair characterizes Wallace's use of footnotes as an
articulation of a prodigiously grotesque body. He explains that "Wallace's
special achievement is to make the book recall and resemble a prodigious human
body [...]. The only `errata' in the final section are those of readers who do
not switch back and forth between the two sections and who, therefore, do not
appreciate how Wallace has deformed his novel to be a gigantic analogue of the
`monsters'--hateful and hopeful--within it" (38).

(2.) In The Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva provides a context for viewing
such unassimilable, horrific fractures as eruptions of what a dominant
symbolic order excludes to maintain its proprietary claims to "reality" and
"truth." Kristeva calls this terrifying non/entity the "abject" and draws upon
George Bataille's research into cultural taboos and Jacques Lacan's
psychoanalytic approach to subjectivity to inform her equation between horror
and social Otherness. Abjection has been likened to such culturally taboo
elements as feces, urine, and in feminist theory, the female body and has been
used within artistic and literary spheres as a strategy of social opposition.
Wallace's characters may be abject, but their inability definitively to
marshal their Otherness against an oppressive social order complicates the use
of abjection as a subversive strategy in Infinite Jest.

(3.) This particular example resonates with Peter Stallybrass and Allon
White's perception that carnival can serve as a vehicle for the dominant
culture to exorcise an Otherness it has created in the process of assuming its
hegemony. As they have argued, in this situation, the dominant culture "uses
the whole world as its theatre in a particularly instrumental fashion, the
very subjects which it politically excludes becoming exotic costumes which it
assumes to play out the disorders of its own identity" (200).

(4.) The "wraith," a gangly lexical genius and former auteur, seems a
combination of both Wallace and the late James Incandenza.

(5.) Wallace uses this term to describe television during his interview with
McCaffery (136), yet it also fits his description of a contemporary art scene
in which "shock stops being the by-product of something else" and
"rule-breaking, the mere form of renegade avant-gardism becomes an end in
itself" (McCaffery 132).

    Title:  Termite art, or Wallace's Wittgenstein. (David Foster Wallace)
   Author:  Lance Olsen

 Abstract:  David Foster Wallace differs from most contemporary writers in
that he does not use post-structuralist literary devices for the sake of using
post-structuralist literary devices. Like Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophical
pondering, which greatly influenced Wallace, he plays theoretical games in
order to address real problems. Neither Wittgenstein nor Wallace takes
anything for granted, but their cynicism is not the end, but the means to the
end, unlike many contemporary authors and philosophers.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

If you do know that there is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest

It's a myth that truth is stranger than fiction. Actually they're about
equally strange.

Reality Termites vs. the White Elephants

Might I not believe that once, without knowing it, perhaps in a state of
unconsciousness, I was taken away from the earth - that other people even know
this, but do not mention it to me?

The more you live with a pomo text, the less pomo it becomes. Think, for
instance, of your first magic-carpet ride through William Gibson's Neuromancer
back in 1984. Of the downright glee you experienced in the face of that
white-hot language, roller-coaster narrative speed, spaghetti-convolution plot
brain-burning dive into that resplendently amazing realm of virtual reality
called cyberspace. Of the kick in the head you got realizing here was a writer
dealing with subjects you just never saw dealt with in fiction before:
computer hackers jacking into consoles with all the intensity of wall-banging
sex, multinationals making ideas like national boundaries seem antique as
bell-bottoms, affectless cyber-outlaws creeping along the undersides of
environmentally and morally comatose cityscapes.

Only then you went back and read it again. Maybe you even found yourself
writing an essay trying to explain just how jazzed up about it you got. Maybe
you even tried to teach it. And the thing was (don't get me wrong here) it
remained a great book. It still grabbed you by the the, still spoke to a whole
generation of kids that didn't just read science fiction but actually lived
it. But you know that language? Somehow it seemed more transparent the second
time through, didn't it? You picked up the rhythms easier, intuitively learned
Gibson's sleight of hand with those jump-cuts, how he introduced future-words
(the Sprawl, a coffin) on one page and then slipped in the definition of them
(the Boston-Atlanta metropolitan axis, a small tubular hotel room) a couple of
pages down the line. And the narrative pace? It was still there, except now
you knew where it was going. You had this sense of logical movement. Plus
you'd been watching MTV and reading Kathy Acker and going to Cronenberg films
an extra year, and so that pace didn't seem quite as fast as it once had. And
what were you thinking of about the plot? It's just this simple love affair
between these two artificial intelligences. No big deal. Throw in a heist
which you've seen a million times on TV and you've got it. The virtual reality
bit? Well, now there's The Lawnmower Man. You might as well go to McDonald's
for all the innovation you'll find there. And computer hackers are just those
people you read about in Mondo 2000 all the time. And who doesn't know that
national boundaries are falling apart, that multinationals are taking over the
power vacuum? You watch CNN, right? Not to mention you have this real bad
feeling, looking at those techno-sleezoid characters again, that you've seen
them all before somewhere. Which you have. Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney,
and the other Brat Packers have done the same
affectless-amoral-urban-underbelly-dweller number more than I can: to think
about even if they didn't set it in a near-future world. And was there really
a time when environmental destruction seemed a provocatively new topic?

All I'm saying is that people like to make sense of things. It's in their
nature. How long can any of us, after all, actually five in a state of total
Pynchonesque anti-paranoia, Baudrillardian schizophrenia? We'd never get our
essays written on time, our magazines published, our classes taught, our exams
graded, our children raised. The more we experience a text, pomo or otherwise
the more we discover patterns, shapes, connections, resonances, systems. These
help us interpret it, make it our own.(3)

Granted. Maybe this is yesterday's news. Fine.

And yet and yet and yet: the thing that most people seem to forget with
respect to a pomo text is that, when all this cosmos-making-out-of-chaos is
said and done, there's always a certain remainder staring you back between the
eyeballs. Some mystery waiting in the wings. This constellation of important
narrative, ideological, and sundry other gaps. Why, for example, returning to
Gibson's book for a second, is that intergalactic artificial intelligence
mentioned at the end, short-circuiting closure at the moment of closure? What
role does it play in the plot that's just transpired? Why, as we learn in
Count Zero, the second installment in the matrix trilogy, does
Wintermute-Neuromancer fly apart into various subprograms or voodoo gods or
viruses (what are they, anyway?) at the very instant it seems to become
unified? Who really killed Linda Lee, the protagonist's girlfriend, and why?
The point being that, paranoid as we might like to be, essentially these
modernist visitors in this essentially pomo neighborhood, frantically trying
to mapmake, connect anything with anything, neutralize the radical charge
within this pomo text or that, the Tasmanian devil of anti-paranoia is always
waiting to join our dance. And when it starts spinning and spitting,
epistemological lopsidedness and ontological weirdness can't be far behind.
Which is to say a pomo text can always become less pomo, but it can never
become modern. The Waste Land you can (at least in the best of all possible
worlds) explain when all's done and said. Neuromancer or those crazed fictions
in Mark Leyner's My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist or the chronology of
Robbe-Grillet's Jealousy or pretty much anything about Burrough's The Ticket
That Exploded, you can't. You just can't.

Which isn't, it goes without saying, to say you can't explain anything about
them. This isn't an either/or situation, but a continuum we're talking about
here.)

Pomo art, then, or maybe just a specialized kind of pomo art, is "termite
art," a term Gibson first introduced me to a couple of years ago and one he
borrowed from a 1962 essay by the iconoclastic film critic Manny Farber, long
before the word postmodern started getting lots of airplay, and even longer
before it started sounding (as it now does) sort of dated and maybe even kind
of dumb.(4) In that essay, Farber distinguishes between two kinds of creation.
The first, for which he holds nothing but contempt, he calls white elephant
art. This is the sort that embraces the idea of a well-regulated, logical
area. It's embodied in the films of Francois Truffaut. Proponents of this
quasi-neoclassical school produce tedious pieces that are
"weight-density-structure-polish amalgam[s] associated with self-aggrandizing
masterworks" (136). The second kind of creation, which Farber endorses, he
calls termite art. This is the kind that stands opposed to high culture,
welcomes freedom and multiplicity, is embodied in the films of Laurel and
Hardy. Proponents of this school produce pieces that go "always forward eating
[their] own boundaries, and, likely as not, leave nothing in [their] path
other than the signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity" (135-36). This
is a stubbornly self-involved mode of creation concerned with process over
progress, question over solution, complex ambiguity over cry explanation.(5)

A mode, that is, that leads us to Ludwig Wittgenstein and David Foster
Wallace.

Avant-Pop and the Scavenger Belly

"What?"

Wittgenstein and Wallace share a certain quality of mind that may helpfully be
thought of as termite consciousness. (Sure: there's a zillion things that
separate them; these it seems to me, are basically uninteresting.) What unites
them is that they don't jark around with thought-experiments for the sake of
jacking around with thought-experiments. They don't play games, aesthetic or
philosophical, just to play games, as one might (perhaps tenuously) claim
about people like Sollers or Derrida, or (much less tenuously) like untold
numbers of fashion-conscious critics, theorists, and other academics in the
course of amassing their tenure and promotion files. No: they play games in
order to wrestle with very real problems, in order to attempt to work through
the world. "What is the use of studying philosophy," Wittgenstein once asked a
student, "if all that it does for you is to enable you to talk with some
plausibility about some abstruse questions of logic, etc., and if it does not
improve your thinking about the important questions of everyday life?"(7)

This said by the Viennese philosopher (1889-1951) who, as Wallace (1962-)
himself wrote, "by all evidence lived in personal torment over the questions
too many of his academic followers have made into elaborate empty exercise"
(Plenum 219-20). Who was gay. Who was an indifferent student, an ascetic, a
soldier, an aviator. Who, with his friend David Pinset (to whom the musically
structured Tractatus is dedicated), had a repertoire of forty Schubert songs
which Pinset would perform on the piano while Wittgenstein whistled along. Who
in 1913 submitted to hypnosis hoping the resulting trance would allow him to
arrive at clear answers to questions of logic. Who lived for more than a year
secluded Thoreau-like in a but on a farm in Norway; considered entering
monastic life; donated large sums of inherited money to needy Ausatian poets
and artists, Rilke and Trakl among them; and published exactly one book and
one brief paper in the course of his life. Who was a grade-school teacher
until he began to worry his intellectual influence on children was probably
harmful. Who disliked universities and academia, and who, like Kafka, was
relieved to discover he was dying.

Both Wittgenstein and Wallace, along with a motley termite crew of others that
includes the likes of Handke and Barthelme, take nothing for granted. Doubt is
their cardinal virtue. Wittgenstein may have begun as a modernist searching
through his picture theory for what can be said honestly about experience. He
ended up, however, drifting in a post-Tractatus twilight zone wondering if he
could be even relatively sure he possessed a hand. The movement from the
Tractatus to On Certainty is the movement from cubism to assemblage, from
Eliot to Acker. And now, via David Foster Wallace, one of his intellectual
great-grandchildren, Wittgenstein has been absorbed into the shark belly of
the avant-pop.

Open that belly, and you'll find everything in it.

Not that Wallace has much choice about whether or not to critique what he
uncovers there. I mean, he is what he uncovers there. The avant-pop's as much
a part of him as the color of his eyes. "Popular culture," says the narrator
of "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way," "is the symbolic
representation of what people already believe" (Girl 27 1). Like many younger
writers who shop in the global K-Mart these days, Wallace is made of the
stuff. He purchases Andy Warhol's aesthetics of trash and Laurie Anderson's
bright ironic media-infiltrated being. Thomas Pynchon's hip convoluted
language, cartoonishly named comic characters (Judith Prietht, Rick Vigorous,
Wang-Dang Lang, et al.), and maximization of form (even Wallace's short
stories are long). Don Delillo's witty thematization of television and early
T. C. Boyle's linguistic flash and offkilter realities. Guy Davenport's and
William Vollmann's interlacing of real and fictional characters in order to
puzzle out the historicity of both, as in "Lyndon," where literature becomes
politics and politics literature. Barth's richly reflexive metafiction
("Westward" is, Wallace tells us on the copyright page of Girt, "written in
the margins" of "Lost in the Funhouse") and Donald Barthelme's tagless
dialogue, culture of urban dreck, and backbroke sentences such as "Was me
whispered to Simple Ranger, |Minogue, T. Rex, first public display since '67,
crisis wool,' and the Ranger nodded, his eyes more full of knowing than sky, a
second" (Girl 137) that grow by accretion and destruction like barnacles on a
wreck or a rock.

17.3.52

Does my telephone call to New York strengthen my conviction that the earth
exists?

In a letter to me dated 17 March 1992, Wallace remarked that his father
studied with Norman Malcolm, one of Wittgenstein's students, at Cornell.
Wallace himself, a math-philosophy major at Amherst took a seminar on
Wittgenstein taught by William Kennick, another student of the philosopher's.
He was really interested in it and "deeply taken" with the Tractatus, but felt
"the Investigations were silly because they retracted the cold formal beauty
of the Tractatus (the Tractatus' first proposition is |The world is everything
that is the case,' which along with Crane's |The Open Boat' 's |None of the
men knew the color of the sky' is the most beautiful opening line in western
lit)." Which led him in the summer of 1990 to publish a twenty-two-page essay
in the Review of Contemporary Fiction on David Markson's Wittgenstein's
Mistress that, besides giving Markson's book a sharp, thorough, and sometimes
critical reading (Markson, among other things, doesn't get women right,
Wallace says), serves as a lucid introduction to many of Wittgenstein's
central concepts and clearly establishes Wallace as an understanding and
self-proclaimed "fan" (218) of the philosopher.

Lenore Sr.'s Measurements

"Suppose Gramma tells me really convincingly that all that really exists of my
life is what can be said about it?"

In that same letter Wallace explained that Lenore Sr., Lenore Beadsman's
great-grandmother, "is based loosely, physically, on Alice Ambrose, a very old
former Smith professor who lived near me and had been one of the students
whose notes were comprised by Witt's Blue and Brown books." Lenore Sr. is a
"small, birdish, sharp-featured thing ... a hard woman, a cold woman, a
querulous and thoroughly selfish woman, one with vast intellectual pretensions
and ... probably commensurate gifts" who lacks a body thermometer and hence
has to be kept in excruciatingly hot rooms, thermostats locked at 98.6 - a
swell metaphor both for her cold-blooded hermetically sealed life and, quite
possibly, for the cold-blooded hermetically sealed lives of logical
positivists everywhere. In the 1920s she studied at Campbridge "under a mad
crackpot genius named Wittgenstein, who believed that everything was words,"
as Rick Vigorous not-too-kindly puts it (Broom 73).

She consequently serves as a slightly skewed, gently gibing introduction to
Wittgenstein's philosophy. For her, whose prize possession is an autographed
copy of the Investigations, as for her mentor, language is a system of symbols
that filters experience. We only know our lives through what we can say about
them. Our understanding of the world arises from our ability to talk about it.
Language shapes what we perceive and how we perceive. Moreover (and here
Wittgenstein foreshadows Derrida & Co.) both the post-Tractatus philosopher
and Lenore Sr. believe language possesses no meaning except in how it's used
at specific times in specific places in specific linguistic contexts. The use
of a word or a sentence is the language game in which it plays a part.
"Meaning," as Lenore Jr. says, "is nothing more or less than its function"
(149).

Hence the central metaphor of Wallace's first novel: the broom. Lenore Jr.
relates how when she was a child Lenore Sr. showed her a broom and asked which
was more fundamental to it, the bristles or the handle. Lenore Jr. answered
the former. "| Aha,' Lenore Sr. says, "|that's because you want to sweep with
the broom, isn't it? It's because of what you want the broom for, isn't it?'
... And that if what we wanted a broom for was to break windows, then the
handle was clearly the fundamental essence of the broom.... Meaning as use'
(149-50). But what happens if your life has no use? Well, then it has no
meaning. And that's just the problem Leonore Sr. finds herself in. She's been
tucked away in the Shaker Heights Nursing Home in Ohio. Twenty-four-year-old
Lenore Jr. (who, by the way, was also a philosophy major in college) and a few
other patients are her sole visitors. She's stuck, in other words, in a
stultifyingly static existence. Which explains the main plot of Broom: Lenore
Sr. attempts to invigorate her life with use and therefore meaning by
proposing to Stonecipher Beadsman III, Lenore Jr.'s dad and chief of the
Stonecipheco baby food company, some research into a drug that speeds
development of (what else?) language skills and comprehension in kids.

See, Gretchen Yingst, one of Lenore Sr.'s cronies at the home, had a husband
who used to work for Consolidated Gland Derivatives in Akron. He came up with
this cattle-endocrine derivative on his own, writing the results down on
Batman tablets before his death. (Does this sound like a Pynchonesque plot, or
what?) Stonecipher goes for the idea but Lenore Sr., never exactly a
Stonecipher groupie, reconsiders and steals back the tablets and test sample
which she next feeds to Lenore Jr.'s pet cockatiel, Vlad the Impaler, with
predictably weird results, giving the bird the gift of gab, or at least
gabble. Then she absconds to the phone tunnels beneath the Bombardini
Building, aided and abetted, apparently, by Dr. Jay, Lenore Jr.'s and Rick
Vigorous's psychologist, where there is at least fleeting evidence that she
eventually dies Broom 463).

There is even more to that broom, though. The word broom is related to the
Anglo-Saxon word brom, Low German bram Dutch brem - the last two of which, my
Webster's informs me, are closely allied to bramble, a word that derives from
the Sanskrit bhram, meaning to be confused. Thus we're talking in a fairly
roundabout way of a novel called something like The Confusion of the System -
an appropriate, if unlikely intentional, title. Language is the primary system
of this text, and confusion of language and other corollary systems (much to
Lenore Sr.'s and Wittgenstein's chagrin) is the wrench in the works.

Wittgenstein understood his life project as explaining the nature of sentences
which, early on in his career, he believed models or pictures of reality. Each
element in a sentence, he thought corresponded to the state of affairs it
represented, making the universe a pretty unambiguous place, though not
everything that could be understood could be said: certain religious moments,
for instance, maybe love, and so on. Wittgenstein thereby saw one function of
philosophy as demarcating what cannot be said by pristinely presenting what
can be said via his picture theory of language, along the way quite possibly
uncovering lots of effors that'd given rise to various philosophical
doctrines. His basic concern, then, was the relationship of language to world,
and his world started out, as Wallace comments in his essay on Markson, "to be
logical heaven," but ended up "a metaphysical hell" (223). Tbe more
post-Tractatus Wittgenstein examined the relationship between language and
world, the more he intuited language didn't really contain the clear-cut
structure he'd been hoping for. In fact, he began seeing the philosophical
ideal he'd put forward in the Tractatus (1922) as an increasingly dubious one.
As his life went on and he began the Investigations (not published until just
after his death), he began to get the impression there wasn't so much a
universe of meaning out there as a pluriverse of meanings. By granting that
the meaning of a word or sentence is in its use, rather than, say, in its
reference to a stable and knowable world, the hope of a mythically pure
inspection of reality began to gunk up, and the idea of totality began to
break down. And it's a short step from thinking context determines meaning to
arriving at the doorstep of philosophical relativism.

Question: Where then important moral and ethical values Wittgenstein sought in
his daily life find a place?

Answer: Nowhere.

Result: A broom in the system.

Now it's true Wallace from time to time echoes the methodical, clean,
subject-verb-predicate sentences of the Tractatus, as in these lines from the
opening of "Little Expressionless Animals":

It's 1976. The sky is low and full of clouds. The gray clouds are bulbous and
wrinkled and shiny. The sky looks cerebral. Under the sky is a field, in the
wind. A pale highway runs beside the field. Lots of cars go by. One of the
cars stops by the side of the highway. Two small children are brought out of
the car by the young woman with a loose face. A man at the wheel of the car
stares straight ahead. (Girl 3)

Thus at least nodding toward a picture theory of the language that takes us
back, not only to Wittgenstein, but also to people like Carver, Beattie,
Hemingway, all the way to Flaubert's doorstep, and Stendhal's before him, who
believed scientistically that language was a mirror held up to experience.
This is the impulse that finds voice in a character like Faye in "Little
Expressionless Animals," who doesn't like the complexity of lyrical language
because "it beats around bushes. Even when i like it, it's nothing more than a
really oblique way of saying the obvious, it seems like" (13); and Bruce in
"Here and There," who wants to be a "poet of technology" and thinks

literature will get progressively more mathematical and technical as time goes
by.... Meaning will be clean.... No more ... warm clover breath, heaving
bosoms, histories as symbol, colossi; no more man, fist to brow or palm to
decolletage [sic], understood in terms of a thumping, thudding, heated Nature,
itself conceived as colored, shaped, invested with odor, lending meaning in
virtue of qualities. No more qualities. No more metaphors. (155)

Ezra Pound's imagism haunts this idea, hard, clear and concentrated as does,
of course, the early Ludwig. And Lenore Sr. would just adore it. Only Bruce's
story ultimately turns out to be a critique of Tractatus mentality, not an
endorsement of it. Bruce is more in love with a picture of his girlfriend than
with the girl herself, heartless guy that he is, with the representation of a
thing than with the thing. When he moves from ideal picture theory to grubby
practice, however, trying to fix a broken stove, he soon realizes the stove is
like the world: "a crude piece of equipment" (171).

Even if Wallace's mind tells him the first sentence of the Tractatus is the
most beautiful opening line in Western lit, his gut tells him otherwise: that
the world is an enigma, the universe a perplexity. Consequently his sentences
usually sound more like this one from forty-two-year-old Rick Vigorous who's
visiting his alma mater:

As I joined the serpentine line of students walking up the ungentle hill to
the Art and Science Buildings, all of us falling into the vaguely floppy,
seal-like gait of the hurried hill-climber, most of us seals apparently late
for class, one of us late for an appointment with a tiny ocean of his own
past, stretching away and down beside the carved dock of his childhood, an
ocean into which this particular seal was going to pour a strong (hopefully
unitary) stream of his own presence, to prove that he still is, and so was -
that is, provided of course the bathroom and toilet and stall were still there
- as I joined the line of seals in short pants and loose short-sleeved shirts
and boat shoes and backpacks, and as I felt the fear that accompanied and was
in a way caused by the intensity of the wash of feelings and desires and so on
that accompanied even the thought of a silly men's room in a silly building at
a silly college where a sad silly boy had spent four years twenty years ago,
as I felt all these things , there occurred to me a fact which I think now as
I sit up in bed in our motel room, writing, the television softly on, the
sharp-haired object of my adoration, and absolute center of my entire
existence asleep and snoring softly in the bed beside me, a fact which I think
now is undeniably true, the truth being that Amherst College in the 1960's was
for me a devourer of the emotional middle, a marker of psychic canyons, a
whacker of the pendulum of Mood with the paddle of Immoderation. (Broom 206)

That's 283 words there, and more labyrinthine clauses, parenthetical phrases
with parenthetical phrases, chaotic cataloging, linguistic indirection, and
confusing syntactical structures than I care to count. Nor is its information
density, as somebody might be inclined to argue, simply a revelation of Rick's
mixed-up neurotic mind, though it is, certainly, in part, that. No: it's just
how Wallace writes most of the time. Check out, for further instance, the
following 122-word knot, an excerpt from a book review Wallace wrote for the
Los Angeles Times, and which the New Yorker, predictably bemused, reprinted
under the title "Sentences We Hated to Come to the End Of":

If pop is the argument between sub-culture (as conceived by the cultural
outsider when that outsider happens to be a genius) and the redemptive,
relentlessly consuming appetite of the community, then the arc of Elvis's
career, from starving white trash to musical insurgent to heartthrob to
B-movie mainstay to corpulent Vegas schmaltz-king "performing a kind of
enormous victory rather than winning it" ("Mystery Train"), limns also the
living and fatal paradox of all popular U.S. art: that this art, which is
produced via raw difference, the special fecund anguish of non-inclusion,
attacks, seduces and is devoured by a mass-art market that redeems and even
deifies the artist while it drains his productions of the denial and pain that
is its voice.(8)

I had to read that three times to get a bead on it, and even then I was a
little queasy. The point being that these sorts of "sentences" are maximalist
effusions that correspond not to some mathematically pure realm of being but
rather to some multidimensional space of becoming intricate as the involved
surface of a brain.

Like all good termite art, they continually move forward gnawing away at their
own perimeters, revealing themselves as ardent and disheveled processes rather
than cool and prim products, reflecting nothing if not their author's (and
characters') befuddlement before language and world.

Strategic Misrepresentation 101

Suppose some adult had told a child that he had been on the moon. The child
tells me the story, and I say it was only a joke, the man hadn't been on the
moon; no one has ever been on the moon; the moon is a long way off and it is
impossible to climb up there or fly there. - If now the child insists, saying
perhaps there is a way of getting there which I don't know, etc., what reply
would I make to him?

Only they're also funny, those sentences of Wallace's. That's important to
remind ourselves every now and then. If Wittgenstein's (at least early
Wittgenstein's) consciousness is the harvest of that maudlin Eliotish-Rilkean
seriousness and sense of disorientation and cosmic angst the idea of modernism
conjures up for a lot of us (pace Joyce and Picasso), then Wallace's
consciousness is the harvest of that carnivalesque comic vision and ironic
Monty Pythonesque sense of often taking nothing (including itself) very
seriously many of us tend to associate with the anti-idea of postmodernism.
And yet, despite this apparently important distinction between philosopher and
writer, Wallace continually enacts Wittgenstein's interrogation of the
efficacy of language in his texts. The mechanisms might be different; the
motive is much the same.

Remember, by way of illustration, how many people in Broom misunderstand each
other and misrepresent themselves. Lenore Jr., raised in a family that made
"just a huge deal out of what got said" (399), and Mr. Bloemker, administrator
of the Shaker Heights Nursing Home go at it for over two pages trying to
define what missing means with respect to Lenore Sr., while Lenore Jr. and
Rick go at it a lot longer than that trying to determine whether Lenore Jr.
actually loves him or not. That cockatiel, Vlad the Impaler, mouths
pronouncements the Reverend Hart Lee Sykes believes profound but which are
really just this side of goofy gibberish. LaVache, Lenore Jr.'s one-legged
cynic of a brother at Amherst, deliberately misnames his phone lymph node so
he can (sort of) honestly tell his father he doesn't own a phone, while he
rechristens his friends with aliases like Heat and Breather because, he
claims, their real names don't matter much anymore. An important part of the
college experience, he adds, "is learning how to lie. |Strategic
misrepresentation,' we call it" (237). He wants people to refer to him as the
Antichrist instead of Stoney because Stoney, his family handle, makes him part
of a system he'd just as soon not be associated with. And that's just for
starters.

Meaning may be use. But what happens if use becomes unclear, either
accidentally or on purpose? What happens if someone hands you a broom yet
doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do with it, and you have this sinking
feeling that sweeping is only one option among many? What happens if use (and
thereby meaning) edges toward some borderline state, toward the nebulous,
toward the pure plain puzzling? Well, so much for that immaculate picture
theory of language.

Confusion of the system. Or, in this case, systems: of language, of meaning,
of identity, of narrative, of reality, of, well, you name it. Everything in
Wallace keeps coming down to this. Near the end of his life Wittgenstein
wrote: "All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis
takes place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less
arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no, it
belongs to the essence of what we call an argument. The system is not so much
the point of departure, as the element in which arguments have their life" (On
Certainty 16e). We can't escape them. We're all a part of them, from traffic
lights to university committees, from paying taxes to psychotherapy sessions.
We'd like to think these systems bring the world into clearer focus for us.
Except they don't seem to hold up as well as we might hope under any sort of
even mildly intense scrutiny.

Take identity. We're sometimes under the delusion we know who we really are,
if you can imagine such a thing. We assume our Is are the same at 7:00 a.m. as
7:00 p.m., Monday as Friday, March as May, 1963 as 1991 from our perspective
and from the perspectives of others. Only Wallace, hearkening back to
post-Tractatus Wittgenstein, thematically challenges this notion though a
series of nice images he generates in Broom. Lenore Jr. is briefly bewildered,
as a case in point, when the new nurse at Shaker Heights thinks Lenore Jr.'s
making a bad joke when she announces she's Lenore Beadsman, there to see
Lenore Beadsman - save for the fact that she is, in a manner of speaking,
Lenore Beadsman, there to see Lenore Beadsman. A more pronounced illustration
of identity investigation is the ritual the Spaniard family acts out before
the laser disk playing on their TV set: they don masks and tell a tale about
how, when they talk of themselves as part of a family, they both feel part of
a larger whole (a whimsical nod in the direction of Wittgenstein's "family
resemblances," perhaps?) and like they've lost parts of themselves (what's
under those masks, anyway, the "real" them? but what's that supposed to mean?
and how many layers of masks, figuratively and otherwise, do they each
possess?). More pronounced still, don't forget Lenore Jr.'s other brother,
John, who's admitted to Lake Lady Medical Center in Chicago because he's
convinced he's not himself anymore but a perpetual game-show contestant - a
super metaphor for all of us because, in a sense, none of us is us: we're all,
in the world accordi ng to Wittgenstein and Wallace, contestants in a
multifaceted system (or, better, multifaceted systems) of language games.

Except in Wallace's universe it's not always clear who's winning.

Or who's playing what.

Or what, exactly, the rules to the game an; supposed to be.

Gramma Says

"Gramma says any telling automatically becomes a kind of system, that controls
everybody involved.... Every telling creates and limits and defines."

No wonder, then, that Wallace foregrounds the very act of narrative in his
work. Telling, after all, is one of the great pattern-making gestures, a
method of testing, labeling, controlling. It's the element in which people,
situations, ideas, etc., have their existence, the element by which we
formulate our daily commotions: and then, and then, and then. "The truth," Dr.
Jay claims, "is that there's no difference between a life and a story" (120).
LaVache reminds Lenore Jr. that Lenore Sr. believes "that you're only real
insofar as you're told about, so that to the extent that you're real you're
controlled, and thus not in control, so that you're more like a sort of
character than a person, really - and of course Lenore would say the two are
the same, now, wouldn't she?" (249).

She would.

And so it's fitting that many of the players in Broom are obsessed with
getting the scripts that are their lives right, but maybe none are so obsessed
as Rick, a kind of pomo Scheherazade who works, suitably enough, for a
publishing firm and as the fiction editor of a small literary review. He tells
Lenore Jr. stories, often not his own, often in bed, often with the point that
things can always get worse: babies can die without warning, cars crash
through ceilings and kill the innocent, malicious psychologists cheat with
wives while mute blind paraplegic husbands lie helplessly by. He also tries
creating some tales of his own, as with "Love," which involves the discovery
that a neighbor has been taking photos of and collecting artifacts belonging
to the little boy next door (unbeknownst both to the little boy and his
parents) as part of some dark infatuation - a story, by the way, like several
by Rick, that distantly echoes his own infatuation with Lenore Jr.

And Lenore Jr. tells not a few stories herself, many having to do with an
attempt to figure out the plot she seems to have been unwillingly written
into, some (again that word) Pynchonesque conspiracy Lenore Jr. feels herself
Oedipa Maasishly to have entered the moment Lenore Sr. vanished, but which may
be nothing more than a series of coincidences, or the product of an overactive
neurotic imagination. In fact, it's all a little like the game of Telephone,
isn't it, where, by the time the message (from Lenore Sr.? Leonore Jr.'s
father? whom?) reaches Leonore Jr., it's traversed so much white noise it's
become nigh indecipherable. In which case those malfunctioning phones at
Frequent and Vigorous, symbols of communications gone awry, are fitting images
indeed for the novel itself which is one grand system of communication and
which tells story after story, white noise sizzling in its master network as
well, as it leaps around achronologically, shifts from third-person POV to
first-, comprises whole chapters out of Barthelmesque swatches of untagged
dialogue only to introduce the characters speaking them later, months from
straight fiction to transcript to monologue to journal entry to magazine
article to legal contract to duty log, upsetting traditional narrative
boundaries along the way, hybridizing genres, and thereby producing the
novelistic equivalent of philosophical relativism. Not to mention that it ends
in mid-sentence, some skier caught just as he lifts off the jump, unsure how
he'll land, some final broom of the system, though we surely know (we think)
the word that finishes the sentence that finishes the novel: it just has to be
the only real Wittgensteinian choice: word (467).

One of the most significant narrative systems that hums through Wallace's
project is television, NBC to MTV, Ronald McDonald to David Letterman, Merv
Griffin to Jack Lord. A character in "My Appearance" reminisces about those
parodies of commercials that Saturday Night Live used to broadcast after the
show's opening:

"Such great parodies that it always took you a while to even realize they were
parodies and not commercials? And how the anti-commercials were a hit? So then
what happened?... the sponsors started putting commercials on |SNL' that were
almost like the parodies of the commercials, so that it took you a while to
realize that these were even real commercials in the first place. So the
sponsors were suddenly guranteed huge audiences that watched their commercials
very, very closely - hoping, of course, that they'd be parodies." (Girl
188-89) A system of commerce co-opts a system of art, which was mimicking a
system of commerce in the first place, in order to mimic a system of art
mimicking a system of commerce in order to make the viewer think he or she's
watching a system of art mimicking a system of commerce and not a system of
commerce mimicking a system of art mimicking a system of commerce. All in
order to sell a product. Baudrillard, be still.

In Wallace's work, the simulcra-producing media become as pervasive as
planetary background radiation. Televisions seem like they're alwayds on.
Which turns out to be not so much a critique of the media on Wallace's part as
it is just a video recording the way things really are for a couple of
generations raised on airwaves. Leading to the extreme case of a character in
"Little Expressionless Animals" who begins wondering,
Alice-in-Wonderland-like, which side of the tube she's really on. That is, she
begins wondering, like all actors who sense they're part of some bigger,
sometimes pretty intricate, script: where is selfhood? where real
communication? where the importantly political? where, finally, that ultimate
language game: reality?

The answer being that reality (whatever the heck that is) goes, subtly, out
the window. Broom is a novel published in 1987 but set for the most part in
the very near-future world of 1990, now our past. But this future world, no
longer our future world, isn't our present world either. And yet it's not
exactly not our present world. I mean, it's really pretty recognizable. Except
Stonecipher Beadsman II has shaped East Corinth to resemble Jayne Mansfield's
profile. And there's that grotesque Norman Bombardini, right out of the
Meaning of Life, who wants to eat everything in sight and grow to infinite
size. And there're those magical realist frogs growing in the pit of the
Thermos Nanaws neck in one of Rick's early stories, not to mention Vlad the
Impaler's newfound speech in the real world (which isn't the real world) of
the novel. Alternate geography crops up in the form of the Great Ohio Desert,
surreality in Rick's goofy sexual dreams of Queen Victoria, absurdity in Dr.
Jay's (read: Dr. Hilarius from, yes, Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49)
hygiene-anxiety therapy.

Meaning those reality termites are back.

A Great Lump of Opaque Pig Iron

But what about such a proposition as "I know I have a brain"? Can I doubt it?
Grounds for doubt are lacking! Everything speaks in its favour, nothing
against it. Nevertheless it is imaginable that my skull should turn out empty
when it was operated on.

Guy Davenport, late-modernist cousin to early Wittgenstein, subscribes to the
notion that the philosopher who thought his way through the Tractatus, the
Investigations, and On Certainly was the kind of guy who made honesty look
dishonest, he was so darn honest:

Nothing - nothing at all - was to be allowed to escape analysis. He had
nothing up his sleeve; he had nothing to teach. The world was to him an
absolute puzzle, a great lump of opaque pig iron. Can we think about the lump?
What is thought? What is the meaning of can, of can we, of can we think? What
is the meaning of we? What does it mean to ask what is the meaning of we? If
we answer these questions on Monday, are the answers valid on Tuesday? If I
answer them at all, do I think the answer, believe the answer, know the
answer, or imagine the answer?[9]

I love that. The world to him was an absolute puzzle. Or, maybe better: the
world to him was an absolute game. Or, maybe better yet: the world to him was
a maze of absolutely impaired language games. David Foster Wallace, of course,
is right behind him. To question the efficacy of language is to question the
validity of systems of meaning which is to question the efficacy of systems of
narrative which is to question the validity of systems of identity which is to
question the veracity of systems of reality. And so on. And so forth.

Think of Lenore Sr.'s antimony in Broom as a guiding metaphor for this: "the
barber who shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves" (42). Does
he shave himself? Well, he can't. And yet he can't can't. Puzzles. Paradoxes.
Mysteries. Lenore Jr. is an enigma to Rick. She's someone who "soundlessly
invites one to play a game consisting of involved auxxnpts to find out the
game's own rules" (72). Rick is an enigma to Lenore Jr. Lenore Sr. is an
enigma to everyone. Only that, as we've already seen, is the whole point,
really: if we don't fully know the rules, we don't fully know the games. And
we don't fully know the rules. Most of the characters inhabiting Wallace's
pluriverse are as baffled before life as those poor patients in the Shaker
Heights Nursing Home. They live in a perpetual state of philosophical
extremis. Metamorphosis is their only norm. "How might one even begin to
orient oneself with respect to such a series of changes in the fundamental
features of the world?" Mr. Bloemker asks, thinking of those patients and what
they've seen of the twentieth century. "How to begin to come to some
understanding of one's place in a system, when one is a part of an area that
exists in such a troubling relation to the rest of the world, a world that is
itself stripped of any static, understandable character by the fact that it
changes, radically, all the time?" (143).

Lenore Sr., like her mentor, like her creator, adored antinomies. None of
these people wants to interpret the world so much as contemplate its
complexity. For them philosophy is less the manifestation of a certain
stabilizing doctrine than it is an activity of mind concerned with trying (if
often failing) to plumb some fairly muddy, muddy depths. Just because you know
one state of affairs, Wittgenstein asserts, doesn't mean you can necessarily
infer another different state of affairs from them. And yet this is what we
all try doing when we speak about the future, isn't it? The result being that
we'll never really know if, when we throw that apple into the air this time,
it will come down. Not, at least, until we see it drop. If, that is, we are
actually seeing it drop when we think we are actually seeing it drop, and not
imagining, and not believing, and not hoping. If, that is, it is an apple. If
it is air. If we are we. No: we don't "know" much, if anything, about a
pluriverse aswarm with language games that must be played out as certainties
though the next second may give them each and every one the lie. And it is to
this extent that late Wittgenstein and early Wallace are kindred spirits to
Kafka, who in many ways is the father of this fin de millennium's Age of
Uncertainty. We're all continually waking up in our beds, a funny feeling that
that uneasy dream we just had wasn't a dream.

So Far It's

So far it's a good graduate-workshop story, the rare kind that imposes the
very logic it obeys; and plus it has the unnameable but stomach-punching
quality of something real, a welcome relief from those dread
watch-me-be-clever pieces - or, even more dread, a fashionably modern minimal
exercise, going through its weary motions as it slouches toward epiphany.

"Familiarity breeds content," Wallace says about the state of contemporary
fiction. "Rarely is our uncritical inheritance of early Wittgensteinian &
Logical Positivist models so obvious as in our academic & aesthetic prejudice
that successful fiction encloses rather than opens up, organizes facts rather
than undermines them" (Plenum 234). In these last strange years of this
twentieth strange century, Wallace couldn't be more on the money. These may be
the days of miracles and wonders, sure Paul Simon, but they're also the days
of mean-spirited conservatism. Of economic censorship in commercial publishing
houses, where literary lists (if you're lucky enough to make it onto them,
which itself is a nearly Herculean task in these recession-heavy times) are
cut continually, and in the bookstore business, where novels are removed fturn
shelves after just a couple of weeks if they don't sell and sell fast and
well. Of writers finding it virtually impossible to survive by writing, if
that writing isn't (and sometimes even if it is) everyone else's writing. Of
self-censorship by authors thinking maybe, just maybe, the least
psychologically dark and stylistically flashy pieces are the ones that'll
really sell.(10)

But these are the days too, maybe, just maybe, to reassert the importance of
Lenore Sr.'s measurements.

Rediscover crazy Manny Farber.

Maybe even trouble a couple of white elephants.

    Title:  Reading and riding the post-scientific wave: the shorter fiction
            of David Foster Wallace.
   Author:  James Rother

 Abstract:  David Foster Wallace is representative of a shift away from
postmodernism and its focus on debunking literary and historical myths at the
expense of relevance and belief. Wallace's fiction skips the ironical games of
postmodernism by inscribing his works with reorganized guidance systems that
allow for sincere character development. Wallace achieves this by using layers
of stories that 'intercalate each other's strata.' There is a sense of flux,
as in the postmodernist works, but also a semblance of order that gives the
work meaning, not just craftiness.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

The influential swing toward meaning and away from sense is as discernible on
the wilder shores of contemporary American fiction as it is in the shored up
wilds of that contemporary fiction that is America. Its consequence has bean a
much anticipated but little heralded turning away not only from mytholepsy and
the sort of Spenglerian Untergangbang that became the hallmark of
postmodernism's first generation, the Pynchon-Coover-Barth axis of the sixties
and seventies, but also from the later capitalizing on empty signifiers that
became the stock in trade of the movement's second generation, the
minimalists, in the eighties. Now, well into the nineties, a third generation
has sprung up whose quiet revolution in the realm of fictional technique has
scrapped deadpan irony in favor of passive-aggressive role modeling in
conceptual plasticene (note Mark Leyner's My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist);
loss of affect in favor of affectation, suitably randomized, of loss (viz.
Kathy Acker's Empire of the Senseless); and density of texture in favor of
density matrices whose historical decompressions of the indigenous reenergize
the master-slave dialectic in wholly new and de-Hegelianized ways (for
example, William T. Vollmann's cycle of novels-in-progress on the loss-leader
role assigned American Indian culture in the discounting of America).
Consider, for example, the most recent work of David Foster Wallace, a true
third generationist and author - so far - of a novel, The Broom of the System
(1987), structured around the prinzip of Wittgenstein's Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus (1921) that all fassion of atomic facts begins and ends
at ground zero-degree; a collection of fictional pieces both long and short,
titled Girl with Curious Hair (1989); a book on African-American street music
done in collaboration with Mark Costello, Signifying Rappers (1990); and some
as-yet uncollected stories, including the different and really quite
remarkable "Order and Flux in Northampton," published in Bradford Morrow's
Conjunctions in its tenth anniversary issue in 1991 (no. 17, pp. 91-118).

This essay will focus on several samples of Wallace's recent fiction from Girl
with Curious Hair and pay particular attention to "Order and Flux in
Northampton" because it so thoroughly exemplifies qualities found in the
newest writing in what I choose to call the post-scientific mode. I propose to
illustrate the differences between Wallace and his postmodernist predecessors
by examining the epistemology masquerading as indeterminacy physics that so
often undergirds the master topoi of classic first-generation metafictional
works, as well as its transfigurations in certain third-generation,
on-the-way-to-becoming-classic post-metafictional, or post-scientific, texts.
Now, post-scientific fiction, as I see it, counters such specious
epistemologizing by altering not only how the game of fiction is played but
its nature and rationale as well. If the postmodernists of the sixties and
seventies were content to smoke out the mirrors secreted in civilization's
high-toned myths, the fact could not be ignored that those myths were from the
start intent on blurring the distinction between the innocence of loss and the
loss of innocence, whether they were a solution dreamed up by Scheherazade to
keep a knife from her throat, or a problem dreamed up for Achilles, Ulysses,
or Aeneas to keep him from reflecting too long or too hard on how holding the
mirror up to self-reflection can leave any masterpiece open to having its
bones jumped someday by a Barthelme or a Barth. These and other writers sought
to veil with multiple ironies (or to infinitize ad ironiam) Bedeutung's
undignified retreat from Sinn all across the spectrum of twentieth-century
culture, believing that, under a barrage of superhip gags and snickers,
readers would be at a loss to say whether what they were being treated to was
an extravaganza piped into a lounge pretending to be The Big Room or a small
satyric revue in a big room pretending to be The Lounge.

Wallace, Leyner, or Vollmann, however, divest their fiction of the games
multiple ironists play by outering the hidden schematics with which the
guidance systems of stories had hitherto been programmed and scrupulously
reinscribing them in an idiom not unlike a blueprint's with its filigree of
specs but somehow charged with a capability to render character and nuance, as
postmodemist coolness seldom was, with a topologist's love of contour and
tactility (though the spirit of place is often "being there-ed" at the cost of
there's being). Their stories also display a lay(er)ing on of topos-less
narrative by a method that musical formalists from Ezra Pound to Pierre Boulez
have designted pli selon pli or "fold over fold." Rather than folding in with
the basic elements of his story grand narratives (ostensibilized as vast
cryptogrammta done up in the style of modernism's - and postmodernism's -
great mythophiliacs from Joyce to Gaddis) like ingredients in a batter,
Wallace instead contrives something intriguingly different. He folds over
layers of text until they intercalate each other's strata, thus simulating a
version of hyperspace utterly removed from either the discontinuities of
Burroughs's montage linguistics or the Einsteinian cut-ups of Durrell's
Alexandria Quartet. These layers act as software for what might be called the
Wallace story's programmatic control center or Wittgensteinian database of
"atomic facts" by which "everything that is the case" is subtended. Initially,
finally: it makes no difference - in that philosopher's Stonehenge of the
obvious, the Tractatus, time is as epochal or bracketable in the Husserlian
sense as it would be in any spreadsheet universe where only insistencies, duly
numbered, ever reach printout. This re-envisioning of fiction as the endlessly
reconstitutable core reactor by which reality is broken down into its various
unifying fields and not nucleated conscriptively into gross metastases of
metaphor and metonymy - engrossing though they might be - as the original
groundbreaking works of a Pynchon or a Coover now seem to third-generational
eyes to have been.

For this and ower reasons (contingent upon Wallace's newer even more engaging
"gridworking" and "netlocking in" of facts) it has become necessary to devote
to the as yet uncollected "Order and Flux in Northampton" the amount of
commentary space usually accorded more easily accessed works, such as, in his
case, his 1989 collection Girl with Curious Hair. Though several of the
stories from that collection - "Girl" and "John Billy" particularly - screw
the potential for weaving in hypertext beyond the first-order permutables that
have long been the stock-in-trade of Coover and other older postmodemists to
an even further sticking point, "Order and Flux" highlights a recent tropism
still very much in progress in both his approach to narration and the crafting
of sentences that if not directly attributable to Wittgentein (as were many
sentences in Broom), are certainly of the sort he would have relished getting
deep inside of. Thus, some of the stories in Girl, and especially the longer
ones like "Little Expressionless Animals," "Lyndon," and the novella-length
"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way," hark back to what now seems a
more retrograde stage of Wallace's transition from a writer obsessed with the
decline of post-modernism to one heralding the advent of an auspicious shift
toward the post-scientific in fiction, as is discernible in "Order and Flux."
It is hardly accidental that Wallace closed out Girl with Curious Hair with
"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way," a story that launched into
orbit a satellite of Barth's 1968 medley of metafictional duties, Lost in the
Funhouse, and most notably its title piece, in the form of a sendup-cum-homage
that is nearly six times as long as its source text. Indeed, Wallace closes a
magic circle of first-generation postmodernism by recalcifying - with
Lettermaniacal irreverence - the now quaint manner of Barth's 1968 - isme,
with its "For whom is the Funhouse fun?" sedimentation of ironies into a
petrifactualism that goes the poet Auden one better in praising the limestone
he himself has quarried for the occasion. This effect is further enhanced by
having D. L., the story's ingenue, present her copy of Lost in the Funhouse
for autographing to its parergonic auteur, Professor Ambrose, in whose writing
workshop she labors, in an arch reprise of metafiction's "the way we were," to
give birth to herself as a postmodernist.

Though along the way Girl and "Order and Flux" might re-Cooverize a descanted
pricksong or two. Wallaces more mature work no longer under-studies the
Rubik's cubism of pieces like "Quenby and Ola, Swede and Carl." On the
contrary, in stories like "Say Never," "John Billy," and "Here and There"
Wallace transcends the generics of homage by reinscribing the setups that let
Coover be Coover within story grids that work to provoke character instead of
just being characteristically provocative. Gone, or at least forcefully reined
in, are the obligatory algorithmics of the Coover style, that tendency to view
fiction as a quickstep of likelihoods high-stepped by fortuity and desire, the
slavish imitation of which has left many of today's younger writers awash in
paregoric of Cooverismo. In fact, Wallace's sendups of life lived in the
shadow of Jeopardy ("Little Expressionless Animals") or The David Letterman
Show ("My Appearance") are every bit as distant from Coover's meltdowns of
Casablanca and The Gold Rush in works like A Night at the Movies, or, You Must
Remember This as Coover's fictions are from the pummelings to low, middle, and
high culture administered by R. Crumb twenty-five years ago in the pages of
Zap Comics, which they superficially resemble. More often than not, the Coover
method is to nominate a she of cubistically pretzelized actantcies out of a
field of potential developments whose mutant derivation from an Ur-mythos
(such as spanking the maid or leaving a child alone with a baby-sitter) denies
any of them precedence within the schema of that particular fiction.

For Wallace, however, commandeering myths in order to play ironic games within
the interstices of determinisms imposed by their structures is not at all the
same thing as demythicizing myths by invading their structures and
commandeering their control centers. A timely analogue from virology helps
bring into focus the difference between first-generation postmodernism's
debunking of myths indispensable to the modernist project and the third
generation's of s debunking of their debunking of myth so as to reconstitute
the mythical as an esemplast having already internalized advanced tochnology
and virtual environments. While books like Barth's Chimera and Barthelme's The
Dead Father invaded the cells of myth in order to replicate en abime the
multiple ironies of their own self-reproduction, the fictions of Wallace,
Vollmann, and the Richard Powers of The Gold Bug Variations effect penetration
in order to transmute the very genetic material of the myths themselves. They
recognize that myth in our time is not the panoplied derangement of an
Achilles's tent or Circe's isle but rather the Jonah-fication of whaling
exemplified by the TV shows beamed, spelunker-like, into the Plato's Cave of
the global village.

In "Order and Flux in Northampton" the basic "plot" downloads much of what is
new about Wallace's most recent fictionalizing into a stylistics whose hard
copy has moved far beyond the Cooverismics, Barthematics, and Pynchonics of
first-generation postmodernisme. Unlike the setups of his more narrowly
focused pieces such as the title story of Girl and "Luckily the Account
Executive Knew CPR," "Order and Flux" is fielded through a schema that owes
less to plot than to a marriage of paradigm and syntagm. Within the plasmic
folds of a kind of supercoordinate Hilbert space, Wallace choreographs a dance
of distentions (not all of which appear as characters) that are for purposes
of the dance indistinguishable from the envelope of fatality with whose
topological surface they interface and from whose curvature and parallax they
fail to deduce their imprisonment in a paint-by-number Las Meninas that seems
drawn to scale by the Logico-Tractator himself. Set on or about June 1983,
"Flux" 's Hilbertized world of quantum-massachusetts folds out to include
virtually every other vector for which a dimension is assignable as direction
or momentum, and so is able to create a chain of Lorenzian attractors in such
diverse locales as Rock Springs, Wyoming, Tyoy, New York, Florence, Aldzana,
and Fullerton, California - all "places" where life is eerily universalized in
parallel to the erroneous comedy unfolding on the Northampton main stage. As a
paradigm/syntagm it poignantly triangulurs the exasperations of one Barry
Dingle, thirty-five-year-old man-on-the-ground of a "spotlessly managed
franchise, The Whole Thing Health Food Emporium ... located directly next to
Collective Copy on Northampton's arterial Great Awakening Avenue" (OFN 91). Of
course the juxtaposition of these two commercial enterprises so near the
jugular of today's post-hippie and unde-Reaganized over-the-counterculture is
hardly fortuitous. As with Wallace's literary predecessors Joyce, Barth,
Pynchon, and Coover, no detail in his fiction is ever fortuitous.

Employed at Collective Copy, next door to where Barry Dingle, "purveyor of
bean sprouts," does his thing, is Myrnaloy Trask, "for whom Dingle harbors ...
an immoderate love." Trask is variously described as a "trained Reproduction
Technician, unmarried woman, vegetarian, flower-child tinged faintly with
wither, overseer and editor of Announcement and Response at the
ten-foot-by-ten-foot communicative hub of a dizzying wheel of leftist
low-sodium aesthetes, a woman politically correct, active in relevant causes,
slatternly but not unerotic. ..." Completing the triangle is Barry's rival,
Don Megala, the man Myrnaloy Trask "has eyes only for," a "middle-aged
liberal" and "professional student" and "presently at work on his seventh and
potentially finest unfinished dissertation, an exhaustive study of Stephen
Dedalus's sublimaed oedipal necrophelia vis A vis Mrs. D. in Ulysses, an essay
tentatively tided |The Ineluctable Modality of the Ineluctably Modal.'" Which
serves to explain at least in part why Myrnaloy "has only the sketchiest
intuition that Barry Dingle even exists, next door" (OFN 91).

On top of this, we are asked to imagine a further triangulation, bordering on
parallax, beyond the mere human triangle whose sides have just been outlined,
establishing its outlying points esemplastically within a continuum of texts
coextensive with, but not contingent upon, the core text of Barry/Myrnaloy/Don
(which, if so desired, can be read linearly, though this is not necessarily
recommended). And, as suggested earlier, we are encouraged to conceive this
triangulation as being disposed within unpredisposable space - a space which
no topology dominates or molds dimensions to its particular shape or vectoral
agenda - indeed, a space wholly congenial to the one-act play of facts Wallace
has mounted on a grammaturgical stage fitted a-scenically, in arena style,
with three blind sides. It is these facts, one should hasten to point out,
that both figure on and configurationally activate the loom of coincidence on
which Wallace's narratological woofs warp and his equivocating back-and-forths
shuttle.

What facts? Why, those whose incontrovertibility, non-negotiability, and
unconvertibility Wittgenstein serves up within the connectable dots of his
"picture theory of meaning" and which figure so prominently in his Tractatus
as "atomic facts." This atomic factician asserts that a picture, insofar as it
is also a fact, is therefore "a model of reality and "like a scale applied to
reality." Further, given that "a picture depicts reality by representing a
possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts," it must
necessarily contain "the possibility of We sum of affairs which it
represents." And finally, the all-important proviso that "We could present
spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one
which contradicted the laws of geometry." Why are these facts so important?
Because facts are modal, and that modality is synonymous with the conditions
language imposes on that reality constructed according to pictures which
meaning assembles out of those same facts that make up the atomic structure of
the only world we know. Wallace likes this view of things because hi mirroring
the tradeoffs at the heart of Wittgen-stein's own philosophical career it
splits the problem of the solipsistic down the middle by salvaging knowledge
at the expense of a Cartesian knower and by denying private languages the role
of spoiler ceded them by the later, more mistycal Wittgenstein of the
Philosophical Investigations.

But Wallace's dog-wagging tale is also about love-objects "invested with all
the flected umbiguity that makes Romance itself possible" - an ambiguity that
thrives on flux and the humunculoidicities of immoderate love (OFN 97), no
doubt further Dingle-ized by diffusion, deflection, and distortion of the sort
that unpacks the Russian nesting dolls of nightmare that terrorize Mrs. Dingle
on the night of 14 June 1983, when she dreams that her husband, the king of
Ithaca (played by Nelson Eddy) is dreaming of her demise and that of her son,
the "finely sandaled" Barry D. on the night of 14 June 1983 B.C. - a regressus
ultimately to be diffused, deflected, and distorted polyphonically into the
anoptically "Telemachoid" resplendencies of Ulysses's dream of Joyce in a book
(dated 1922) about order and flux in a city called Dublin, the dearness and
dirtiness of which, having been "dreamt" in advance almost a millennium ago in
a symmetrical inversion involving Northampton, Mass. (in which the
"dulcimer-craeftig" Don Megala is cast as the advisor who tells the king of
Ithaca that what brought the plague that carried off both Mrs. Dingle and
Barry D. was nothing other than the king's dream itself) is grotesquely
reprised as if by a Saturday Night Live sketch in which guess who play a
Tristan and an Iseult whose dithyring Rambonics, far from bringing death and
mortal woe to the pinnacle of taste in this, Denis de Rougemont's and our
modern world, merely freeze its eternal antithesis within an instant's
burlesque frame. And it concerns parameciae in human saliva that make for the
true magnetic north in all their mediated plashings in direct opposition to
big toe-seeking inflammations of Eros. Thus, this: a hypertextual space across
which parbolas of actantcy can flit but for which no Marvin Minsky-style
"default assumptions" can be adduced. Envisioning this is not unlike trying to
picture Cartesian tennis being played without so much as a Malebranchian net.

Viewed narratologically, the trajectory of "Order and Flux" seems calibrated
at about Middle High Pynchon, but such calls are little more than ballpark
estimates. Don Webb, in reviewing Mark Jacobson's new novel Gojiro in American
Book Review, is so loath to proscribe the dismantling of originality by
up-and-coming writers that in approving self-mantling in Ur-styles considered
"classical," he all but invents writer-response criticism on poststructuralist
principles before the reader's very eyes:

For Mr. Jacobson to achieve his paean to life a workable style had to exist. I
realize that this speaks against the current call for originality, but books
do not need to be original in style. Classical poets always cast their works
in the appropriate style, and Pynchon-prose is the appropriate mode for the
current epic. It moves between consensus reality and stylized camp reality
effortlessly. It leaves the complicated goings-on of the real world whenever a
close-up focus is needed-and best of all it can just tell the reader what's
going on or spice up the flow with a few jokes.

For first-generation postmodernists like Italo Calvino - himself given to
wondering before his untimely death, "Why Read the Classics?" - the subtext of
such remarks might seem less a surrender to influence in the form of hero
worship Man a succumbing to influenza through a contagion of styles. But
Wallace is third generation, a fact that clearly emerges in the algorithmic
plotting of "Order and Flux," with its reflectively principled encoding of
truths elicited from certain axiom systems and rules of procedure able to
elicit further truths unrelated to those systems and procedures. As suggested
earlier, in at least some of the stories that make up Girl with Curious Hair
he is into quite different things than either the permutations of influence or
multiple mises en abime played on the mind's eye by a shattered- mirror.
Wallace, Volimann, and some of their contemporaries are busily rediscovering
the wheeling, if not the dealing, attendant upon plying the psychological
dimension in their fiction. This explains why the narrativities of the title
story "Girl with Curious Hair," in their determination to find a way out of
the seeing-round-corners narcopathology of the story's narrator, shift the
fulcrum of self-consciousness away from the sun-stricken heliotrope, Sick
Puppy. It also makes plain why the monologics - phase spaced-out to the max -
of John Billy, who, in the story bearing his name, implodes a responsibility
to "tell Simple Ranger how Chuck Nunn Junior done wronged the man that wronged
him and fleen to parts unguessed" (GCH 121) into a shrinking
universe-as-tall-tale that miniserially parallels the nebulous expansiveness
of a McMurtry's Lonesome Dove. Similarly, with the catechistic dissymmetrics
(dedicated to K. Godel) proffered by the connubially stalled respondent in
"Here and There" - and others deserving of broader mention than can be made of
them there.

At any rate, the atomic "facts" comprising Wallace's molecular narratives can
be made to seem unatomizably factual in context only if, as with reflection
principles, they aid in convincing us that they indeed provide valid ways of
arriving at what for the piece in question is a correspondence theory of
virtual truth linking the story's "axiom system" with the "rules of procedure"
that govern its discursivities narratologically. In fact, it was a sense of
deprivation over Wittgenstein's having doublelocked the door to a
reconciliation (which only he could have effected) between the dark inner
space of solipsism and the deprivatized shadowplay of endless noon in Plato's
Cave that gave rise to Wallace's belief that the second and more famous half
of the Viennese thinker's career, the post-tractatus revisionist period of
logical atom smashing in the Philosophical Investigations (1945-49; pub.
1953), represents a catastrophic loss to philosophy. All that the later works
managed to do was to trade the only real bullion ever secured in
post-Cartesian philosophy for the inflated paper of language games and
psycho-logical atomism. For Wallace's thoughts on Wittgenstein's "tragic
fall," see the interview with McCaffery above.)

Thus, the narrative game being played in the works under discussion revolves
around the problem of creating a private fictional world (theoretically
corresponding, more or less, to the truths dictated by God, were He a logical
atomist, which, despite quibbles that might arise within the hermeneutics of
conjectural atheism, He could well be) without at the same time creating a
private language of the sort anathematized by the Wittgenstein of the
Investigations and which eventually denied the Joyce of Finnegans Wake a gold
medal in the only Olympics that matters. In the RCF interview Wallace contends
that membership within hermeneutical circles can result in knowledge only of
what it is like to experience being within the bounds of such a community
itself, and never of the larger reality whose immanentizing center the
knowledge community is. The world "outside" will always remain the "world"
outside, no matter how "communicative" relations within that community become.

Consider the basic concatenation of events that, far from just populating a
Wallace story with data, actually nude up that story. The paronomasia is
crucial: nowhere in any of the pieces mentioned so far is the motor of
self-determination ever allowed to idle in any particular character's conative
driveway. For instance, Barry Dingle's passion for Myrnaloy Trask is in one
sense an erotomania fueled by runaway hormones, but in a different sense -
one, say, involving an erotomane able to step outside his erotomania and view
it non-erotomaniacally - it is anything but such an erotomania. This sort of
Turingesque two-step brings to mind Godel's theorem, in which the truth or
falsity of arithmetical propositions cannot be wrung out of a
self-describability lodged within a system of description itself incapable of
assimilating self into any coordinating predicate. But it also sets spinning
the peculiarly Boolean mysticism of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, in which atomic
facts head up a treatise in which luck is as absent as any trace of a
diverting conundrum: "The riddle does not exist," tractates the
Logico-Philosophicus.

"Order and Flux" begins under an injunction to supply enough atomic facts or
"Trask-data" to put Barry Dingle's "immoderate love" for Myrnaloy up on the
big screen. These data are further rounded out with dossier fodder documenting
Barry's impairment at the hands of his macrophobic mother. This has doomed him
to the "position of a man able to want without the disturbing option of ever
truly being able to have" (OFN 91, 96). Nor does the same factitiousness that
afflicts Barry's search for sexual peace fail to enfold Sick Puppy of "Girl"
up to his proverbials, since the brute and stubbom mindlessness by which his
existence, a triumph of luck and Reaganomics, has so far been maintained is
nothing but a vacuum left by the facts of a sustainable life in departing a
causeless loss. Much of that mindlessness reaches critical mass only through
sexual jumpstarting, a conscription of orality into the anaesthetized essays
of genital intercourse:

Unfortunately, even though I am one handsome dude and desirable on the part of
many girls throughout my school and life, my penis declines to become erect
when they want to commit the sexual act, and will only be erect if they
fellate me, and if they fellate me I wish to burn them with matches or my
lighter very much and most women dislike this event and are unhappy when
burned and thus are chicken to fellate me and only wish to commit the sexual
act. (GCH 72).

As William H. Gass once wrote in commenting on an especially well-turned
Barthelmean period, "it is impossible to overpraise such a sentence." The mix
here of Rolling Stone interview jargon and schizoid parataxis (common to
serial killers speaking viva voce and mob figures mouthing dialogue in films
like Bugsy and Hoffa) constitutes an edgy lead-in to a historically original
neo-trash phenomenon. It also alchemizes fact in such a way as to provide a
Sick Puppy too stoned to philosophize with a means of turning sex hassles of
the "stump Dr. Ruth" variety from heavy metal cliche into base gold.

So, too, in the realm of Dinglemania, where factologies lie like glaciers on
an emotional tundra landlocked by sea change and roiling with stasis. That
such Wittgensteinian reefs remain unnavigable by the port-leaning ship of
fools so improbably beached in "Order and Flux" amounts to Wallace's point as
well as his counterpoint. Having been invaded by a homunculoid love, Barry
Dingle "is, as it were, beside himself, in a state of utter emotional flux
whereby up and down, good and bad are as indistinguishable as right and left"
(OFN 96). A Dingle-an-sich in hot pursuit of the Dingle-ling-an-sich he pines
for completion by another, but this masks a fact at least as crucial to the
story's support system as the Godelian umbilical linking the affictive quo est
of Barry's toe to the inflictive quod est of his homunculoid love. Within
Wallace's Wittgensteinian schematic this dominating because most
particularized) atomic fact is that "cross-eyed Barry's" pining is
fundamentally "duplicitous" due to his unauthorized version of second sight;
this redoubled vision has, from 15 June 1961 (the day in Troy, New York, when
his two eyes, which had flirted with disaster like star-crossed lovers from
childhood on, finally and forever came together), consistently provided him
with a synoptic gospel whose good news parallax routinely deconstructs and
whose eight-eyed orthogonals he is determined to transcend via a liebes-toed
contusion of cur (his) and bitch (hers) at the feet of his very own beloved
Iseult-of-the-"delicate white hands" on the mayday aforementioned, 15 June
1983 (OFN 102). This last date assumes inipanance because (as any attentive
reader will instantly grasp) it is the twenty-second anniversary of Barry's
blindsiding at the hands of fate and the twentieth of his having first laid
eyes (albeit in a doubly triangulated stare: see below) on Myrnaloy Trask. But
it is also a mere calendar's tick from June 16th or Bloomsday, that singular
diurnal interval in 1904 during which a certain Dingle-like Dubliner by the
name of Bloom wanders like Tristan (a major backup myth in "Order and Flux")
from one Celticity to another, faithfully (or almost so) temporizing the
faithlessness (only skin deep) of his wife, the Myrnaloy Trask-like Molly,
whose rendezvous that afternoon with his sexual rival, the Don Megalaesque
Blazes Boylan, has brought him to focus his Odyssean wiles on the awful moment
of his moment's force: the desire to reclaim his riteful home and wrongful
bed, to yang, yet again, his well-worn yin in Ithaca.

This town is not, it should be noted, the one in New York state, which, like
Barry Dingle's and Myrnaloy Trask's Northampton, is a college town, which,
though unlike it, is closer to Troy, a town less given to gown and not all
that much further from Homer's Ithaca than is once towering Ilium, where
Ulysses made war, from the seat of his kingdom, where he made love. As far,
perhaps, as the Troy of Barry's youth, where the cross he now bears was first
hoisted onto his shoulders in the form of "thick angled lenses that catch and
reorganize the disordered doubleness of things into a unity that fuses at a
focused point several yards in front of Barry's own ruined apparatus," is from
the Northampton where he now resides and whose objects "appear always twice as
far away as they in fact are. Smaller and more distant. . . . So that," the
story's mediated voice goes on to descant, "Dingle has chosen ... between
doubleness and distance, between there being, for him, exactly twice or
exactly half as much as there really is" (OFN 96). (Hence Barry's long, doubly
triangulated stare, "as only the cross-eyed can stare," two years earlier
when, ma 15 June 198L while at work the Michelson-Morleyed image of Myrnaloy
Trask was bounced back at him from off the window of a Northampton Public
Transit Authority bus onto the colored glass of the storefront of The Whole
Thing Health Food Emporium which he happened to be looking through [OFN 92].)

A similar doubling and shrink-wrap redistancing may be noted in Wallace's
deliberate use of Ulyssean parallels and his sedulous aping of the sort of
pedantic overfastidiousness with which Stuart Gilbert's guide to Joyce's
masterbook has long been associated. Don Megala, the Mortimer Adler of
dissertations-in-progress, is said to have "at least one" copy of this
graduate student classic "under his arm" (OFN 105), and Wallace's point in
flashing this reference is to keep his story's Joycean refractions on the
beam. Consider, for example, the brief scene in the Collective Copy, which
from Dingle's point of view and ours, doubles as the Xeroxing establishment
that employs Myrnaloy Trask and as a hotbed of Aeolian circulation, "full of
the dry chemical wind of roaring copier and rattling automatic collator" (OFN
104). Here, the eye of the narrative, damping its aperture down to a binocular
anopticity nearly enough in sync with Dingle's own to make double or nothing a
redundancy, piggybacks on a flatbed of metalepsis to it's own dim view of
things, in this case how the "Cave of Winds" segment of Ulysses acquires an
eigenvalue relative to the eigenvector of the Collective Copy, one among many
such eigenvectors, the sum of which comprises the "observable," or the
eigenbasis of the observable (an eigenbasis being a set of vectors, such that
any arbitrary vector can be represented as a linear combination of those in
the set).

This meta-Ulyssean mock-up thus assumes - in keeping with its protagonist's
shrunken vision field of folk - the qualities of the very antithesis of "an
observable," becoming in fact (and by paronomasial flatlining) an-observable.
Indeed, Wallace's tale of erotic whoa tends to downplay sharpness of visual
detail to the low anoptic hum of a verbal diagram, almost as if its purpose
was to give a sense of how little the ableptical Joyce really saw when writing
Ulysses from 1914 to 1922. Wallace's power to make his reader see is evident
everywhere in Girl with Curious Hair, so there's no doubt that, for him at
least, Pound's metaphrasial homage to the poet of the Odyssey in his Cantos as
"blind, blind as a bat" triangulates the ophthal-malogocentricity of Joyce's
Homer in much the way Myrnaloy Trask's image is described as hawng caromed off
two blindsiding mirrors smack into the corner pocket of Barry's peripheralized
vision.

Thus, Wallace's tale (in which love is not the issue) reenacts the story by
which other lovers and their obsessions avoid being incarcerated in narratives
that would otherwise assure their deaths, were not the sole condition of their
mortality foreclosed by myths proclaiming their infinite empowerment to die in
prophetic retellings of Love prophesies foretold. How else explain the
gathering at the end of the story of synchronicities eigenstacked like cord
wood and yet knotted in love within the interval 11:50 to 11:57 A.M. EDT, 15
June 1983, which, we are informed, "finds a tiny percentage of the planet's
persons involved in a tiny percentage of the planet's various and ineluctably
modal situations" (OFN 115)? (Even the sodomistic daisy chain of gang rape
perpetrated on Dean Paul Doyle by the Eskew brothers, Ronnie and Boone, on the
floor of a crowded dormitory in Cell Block D, Arizona State Correctional
Facility, Florence, AZ, constitutes a loveknot of sorts. Which only goes to
prove what all the catalog rolling and calculated heartlessness tricked out at
the end of the story confirm, namely that when vice is versa-ed, one man's
poison can all too often (and unfairly) become another man's meat.) Or, how
account for the loveknot of other, antecedent tales only seemingly
intercalated at random with the Barry-Myrnaloy original and which may be seen
as dependently Dingle-dangle, catenary-style, from this lei of interrupted
lays? And even when the dispositional and predispositional paronomastics point
the other way - that is, toward the very mythos of the observable with which
Wallace's story is every which way preoccupied, it matters little to the human
propositions locked inside its phase space of spacey phases.

If the world is indeed "everything that is the case," it necessarily looks
endlessly down the barrel of its own self-delimiting Dasein; likewise, it
disposes of events with astonishing diffidence by disposing of them wherever
atomic facts go to die. For between the persistence of Wittgenstein's "picture
theory of meaning" ("Picture this" or its equivalent is an injunction which
the reader of "Order and Flux" is not infrequently put under by its narrator)
and the insistence of its logical framing metabolism that regulates sentences
internally according to the laws governing propositions such as those that led
the Wittgenstein of the pre-Tractatus Notebooks to declare that "|aRa' must
make sense if |aRb' makes sense" - between these two abnegational extremes
falls the shadow of the arti-factual, whose field of dominance is the there
and then, as opposed to the here and now. In "Flux"'s Northampton, "John
Billy"'s Minogue, Oklahoma, and "Girl" 's Irvine, California, no less than in
the Dresden, Chicago, or even Tralfamadore of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse
Five (1969), past is never prologue, but in a turnabout that hardly plays
fair, prologue ends up as past, thrust, as in a world of metafictional and
polymath-physics it must be, into a time warp of dissembling presence whose
simulacra mock for all eternity the recurrence of eternal recurrence. Or, to
put somewhat less of a spin on it, prologue appears as a past whose energies
remain frozen within the very same parenthetical frames as earlier enclosed
Slothropian metanarratives hungover with the Spenglerian [delta]t's and all
such screamings across the sky.

This might be a good moment to stop and ask just what Wallace is proposing as
an alternative to Pynchonics and the sort of density matrix the author of
Gravity's Rainbow was able to field in that unbelievably dense mother of a
book. A density matrix may be defined as a complex system in which many
quantum states are taken together to represent reality. When Pynchon employs
such a wodd processor in projecting a novel he has not left the realm of
mythmaking behind him; he has merely modulated its Joycean and Mannian
proclivities to another, more mathematically distant plane of abstraction.
Wallace rejects this as the pyramid scheme that it is and always has been. He
seems to feel that it's better to internalize the density matrices of the
original postmodernists and remetabolize them as both subject matter and
object lesson. As suggested earlier, Pynchon-prosaics are everywhere in
evidence in "Order and Flux," but subtly absorbed into an ophthalmologos in
which the spectacle of Pynchonics moving its slow thighs across the page is
more likely to trouble the sight than seriously affect the vision. Filtered as
it is through a mere twenty-seven pages of text, "Flux" is accommodated by a
matrix of complex systems sufficiently compacted to pass, if not for an
infinitely bot and dense dot, then certainly for a planisphere with multiple
bearings visible at all times. If its pinions of fact and struts of conjecture
avoid the sort of continuum rupture that Pynchon's later work does on, it is
because Wallace's propositional calculus deftly escapes being thrown for a
loop by feedback from its own theory.

Indeed, it seems never to have occurred to Pynchon to wonder in spite of
quantum mechanics whether his particular take on the postmodern take on
fiction, with its self-discounting silences, might not finally be
incommensurate with its dark-sided twin, the world of physics - specially
postmodern physics, where contiguous Hilbertized envelopes bump upendlessly
against one another and linguistic opacities like "unsolvable," "density,"
"parallel," and "serial" become impenetrable barriers rather than windows on
that ulterior world. Any choice of discourse risks entropicalization whenever
language contracts into a space whose flickering topologies wax figurative or
wanly wane. Which notation system will be of most use is a matter not of truth
but of whose noughtical inscriptions are in force and under what particular
whether watch. Also involved are force fields of a different nature: those
that determine whether the systems of language and sign or the systems of
formula and design will ultimately prevail. Of course, this is not anything
novelists or physicists can decide, for themselves or for others. What if all
fields, conceptual or representational, merely misrepresent one another's
"border writing" without realizing it?

Which, finally, in point of a subsequence of recorsi, lands us back at W. H.
Gass's original question: What would a literary physics be?

What it would not be is a literature of or about physics, either in the direct
way of a discourse on the history or ideas of physics, or the interworkings of
physicists, whether singly or collaboratively, effecting historic trajectories
of explanation, prediction, and control. Neither could it be a physics of
literature, which would be an absurdity on its face. As a dangling plethom of
misapplied linearities and functions such a hybrid would inevitably con-script
a dysfunctionality in dire contradiction to the correspondence (necessary to
any science) between reflected truth and the truth of reflection. This leaves,
it seems, only one conceivable alternative - the one which, as I have been
suggesting, Wallace has selected on occasion: physics in the form of a form of
writing radiant with an idealized clarity once thought synonymous with the
sort of sciencespeak that Houyhnhmns like the Huxleys, Aldous and Julian,
spoke and wrote, but now viewed, this time by Yahoos, as runoff from a stream
of consciousness beset by theory and by a praxis capable only fitfully of
being its own subject. As Wittgenstein surely recognized when tracking
thoughts he would later run to ground in the Tractatus, to write in this form
of a form is to court hubris. It entails being aware of the "complete
unclarity" of all the sentences that tend to gather (like the crush of oil,
oozed) at the mind's tip whenever anyone attempts to talk what is the case
down from its ledge of quanta and back into a cage of words.

Joseph Liouville, the unacknowledged legislator of narratological physics
proposed a theorem according to which phase-space volume does not change with
time-evolution. In the formulized formalisms of literary physics this means
that no matter how long the time span of a novel might be (whether measured in
terms of textual action or of active text), the phasespace within which the
work elaborates its own actantial algorithmics - in synaptic contradistinction
to Euclidean dottiness on the matter of points, the novel's "counter-point"
having magnitude but no location - remains constant. Postmodern fictional
space - broadly considered - is phase space; but the space in which Wallace
and the younger post-postmodernists choose to have fiction become operational
is sentence space -- a space that is, in every sense of the word, Hilbert
space. Roger Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind (Oxford University Press, 1989)
provides the basis for this when he describes single points in phase and
Hilbert space as follows: "A single point of phase space would be used to
represent the (classical) state of an entire physical system. In the quantum
theory, the appropriate analogous concept is that of Hilbert space. A single
point of Hilbert space now represents the aquantum state of an entire system."
And because "the most fundamental property of a Hilbert space is that it is
what is called a vector space - in fact, a complex vector space," that being
one in which "we are allowed to add together any two elements of the space and
obtain another such element" (ENM 257; italics the author's), it may not be
stretching things too far to imagine the semantico-grammatical elements of a
sentence as operating within a kind of complex vector space. To put it more
succinctly: first- and second-generation postmodernists build, whether in a
novel or a story, a fictional structure in phase space whose parts are only
configurable in terms of their inclusion in a whole; space, third-generation
writers like Wallace work in sentence or Hilbert space, wherein the entire
notion of overarching fictional structure is meaningless except in terms of
sentences whose "genetic material" must encode the DNA molecularity of the
fiction as a whole.

Yet, it must also be kept in mind that the dynamics at work in Wallace's
stories are not the only Hilbertian dynamics propinquitous to literary
sentencing. When, for example, in the story "Little Expressionless Animals"
Wallace has an associate of the TV showtalk magnate Merv Griffin register
character by plainly - or not so plainly - speaking out of it, what is
projected is not only splendid neo-Heideggerian parody, it is Hilbert
spaceyness pure and simple. The remark the Griffin aide-de-Camp makes to the
story's co-protagonist Faye Goddard - "The mystery of total data, that mystery
made a sort of antic, ontic self-perpetuation. We're talking fact sustaining
feeling, right through the change that inevitably attends all feeling, Faye"
(GCH 28) - eigenvaluatively Hilbertizes phase space as though it were
Wittgensteinian logical space, while at the same time opening the possibility
of the entire story being metonymized by this transmutation of
sententiousness.

The gag here is, at least in part, built around having Merv Griffin
phenomenologize droppings like "ontic" which, while vaguely suggestive of
"antic," a term to which it is not in any way homologous, still somehow
manages to be congruent with it on a free-associational level. Throughout all
his writing Wallace enjoys being free with those associations found milling
around the hub of the ontological. In "Order and Flux in Northampton" there is
mention made of "miraculous manipulations of primal human ontemes too primal
and too human even to be contemplated" (OFN 94), an "onteme" being presumably
a unit of emitted being. Likewise, Merv Griffin himself, here frontloaded as a
"character font' with We freedom to enter and leave the story's narrativity
frame (as well as determining the fate of its "typecasts"), proves that in
this text at least il n'y a pas de hors-Merv Griffin. But in his own person he
also proves something else. As a point of Hilbert space representing ad
finitum the "quantum state" of an entire narrative system, his indeterminacy
is then indistinguishable from the causeless effect and the effectless cause
of that state, which is now a story that has Merv Griffm in it but which
determines how it shall be read, from a point outside it, his ever shifting
cachet as a performance artist in late capitalist showbiz. (Though it is
tempting to adduce the same power to mediate an end run around the means of
cultural production to the other "real-life" characters in "Little
Expressionless Animals," such as the TV hosts of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune
Alex Trebek and Pat Sajak, their use in the story is in every sense "fair" and
merely reprivatizes what is already within the public domain.)

Such raids on Nouveau Kitsch by gimcrack "technicals" franchised by E. M.
Doctorow and Max Apple over a quarter of a century ago are scarcely new.
Indeed, David Letterman appears as a character in another Wallace story, "My
Appearance," from Girl with Curious Hair. But differences between the frames
broken by these two particular outtakes, though indistinguishable in context
from the surface of things fictional, are hardly superficial. "I'm always
stumped when critics regard references to popular culture in serious fiction
as some sort of avant-garde stratagem," Wallace confesses in his interview
with McCaffery. "In terms of the world I live in and try to write about, it's
inescapable. Avoiding any reference to the pop would mean either being
retrograde about what's |permissible' in serious art or else writing about
some other world." Postmodern irony having "become our environment," why not
use real names when adverting to the world of commerce and the media instead
of stooping to the sort of campy logo-centricity that Updike and other older
writers engage in whereby certain fast-food restaurants get called "Burger
Bliss" rather than "Burger King."

Why not, indeed. The obvious answer is that the canvas of proto-reality,
having become indistinguishable from the frame that contains it, is no longer
able to prevent fiction from reconfiguring the collage of icons that is itself
indistinguishable - postmodern irony having become our environment - from the
circumambient culture that sustains it. This iconic speculum also doubles as
the medium that permits us to view that no less factitious world whose
endlessly recycled representations include made-for-TV images of ourselves
being watched as we watch them, thus providing an echo chamber for our least
negotiable narcissisms. Escaping from this paralysis of irony and narcissism
is one of the main problems Wallace has found himself having to face as a
writer: how to spacewalk in the vergeless virtual totally unpunctuated Hilbert
space of the new post-scientific sensibility.

Post-scientific?

Yes - if by the term is meant collaborative rather than unicellular-heroic,
transempirical rather than Popperesque, cumulo-enactive rather than
linear-descriptive. "No longer devoted exclusively to knowing, knowledge, or
know-how" might be one way to encapsulate the post-scientific in opposition to
both Feyerabendistic (against method) and anti-feyerabendisfic (against
Against Methoa) mindsets. Nor is it in any way to be confused or conflated
with postmodernism or poststructuralism. These two no-longerquite-so-trendy
dyslexicologies once carved out insubstantial niches for themselves by
furnishing ways and means (though not necessarily the ways and means) by which
what is - or more often, what is not - might be reconscripted into an army of
metaphors and metonymies at least as mobile (and certainly newer) than the one
half-excoriated and half-embraced by Nietzsche in "On Truth and Lie in an
Extra-Moral Sense" (1873). As fully self-conscious theorias they clearly set
out to debug the collective pleroma of sociotronic mass intermediation with
literary-philosophical sounding kits somewhere between the reflex tester
(again, proposed by Nietzsche, in Twilight of the Idols, or, How One
Philosophizes with a Hammer [1888]) and the armamentarium of program
protectors with which computer virologists come equipped. Postmodern science
begins from the point of recognizing the need, as Stephen Toulmin writes in
The Return to Cosmology (1982), "to reinsert humanity into nature." The
post-scientific, on the other hand, involves a far different approach to
bricolage than the vision of either a Paul Feyerabend or a Gregory Bateson
allows for. It requires a hands-on algorithmics for actually doing realily in
a sense akin to the old sixties cachet of "doing drugs," but it also combines
a counterintuitive reserve with an open field commitment to what the pianist
David Sudnow calls "ways of the hand" or "organization of improvised conduct,"
instead of settling for well worn Taosing rods urging us to play reality by
ear.

How, then, might "Girl" 's fractalizations of Sick Puppy's discombobulating
mind in a prose as sweatlessly unconscionable as it is unconscionably
sweatless properly - or even improperly - speaking, be considered
"post-scientific"? Or, for that matter, the emergency room narrativistics of
"Luckily the Account Representative Knew CPR"? Or the Dinglemania so fractally
ophthalmologized by Wallace in "Order and Flux in Northampton"? And why should
such a cumbersome new concept, laid on the culture like an enormous mustard
plaster, be of any interest to literary theory already up to its canines in
dogs that won't hunt?

Let me attempt to answer that by deproblematizing the issues involved.
Post-scientific writing no longer accepts either the single-author theory of
literary conspiracy or the conspiratorial model of "non-subjective" impersonal
authorship favored by poststructuralists, post-Marxists, postmodernists, and
post-post-all of the above. It bathes (rather than frames) the act of writing
in the light of a wholly collaborative dissolution of alterities and the
culture wars they have historically given rise to. The aim of the scientific
has always been to control those parameters that are indispensable to the
exercise of domination. Science as we know it has thrived because it has
co-opted all responsibly envisionable canons of authority and the perquisites
of legitimacy that go with them. Post-scientific writing releases the literary
from its longstanding obligation to oppose the scientific, to play "pseudo-"
to its overarching power to collapse all articulative distinctions between
"state" as a noun and "state" as a verb. It overturns the traditionally
imposed hegemony of the temporal over the spatial and returns writing (after
long exile) to its dream of fields - open rather than closed (as along the
Flaubert-Joyce-Beckett axis); fractal rather than linear-dynamic; integrative
rather than discontinuous and catabolic. Though superficially comparable with
the plush upholsteries of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry and related congeries,
post-scientific writing may perhaps best be understood as "discourse art"
grated on to a root stock of chaos theory and Nietzschean "somantics," which
is a spinoff from semantics and cognitive science, having been filtered
through some recent and highly innovative thinking about "the body in the
mind."

To suggest where this leaves postmodern fiction it is necessary to review what
such fiction has been thought to be by the industry that has marketed
consensus regarding the value of its products with the untempered enthussiasm
of a Honda Corporation touting the merits of a very different type of accord
during the last twenty years or so. This accord is nearly always referred back
to the same few appraisers of the "postmodern condition" - Lyotard,
Baudrillard, and Jameson jump to mind - who view postmodern writers generally
as opting to problematize reality in their works rather than settling for an
illusionistic consensus of what it is.

But of course it could be asked, When has fiction not "problematized" reality?
Even "novelists of manners" from Austen to Waugh (keeping to just the Anglo-
in Anglo-American writing) have fictionalized their problematizations of it by
appending to their testaments to will the empowering codicils of proprietary
subjectivity without which any "reality" is but a rationalist's forgery or an
irrationalist's fraud. "A mourning process has now been completed,"
Jean-Francois Lyotard opined sunnily in The Postmodern Condition. "Most people
have lost the nostalgia for the lost narrative." That was warmly aired in
1984, an auspicious year for singleminded ascensions into doublethink. Five
years before the collapse of the Great Wall of communism in central and
eastern Europe; eight years before the resurgence of "post-Marxist" socialism
in the same countries that had only recenty rhapsodized about the promise of
"post-socialist politics." One grand narrative that turned out less lost than
just misplaced by the likes of Lyotard and others eager to hop on the garishly
painted wagon of postmodernism was, of all things, modernism. Not the
Enlightenment modernism of a Jurgen Habermas, but the aesthetic modernism of
an Erich Auerbach, whose final chapters in Mimesis (1953) conceive narrative
as a crucible in which even so discontinuous and fragmentary a subjective
experience as Proust's can be reconstituted by "analogy" (Proust's term) into
a unity.

At least some of Wallace's shorter fiction can be seen as exemplary acts of
post-scientific writing because they erase the factitious dualism that has
plagued the modernism/postmodernism chimera by abolishing the pain in the neck
that is vaceabb; to the "pineal connection" underlying its disembodied and
mindless interdifferentiality. Wallace's "Flux," for example, is a tale of
Love Syntagmaticized that takes a grammar of lore and energizes it to drive a
syntax of eigenvectors only dimly contingent upon such signifying chains as
socioreality/rhizomatics (Guattari), economimesis/difference (Derrida), or
chronotopicality/dialogics (Bakhtin). The linkage system "interseparating"
Barry Dingle, Myrnaloy Trask, and Don Megala (not to mention the host of named
and unnamed supernumeraries who inhabit the Berkeleyan/Berkeleyan pleroma of
Northampton/Amherst, Massachusetts) exceeds reality without transcending it
because it offers no megalomaniacal "grand narrative" of the sort that Don
Megala hoped to find in Stuart Gilbert's misguided tour of Ulysses. Fiction in
the age of science (coincidental with the novel's maximum solvency) has always
posted "the world according to . . ." in a ledger of double entry transfers of
knowledge from the carnal to the ever expanding database that, in direct
succession from Samuel Richardson to his less-talented postmodern epigone John
Irving, has rendered "real life" accessible through an essentially Garped
economy of means. Like the underheated economy that is present-day America's
discontent, such fiction has flourished on a regimen of borrow and spend,
ignoring with singleminded determination the mounting deficit of relevance and
belief it could no longer bank or bank upon. Northampton's ancestral kvetch,
Solomon Stoddard, set the tone for this screming beneath the sky well back in
the eighteenth century, when, as the narratormentor to the reader doing "Order
and Flux" reports, the dentist/ theologian and deliverer of some stemwinding
Great-awakening jeremiads in the years 1711-17 "foretold the world's cold and
imminent end, characterizing that end as a kind of grim entropic stasis
already harbinged by, among other portents: poor nutrition and its attendant
moral and dental decay; the increasing infertility of modern woman; the rise
of the novel; the Great Awakening itself" (OFN 94).

The example of Thomas Pynchon provides a useful contrast to Wallace's
post-scientific approach. Pynchon, of course, is still very much alive, but
remains very much a horseman of this chiropractical apocalypse; which is also
to say that by now it's impossible to come upon the word entropic without
recalling just whose gold lies buried at the foot of gravity's rainbow. Yet,
for all its postmodern panache and skill at inventorying the century's
paranoid inventions, no shimmer of the post-scientific gleams from the pages
of this encyclopedic master. His Vineland is not all that removed from the
sort of world that can be pieced together from Rev. Stoddard's X rays of the
mouth of Hell.

But not so the recent writings of his inheritor and not-so secret sharer of
influenza's anxiety, David Foster Wallace. In several of his best stories
modernism and postmodernism are underwritten with a currency that projects a
semblance of solvency, even while its value continues to drain away behind the
scenes of its own commercially staged renascence. If all that Wallace has set
a-shimmer doesn't yet gleam, his work nevertheless proves the writing on the
wall for any number of his glitzier contemporaries. This wall has been waiting
patiently to receive such writings - and those of his post-postmodern
contemporaries - if and when what is still wanting in it weighs in with the
balanced fullness of its findings, and ours.

WHEN POET AND CRITIC RANDALL JARRELL DEfined the novel as a long narrative
that tends to have something wrong with it, he did not mean printer's errors.
But that was precisely what concerned David Foster Wallace when he read the
proofs of his 1,079-page Infinite Jest. "There were about 712,000 typos, and I
freaked," says the 33-year-old author from his home in Bloomington, Illinois,
where he is an associate professor of English at Illinois State. All but one
of the mistakes were fixed--a line adjustment that no one but the author could
have picked up. All the more reason to think the correction sheet that
accompanied review copies was a gag.

Wrong. Wallace may look like a carefree Frisbee player with his ponytail and
head hankie, but he has the soul of an old-fashioned inkstained wretch. As an
undergraduate at Amherst, he specialized in mathematical logic and played on
the tennis team until, as he puts it, "I wanted to be in the library all the
time, and the coach was not amused."

Wallace's first novel, The Broom of the System (1987), was a mind stretcher
that suggested the influence of Thomas Pynchon and others. His second offering
was a short-story collection, Girl with Curious Hair, published in 1989. It
was the year Infinite Jest began taking shape. "In a time of unprecedented
comfort and pleasure and ease, there was a real sort of sadness about the
country," Wallace recalls. "I wanted to do something about it, about America
and what our children might think of us. That's one reason for setting the
book 18 years ahead."

The literary scene's latest word warrior battles one vice. "I have a terrible
time with nicotine," he admits. For his lungs' sake, Wallace alternates
between smoking and chewing tobacco, with a caveat: "I made a deal with myself
that if I ever fired up a cigarette with chewing tobacco in my mouth, I was
going to check into a hospital." Good idea, but not until after the book tour.

Mr. John Ziegler, thirty-seven, late of Louisville's WHAS, is now on the air,
"Live and Local," from 10:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. every weeknight on southern
California's KFI, a 50,000-watt megastation whose hourly ID and Sweeper,
designed by the station's Imaging department and featuring a gravelly basso
whisper against licks from Ratt's 1984 metal classic "Round and Round," is
"KFI AM-640, Los Angeles--More Stimulating Talk Radio." This is either the
eighth or ninth host job that Mr. Ziegler's had in his talk-radio career, and
far and away the biggest. He moved out here to LA over Christmas--alone,
towing a U-Haul--and found an apartment not far from KFI's studios, which are
in an old part of the Koreatown district, near Wilshire Center.

The John Ziegler Show is the first local, nonsyndicated late-night program
that KFI has aired in a long time. It's something of a gamble for everyone
involved. Ten o'clock to one qualifies as late at night in southern
California, where hardly anything reputable's open after nine.

It is currently right near the end of the program's second segment on the
evening of May 11, 2004, shortly after Nicholas Berg's taped beheading by an
al-Qaeda splinter in Iraq. Dressed, as is his custom, for golf, and wearing a
white-billed cap w/corporate logo, Mr. Ziegler is seated by himself in the
on-air studio, surrounded by monitors and sheaves of Internet downloads. He is
trim, clean-shaven, and handsome in the somewhat bland way that top golfers
and local TV newsmen tend to be. His eyes, which off-air are usually flat and
unhappy, are alight now with passionate conviction. Only some of the studio's
monitors concern Mr. Z.'s own program; the ones up near the ceiling take
muted, closed-caption feeds from Fox News, MSNBC, and what might be C-SPAN. To
his big desk's upper left is a wall-mounted digital clock that counts down
seconds. His computer monitors' displays also show the exact time.

Across the soundproof glass of the opposite wall, another monitor in the
Airmix room is running an episode of The Simpsons, also muted, which both the
board op and the call screener are watching with half an eye.

Pendent in front of John Ziegler's face, attached to the same type of hinged,
flexible stand as certain student desk lamps, is a Shure-brand broadcast
microphone that is sheathed in a gray foam filtration sock to soften popped
p's and hissed sibilants. It is into this microphone that the host speaks:

"And I'll tell you why--it's because we're better than they are."

A Georgetown B.A. in government and philosophy, scratch golfer, former TV
sportscaster, possible world-class authority on the O.J. Simpson trial, and
sometime contributor to MSNBC's Scarborough Country, Mr. Ziegler is referring
here to America versus what he terms "the Arab world." It's near the end of
his "churn," which is the industry term for a host's opening monologue, whose
purpose is both to introduce a show's nightly topics and to get listeners
emotionally stimulated enough that they're drawn into the program and don't
switch away. More than any other mass medium, radio enjoys a captive
audience--if only because so many of the listeners are driving--but in a major
market there are dozens of AM stations to listen to, plus of course FM and
satellite radio, and even a very seductive and successful station rarely gets
more than a five or six percent audience share.

"We're not perfect, we suck a lot of the time, but we are better as a people,
as a culture, and as a society than they are, and we need to recognize that,
so that we can possibly even begin to deal with the evil that we are facing."

When Mr. Z.'s impassioned, his voice rises and his arms wave around (which
obviously only those in the Airmix room can see). He also fidgets, bobs
slightly up and down in his executive desk chair, and weaves. Although he must
stay seated and can't pace around the room, the host does not have to keep his
mouth any set distance from the microphone, since the board op, 'Mondo
Hernandez, can adjust his levels on the mixing board's channel 7 so that Mr.
Z.'s volume always stays in range and never peaks or fades. 'Mondo, whose
price for letting outside parties hang around Airmix is one large bag of
cool-ranch Doritos per evening, is an immense twenty-one-year-old man with a
ponytail, stony Mesoamerican features, and the placid, grandmotherly eyes
common to giant mammals everywhere. Keeping the studio signal from peaking is
one of 'Mondo's prime directives, along with making sure that each of the
program's scheduled commercial spots is loaded into Prophet and run at just
the right time, whereupon he must confirm that the ad has run as scheduled in
the special Airmix log he signs each page of, so that the station can bill
advertisers for their spots. 'Mondo, who started out two years ago as an
unpaid intern and now earns ten dollars an hour, works 7:00-1:00 on weeknights
and also board-ops KFI's special cooking show on Sundays. As long as he's kept
under forty hours a week, which he somehow always just barely is, the station
is not obliged to provide 'Mondo with employee benefits.

The Nick Berg beheading and its Internet video compose what is known around
KFI as a "Monster," meaning a story that has both high news value and
tremendous emotional voltage. As is SOP in political talk radio, the emotions
most readily accessed are anger, outrage, indignation, fear, despair, disgust,
contempt, and a certain kind of a apocalyptic glee all of which the Nick Berg
thing's got in spades. Mr. Ziegler, whose program is in only its fourth month
at KFI, has been fortunate in that 2004 has already been chock-full of
Monsters--Saddam's detention, the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Scott Peterson
murder trial, the Greg Haidl gang-rape trial, and preliminary hearings in the
rape trial of Kobe Bryant. But tonight is the most angry, indignant,
disgusted, and impassioned that Mr. Z.'s gotten on-air so far, and the
consensus in Airmix is that it's resulting in some absolutely first-rate talk
radio.

John Ziegler, who is a talk-radio host of unflagging industry, broad general
knowledge, mordant wit, and extreme conviction, makes a particular specialty
of media criticism. One object of his disgust and contempt in the churn so far
has been the U.S. networks' spineless, patronizing decision not to air the
Berg videotape and thus to deny Americans "a true and accurate view of the
barbarity, the utter depravity, of these people" Even more outrageous, to Mr.
Z., is the mainstream media's lack of outrage about Berg's taped murder versus
all that same media's hand-wringing and invective over the recent photos of
alleged prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, which he views as a clear
indication of the deluded, blame-America-first mentality of the U.S. press. It
is an associated contrast between Americans' mortified response to the Abu
Ghraib photos and reports of the Arab world's phlegmatic reaction to the Berg
video that leads to his churn's climax, which is that we are plainly,
unambiguously better than the Arab world--whereupon John Ziegler invites
listeners to respond if they are so moved, repeats the special mnemonic KFI
call-in number, and breaks for the :30 news and ads, on time to the second, as
'Mondo takes ISDN feed from Airwatch and the program's associate producer and
call screener, Vince Nicholas--twenty-six and hiply bald--pushes back from his
console and raises both arms in congratulation, through the glass.

It goes without saying that there are all different kinds of stimulation.
Depending on one's politics, sensitivities, and tastes in argumentation, it is
not hard to think of objections to John Ziegler's climactic claim, or at least
of some urgent requests for clarification. Like: Exactly what and whom does
"the Arab world" refer to? And why are a few editorials and man-on-the-street
interviews sufficient to represent the attitude and character of a whole
diverse region? And why is al-Jazeera's showing of the Berg video so awful if
Mr. Z. has just castigated the U.S. networks for not showing it? Plus, of
course, what is "better" supposed to mean here? More moral? More diffident
about our immorality? Is it not, in our own history, pretty easy to name some
Berg-level atrocities committed by U.S. nationals, or agencies, or even
governments, and approved by much of our populace? Or perhaps this: Leaving
aside whether John Ziegler's assertions are true or coherent, is it even
remotely helpful or productive to make huge, sweeping claims about some other
region's/culture's inferiority to us? What possible effect can such remarks
have except to incite hatred? Aren't they sort of irresponsible?

It is true that no one on either side of the studio's thick window expresses
or even alludes to any of these objections. But this is not because Mr. Z.'s
support staff is stupid, or hateful, or even necessarily on board with
sweeping jingoistic claims. It is because they understand the particular codes
and imperatives of large-market talk radio. The fact of the matter is that it
is not John Ziegler's job to be responsible, or nuanced, or to think about
whether his on-air comments are productive or dangerous, or cogent, or even
defensible. That is not to say that the host would not defend his "we're
better"--strenuously--or that he does not believe it's true. It is to say that
he has exactly one on-air job, and that is to be stimulating. An obvious
point, but it's one that's often overlooked by people who complain about
propaganda, misinformation, and irresponsibility in commercial talk radio.
Whatever else they are, the above-type objections to "We're better than the
Arab world" are calls to accountability. They are the sort of criticisms one
might make of, say, a journalist, someone whose job description includes being
responsible about what he says in public. And KFI's John Ziegler is not a
journalist--he is an entertainer. Or maybe it's better to say that he is part
of a peculiar, modern, and very popular type of news industry, one that
manages to enjoy the authority and influence of journalism without the stodgy
constraints of fairness, objectivity, and responsibility that make trying to
tell the truth such a drag for everyone involved. It is a frightening
industry, though not for any of the simple reasons most critics give.

Distributed over two walls of KFI's broadcast studio, behind the monitors and
clocks, are a dozen promotional KFI posters, all in the station's eye-catching
Halloween colors against the Sweeper's bright white. On each poster, the word
"stimulating" is both italicized and underscored. Except for the door and
soundproof window, the entire studio is lined in acoustic tile with strange
Pollockian patterns of tiny holes. Much of the tile is grayed and decaying,
and the carpet's no color at all; KFI has been in this facility for nearly
thirty years and will soon be moving out. Both the studio and Airmix are kept
chilly because of all the electronics. The overhead lights are old inset
fluorescents, the kind with the slight flutter to them; nothing casts any sort
of shadow. On one of the studio walls is also pinned the special set of
playing cards distributed for the invasion of Iraq, these with hand-drawn Xs
over the faces of those Baathists captured or killed so far. The great
L-shaped table that Mr. Z. sits at nearly fills the little room; it's got so
many coats of brown paint on it that the tabletop looks slightly humped. At
the L's base is another Shure microphone, used by Ken Chiampou of 3:00-7:00's
John & Ken, its hinged stand now partly folded up so that the mike hangs like
a wilted flower. The oddest thing about the studio is a strong scent of
decaying bananas, as if many peels or even whole bananas were rotting in the
room's wastebaskets, none of which look to have been emptied anytime recently.
Mr. Ziegler, who has his ascetic side, drinks only bottled water in the
studio, and certainly never snacks, so there is no way he is the source of the
banana smell.

It is worth considering the strange media landscape in which political talk
radio is a salient. Never before have there been so many different national
news sources--different now in terms of both medium and ideology. Major
newspapers from anywhere are available online; there are the broadcast
networks plus public TV, cable's CNN, Fox News, CNBC, et al., print and Web
magazines, Internet bulletin boards, The Daily Show, e-mail newsletters,
blogs. All this is well known; it's part of the Media Environment we live in.
But there are prices and ironies here. One is that the increasing control of
U.S. mass media by a mere handful of corporations has--rather
counterintuitively--created a situation of extreme fragmentation, a
kaleidoscope of information options. Another is that the ever increasing
number of ideological news outlets creates precisely the kind of relativism
that cultural conservatives decry, a kind of epistemic free-for-all in which
"the truth" is wholly a matter of perspective and agenda. In some respects all
this variety is probably good, productive of difference and dialogue and so
on. But it can also be confusing and stressful for the average citizen. Short
of signing on to a particular mass ideology and patronizing only those
partisan news sources that ratify what you want to believe, it is increasingly
hard to determine which sources to pay attention to and how exactly to
distinguish real information from spin.

This fragmentation and confusion have helped give rise to what's variously
called the "meta-media" or "explaining industry." Under most classifications,
this category includes media critics for news dailies, certain high-end
magazines, panel shows like CNN's Reliable Sources, media-watch blogs like
instapundit.com and talkingpointsmemo.com, and a large percentage of political
talk radio. It is no accident that one of the signature lines Mr. Ziegler
likes to deliver over his opening bumper music at :06 is "... the show where
we take a look at the news of the day, we provide you the facts, and then we
give you the truth." For this is how much of contemporary political talk radio
understands its function: to explore the day's news in a depth and detail that
other media do not, and to interpret, analyze, and explain that news.

[Graphic omitted]Which all sounds great, except of course "explaining" the
news really means editorializing, infusing the actual events of the day with
the host's own opinions. And here is where the real controversy starts,
because these opinions are, as just one person's opinions, exempt from strict
journalistic standards of truthfulness, probity, etc., and yet they are often
delivered by the talk-radio host not as opinions but as revealed truths,
truths intentionally ignored or suppressed by a "mainstream press" that's
"biased" in favor of liberal interests. This is, at any rate, the rhetorical
template for Rush Limbaugh's program, on which most syndicated-and
large-market-political talk radio is modeled, from ABC's Sean Hannity and Talk
Radio Network's Laura Ingraham to G. G. Liddy, Rusty Humphries, Michael
Medved, Mike Gallagher, Neal Boortz, Dennis Prager, and, in many respects, Mr.
John Ziegler.

KFI AM-640 carries Rush Limbaugh every weekday, 9:00 A.M. to noon, via live
ISDN feed from Premiere Radio Networks, which is one of the dozen syndication
networks that own talk-radio shows so popular that it's worth it for local
stations to air them even though it costs the stations a portion of their spot
load. The same goes for Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who's based in southern
California and used to-broadcast her syndicated show-from KFI until the
mid-nineties, when Premiere built its own LA facility and was able to offer
Schlessinger more-sumptuous digs. Dr. Laura airs M-F from noon to 3:00 on KFI,
though her shows are canned and there's no live feed. Besides 7:00-10:00
P.M.'s Phil Hendrie (another KFI host whose show went into national
syndication, and who now has his own private dressing room and studio over at
Premiere), the only other weekday syndication KFI uses is Coast to Coast With
George Noory, which covers and analyzes news of the paranormal throughout the
wee hours.

Whatever the social effects of talk radio or the partisan agendas of certain
hosts, it is a fallacy that political talk radio is motivated by ideology. It
is not. Political talk radio is a business, and it is motivated by revenue.
The conservatism that dominates today's AM airwaves does so because it
generates high Arbitron ratings, high ad rates, and maximum profits.

Radio has become a more lucrative business than most people know. Throughout
most of the past decade, the industry's revenues have increased by more than
10 percent a year. The average cash-flow margin for major radio companies is
40 percent, compared with more like 15 percent for large TV networks; and the
mean price paid for a radio station has gone from eight to more than thirteen
times cash flow. Some of this extreme profitability, and thus the structure of
the industry, is due to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which allows radio
companies to acquire up to eight stations in a given market and to control as
much as 35 percent of a market's total ad revenues. The emergence of huge,
dominant radio conglomerates like Clear Channel and Infinity is a direct
consequence of the '96 Act (which the FCC, aided by the very conservative D.C.
Court of Appeals, has lately tried to make even more permissive). And these
radio conglomerates enjoy not just substantial economies of scale but almost
unprecedented degrees of business integration.

Example: Clear Channel Communications Inc. now owns KFI AM-640, plus two other
AM stations and five FMs in the Los Angeles market. It also owns Premiere
Radio Networks. It also owns the Airwatch subscription news/traffic service.
And it designs and manufactures Prophet, KFI's operating system, which is
state-of-the-art and much too expensive for most independent stations. All
told, Clear Channel currently owns some 1,200 radio stations nationwide, one
of which happens to be Louisville, Kentucky's WHAS, the AM talk station from
which John Ziegler was fired, amid spectacular gossip and controversy, in
August of 2003. Which means that Mr. Ziegler now works in Los Angeles for the
same company that just fired him in Louisville, such that his firing now
appears--in retrospect, and considering the relative sizes of the Louisville
and LA markets--to have been a promotion. All of which turns out to be a
strange and revealing story about what a talk-radio host's life is like.

For obvious reasons, critics of political talk radio concern themselves mainly
with the programs' content. Talk station management, on the other hand, tends
to think of content as a subset of personality, of how stimulating a given
host is. As for the hosts--ask Mr. Ziegler off-air what makes him good at his
job, and he'll shrug glumly and say, "I'm not really all that talented. I've
got passion, and I work really hard." Taken so for granted that nobody in the
business seems aware of it is something that an outsider, sitting in Airmix
and watching John Ziegler at the microphone, will notice right away. Hosting
talk radio is an exotic, high-pressure gig that not many people are fit for,
and being truly good at it requires skills so specialized that many of them
don't have names.

[Graphic omitted]To appreciate these skills and some of the difficulties
involved, you might wish to do an experiment. Try sitting alone in a room with
a clock, turning on a tape recorder, and starting to speak into it. Speak
about anything you want--with the proviso that your topic, and your opinions
on it, must be of interest to some group of strangers who you imagine will be
listening to the tape. Naturally, in order to be even minimally interesting,
your remarks should be intelligible and their reasoning sequential--a listener
will have to be able to follow the logic of what you're saying-which means
that you will have to know enough about your topic to organize your statements
in a coherent way. (But you cannot do much of this organizing beforehand; it
has to occur at the same time you're speaking. Plus, ideally, what you're
saying should be not just comprehensible and interesting but compelling,
stimulating, which means that your remarks have to provoke and sustain some
kind of emotional reaction in the listeners, which in turn will require you to
construct some kind of identifiable persona for yourself--your comments will
need to strike the listener as coming from an actual human being, someone with
a real personality and real feelings about whatever it is you're discussing.
And it gets even trickier: You're trying to communicate in real time with
someone you cannot see or hear responses from; and though you're communicating
in speech, your remarks cannot have any of the fragmentary, repetitive,
garbled qualities of real interhuman speech, or speech's ticcy unconscious
"umm"s or "you know's, or false starts or stutters or long pauses while you
try to think of how to phrase what you want to say next. You're also, of
course, denied the physical inflections that are so much a part of spoken
English--the facial expressions, changes in posture, and symphony of little
gestures that accompany and buttress real talking. Everything unspoken about
you, your topic, and how you feel about it has to be conveyed through pitch,
volume, tone, and pacing. The pacing is especially important: it can't be too
slow, since that's low-energy and dull, but it can't be too rushed or it will
sound like babbling. And so you have somehow to keep all these different
imperatives and structures in mind at the same time, while also filling
exactly, say, eleven minutes, with no dead air and no going over, such that at
10:46 you have wound things up neatly and are in a position to say, "KFI is
the station with the most frequent traffic reports. Alan LaGreen is in the KFI
Traffic Center" (which, to be honest, Mr. Z. sometimes leaves himself only
three or even two seconds for and has to say extremely fast, which he can
always do without a flub). So then, ready: go.

It's no joke. See for example the John Ziegler Show's producer, Emiliano
Limon, who broke in at KFI as a weekend overnight host before moving across
the glass:

"What's amazing is that when you get new people who think that they can do a
talk-radio program, you watch them for the first time. By three minutes into
it, they have that look on their face like, 'Oh my God, I've got ten minutes
left. What am I going to say?' And that's what happened to me a lot. So you
end up talking about yourself [which, for complex philosophical reasons, the
producer disapproves of], or you end up yammering." Emiliano is a large, very
calm and competent man in his mid-thirties who either wears the same black LA
Times T-shirt every day or owns a whole closetful of them. He was pulled off
other duties to help launch KFI's experimental Live and Local evening show, an
assignment that obviously involves working closely with Mr. Z., which Emiliano
seems to accept as his karmic punishment for being so unflappable and easy to
get along with. He laughs more than everyone else at KFI put together.

"I remember one time, I just broke after five minutes, I was just done, and
they were going, 'Hey, what are you doing, you have another ten minutes!' And
I was like, 'I don't know what else to say!' And that's what happens. For
those people who think 'Oh, I could do talk radio,' well, there's more to it.
A lot of people can't take it once they get that taste of, you know, 'Geez, I
gotta fill all this time and sound interesting?'

"Then, as you keep on doing it over the days, there's something that becomes
absolutely clear to you. You're not really acting on the radio. It's you. If
no one really responds and the ratings aren't good, it means they don't like
you." Which is worth keeping very much in mind.

An abiding question: Who exactly listens to political talk radio? Arbitron
Inc. and some of its satellites can help measure how many are listening for
how long and when, and they provide some rough age data and demographic specs.
A lot of the rest is guesswork, and Program Directors don't like to talk about
it.

From outside, though, one of the best clues to how a radio station understands
its audience is spots. Which commercials it runs, and when, indicate how the
station is pitching its listeners' tastes and receptivities to sponsors In how
often particular spots are repeated lie clues to the length of time the
station thinks people are listening, how attentive it thinks they are, etc.
Specific example: Just from its spot load, we can deduce that KFI trusts its
audience to sit still for an extraordinary amount of advertising. An average
hour of the John Ziegler Show consists of four program segments: :06-:17,
:23-:30, :37-:46, and :53-:00, or thirty-four minutes of Mr. Z. actually
talking. Since KFI's newscasts are never more than ninety seconds, and since
quarterly traffic reports are always bracketed by "live-read" spots for
Traffic Center sponsors, that makes each hour at least 40 percent ads; the
percentage is higher if you count Sweepers for the station and promos for
other KFI shows. And this is the load just on a local program, one for which
the Clock doesn't have to be split with a syndicator.

It's not that KFI's unaware of the dangers here. Station management reads its
mail, and as Emiliano Limon puts it, "If there's one complaint listeners
always have, it's the spot load." But the only important issue is whether all
the complaints translate into actual listener behavior. KFFs spot load is an
instance of the kind of multivariable maximization problem that M.B.A.
programs thrive on. It is obviously in the station's financial interest to
carry just as high a volume of ads as it can without hurting ratings-the
moment listeners begin turning away from KFI because of too many commercials,
the Arbitron numbers go down, the rates charged for ads have to be reduced,
and profitability suffers. But anything more specific is, again, guesswork.
When asked about management's thinking here, or whether there's any particular
formula KFI uses to figure out how high a spot load the market will bear, Ms.
Bertolucci will only smile and shrug as if pleasantly stumped: "We have more
commercials than we've ever had, and our ratings are the best they've ever
been."

[Graphic omitted]How often a particular spot can run over and over before
listeners just can't stand it anymore is something else no one will talk
about, but the evidence suggests that KFI sees its audience as either very
patient and tolerant or almost catatonically inattentive. Canned ads for local
sponsors like Robbins Bros. Jewelers, Sit 'n Sleep Mattress, and the Power
Auto Group play every couple hours, 24/7, until one knows every hitch and
nuance. National saturation campaigns for products like Cortislim vary things
somewhat by using both endorsements and canned spots. Pitches for caveat
emptor-type nostrums like Avacor (for hair loss), Enzyte ("For natural male
enhancement!"), and Altovis ("Helps fight daily fatigue!") often repeat once
an hour through the night. As of spring '04, though, the most frequent and
concussive ads on KFI are for mortgage and home-refi companies--Green Light
Financial, HMS Capital, Home Field Financial, Benchmark Lending. Over and
over. Pacific Home Financial, U.S. Mortgage Capital, Crestline Funding,
Advantix Lending. Reverse mortgages, negative amortization, adjustable rates,
APR, FICO ... where did all these firms come from? What were these guys doing
five years ago? Why is KFI's audience seen as so especially ripe and ready for
refi? Betterloans.com, lendingtree.com, Union Bank of California, on and on
and on.

Emiliano Limon's "It's you" seems true to an extent. But there is also the
issue of persona, meaning the on-air personality that a host adopts in order
to heighten the sense of a real person behind the mike. It is, after all,
unlikely that Rush Limbaugh always feels as jaunty and confident as he seems
on the air, or that Howard Stern really is deeply fascinated by porn starlets
every waking minute of the day. But a host's persona is not the same as
outright acting. For the most part, it's probably more like the way we are all
slightly different with some people than we are with others.

In some cases, though, the personas are more contrived and extreme. In the
slot preceding Mr. Z.'s on KFI, for instance, is the Phil Hendrie Show, which
is actually a cruel and complicated kind of meta-talk radio. What happens
every night on this program is that Phil Hendrie brings on some wildly
offensive guest--a man who's leaving his wife because she's had a mastectomy,
a Little League coach who advocates corporal punishment of players, a retired
colonel who claims that females' only proper place in the military is as
domestics and concubines for the officers-and first-time or casual listeners
will call in and argue with the guests and (not surprisingly) get very angry
and upset. Except the whole thing's a put-on. The guests are fake, their
different voices done by Hendrie with the aid of mike processing and a
first-rate board op, and the show's real entertainment is the callers, who
don't know it's all a gag--Hendrie's real audience, which is in on the joke,
enjoys hearing these callers get more and more outraged and sputtery as the
"guests" yank their chain. It's all a bit like the old Candid Camera if the
joke perpetrated over and over on that show were convincing somebody that a
loved one had just died. So obviously Hendrie-whose show now draws an
estimated one million listeners a week-lies on the outer frontier of radio
persona.

A big part of John Ziegler's on-air persona, on the other hand, is that he
doesn't have one. This may be just a function of all the time he's spent in
the abattoir of small-market radio, but in Los Angeles it plays as a canny and
sophisticated meta-radio move. Part of his January introduction to himself and
his program is "The key to the John Ziegler Show is that I am almost
completely real. Nearly every show begins with the credo 'This is the show
where the host says what he believes and believes what he says.' I do not make
up my opinions or exaggerate my stories simply to stir the best debate on that
particular broadcast."

Though Mr. Z. won't ever quite say so directly, his explicit I-have-no-persona
persona helps to establish a contrast with weekday afternoons' John Kobylt,
whose on-air voice is similar to Ziegler's in pitch and timbre. Kobylt and his
sidekick Ken Chiampou have a hugely popular show based around finding stories
and causes that will make white, middle-class Californians feel angry and
disgusted, and then hammering away at these stories/causes day after day.
Their personas are what the LA Times calls "brash" and Chiampou himself calls
"rabid dogs," which latter KFI has developed into the promo line "The Junkyard
Dogs of Talk Radio." What John & Ken really are is professional oiks. Their
show is credited with helping jumpstart the '03 campaign to recall Governor
Gray Davis, although they were equally disgusted by most of the candidates who
wanted to replace him (q.v. Kobylt: "If there's anything I don't like more
than politicians, it's those wormy little nerds who act as campaign handlers
and staff ... We just happened to on our own decide that Davis was a rotting
stool that ought to be flushed"). In '02, they organized a parade of SUVs in
Sacramento to protest stricter vehicle-emissions laws; this year they spend at
least an hour a day attacking various government officials and their
spokesholes for failing to enforce immigration laws and trying to bullshit the
citizens about it; and so on. But the John & Ken Show's real specialty is
gruesome, high-profile California trials, which they often cover on-site,
Kobylt eschewing all PC pussyfooting and legal niceties to speak his mind
about defendants like 2002's David Westerfield and the current Scott Peterson,
both "scumbags that are guilty as sin." The point is that John Kobylt
broadcasts in an almost perpetual state of affronted rage; and, as more than
one KFI staffer has ventured to observe off the record, it's unlikely that any
middle-aged man could really go around this upset all the time and not drop
dead. It's a persona, in other words, not exactly fabricated but certainly
exaggerated ... and of course it's also demagoguery of the most classic and
unabashed sort.

But it makes for stimulating and profitable talk radio. As of Arbitron's
winter' 04 Book, KFI AM-640 has become the No. 1 talk station in the country,
beating out New York's WABC in both Cume and AQH for the coveted 25-54
audience. KFI also now has the second highest market share of any radio
station in Los Angeles, trailing only hip-hop giant KPWR. In just one year,
KFI has gone from being the eighteenth to the seventh top-billing station in
the country, which is part of why it received the 2003 News/Talk Station of
the Year Award from Radio and Records magazine. Much of this recent success is
attributed to Ms. Robin Bertolucci, the Program Director brought in from
Denver shortly after Clear Channel acquired KFI, whom Mr. Z. describes as "a
real superstar in the business right now." From all reports, Ms. Bertolucci
has done everything from redesigning the station's ID and Sweeper and sound
and overall in-your-face vibe to helping established hosts fine-tune their
personas and create a distinctively KFI-ish style and 'tude for their shows.

Every Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Bertolucci meets with John Ziegler to review
the previous week and chat about how the show's going. The Program Director's
large private office is located just off the KFI prep room (where Mr. Z.'s own
office is a small computer table with a homemade THIS AREA RESERVED FOR JOHN
ZIEGLER taped to it). Ms. B. is soft-spoken, polite, unpretentious, and almost
completely devoid of moving parts. Here is her on-record explanation of the
Program Director's role w/r/t the John Ziegler Show:

"It's John's show. He's flying the airplane, a big 747. What I am, I'm the
little person in the control tower. I have a different perspective--"

"I have no perspective!" Mr. Z. interrupts, with a loud laugh, from his seat
before her desk.

"--which might be of value. Like, 'You may want to pull up because you're
heading for a mountain:" They both laugh. It's an outrageous bit of
understatement: nine months ago John Ziegler's career was rubble, and Ms. B.
is the only reason he's here, and she's every inch his boss, and he's nervous
around her--which you can tell by the way he puts his long legs out and leans
back in his chair with his hands in his slacks' pockets and yawns a lot and
tries to look exaggeratedly relaxed.

The use of some esoteric technical slang occasions a brief Q & A on how
exactly Aribitron works, while Mr. Z. joggles his sneaker impatiently. Then
they go over the past week. Ms. B. gently chides the new host for not hitting
the Greg Haidl trial harder, and for usually discussing the case in his show's
second hour instead of the first. Her thrust: "It's a big story for us. It's
got sex, it's got police, class issues, kids running amok, video, the courts,
and who gets away with what. And it's in Orange County." When Mr. Ziegler
(whose off-air method of showing annoyance or frustration is to sort of hang
his head way over to one side) protests that both Bill Handel and John & Ken
have already covered the story six ways from Sunday every day and there is no
way for him to do anything fresh or stimulating with it, Ms. B. nods slowly
and responds: "If we were KIIS-FM, and we had a new Christina Aguilera song,
and they played it heavy on the morning show and the afternoon show, wouldn't
you still play it on the evening show?" At which Mr. Z. sort of lolls his head
from side to side several times--"All right. I see your point. All right"--and
on tonight's (i.e., May 19's) program he does lead with and spend much of the
first hour on the latest Haidl developments.

By way of post-meeting analysis, it is worth noting that a certain assumption
behind Ms. B.'s Christina Aguilera analogy--namely, that a criminal trial is
every bit as much an entertainment product as a Top 40 song--was not
questioned or even blinked at by either participant. This is doubtless one
reason for KFI's ratings eclat--the near total conflation of news and
entertainment. It also explains why KFFs twice-hourly newscasts (which are
always extremely short, and densely interwoven with station promos and
live-read ads) concentrate so heavily on lurid, tabloidish stories. Post-Nick
Berg, the station's newscasts in May and early June tend to lead with
child-molestation charges against local clerics and teachers, revelations in
the Peterson and Haidl trials, and developments in the Kobe Bryant and Michael
Jackson cases. With respect to Ms. Bertolucci's on-record description of KFFs
typical listener--"An information-seeking person that wants to know what's
going on in the world and wants to be communicated to in an interesting,
entertaining, stimulating sort of way"--it seems fair to observe that KFI
provides a peculiar and very selective view of what's going on in the world.

[Graphic omitted]Ms. B.'s description turns out to be loaded in a number of
ways. The role of news and information versus personal and persona-driven
stuff on the John Ziegler Show, for example, is a matter that Mr. Z. and his
producer see very differently. Emiliano Limon, who's worked at the station for
over a decade and believes he knows its audience, sees "two distinct eras at
KFI. The first was the opinion-driven, personal, here's-my-take-on-things era.
The second is the era we're in right now, putting the information first."
Emiliano refers to polls he's seen indicating that most people in southern
California get their news from local TV newscasts and Jay Leno's monologue on
the Tonight show. "We go on the presumption that the average driver, average
listener, isn't reading the news the way we are. We read everything." In fact,
this voracious news-reading is a big part of Emiliano's job. He is, like most
talk-radio producers, a virtuoso on the Internet, and he combs through a daily
list of sixty national papers, 'zincs, and blogs, and he believes that his and
KFI's main function is to provide "a kind of executive news summary" for busy
listeners. In a separate Q & A, though, Mr. Ziegler's take on the idea of his
show's providing news is wholly different: "We're trying to get away from
that, actually. The original thought was that this would be mostly an
informational show, and now we're trying to get a little more toward
personality" ... which, since Mr. Z. makes a point of not having a special
on-air persona, means more stuff about himself, John Ziegler--his experiences,
his resume, his political and cultural outlook and overall philosophy of life.

If we're willing to disregard the complicating precedents of Joe Pyne and Alan
Burke, then the origins of contemporary political talk radio can be traced to
three phenomena of the 1980s. The first of these involved AM music stations'
getting absolutely murdered by FM, which could broadcast music in stereo and
allowed for much better fidelity on high and low notes. The human voice, on
the other hand, is mid-range and doesn't require high fidelity. The eighties'
proliferation of talk formats on the AM band also provided new careers for
some music deejays e.g., Don Imus, Morton Downey Jr.--whose chatty personas
didn't fit well with FM's all-about-the-music ethos.

The second big factor was the repeal, late in Ronald Reagan's second term, of
what was known as the Fairness Doctrine. This was a 1949 FCC rule designed to
minimize any possible restrictions on free speech caused by limited access to
broadcasting outlets. The idea was that, as one of the conditions for
receiving an FCC broadcast license, a station had to "devote reasonable
attention to the coverage of controversial issues of public importance," and
consequently had to provide "reasonable, although not necessarily equal"
opportunities for opposing sides to express their views. Because of the
Fairness Doctrine, talk stations had to hire and program symmetrically: if you
had a three-hour program whose host's politics were on one side of the
ideological spectrum, you had to have another long-form program whose host
more or less spoke for the other side. Weirdly enough, up through the
mid-eighties it was usually the U.S. right that benefited most from the
Doctrine. Pioneer talk syndicator Ed McLaughlin, who managed San Francisco's
KGO in the 1960s, recalls that "I had more liberals on the air than I had
conservatives or even moderates for that matter, and I had a hell of a time
finding the other voice."

The Fairness Doctrine's repeal was part of the sweeping deregulations of the
Reagan era, which aimed to liberate all sorts of industries from government
interference and allow them to compete freely in the marketplace. The old,
Rooseveltian logic of the Doctrine had been that since the airwaves belonged
to everyone, a license to profit from those airwaves conferred on the
broadcast industry some special obligation to serve the public interest.
Commercial radio broadcasting was not, in other words, originally conceived as
just another for-profit industry; it was supposed to meet a higher standard of
social responsibility. After 1987, though, just another industry is pretty
much what radio became, and its only real responsibility now is to attract and
retain listeners in order to generate revenue. In other words, the sort of
distinction explicitly drawn by FCC Chairman Newton Minow in the
1960s--namely, that between "the public interest" and "merely what interests
the public"-no longer exists.

More or less on the heels of the Fairness Doctrine's repeal came the West
Coast and then national syndication of The Rush Limbaugh Show through Mr.
McLaughlin's [EFM Media.] Limbaugh is the third great progenitor of today's
political talk radio partly because he's a host of extraordinary,
once-in-a-generation talent and charisma-bright, loquacious, witty, complexly
authoritative--whose show's blend of news, entertainment, and partisan
analysis became the model for legions of imitators. But he was also the first
great promulgator of the Mainstream Media's Liberal Bias idea. This turned out
to be a brilliantly effective rhetorical move, since the MMLB concept
functioned simultaneously as a standard around which Rush's audience could
rally, as an articulation of the need for right-wing (i.e., unbiased) media,
and as a mechanism by which any criticism or refutation of conservative ideas
could be dismissed (either as biased or as the product of indoctrination by
biased media). Boiled way down, the MMLB thesis is able both to exploit and to
perpetuate many conservatives' dissatisfaction with extant media sources--and
it's this dissatisfaction that cements political talk radio's large and loyal
audience.

In the best Rush Limbaugh tradition, Mr. Ziegler takes pride in his on-air
sense of humor. His media criticism is often laced with wisecracks, and he
likes to leaven his show's political and cultural analyses with timely ad-lib
gags, such as "It's maybe a good thing that Catholics and Muslims don't tend
to marry. If they had a kid, he'd grow up and then, what, abuse some child and
then blow him up?" And he has a penchant for comic maxims ("Fifty percent of
all marriages are confirmed failures, while the other fifty percent end in
divorce"; "The female figure is the greatest known evidence that there might
be a God, but the female psyche is an indication that this God has a very sick
sense of humor') that he uses on the air and then catalogues as "Zieglerisms"
on his KFI Web site.

Mr. Z. can also, when time and the demands of prep permit, go long-form. In
his program's final hour for May 22, he delivers a mock commencement address
to the Class of 2004, a piece of prepared sit-down comedy that is worth
excerpting, verbatim, as a sort of keyhole into the professional psyche of Mr.
John Ziegler:
   Class of 2004, congratulations on graduation ... I wish to let you
   in on a few secrets that those of you who are not completely
   brain-dead will eventually figure out on your own, but, if you
   listen to me, will save a lot of time and frustration. First of
   all, most of what you have been taught in your academic career is
   not true. I am not just talking about the details of history that
   have been distorted to promote the liberal agenda of academia. I am
   also referring to the big-picture lessons of life as well. The sad
   truth is that contrary to what most of you have been told, you
   cannot do or be anything you want. The vast majority of you ...
   will-be absolutely miserable in whatever career you choose or are
   forced to endure. You will most likely hate your boss because they
   will most likely be dumber than you think you are, and they will
   inevitably screw you at every chance they get ... The boss will not
   be the only stupid person you encounter in life. The vast majority
   of people are much, much dumber than you have ever been led to
   believe. Never forget this. And just like people are far dumber than
   you have been led to believe, they are also far more dishonest than
   anyone is seemingly willing to admit to you. If you have any doubt
   as to whether someone is telling you the truth, it is a safe bet to
   assume that they are lying to you ... Do not trust anyone unless you
   have some sort of significant leverage over him or her and they know
   that you have that leverage over them. Unless this condition exists,
   anyone--and I mean anyone-can and probably will stab you in the back.

That is about one sixth of the address, and for the most part it speaks for
itself.

One of many intriguing things about Mr. Ziegler, though, is the contrast
between his deep cynicism about backstabbing and the naked, seemingly
self-destructive candor with which he'll discuss his life and career. This
candor becomes almost paradoxical in Q & As with an outside correspondent, a
stranger whom Mr. Z. has no particular reason to trust at those times when he
winces after saying something and asks that it be struck from the record. As
it happens, however, nearly all of what follows is from an autobiographical
time-line [volunteered by John Ziegler in late May '04 over a very large
medium-rare steak. Especially interesting is the time-line's mixture of raw
historical fact and passionate editorial opinion, which Mr. Z. blends so
seamlessly that one really can believe he discerns no difference between them.

1967-1989: Mr. John Ziegler grows up in suburban Philadelphia, the elder son
of a financial manager and a homemaker. All kinds of unsummarizable evidence
indicates that Mr. Z. and his mother are very close. In 1984, he is named High
School Golfer of the Year by the Bucks County Courier Times. He's also a
three-year golf letterman at Georgetown, where his liberal arts studies turn
out to be "a great way to prepare for a life of being unemployed, which I've
done quite a bit of."

1989-1995: Mr. Z.'s original career is in local TV sports. He works for
stations in and around Washington DC, in Steubenville OH, and finally in
Raleigh NC. Though sports news is what he's wanted to do ever since he was a
little boy, he hates the jobs: "The whole world of sports and local news is so
disgusting ... local TV news is half a step above prostitution."

1994-1995: Both personally and professionally, this period constitutes a dark
night of the soul for John Ziegler. Summer '94: O.J. Simpson's ex-wife is
brutally murdered. Fall '94: Mr. Ziegler's mother is killed in a car crash.
Winter '95: During his sportscast, Mr. Z. makes "an incredibly tame joke about
O.J. Simpson's lack of innocence" w/r/t his wife's murder, which draws some
protest from Raleigh's black community. John Ziegler is eventually fired from
WLFL because the station "caved in to Political Correctness." The whole nasty
incident marks the start of (a) Mr. Z.'s deep, complex hatred for all things
PC, and (b) "my history with O.J." He falls into a deep funk, decides to give
up sports broadcasting, "pretty much gave up on life, actually." Mr. Z. spends
his days watching the O.J. Simpson trial on cable television, often sitting
through repeat broadcasts of the coverage late at night; and when O.J. is
finally acquitted, "I was nearly suicidal." Two psychiatrist golf buddies talk
him into going on antidepressants, but much of the time O.J. is still all Mr.
Ziegler can think and talk about. "It got so bad--you'll find this funny--at
one point I was so depressed that it was my goal, assuming that he'd be
acquitted and that [O.J.'s] Riviera Country Club wouldn't have the guts to
kick him out, that I was going to become a caddy at Riviera, knock him off,
and see whether or not [a certain lawyer Mr. Z. also played golf with, whose
name is here omitted] could get me off on jury nullification. That's how
obsessed I was." The lawyer/golfer/friend's reaction to this plan is not
described.

[Graphic omitted]Late 1995: Mr. Z. decides to give life and broadcasting
another shot. Figuring that "maybe my controversial nature would work better
on talk radio," he takes a job as a weekend fill-in host for a station in
Fuquay-Varina NC--"the worst talk-radio station on the planet ... to call the
station owner a redneck was insulting to rednecks"--only to be abruptly fired
when the station switches to an automated Christian-music format.

Early 1996: "I bought, actually bought, time on a Raleigh talk-radio station"
in order to start "putting together a Tape," although Mr. Z. is good enough on
the air that they soon put him on as a paid host. What happens, though, is
that this station uses a certain programming consultant, whose name is being
omitted--"a pretty big name in the industry, who [however] is a snake, and, I
believe, extremely overrated--and he at first really took a shine to me, and
then told me, told me, to do a show on how I got fired from the TV job, and I
did the show," which evidently involves retelling the original tame O.J. joke,
after which the herpetic consultant stands idly by as the station informs Mr.
Z. that "'We're done with you, no thank you, which was another blow.

1996-1997: Another radio consultant recommends Mr. Z. for a job at WWTN, a
Nashville talk station, where he hosts an evening show that makes good Book
and is largely hassle-free for several months. Of his brief career at WWTN,
the host now feels that "I kind of self-destructed there, actually, in
retrospect. I got frustrated with management. I was right, but I was stupid as
well." The trouble starts when Tiger Woods wins the 1997 Masters. As part of
his commentary on the tournament, Mr. Z. posits on-air that Tiger constitutes
living proof of the fact that "not all white people are racists." His
supporting argument is that "no white person would ever think of Tiger as a
nigger," because whites draw a mental distinction "between people who just
happen to be black and people who act like niggers." His reason for
broadcasting the actual word "nigger"? "This all goes back to O.J. I hated the
fact that the media treated viewers and listeners like children by saying
'Mark Fuhrman used the N-word.' I despised that, and I think it gives the word
too much power. Plus there's the whole hypocrisy of how black people can use
it and white people can't. I was young and naive and thought I could stand on
principle." As part of that principled stand, Mr. Z. soon redeploys the
argument and the word in a discussion of boxer Mike Tyson, whereupon he is
fired, "even though there was very little listener reaction." As Mr. Z.
understands it, the reason for his dismissal is that "a single black employee
complained," and WWTN's parent, "a lily-white company," feared that it was
"very vulnerable" to a discrimination lawsuit.

1998-1999: Mr. Z. works briefly as a morning fill-in at Nashville's WLAC,
whose studios are right across the street from the station that just fired
him. From there, he is hired to do overnights at WWDB, an FM talk station in
Philadelphia, his home town. There are again auspicious beginnings ... "except
my boss, [the RD. who hired him], is completely unstable and ends up punching
out a consultant, and gets fired. At that point I'm totally screwed-I have
nobody who's got my back, and everybody's out to get me." Mr. Z. is suddenly
fired to make room for syndicated raunchmeister Tom Leykis, then is quickly
rehired when listener complaints get Leykis's program taken off the air ...
then is retired a week later when the station juggles its schedule again. Mr.
Z. on his time at WWDB: "I should have sued those bastards."

Q: So what exactly is the point of a host's having a contract if the station
can evidently just up and fire you whenever they feel like it?

A: "The only thing a contract's worth in radio is how much they're going to
pay you when they fire you. And if they fire you 'For Cause,' then they don't
have to pay you anything."

2000: John Ziegler moves over to WIP, a famous Philadelphia sports-talk
station. "I hated it, but I did pretty well. I can do sports, obviously, and
it was also a big political year." But there is both a general problem and a
specific problem. The general problem is that "The boss there, [name omitted],
is an evil, evil, evil, evil man. If God said, 'John, you get one person to
kill for free,' this would be the man I would kill. And I would make it
brutally painful." The specific problem arises when "Mike Tyson holds a press
conference, and calls himself a nigger. And I can't resist--I mean, here I've
gotten fired in the past for using the word in relation to a person who calls
himself that now. I mean, my God. So I tell the story [of having used the word
and gotten fired for it] on the air, but I do not use the N-word--I spell thee
N-word, every single time, to cover my ass, and to also make a point of the
absurdity of the whole thing. And we get one, one, postcard, from a total
lunatic black person--misspellings, just clearly a lunatic. And [Mr. Z.'s boss
at WIP] calls me in and says, 'John, I think you're a racist.' Now, first of
all, this guy is a racist, I mean he is a real racist. I am anything but a
racist, but to be called that by him just made my blood boil. I mean, life's
too short to be working overnights for this fucking bastard." A day or two
later Mr. Z. is fired, For Cause, for spelling the N-word on-air.

Q: It sounds like you've got serious personal reasons for disliking Political
Correctness.

A: "Oh my God, yes. My whole life has been ruined by it. I've lost
relationships, I can't get married, I can't have kids, all because of
Political Correctness. I can't put anybody else through the crap I've been
through I can't do it."

2001: While writing freelance columns for the Philadelphia Inquirer and
Philadelphia Daily News, Mr. Ziegler also gets work at a small
twenty-four-hour Comcast cable-TV network in Philly, where he's a writer and
commentator on a prime-time issues-related talk show. Although Comcast is "an
evil, evil, evil company, [which] created that network for the sole purpose of
giving blowjobs to politicians who vote on Comcast legislation," Mr. Z.
discovers that "I'm actually really good at talk TV. I was the best thing that
ever happened to this show. I actually ended up winning an Emmy, which is
ironic." There are, however, serious and irresolvable problems with a female
producer on the show, the full story of which you are going to be spared
(mainly because of legal worries).

2002: John Ziegler is hired as the mid-morning host at Clear Channel's WHAS in
Louisville, which Arbitron lists as the fifty-fifth largest radio market in
the U.S. According to a local paper, the host's "stormy, thirteen-month tenure
in Louisville was punctuated by intrigue, outrage, controversy and
litigation." According to John Ziegler, "The whole story would make a great
movie--in fact, my whole life would make a great movie, but this in particular
would make a great movie." Densely compressed synopsis: For several quarters,
Mr. Z.'s program is a great success in Louisville. "I'm doing huge numbers--in
one Book I got a fifteen share, which is ridiculous." He is also involved in a
very public romance with one Darcie Divita, a former LA Lakers cheerleader who
is part of a morning news show on the local Fox TV affiliate. The relationship
is apparently Louisville's version of Ben & J.Lo, and its end is not amicable.
In August '03, prompted by callers' questions on his regular "Ask John
Anything" feature, Mr. Z. makes certain on-air comments about Ms. Divita's
breasts, underwear, genital grooming, and libido. Part of the enduring
controversy over John Ziegler's firing, which occurs a few days later, is
exactly how much those comments and/or subsequent complaints from listeners
and the Louisville media had to do with it. Mr. Z. has a long list of reasons
for believing that his P.D. was really just looking for an excuse to can him.
As for all the complaints, Mr. Z. remains bitter and perplexed: (1) "The
comments I made about Darcie's physical attributes were extremely positive in
nature"; (2) "Darcie had, in the past, volunteered information about her
cleavage on my program"; (3) "I've gone much further with other public figures
without incident ... I mocked [Kentucky Governor] Paul Patton for his
inability to bring Tina Conner to orgasm, [and] no one from management ever
even mentioned it to me."

John Ziegler on why he thinks he was hired for the Live and Local job by KFI:
"They needed somebody "available.'" And on the corporate logic behind his
hiring: "It's among the most bizarre things I've ever been involved in. To
simultaneously be fired by Clear Channel and negotiate termination in a market
where I had immense value and be courted by the same company in a market where
I had no current value is beyond explicable."

Mr. Z. on talk radio as a career: "This is a terrible business. I'd love to
quit this business." On why, then, he accepted KFI's offer: "My current
contract would be by far the toughest for them to fire me of anyplace I've
been."

Compared with many talk-radio hosts, John Ziegler is unusually polite to
on-air callers. Which is to say that he doesn't yell at them, call them names,
or hang up while they're speaking, although he does get frustrated with some
calls. But there are good and bad kinds of frustration, stimulation-wise.
Hence the delicate art of call screening. The screener's little switchboard
and computer console are here in the Airmix room, right up next to the studio
window.

JZS Producer Emiliano Limon: "There are two types of callers. You've got your
hard-core talk-radio callers, who just like hearing themselves on-air"---these
listeners will sometimes vary the first names and home cities they give the
screener, trying to disguise the fact that they've been calling in night after
night--"and then there are the ones who just, for whatever reason, respond to
the topic." Of these latter a certain percentage are wackos, but some wackos
actually make good on-air callers. Assoc. prod. and screener Vince Nicholas:
"The trick is knowing what kooks to get rid of and what to let through. People
that are kooky on a particular issue--some of these Zig likes; he can bust on
them and have fun with them. He likes it."

Vince isn't rude or brusque with the callers he screens out; he simply becomes
more and more laconic and stoned-sounding over the headset as the person rants
on, and finally says, "Whoa, gotta go." Especially obnoxious and persistent
callers can be placed on Hold at the screener's switchboard, locking up their
phones until Vince decides to let them go. Those whom the screener lets
through enter a different, computerized Hold system in which eight callers at
a time can be kept queued up and waiting, each designated on Mr. Z.'s monitor
by a different colored box displaying a first name, city, one-sentence summary
of the caller's thesis, and the total time waiting. The host chooses,
cafeteria-style, from this array.

In his selections, Mr. Z. has an observable preference for female callers.
Emiliano's explanation: "Since political talk radio is so white male-driven,
it's good to get female voices in there." It turns out that this is an
industry convention; the roughly 50-50 gender mix of callers one hears on most
talk radio is because screeners admit a much higher percentage of female
callers to the system.

[Graphic omitted]One of the last things that Emiliano Limon always does before
airtime is to use the station's NexGen Audio Editing System to load various
recorded sound bites from the day's broadcast news onto a Prophet file that
goes with the Cut Sheet. This is a numbered list of bites available for
tonight's John Ziegler Show, of which both Mr. Z. and 'Mondo get a copy. Each
bite must be precisely timed. It is an intricate, exacting process of editing
and compilation, during which Mr. Z. often drums his fingers and looks
pointedly at his watch as the producer ignores him and always very slowly and
placidly edits and compresses and loads and has the Cut Sheet ready at the
very last second. Emiliano is the sort of extremely chilled-out person who can
seem to be leaning back at his station with his feet up on the Airmix table
even when he isn't leaning back at all. He's wearing the LA Times shirt again.
His own view on listener calls is that they are "overrated in talk radio,"
that they're rarely all that cogent or stimulating, but that hosts tend to be
"overconcerned with taking calls and whether people are calling. Consider:
This is the only type of live performance with absolutely no feedback from the
audience. It's natural for the host to key in on the only real-time response
he can get, which is the calls. It takes a long time with a host to get him to
forget about the calls, to realize the calls have very little to do with the
wider audience."

Vince, meanwhile, is busy at the screener's station. A lady with a heavy
accent keeps calling in to say that she has vital information: a Czech
newspaper has revealed that John Kerry is actually a Jew, that his grandfather
changed his distinctively Jewish surname, and that this fact is being
suppressed in the U.S. media and must be exposed. Vince finally tries putting
her on punitive Hold, but her line's light goes out, which signifies that the
lady has a cell phone and has disengaged by simply turning it off. Meaning
that she can call back again as much as she likes, and that Vince is going to
have to get actively rude. 'Mondo's great mild eyes rise from the board:
"Puto, man, what's that about?" Vince, very flat and bored: "Kerry's a Jew."
Emiliano: "Another big advent is the cell phone. Before cells you got mostly
homebound invalids calling in. [Laughs] Now you get the driving invalid."

Historically, the two greatest ratings periods ever for KFI AM-640 have been
the Gray Davis gubernatorial recall and the O.J. Simpson trial. Now, in early
June '04, the tenth anniversary of the Ron Goldman/Nicole Brown Simpson
murders is approaching, and O.J. starts to pop up once again on the cultural
radar. And Mr. John Ziegler happens to be more passionate about the O.J.
Simpson thing than maybe any other single issue, and feels that he "know[s]
more about the case than anyone not directly involved;' and is able to be
almost unbearably stimulating about O.J. Simpson and the utter indubitability
of his guilt. And the confluence of the murders' anniversary, the case's
tabloid importance to the nation and business importance to KFI, and its deep
personal resonance for Mr. Z. helps produce what at first looks like the
absolute Monster talk-radio story of the month.

On June 3, in the third segment of the John Ziegler Show's second hour, after
lengthy discussions of the O.J. anniversary and the Michael Jackson case, Mr.
Z. takes a phone call from one "Daryl in Temecula," an African-American
gentleman who is "absolutely astounded they let a Klansman on the radio this
time of night." The call, which lasts seven minutes and eighteen seconds and
runs well over the :46 break, ends with John Ziegler's telling the audience,
"That's as angry as I've ever gotten in the history of my career." And Vince
Nicholas, looking awed and spent at his screener's station, pronounces the
whole thing "some of the best talk radio I ever heard."

Some portions of the call are untranscribable because they consist mainly of
Daryl and Mr. Z. trying to talk over each other. Daryl's core points appear to
be (1) that Mr. Z. seems to spend all his time talking about black men like
Kobe and O.J. and Michael Jackson--"Don't white people commit crimes?'--and
(2) that O.J. was, after all, found innocent in a court of law, and yet Mr. Z.
keeps "going on about 'He's guilty, he's guilty--'"

"He is;" the host inserts.

Daryl: "He was acquitted, wasn't he?"

"That makes no difference as to whether or not he did it."

"O.J., Kobe: You just thrive on these black guys."

It is here that Mr. Z. begins to pick up steam. "Oh yeah, Daryl, right, I'm a
racist. As a matter of fact, I often say, 'You know what? I just wish another
black guy would commit a crime, because I hate black people so much."

Daryl: "I think you do have more to talk about on black guys. I think that's
more 'news'" ... which actually would be kind of an interesting point to
explore, or at least address; but Mr. Z. is now stimulated.

"As a matter of fact, Daryl, oftentimes when we go through who's committed the
crimes, there are times when the white people who control the media, we get
together and go, 'Oh, we can't talk about that one, because that was a white
guy.' This is all a big conspiracy, Daryl. Except, to be serious for a second,
Daryl, what really upsets me, assuming you're a black guy, is that you ought
to be ten times more pissed off at O.J. Simpson than I am, because you know
why?"

Daryl: "You can't tell me how I should feel. As a forty-year-old black man,
I've seen racism for forty years."

[Graphic omitted]Mr. Z. is starting to move his upper body back and forth
excitedly in his chair. "I bet you have. I bet you have. And here's why you
ought to be pissed off: Because, out of all the black guys who deserved to get
a benefit of the doubt because of the history of racism which is real in this
country, and which is insidious, the one guy--the one guy--who gets the
benefit of all of that pain and suffering] over a hundred years of history in
this country is the one guy who deserves it less than anybody else, who sold
his race out, who tried to talk white, who only had white friends, who had his
ass kissed all over the place because he decided he wasn't really a black guy,
who was the first person in the history of this country ever accepted by white
America, who was actually able to do commercial endorsements because he
pretended to be white, and that's the guy?. That's the guy. That's the guy who
gets the benefit of that history, and that doesn't piss you off, that doesn't
piss you off?" And then an abrupt decrescendo: "Daryl, I can assure you-that
tide last thing I am is racist on this. This is the last guy who should
benefit."

And then June 4, the night following the Daryl interchange, turns out to be a
climactic whirlwind of production challenges, logistical brinksmanship,
meta-media outrage, Simpsonian minutiae, and Monster-grade stimulation. As is
SOP, it starts around 7:00 P.M. in KFI's large central prep room, which is
where all the local hosts and their producers come in to prepare for their
shows.

The prep room, which station management sometimes refers to as the production
office, is more or less the nerve center of KFI, a large, complexly shaped
space perimetered with battered little canted desks and hutches and two-drawer
file cabinets supporting tabletops of composite planking. There are beat-up
computers and pieces of sound equipment and funny Scotch-taped bits of office
humor (e.g., pictures with staffers' heads Photoshopped onto tabloid
celebrities' bodies). Like the studio and Airmix, the prep room is also a
D.P.H.-grade mess: half the overhead fluorescents are either out or flickering
nauseously, and the gray carpet crunches underfoot, and the waste-baskets are
all towering fire hazards, and many of the tabletops are piled with old books
and newspapers. One window, which is hot to the touch, overlooks KFI's gated
parking lot and security booth and the office of a Korean podiatrist across
the street.

Overall, the layout and myriad tactical functions of the prep room are too
complicated to try to describe this late in the game. At one end, it gives on
to the KFI newsroom, which is a whole galaxy unto itself. At the other,
comparatively uncluttered end is a set of thick, distinguished-looking doors
leading off into the offices of the Station Manager, Director of Marketing &
Promotions, program Director, and so on, with also a semi-attached former
closet for the P.D.'s assistant, a very kindly and eccentric lady who's been
at KFI for over twenty years and wears a high-tech headset that one begins,
only over time, to suspect isn't really connected to anything.

There are three main challenges facing tonight's John Ziegler Show. One is
that Emiliano Limon is off on certain personal business that he doesn't want
described, and therefore Mr. Vince Nicholas is soloing as producer for the
very first time. Another is that last night's on-air exchange with Daryl of
Temecula is the type of intensely stimulating talk-radio event that cries out
for repetition and commentary; Mr. Z. wants to rerun certain snippets of the
call in a very precise order so that he can use them as jumping-off points for
detailing his own "history with O.J." and explaining why he's so
incandescently passionate about the case.

The third difficulty is that Simpson's big anniversary Q & A with Ms. Katie
Couric is airing tonight on NBC's Dateline, and the cuts and discussions of
the Daryl call are going to have to be interwoven with excerpts from what Mr.
Z. refers to several times as "Katie's blowjob interview." An additional
complication is that Dateline airs in Los Angeles from 8:00 to 10:00 P.M., and
it has also now run teases for stories on the health hazards of the Atkins
diet and the dangerously lax security in U.S. hotels. Assuming that Dateline
waits and does the O.J. interview last (which it is clearly in the program's
interests to do), then the interview's highlights will have to be recorded off
TiVo, edited on NexGen, loaded onto Prophet, and queued up for the Cut Sheet
all very quickly, since Mr. Z.'s opening segment at 10:06 and it's hard to
fiddle with logistics once his show's under way.

Thus Vince spends 7:00-8:00 working two side-by-side computers, trying
simultaneously to assemble the cuts from last night's call, load an MSNBC
interview with Nicole Brown Simpson's sister directly into NexCen, and track
down a Web transcript of tonight's Dateline (which on the East Coast has
already aired) so that he and Mr. Z. can choose and record bites from the
Couric thing in real time. 'Mondo, who is back board-opping the ISDN feed of
7:00-10:00's Phil Hendrie Show, nevertheless comes in from Airmix several
times to stand behind Vince at the terminals, ostensibly to see what's going
on but really to lend moral support. 'Mondo's shadow takes up almost half the
room's east wall.

John Ziegler, who is understandably quite keyed up, spends some of the
pre-Dateline time standing around with an extremely pretty News-department
intern named Kyra, watching the MSNBC exchange with half an eye while doing
his trademark stress-relieving thing of holding two golf ball, and trying to
align the dimples so that one ball stays balanced atop the other. He is
wearing a horizontally striped green-and-white golf shirt, neatly pressed
black shorts, and gleaming New Balance sneakers. He keeps saying that he
cannot believe they're even giving Simpson air time. No one points out that
his shock seems a bit naive given the business realities of network TV news,
realities about which John Ziegler is normally very savvy and cynical. Kyra
does venture to observe, quietly, that the Simpson thing draws even bigger
ratings than today's Scott Peterson, who--

"Don't even compare the two," Mr. Z. cuts her off. "O.J.'s just in his own
world in terms of arrogance."

[Graphic omitted]The designated JZS intern, meanwhile, is at the prep room's
John & Ken Show computer, working (in Vince's stead) on a comic review feature
called "What Have We Learned This Week?," which is normally a Friday standard
but which there may or may not be time for tonight. At 7:45 P.M. it is still
90[degrees] out, and smoggy. The windows' light makes people look greenish in
the areas where the room's fluorescents are low. A large spread of takeout
chicken. sits uneaten and expensively congealing. Mr. Z.'s intern spends
nearly an hour composing a mock poem to Ms. Amber Frey, the mistress to whom
Scott Peterson evidently read romantic verse over the phone. The poem's final
version, which is "Roses are red / Violets are blue / If I find out you're
pregnant / I'll drown your ass too," takes such a long time because of
confusions about the right conjugation of "to drown."

"And to top it off," Mr. Z. is telling Kyra as her smile becomes brittle and
she starts trying to edge away, "to top it off, he leaves Nicole's body in a
place where the most likely people to find it are his children. It's just a
fluke that couple found her. I don't know if you've ever walked by there, but
it's really dark at night, and they were in a, like [gesturing, one golf ball
in each hand], cave formation out at the front."

Sure enough, Dateline runs the anti-Atkins story first. For reasons involving
laser printers and a special editing room off the on-air news cubicle, there's
suddenly a lot of running back and forth.

In Airmix, 'Mondo is eating Koo Koo Roo's chicken while watching Punk'd, an
MTV show where friends of young celebrities collude with the producers to make
the celebrities think they're in terrible legal trouble. 'Mondo is very
careful about eating anywhere near the mixing board. It's always around
60[degrees] in this room. On the board's channel 6 and the overhead speakers,
Phil Hendrie is pretending to mediate between apoplecfic callers and a man
who's filing sexual-harassment charges against female co-workers who've gotten
breast implants. For unknown reasons, a waist-high pile of disconnected
computer keyboards has appeared in the Airmix room's north corner, just across
the wall from KFI's Imaging studio, whose door is always double-locked.

It is only right that John Ziegler gets the spot directly in front of the prep
room's TV, with everyone else's office chairs sort of fanned out to either
side behind him. Seated back on his tailbone with his legs out and ankles
crossed, Mr. Z. is able simultaneously to watch Dateline's
are-you-in-danger-at-luxury-hotels segment, to hear and help rearrange Vince's
cuts from the MSNBC exchange, and to highlight those parts of the O.J.-Katie
Couric transcript that he wants to make absolutely sure to have Vince load
from TiVo into Prophet when the greedy bastards at Dateline finally air the
interview. It must be said, too, that Vince is an impressive surprise as a
producer. He's a veritable blur of all-business competence and technical
savvy. There are none of Emiliano's stoic shrugs, sotto wisecracks, or
passive-aggressive languor. Nor, tonight, is Vince's own slackerish stoner
persona anywhere in view. It is the same type of change as when you put a fish
back in the water and it seems to turn electric in your hand. Watching Vince
and the host work so well as a team induces the night's first strange
premonitory jolt: Emiliano's days are numbered.

The broadcast studio is strange when no one's in here. Through the soundproof
window, 'Mondo's head looks small and far away as he inclines over the spot
log. It seems like a lonely, cloistered place in which to be passionate about
the world. Mr. Z.'s padded host chair is old and lists slightly to port; it's
the same chair that John Kobylt sits in, and morning drive's Bill Handel, and
maybe even Dr. Laura back in the day. The studio wastebaskets have been
emptied, but the banana scent still lingers. It might simply be that John
and/or Ken eats a lot of bananas during afternoon drive. All the studio's
monitors are on, though none is tuned to NBC. On the Fox News monitor up over
the digital clock, Scan Hannity and Susan Estrich are rerunning the Iowa
Caucuses clip of Howard Dean screaming at the start of his concession speech.
They play the scream over and over. Ms. Estrich is evidently filling in on
Hannity and Colmes. "They have hatred for George W. Bush, but they don't have
ideas," Sean Hannity says. "Where are the ideas on the left? Where is the
thinking liberal?" Susan Estrich says, "I don't know. I don't have a full-time
job on TV, so I can't tell you."

All multi-tasking ends when Dateline, after two teases and an extra-long spot
break, finally commences the interview segment. It is Katie Couric and O.J.
Simpson and Simpson's attorney in a living room that may or may not be real.
One tends to forget how unusually, screen-fillingly large O.J.'s head is. Mr.
Ziegler is now angled forward with his elbows on his knees and his fingers
steepled just under his nose. Although he does, every so often, let loose with
a "Katie Couric sucks!" or "Katie Couric should be fucking shot!," for the
most part a person seated on the host's far flank has to watch his upper
face-his right eye's and nostril's dilations--to discern when Mr. Z.'s
reacting strongly or thinking about how he'll respond to some specific bit of
Simpson's "sociopathic BS" when it's his turn to talk.

It's odd: if you've spent some time watching Mr. Z. perform in the studio, you
can predict just what he'll look like, how his head and arms will move and
eyes fill with life as he says certain things that it's all but sure he'll say
on-air tonight, such as "I have some very, very strong opinions about how this
interview was conducted," and "Katie Couric is a disgrace to journalism
everywhere;' and that O.J.'s self-presentation was "delusional and arrogant
beyond all belief," and that the original trial jury was "a collection of
absolute nimrods," and that to believe in Simpson's innocence, as Ms. Couric
says a poll shows some 70 percent of African-Americans still do, "you have to
be either crazy, deluded, or stupid-there are no other explanations."

[Graphic omitted]To be fair, though, there truly are some dubious, unsettling
things about the Dateline interview, such as for instance that NBC has acceded
to O.J. Simpson's "no editing" condition for appearing, which used to be an
utter taboo for serious news organizations. Or that O.J. gets to sit there
looking cheery and unguarded even though he has his lawyer almost in his lap;
or that most of Katie Couric's questions turn out to be Larry King-size
fluffballs; or that O.J. Simpson responds to one of her few substantive
questions-about 1994's eerie, slow-motion Bronco chase and its bearing on how
O.J.'s case is still perceived--by harping on the fact that the chase "never
ever, in three trials that I had, it never came up," as if that had anything
to do with whatever his behavior in the Bronco really signified (and at which
non-answer, and Ms. Couric's failure to press or follow up, Mr. Z. moans and
smears his hand up and down over his face). Or that O.J.'s cheerful expression
never changes when Katie Couric, leaning forward and speaking with a delicacy
that's !either decent or obscene, inquires whether his children ever ask him
about the crime. And when someone in the arc of chairs around John Ziegler
says, almost to himself, that the one pure thing to hope for here is that
Simpson's kids believe he's innocent, Mr. Z. gives a snort of reply and
states, very flatly, "They know, and he knows they know, that he did it." To
which, in KFI's prep room, the best response would probably be compassion,
empathy. Because one can almost feel it: what a bleak and merciless world this
host lives in--believes, nay, knows for an absolute fact he lives in. I'll
take doubt.

FCC regulations require a station ID to be broadcast every hour. This ID
comprises a station's call letters, band and frequency, and the radio market
it's licensed to serve. Just about every serious commercial station (which KFI
very much is) appends to its ID a Sweeper, which is the little tag line by
which the station wishes to be known. KABC, the other giant AM talk station in
Los Angeles, deploys the entendre-rich "Where America Comes First." KFI's own
main Sweeper is "More Stimulating Talk Radio," but it's also got secondary
Sweepers that it uses to intro the half-hour news, traffic updates at
seventeen and forty-six past the hour, and station promos. "Southern
California's Newsroom," "The Radio Home of Fox News," and "When You See News
Break, Don't Try to Fix It Yourself--Leave That to Professionals" are the big
three that KFI's running this spring. The content and sound of all IDs,
Sweepers, and promos are the responsibility of the station's Imaging
department, apparently so named because they involve KFI's image in the LA
market. Imaging is sort of the radio version of branding--the Sweepers let KFI
communicate its special personality and 'tude in a compressed way.

There are also separate, subsidiary tag lines that KFI develops specially for
its local programs. The main two it's using for the John Ziegler Show so far
are "Live and Local" and "Hot, Fresh Talk Served Nightly."

The whisperer turns out to be one Chris Corley, a voiceover actor best known
for movie trailers. Corley's [C.sup.2] Productions is based in Fort Myers FL.

(By the standards of the U.S. radio industry this makes him almost movie-star
gorgeous.)

'Mondo's lay explanation of what peaking is consists of pointing at the red
area to the right of the two volumeters' bobbing needles on the mixing board:
"It's when the needles go into the red." The overall mission, apparently, is
to keep the volume and resonance of a host's voice high enough to be
stimulating but not so high that they exceed the capacities of an AM analog
signal or basic radio receiver. One reason why callers' voices sound so much
less rich and authoritative than hosts' voices on talk radio is that it is
harder to keep telephone voices from peaking.

Another reason is mike processing, which evens and fills out the host's voice,
removing raspy or metallic tones, and occurs automatically in Airmix. There's
no such processing for the callers' voices.

Prophet is the special OS for KFI's computer system--"like Windows for a radio
station," according to Mr. Ziegler's producer.

Here is a sample bit of "What the John Ziegler Show is All About," a long
editorial intro to the program that Mr. Ziegler delivered snippets of over his
first several nights in January:
   The underlying premise of the John Ziegler Show is
   that, thanks to its socialistic leanings, incompetent
   media, eroding moral foundation, aging demographics,
   and undereducated masses, the United
   States, as we know it, is doomed. In my view, we
   don't know how much longer we still have to enjoy
   it, so we shouldn't waste precious moments constantly
   worrying or complaining about it. However,
   because not everyone in this country is yet convinced
   of this seemingly obvious reality, the show
   does see merit in pointing out or documenting the
   demise of our nation and will take great pains to
   do so. And because most everyone can agree that
   there is value in attempting to delay the sinking of
   the Titanic as long as possible, whenever feasible
   the John Ziegler Show will attempt to do its part to
   plug whatever holes in the ship it can. With that
   said, the show realizes that, no matter how successful
   it (or anyone else) may be in slowing the downfall
   of our society, the final outcome is still pretty
   much inevitable, so we might as well have a good
   time watching the place fall to pieces.

[Graphic omitted]Be advised that the intro's stilted, term-paperish language,
which looks kind of awful in print, is a great deal more effective when the
spiel is delivered out loud--the stiffness gives it a slight air of
self-mockery that keeps you from being totally sure just how seriously John
Ziegler takes what he's saying. Meaning he gets to have it both ways. This
half-pretend pretension, which is ingenious in all sorts of ways, was
pioneered in talk radio by Rush Limbaugh, although with Limbaugh the
semi-self-mockery is more tonal than syntactic.

ISDN, in which the D stands for "Digital" is basically a phone line of very
high quality and expense. ISDN is the main way that stations take feed for
syndicated programs from companies like Infinity Broadcasting, Premiere Radio
Networks, etc. KFI has its own News department and traffic reporters, but on
nights and weekends it subscribes to an independent service called Airwatch
that provides off-hour news and traffic for stations in the LA area. When, at
:17 and :46 every hour, Mr. Z. intros a report from "Alan LaGreen in the KFI
Traffic Center," it's really Alan LaGreen of Airwatch, who's doing ISDN
traffic reports for different stations at different times all hour and has to
be very careful to give the right call letters for the I Traffic Center he's
supposedly reporting from.

KFI management's explanation of "stimulating" is apposite, if a bit slippery.
Following is an excerpted transcript of a May 25 Q & A with Ms. Robin
Bertolucci, the station's intelligent, highly successful, and sort of
hypnotically intimidating Program Director. (The haphazard start is because
the interviewing skills behind the Q parts are marginal; the excerpt gets more
interesting as it goes along.)

Q: Is there some compact way to describe KFI's programming philosophy?

A: "What we call ourselves is 'More Stimulating Talk Radio.'"

Q: Pretty much got that part already.

A: "That is the slogan that we try to express every minute on the air. Of
being stimulating. Being informative, being entertaining, being energetic,
being dynamic ... The way we do it is a marriage of information and
stimulating entertainment."

Q: What exactly is it that makes information entertaining?

A: "It's attitudinal, it's emotional."

Q: Can you explain this attitudinal component?

A: "I think 'stimulating' really sums it up. It's what we really try to do."

Q: [strangled frustration noises]

A: "Look, our station logo is in orange and black, and white--it's a stark,
aggressive look. I think that typifies it. The attitude. A little
in-your-face. We're not ... stodgy."

See, e.g., Mr. John Kobylt, of KFI's top-rated afternoon John & Ken Show, in a
recent LA Times profile: "The truth is, we do everything for ratings. Yes,
that's our job. I can show you the contract ... This is not Meet the Press.
It's not The Jim Lehrer News Hour."

Or you could call it atavistic, a throwback. The truth is that what we think
of as objectivity in journalism has been a standard since only the 1900s, and
mainly in the United States. Have a look at some European dailies sometime.

KFI has large billboards at traffic nodes all over metro Los Angeles with the
same general look and feel, although the billboards often carry both the
Sweeper and extra tag phrases--"Raving Infomaniacs," "The Death of Ignorance,"
"The Straight Poop," and (against a military-camouflage background)
"Intelligence Briefings."

The Airmix room's analogue to the cards is a bumper sticker next to the
producer's station:

WHO WOULD THE FRENCH VOTE FOR?--AMERICANS FOR BUSH

(He never leaves his chair during breaks, for example, not even to use the
restroom.)

EDITORIAL ASIDE It's hard to understand Fox News tags like "Fair and
Balanced," "No-Spin Zone," and "We Report, You Decide" as anything but dark
jokes, ones that delight the channel's conservative audience precisely because
their claims to objectivity so totally enrage liberals, whose own literal
interpretation of the tag lines makes the left seem dim, humorless, and
stodgy.

EDITORIAL ASIDE Of course, this is assuming one believes that information and
spin are different things--and one of the dangers of partisan news's
metastasis is the way it enables the conviction that the two aren't really
distinct at all. Such a conviction, if it becomes endemic, alters democratic
discourse from a "battle of ideas" to a battle of sales pitches for ideas
(assuming, again, that one chooses to distinguish ideas from pitches, or
actual guilt/innocence from lawyers' arguments, or binding commitments from
the mere words "I promise," and so on and so forth).

PURELY INFORMATIVE It's true that there are, in some large markets and even
syndication, a few political talk-radio hosts who identify as moderate or
liberal. The best known of these are probably Ed Schultz, Thom Hartmann, and
Doug Stephan. But only a few-and only Stephan has anything close to a national
audience. And the tribulations of Franken et al.'s Air America venture are
well known. The point is that it is neither inaccurate nor unfair to say that
today's political talk radio is, in general, overwhelmingly conservative.

(whose show is really only semi-political)

Quick sample intros: Mike Gallagher, a regular Fox News contributor whose
program is syndicated by Salem Radio Network, has an upcoming book called
Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America. Neal Boortz, who's
carried by Cox Radio Syndication and JRN, bills himself as "High Priest of the
Church of the Painful Truth," and his recent ads in trade publications feature
the quotation "How can we take airport security seriously until ethnic
profiling is not only permitted, but encouraged?"

Mr. Z. identifies himself as a Libertarian, though he's not a registered
member of the Libertarian Party, because he feels they "can't get their act
together," which he does not seem to intend as a witticism.

[Graphic omitted]"Spot load" is the industry term for the number of minutes
per hour given over to commercials. The point of the main-text sentence is
that a certain percentage of the spots that run on KFI from 9:00 to noon are
Rush/PRN commercials, and they are the ones who get paid by the advertisers.
The exact percentages and distributions of local vs. syndicator's commercials
are determined by what's called the "Clock," which is represented by a
pie-shaped distribution chart that Ms. Bertolucci has on file but will show
only a very quick glimpse of, since the spot-load apportionments for
syndicated shows in major markets involve complex negotiations between the
station and the syndicator, and KFI regards its syndicated Clocks as
proprietary info--it doesn't want other stations to know what deals have been
cut with PRN.

In White Star Productions' History of Talk Radio video, available at better
libraries everywhere, there is footage of Dr. Laura doing her show right here
at KFI, although she's at a mike in what's now the Airmix room--which,
according to 'Mondo, used to be the studio, with what's now the studio serving
as Airmix. (Why they switched rooms is unclear, but transferring all the gear
must have been a serious hassle.) In the video, the little gray digital clock
propped up counting seconds on Dr. Laura's desk is the same one that now
counts seconds on the wall to Mr. Ziegler's upper left in the studio--i.e.,
it's the very same clock--which not only is strangely thrilling but also
further testifies to KFI's thriftiness about capital expenses.

Clear Channel bought KFI--or rather the radio company that owned KFI--sometime
around 2000. It's all a little fuzzy, because it appears that Clear Channel
actually bought, or absorbed, the radio company that had just bought KFI from
another radio company, or something like that.

It turns out that one of the reasons its old Koreatown studios are such a
latrine is that KFI's getting ready to move very soon to a gleaming new
complex in Burbank that will house five of Clear Channel's stations and allow
them to share a lot of cutting-edge technical equipment and software. Some of
the reasons for the consolidation involve AM radio's complex, incremental move
from analog to digital broadcast, a move that's a lot more economical if
stations can be made to share equipment. The Burbank hub facility will also
feature a new and improved mega-Prophet OS that all five stations can use and
share files on, which for KFI means convenient real-time access to all sorts
of new preloaded bumper music and sound effects and bites.

As the board op, 'Mondo Hernandez is also responsible for downloading and
cueing up the sections of popular songs that intro the John Ziegler Show and
background Mr. Z.'s voice when a new segment starts. Bumper music is, of
course, a talk-radio convention: Rush Limbaugh has a franchise on the
Pretenders, and Sean Hannity always uses that horrific Martina McBride "Let
freedom ring/Let the guilty pay" song. Mr. Z. favors a whole rotating set of
classic rock hooks, but his current favorites are Van Halen's "Right Now" and
a certain jaunty part of the theme to Pirates of the Caribbean, because,
according to 'Mondo, "they get John pumped."

N.B. Mr. Z. usually refers to himself as either "Zig" or "the Zigmeister," and
has made a determined effort to get everybody at KFI to call him Zig, with
only limited success so far.

(Which means that the negotiations between KFI and PRN over the terms of
syndication for Rush, Dr. Laura, et al. are actually negotiations between two
parts of the same company, which either helps explain or renders even more
mysterious KFI's reticence about detailing the Clocks for its PRN shows.)

"Passion" is a big word in the industry, and John Ziegler uses the word in
connection with himself a lot. It appears to mean roughly the same as what Ms.
Bertolucci calls "edginess" or "attitude."

Part of the answer to why conservative talk radio works so well might be that
extreme conservatism provides a neat, clear, univocal template with which to
organize one's opinions and responses to the world. The current term of
approbation for this kind of template is "moral clarity."

It is, of course, much less difficult to arouse genuine anger, indignation,
and outrage in people than it is real joy, satisfaction, fellow feeling, etc.
The latter are fragile and complex, and what excites them varies a great deal
from person to person, whereas anger et al. are more primal, universal, and
easy to stimulate (as implied by expressions like "He really pushes my
buttons").

This, too: Consider the special intimacy of talk radio. It's usually listened
to solo--radio is the most solitary of broadcast media. And
half-an-ear-background-listening is much more common with music formats than
with talk. This is a human being speaking to you, with a pro-caliber voice,
eloquently and with passion, in what feels like a one-to-one; it doesn't take
long before you start to feel you know him. Which is why it's often such a
shock when you see a real host, his face--you discover you've had a picture of
this person in your head without knowing it, and it's always wrong. This
dissonant shock is one reason why Rush and Dr. Laura, even with their huge
built-in audiences, did not fare well on TV.

(as the industry is at pains to remind advertisers)

[Graphic omitted]The exact-timing thing is actually a little less urgent for a
host who's got the resources of Clear Channel behind him. This is because in
KFFs Airmix room, nestled third from the bottom in one of the two eight-foot
stacks of processing gear to the left of 'Mondo's mixing board, is an Akai
DD1000 Magneto Optical Disk Recorder, known less formally as a "Cashbox." What
this is is a sound compressor, which exploits the fact that even a live studio
program is--because of the FCC-mandated seven-second delay-taped. Here is how
'Mondo, in exchange for certain vending-machine comestibles, explains the
Cashbox: "All the shows are supposed to start at six past. But if they put
more spots in the log, or say, like, if traffic goes long, now we're all of a
sudden starting at seven past or something. The Cashbox can take a
twenty-minute segment and turn it into a nineteen." It does this by using
computerized sound-processing to eliminate pauses and periodically accelerate
Mr. Z.'s delivery just a bit. The trick is that the Cashbox can compress sound
so artfully that you don't hear the speed-up, at least not in a
nineteen-for-twenty exchange ("You get down to eighteen it's risky, or down
around seventeen you can definitely hear it"). So if things are running a
little over, 'Mondo has to use the Cashbox-very deftly, via controls that look
really complicated-in order to make sure that the Clock's adhered to and
Airwatch breaks, promos, and ad spots all run as specified. A gathering
suspicion as to why the Akai DD1000 is called the Cashbox occasions a Q: Does
the station ever press 'Mondo or other board ops to use the Cashbox and
compress shows in order to make room for additional ads? A: "Not really. What
they'll do is just put an extra spot or two in the log, and then I've just got
to do the best I can."

The only elocutionary problem Mr. Z. ever exhibits is a habit of confusing the
words "censure" and "censor."

For instance, one has only to listen to Coast to Coast With George Noory's ads
for gold as a hedge against hyperinflation, special emergency radios you can
hand-crank in case of extended power failure, miracle weight-loss formulas,
online dating services, etc., to understand that KFI and the syndicator regard
this show's audience as basically frightened, credulous, and desperate.

(ad-wise, a lucrative triad indeed)

A live read is when a host or newsperson reads the ad copy himself on-air.
They're sort of a radio tradition, but the degree to which KFI weaves live
reads into its programming is a great leap forward for broadcast marketing.
Live-read spots are more expensive for advertisers, especially the longer,
more detailed ones read by the programs' hosts, since these ads (a) can sound
at first like an actual talk segment and (b) draw on the personal appeal and
credibility of the host. And the spots themselves are often clearly set up to
exploit these features--see for instance John Kobylt's live read for LA's
Cunning Dental Group during afternoons' John & Ken: "Have you noticed how bad
the teeth are of all the contestants in these reality shows? I saw some of
this the other day. Discolored, chipped, misshaped, misaligned, rotted-out
teeth, missing teeth, not to mention the bleeding, oozing, pus-y gums. You go
to Cunning Dental Group, they will take all your gross teeth and in one or two
visits fix them and give you a bright shiny smile."

Even more expensive than live reads are what's called "endorsements; which are
when a host describes, in ecstatically favorable terms, his own personal
experience with a product or service. Examples here include Phil Hendrie's
weight loss on Cortislim, Kobylt's "better than 20-20" laser-surgery outcome
with Saddleback Eye Center, and Mr. Bill Handel's frustrations with dial-up
ISPs before discovering DSL Extreme. These ads, which are KFI's most powerful
device for exploiting the intimacy and trust of the listener-host
relationship, also result in special "endorsement fees" paid directly to the
host.

Handel, whose KFI show is an LA institution in morning drive, describes this
program as "in-your-face, informational, with a lot of racial humor."

(It's unclear how one spells the adjectival form of "pus," though it sounds
okay on-air.)

It's a little more complicated than that, really, because excessive spots can
also affect ratings in less direct ways--mainly by lowering the quality of the
programming. Industry analyst Michael Harrison, of Talkers magazine, complains
that "The commercial breaks are so long today that it is hard for hosts to
build upon where they left off. The whole audience could have changed. There
is the tendency to go back to the beginning and re-set up the premise. It
makes it very difficult to do what long-form programming is supposed to do."

SEMI-EDITORIAL Even in formal, on-record, and very PR-savvy interviews, the
language of KFI management is filled with little unconscious bits of
jargon--"inventory" for the total number of ad minutes available, "product"
for a given program, or (a favorite) "to monetize," which means to extract ad
revenue from a given show--that let one know exactly where KFI's priorities
lie. Granted, the station is a business, and broadcasting is not charity work.
But given how intimate and relationship-driven talk radio is, it's
disheartening when management's only term for KFI's listeners, again and
again, is "market."

[Graphic omitted]CONSUMER ADVISORY As it happens, these two are products of
Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, an Ohio company with annual sales of more
than $100 million, as well as over 3,000 complaints to the BBB and the
Attorney General's Office in its home state alone. Here's why. The radio ads
say you can get a thirty-day free trial of Enzyte by calling a certain
toll-free number. If you call, it turns out there's a $4.90 S&H charge for the
free month's supply, which the lady on the phone wants you to put on your
credit card. If you acquiesce, the company then starts shipping you more
Enzyte every month and auto-billing your card for at least $35 each time,
because it turns out that by taking the thirty-day trial you've somehow signed
up for Berkeley's automatic-purchase program--which the operator neglected to
mention. And calling Berkeley Nutraceuticals to get the automatic shipments
and billings stopped doesn't much help; often they'll stop only if some kind
of consumer agency sends a letter. It's the same with Altovis and its own
"free trial." In short, the whole thing is one of those irksome, hassle-laden
marketing schemes, and KFI runs dozens of spots per day for Berkeley products.
The degree to which the station is legally responsible for an advertiser's
business practices is, by FTC and FCC rules, nil. But it's hard not to see
KFI's relationship with Berkeley as another indication of the station's true
regard for its listeners.

(Calls to KFI's Sales department re consumers' amply documented problems with
Enzyte and Altovis were, as the journalists say, not returned.)

FYI: Enzyte, which bills itself as a natural libido and virility enhancer (it
also has all those "Smiling Bob & Grateful Wife" commercials on cable TV),
contains tribulis terrestris, panax ginseng, ginko biloba, and a half dozen
other innocuous herbal ingredients. The product costs Berkeley, in one
pharmacologist's words, "nothing to make." But it's de facto legal to charge
hundreds of dollars a year for it, and to advertise it as an OTC Viagra. The
FDA doesn't regulate herbal meds unless people are actually falling over from
taking them, and the Federal Trade Commission doesn't have anything like the
staff to keep up with the advertising claims, so it's all basically an
unregulated market.

(somewhat paradoxically)

(who really is a gifted mimic)

Apparently, one reason why Hendrie's show was perfect for national syndication
was that the wider dissemination gave Hendrie a much larger pool of
uninitiated listeners to call in and entertain the initiated listeners.

National talk-radio hosts like Limbaugh, Prager, Hendrie, Gallagher, et al.
tend to have rich baritone radio voices that rarely peak, whereas today's KFI
has opted for a local-host sound that's more like a slightly adenoidal second
tenor. The voices of Kobylt, Bill Handel, Ken Chiampou, weekend host Wayne
Resnick, and John Ziegler all share not only this tenor pitch but also a
certain quality that is hard to describe except as sounding stressed,
aggrieved, Type A: the Little Guy Who's Had It Up To Here. Kobylt's voice in
particular has a consistently snarling, dyspeptic, fed-up quality-a perfect
aural analogue to the way drivers' faces look in jammed traffic--whereas Mr.
Ziegler's tends to rise and fall more, often hitting extreme upper registers
of outraged disbelief. Off-air, Mr. Z.'s speaking voice is nearly an octave
lower than it sounds on his program, which is a bit mysterious, since 'Mondo
denies doing anything special to the on-air voice except setting the default
volume on the board's channel 7 a bit low because "John sort of likes to yell
a lot." And Mr. Ziegler bristles at the suggestion that he, Kobylt, or Handel
has anything like a high voice on the air: "It's just that we're passionate.
Rush doesn't get all that passionate. You try being passionate and having a
low voice."

(as in if you listen to an upset person say "I can't believe it!")

CONTAINS EDITORIAL ELEMENTS It should be conceded that there is at least one
real and refreshing journalistic advantage that bloggers, fringe-cable
newsmen, and most talk-radio hosts have over the mainstream media: they are
neither the friends nor the peers of the public officials they cover. Why this
is an advantage involves an issue that tends to get obscured by the endless
fight over whether there's actually a "liberal bias" in the "elite" mainstream
press. Whether one buys the bias thing or not, it is clear that leading media
figures are part of a very different social and economic class than most of
their audiences. See, e.g., a snippet of Eric Alterman's recent What Liberal
Media?:
   No longer the working-class heroes of The Front Page/His Gal Friday
   lore, elite journalists in Washington and New York [and LA] are
   rock-solid members of the political and financial Establishment
   about whom they write. They dine at the same restaurants and take
   their vacations on the same Caribbean islands ... What's more,
   like the politicians, their jobs are not subject to export to China
   or Bangladesh.

This is why the really potent partisan label for the NYT/Time/network-level
press is not "liberal media" but "elite media"--because the label's true. And
talk radio is very deliberately not part of this elite media. With the
exception of Limbaugh and maybe Hannity, these hosts are not stars, or
millionaires, or sophisticates. And a large part of their on-air persona is
that they are of and for their audience--the Little Guy--and against corrupt,
incompetent pols and their "spokesholes," against smooth-talking lawyers and
PC whiners and idiot bureaucrats, against illegal aliens clogging our highways
and emergency rooms, paroled sex offenders living among us, punitive vehicle
taxes, and stupid, self-righteous, agenda-laden laws against public smoking,
SUV emissions, gun ownership, the right to watch the Nick Berg decapitation
video over and over in slow motion, etc. In other words, the talk host's
persona and appeal are deeply, totally populist, and if it's all somewhat
fake-if John Kobylt can shift a little too easily from the apoplectic Little
Guy of his segments to the smooth corporate shill of his live reads--then
that's just life in the big city.

(Except some of your more slippery right-wing commentators use "elitist
media," which sounds similar but is really a far more loaded term.)

Besides legendary stunts like tossing broccoli at "vegetable-head" jurors for
taking too long to find Westerfield guilty, Kobylt is maybe best known for
shouting, "Come out, Scott! No one believes you! You can't hide!" at a
window's silhouette as the J & K Show broadcast live from in front of
Peterson's house, which scene got re-created in at least one recent TV movie
about the Scott & Laci case.

The John & Ken Show pulls higher ratings in southern California than the
syndicated Rush and Dr. Laura, which is pretty much unheard of.

These are measurement categories in Arbitron Inc.'s Radio Market Reports,
which reports come out four times a year and are known in the industry as
"Books." In essence, Cume is the total measure of all listeners, and AQH (for
"Average Quarter Hour") represents the mean number of listeners in any given
fifteen-minute period.

(On the other hand, he omits to wear his golf cap in her office, and his hair
shows evidence of recent combing.)

In truth, just about everyone at KFI except Ms. B. refers to Arbitron as
"Arbitraryon." This is because it's 100 percent diary-based, and diary surveys
are notoriously iffy, since a lot of subjects neglect to fill out their
diaries in real time (especially when they're listening as they drive),
tending instead to wait till the night before they're due and then trying to
do them from memory. Plus it's widely held that certain ethnic minorities are
chronically mis- or over-represented in metro LA's Books, evidently because
Arbitron has a hard time recruiting these minorities as subjects, and when it
lands a few it tends to stick with them week after week.

FOR THOSE OUTSIDE SOUTHERN CA Haidl, the teenage son of an Orange County Asst.
Sheriff, is accused, together with some chums, of gang-raping an unconscious
girl at a party two or three years ago. Rocket scientists all, the perps had
videotaped the whole thing and then managed to lose the tape, which eventually
found its way to the police.

[meaning for the station in its current talk format, which started sometime in
the eighties. KFI itself has been on the air since 1922--the "FI" actually
stands for "Farm Information."]

Again, this sort of claim seems a little tough to reconcile with the actual
news that KFI concentrates on, but--as Mr. Z. himself once pointedly observed
during a Q & A-interviewing somebody is not the same as arguing with him over
every last little thing.

(with whom Emiliano, from all indications, does not enjoy a very chummy or
simpatico relationship, although he's always a master of tact and
circumspection on the subject of Mr. Z.)

The upshot here is that there's a sort of triangular dissonance about the John
Ziegler Show and how best to stimulate LA listeners. From all available
evidence, Robin Bertolucci wants the program to be mainly info-driven
(according to KFI's particular definition of info), but she wants the
information heavily editorialized and infused with 'tude and in-your-face
energy. Mr. Ziegler interprets this as the ED.'s endorsing his talking a lot
about himself, which Emiliano Limon views as an antiquated, small-market
approach that is not going to be very interesting to people in Los Angeles,
who tend to get more than their share of colorful personality and
idiosyncratic opinion just in the course of their normal day. If Emiliano is
right, then Mr. Z. may simply be too old-school and self-involved for KFI, or
at least not yet aware of how different the appetites of a New York or LA
market are from those of a Louisville or Raleigh.

(famous "confrontational" talk hosts of the sixties)

KGO happens to be the station where Ms. Robin Bertolucci, fresh out of
Cal-Berkeley, first broke into talk radio.

(except, obviously, for some restrictions on naughty language)

CONTAINS WHAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS EDITORIAL ELEMENTS

It seems only fair and balanced to observe, from the imagined perspective of a
Neal Boortz or John Ziegler, that Minow's old distinction reflected exactly
the sort of controlling, condescending, nanny-state liberal attitude that
makes government regulation such a bad idea. For how and why does a federal
bureaucrat like Newton Minow get to decide what "the public interest" is? Why
not respect the American people enough to let the public itself decide what
interests it? Of course, this sort of objection depends on precisely the
collapse of "the public interest" into "what happens to interest the public"
that liberals object to. For the distinction between these two is itself
liberal, as is the idea of a free press's and broadcast media's special
responsibilities-"liberal" in the sense of being rooted in a concern for the
common good over and above the preferences of individual citizens. The point
is that the debate over things like the Fairness Doctrine and the proper
responsibility of broadcasters quickly hits ideological bedrock on both sides.

DITTO (Which does indeed entail government's arrogating the power to decide
what that common good is, it's true. On the other hand, the idea is that at
least government officials are elected, or appointed by elected
representatives, and thus are somewhat accountable to the public they're
deciding for. What appears to drive liberals most crazy about the right's
conflation of "common good"/"public interest" with "what wins in the market"
is the conviction that it's all a scam, that what the deregulation of
industries like broadcasting, health care, and energy really amounts to is the
subordination of the public's interests to the financial interests of large
corporations. Which is, of course, all part of a very deep, serious national
argument about the role and duties of government that America's having with
itself right now. It is an argument that's not being plumbed at much depth on
political talk radio, though-at least not the more legitimate, non-wacko
claims of some on the left [a neglect that then strengthens liberal suspicions
that all these conservative talk hosts are just spokesholes for their
corporate masters ... and around and around it all goes].)

The crucial connection with the ED.'s repeal was not Rush's show but that
show's syndicatability. A station could now purchase and air three daily hours
of Limbaugh without being committed to programming another three hours of
Sierra Club or Urban League or something.

EFM Media, named for Edward E McLaughlin, was a sort of Old Testament
patriarch of modern syndication, although Mr. McL. tended to charge
subscribing stations cash instead of splitting the Clock, because he wanted a
low spot load that would give Rush maximum air time to build his audience.

In truth, Rush's disdain for the "liberal press" somewhat recalls good old
Spiro Agnew's attacks on the Washington press corps (as in "nattering nabobs,"
"hopeless, hysterical hypochondriacs," etc.), with the crucial difference
being that Agnew's charges always came off as thuggish and pathetic in that
"liberal press, "which at the time was the only vector for their transmission.
Because of his own talent and the popularity of his show, Rush was able to
move partisan distrust for the mainstream "liberal media" into the mainstream
itself.

JUST CLEAR-EYED, DISPASSIONATE REASON Notwithstanding all sorts of interesting
other explanations, the single biggest reason why left-wing talk-radio
experiments like Air America or the Ed Schultz program are not likely to
succeed, at least not on a national level, is that their potential audience is
just not dissatisfied enough with today's mainstream news sources to feel that
it has to patronize a special type of media to get the unbiased truth.

Again, this is all better, and arguably funnier, when delivered aloud in Mr.
Z.'s distinctive way.

EDITORIAL QUIBBLE It's unclear just when in college Mr. Z. thinks students are
taught that they can do or be anything. A I good part of what he considers
academia's leftist agenda, after all, consists in teaching kids about social
and economic stratification, inequalities, uneven playing fields--all the U.S.
realities that actually limit possibilities for some people.

(if conservatively disposed, please substitute "allegedly")

The best guess re Mr. Z.'s brutal on-record frankness is that either (a) the
host's on- and off-air personas really are identical, or (b) he regards
speaking to a magazine correspondent as just one more part of his job, which
is to express himself in a maximally stimulating way (there was a tape
recorder out, after all).

(for a magazine, moreover, that pretty much everyone around KFI regards as a
chattering-class organ of the most elitist liberal kind)

(while both eating and watching a Lakers playoff game on a large-screen
high-def TV, which latter was the only condition he placed on the interview)

(especially the one at Raleigh's WLFL Fox 22--"My boss there was the worst
boss in the history of bosses")

?!

A Tape is sort of the radio/TV equivalent of an artist's portfolio.

As Mr. Z. explains it, consultants work as freelance advisers to different
stations' Program Directors--"They sort of give the ED. a cover if he hires
somebody and it doesn't work out."

(the whole story of which is very involved and takes up almost half a
microcassette)

(whom the host reveres---a standing gag on his KFI program is that Mr. Z. is a
deacon in the First Church of Tiger Woods)

For those unfamiliar with Tom Leykis: Imagine Howard Stern without the
cleverness.

In the Q & A itself, Mr. Z. goes back and forth between actually using the
N-word and merely referring to it as "the N-word," without apparent pattern or
design.

EDITORIAL OPINION This is obviously a high-voltage area to get into, but for
what it's worth, John Ziegler does not appear to be a racist as "racist" is
generally understood. What he is is more like very, very insensitive--although
Mr. Z. himself would despise that description, if only because "insensitive"
is now such a PC shibboleth. Actually, though, it is in the very passion of
his objection to terms like "insensitive," "racist," and "the N-word" that his
real problem lies. Like many other post-Limbaugh hosts, John Ziegler seems
unable to differentiate between (1) cowardly, hypocritical acquiescence to the
tyranny of Political Correctness and (2) judicious, compassionate caution
about using words that cause pain to large groups of human beings, especially
when there are several less upsetting words that can be used. Even though
there is plenty of stuff for reasonable people to dislike about Political
Correctness as a dogma, there is also something creepy about the brutal,
self-righteous glee with which Mr. Z. and other conservative hosts defy all PC
conventions. If it causes you real pain to hear or see something, and I make
it a point to inflict that thing on you merely because I object to your
reasons for finding it painful, then there's something wrong with my sense of
proportion, or my recognition of your basic humanity, or both.

(just one person's opinion ...)

THIS, TOO (And let's be real: spelling out a painful word is no improvement.
In some ways, it's worse than using the word outright, since spelling it could
easily be seen as implying that the people who are upset by the word are also
too dumb to spell it. What's puzzling here is that Mr. Ziegler seems much too
bright and self-aware not to understand this.)

Mr. Z. explains that he's referring here to the constant moving around and
apartment-hunting and public controversy caused by the firings. His sense of
grievance and loss seems genuine. But one should also keep in mind how vital,
for political talk hosts in general, is this sense of embattled
persecution--by the leftist mainstream press, by slick Democratic operatives,
by liberal lunatics and identity politics and PC and rampant cynical
pandering. All of which provides the constant conflict required for good
narrative and stimulating radio. Not, in John Ziegler's case, that any of his
anger and self-pity is contrived--but they can be totally real and still
function as parts of the skill set he brings to his job.

[Graphic omitted]A corollary possibility: The reason why the world as
interpreted by many hosts is one of such thoroughgoing selfishness and
cynicism and fear is that these are qualities of the talk-radio industry they
are part of, and they (like professionals everywhere) tend to see their
industry as a reflection of the real world.

Here, some of John Ziegler's specific remarks about Darcie Divita are being
excised at his request. It turns out that Ms. Divita is suing both the host
and WHAS--Mr.Z.'s deposition is scheduled for summer '04.

(after what Ms. Bertolucci characterizes as "a really big search around the
country")

Mr. Z. explains the scare quotes around "available" as meaning that the
experimental gig didn't offer the sort of compensation that could lure a
large-market host away from another station. He describes his current KFI
salary as "in the low six figures."

Vince (who is either a deep professional admirer or a titanic suck-up) states
several times that John Ziegler is excellent with callers, dutifully referring
to him each time as "Zig."

'Mondo Hernandez confirms on-record that Vince's screener voice sounds like
someone talking around a huge bong hit.

NexGen (a Clear Channel product) displays a Richterish-looking sound wave, of
which all different sizes of individual bits can be highlighted and erased in
order to tighten the pacing and compress the sound bite. It's different from
'Mondo's Cashbox, which tightens things automatically according to pre-set
specs; using NexGen requires true artistry. Emiliano knows the distinctive
vocal wave patterns of George W. Bush, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and
certain others well enough that he can recognize them on the screen without
any sound or ID. He is so good at using NexGen that he manages to make the
whole high-stress Cut Sheet thing look dull.

'Mondo and Vince clearly enjoy each other, exchanging "puto" and "chilango"
with brotherly ease. When Vince takes a couple days off, it becomes difficult
to get 'Mondo to say anything about anything, Doritos or no.

Q (based on seeing some awfully high minute-counts in some people's colored
boxes on Vince's display): How long will callers wait to get on the air.'?
Emiliano Limon: "We get some who'll wait for the whole show. [Laughs] If
they're driving, what else do they have to do?"

Q: If a drunk driver calls in, do you have to notify the police or something?

A: "Well, this is why screening is tricky. You'll get, say, somebody calling
in saying they're going to commit suicide--sometimes you have to refer the
call. But sometimes you're getting pranked. Keep in mind, we're in an area
with a lot of actors and actresses anxious to practice their craft. [Now his
feet really are up on the table.] I remember we had Ross Perot call in one
time, it sounded just like him, and actually he really was due to be on the
show but not for an hour, and now he's calling saying he needs to be on right
now because of a schedule change. Very convincing, sounded just like him, and
I had to go, 'Uh, Mr. Perot, what's the name of your assistant press liaison?'
Because I'd just talked to her a couple days prior. And he's [doing vocal
impression]: 'Listen here, you all going to put me on the air or not?' And
I'm: 'Umm, Mr. Perot, if you understand the question, please answer the
question.' And he hangs up. [Laughs] But you would have sworn this was Ross
Perot."

Some of his personal reasons for this have been made clear. But the Simpson
case also rings a lot of professional cherries for Mr. Ziegler as a host:
sports, celebrity, race, racism, PC and the "race card" the legal profession,
the U.S. justice system, sex, misogyny, miscegenation, and a lack of shame and
personal accountability that Mr. Z. sees as just plain evil.

This annoys Alan LaGreen of Air-watch enough to cause him to snap at 'Mondo on
an off-air channel (mainly because Alan LaGreen now ends up having to be the
KFI Traffic Center during an interval in which he's supposed to be the Traffic
Center for some country station); plus it pushes 'Mondo's skills . with the
Cashbox right to their limit in the hour's segment four.

It turns out to be impossible, off the air, to Q & A Mr. Ziegler about his
certainty re O.J.'s guilt. Bring up anything that might sound like
reservations, and Mr. Z, won't say a word--he'll angle his head way over to
the side and look at you as if he can't tell whether you're trying to jerk him
around or you're simply out of your mind.

It's different if you ask about O.J. Simpson l'homme, or about specific
details of his psyche and marriage and lifestyle and golf game and horrible
crimes. For instance, John Ziegler has a detailed and fairly
plausible-sounding theory about O.J.'s motive for the murders, which boils
down to Simpson's jealous rage over his ex-wife's having slept with Mr. Marcus
Allen, a former Heisman Trophy winner and current (as of '94) NFL star. Mr. Z.
can defend this theory with an unreproduceably long index of facts, names, and
media citations, all of which you can ask him about if you keep your face and
tone neutral and simply write down what he says without appearing to quibble
or object or in any way question the host's authority on the subject.

(For instance, you cannot ask something like whether Ms. Simpson's liaison
with Marcus Allen is a documented fact or just part of Mr. Z.'s theory--this
will immediately terminate the Q & A.)

In case memories of the trial have dimmed, Mr. Z. is referring here to the
defense team's famous playing of the race card, the suggestion that the LAPD
wanted to frame O.J. because he was a miscegenating black, etc.

TINY EDITORIAL CORRECTION Umm, four hundred?

[Graphic omitted]John Ziegler is now screeching-except that's not quite the
right word. Pitch and volume have both risen ('Mondo's at the channel 7
controls trying to forestall peaking), but his tone is meant to connote a mix
of incredulity and outrage, with the same ragged edge to the stressed
syllables as--no kidding--Jackson's and Sharpton's. Daryl of Temecula,
meantime, has been silenced by the sheer passion of the host's soliloquy ...
and we should note that Daryl really has stopped speaking; it's not that Mr.
Z. has turned off the volume on the caller's line (which is within his power,
and which some talk-radio hosts do a lot, but Mr. Z. does not treat callers
this way).

(Mr. Z. means the first black person--he's now so impassioned he's skipping
words. [It never once sounds like babbling, though.])

(voice breaking a bit here)

EDITORIAL OPINION Again, it's nothing so simple as that he doth protest too
much; but it would be less discomfiting if Mr. Z. didn't feel he could so
totally assure Daryl of this--i.e., if Mr. Z. weren't so certain that his
views are untainted by racism Not to mention that the assurance resonates
strangely against all the host's vented spleen about a black man's "selling
out his race" by "pretending to be white." Not, again, that Mr. Z. wears a
pointy hood--but he seems weirdly unconscious of the fact that Simpson's
ostensible betrayal of his race is something that only a member of that race
really has the right to get angry about. No? If a white person gets angry
about a black person's "pretending to be white," doesn't the anger come off
far less as sympathy with the person's betrayed race than as antipathy for
somebody who's trying to crash a party he doesn't belong at? (Or is Mr. Z.
actually to be admired here for not giving a damn about how his anger comes
off, for not buying into any of that
it's-okay-for-a-black-person-to-say-it-but-not-okay-for-a-white-person stuff?
And if so, why is it that his "selling out" complaints seem creepy and obtuse
instead of admirable [although, of course, how his complaints "seem" might
simply depend on the politics and sensitivities of the individual listener
(such that the whole thing becomes not so much stimulating as exhausting)]?)

Is it wimpy or white-guiltish to believe that we're all at least a little bit
racist in some of our attitudes or beliefs, or at any rate that it's not
impossible that we are?

(Better than "the right" here might be "the rhetorical authority.")

The standard of professionalism in talk radio is one hour of prep for each
hour on the air. But Mr. Ziegler, whose specialty in media criticism entails
extra-massive daily consumption of Internet and cable news, professes to be
"pretty much always prepping," at least during the times he's not asleep
(3:00-10:00 A.M.) or playing golf (which since he's moved to LA he does just
about every day, quite possibly by himself--all he'll say about it is "I have
no life here").

There is also another large TV in the prep room, this one wired to a TiVo
digital recording system so that anything from the day's cable news can be
tagged, copied, and loaded into NexGen and Prophet. The TV gets only one
channel at a time, but apparently certain cable stuff can also be accessed on
one of the prep-room computers by a producer who knows what he's doing

Examples of volumes pulled at random from the tabletops' clutter: Dwight
Nichols's God's Plans for Your Finances, the Hoover Institution's Education
and Capitalism: How Overcoming Our Fear of Markets and Economics Can Improve
America's Schools, and Louis Barajas's The Latino Journey to Financial
Greatness.

(who's usually long gone by the time the JZS staff starts prepping)

"You're going to need to kick some ass tonight, bud," Mr. Z. tells Vince as he
highlights bites in a transcript of Daryl's call, eliciting something very
close to a salute.

Nobody ever ribs Mr. Z. about the manual golf-ball thing vis-a-vis, say,
Captain Queeg's famous ball bearings. It is not that he wouldn't get the
allusion; Mr. Z. is just not the sort of person one kids around with this way.
After one mid-May appearance on Scarborough Country, re some San Diego
schoolteachers getting suspended for showing the Nick Berg decapitation video
in class, a certain unnamed person had tried joshing around with him, in an
offhand and lighthearted way, about a supposed very small facial tic that had
kept appearing unbeknownst to John Ziegler whenever he'd used the phrase
"wussification of America" on-camera; and Mr. Z. was, let's just say,
unamused, and gave the person a look that chilled him to the marrow.

(negotiated ahead of time with Vince as the price for letting a mute,
unobtrusive outside party observe tonight's prep)

'Mondo eventually starts taking plates of food back into Airmix with him.

(a UC-Irvine undergrad, name omitted)

(meaning the Bundy Drive crime scene, which Mr. Z. has evidently walked every
inch of)

'Mondo can neither confirm nor deny that these supposedly outraged uninitiated
callers are maybe themselves fakes, just more disembodied voices that Hendrie
and his staff are creating, and that maybe the real dupes are us, the
initiated audience, for believing that the callers are genuine dupes. 'Mondo
has not, he confesses, ever considered this possibility, but he agrees that it
would constitute "a serious mind-luck" for KFI listeners.

(which Vince was able to find online, but which had to be specially
reconfigured and printed in order to restore the original line breaks and
transcript format of, this being one cause of all the running around between
8:00 and 8:30, as well as another reason why it took the JZS intern so long to
finish his quatrain, which he is even now fidgeting in his chair and trying to
decide on just the right moment to show to Mr. Z.)

Sure enough, within just weeks Emiliano Limon will have left KFI for a job at
New York's WCBS.

[Graphic omitted]It is a medical commonplace that bananas are good for ulcers.

Vince's broad back is now to the TV and everyone I around it as he uploads
real-time TiVo feed into NexGen and edits per his host's written specs.

All of this John Ziegler will and does say on his program--although what no
one in the prep room can know is that a second-hour Airwatch flash on the
imminent death of Ronald W. Reagan will cut short Mr. Z.'s analysis and
require a total, on-the-fly change of both subject and mood.

(who is in so many ways the efficient cause, ideologically and statutorily, of
today's partisan media, and whose passing will turn out to be June's true
Monster ...)

The only bit of genuine fun is during the interview's first commercial break,
when the opening ad is for Hertz--Hertz, of old
O.J.-running-through-airports-spots fame--and Mr. Z. throws his head back and
asks if he's really seeing what he's seeing. Even Vince turns around in his
chair ! to look. Hertz's placement of an ad here is a brilliant, disgusting,
unforgettable piece of metameta-media marketing. It's impossible not to laugh
... and yet Mr. Z. doesn't. (Neither do the room's two interns, though that's
only because they're too young to get the meta-reference.)

EDITORIALIZING, OR JUST STATING THE OBVIOUS? Plus there's the creepy question
of why O.J. Simpson is doing a murder-anniversary TV interview at all. What on
earth does he stand to gain from sitting there on-camera and letting tens of
millions of people search his big face for guilt or remorse? Why subject
himself to America's ghoulish fascination? And make no mistake: it is
fascinating. The interview and face are riveting television entertainment.
It's almost impossible to look away, or not to feel that special kind of
guilty excitement in the worst, most greedy and indecent parts of yourself.
You can really feel it--this is why drivers slow down to gape at accidents,
why reporters put mikes in the faces of bereaved relatives, why the Haidl
gang-rape trial is a hit single that merits heavy play, why the cruelest forms
of reality TV and tabloid news and talk radio generate such numbers. But that
doesn't mean the fascination is good, or even feels good. Aren't there parts
of ourselves that are just better left unfed? If it's true that there are, and
that we sometimes choose what we wish we wouldn't, then there is a very
serious unanswered question at the heart of KFI's Sweeper: "More Stimulating"
of what?

For instance, it's troubling that her delivery is that of someone who's
choosing her words with great care, when clearly the words have already been
chosen, the question scripted. Which would seem to mean she's acting.

(It goes without saying that this is just one person's opinion.)

David Foster Wallace is the author of several books, including Infinite Jest,
A supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, and Oblivion.

By DAVID FOSTER WALLACE

Published: November 7, 2004

THERE'S an unhappy paradox about literary biographies. The majority of readers who will be interested in a writer's bio, especially one as long and exhaustive as Edwin Williamson's ''Borges: A Life,'' will be admirers of the writer's work. They will therefore usually be idealizers of that writer and perpetrators (consciously or not) of the intentional fallacy. Part of the appeal of the writer's work for these fans will be the distinctive stamp of that writer's personality, predilections, style, particular tics and obsessions -- the sense that these stories were written by this author and could have been done by no other.* And yet it often seems that the person we encounter in the literary biography could not possibly have written the works we admire. And the more intimate and thorough the bio, the stronger this feeling usually is. In the present case, the Jorge Luis Borges who emerges in Williamson's book -- a vain, timid, pompous mama's boy, given for much of his life to dithery romantic obsessions -- is about as different as one can get from the limpid, witty, pansophical, profoundly adult writer we know from his stories. Rightly or no, anyone who reveres Borges as one of the best and most important fiction writers of the last century will resist this dissonance, and will look, as a way to explain and mitigate it, for obvious defects in Williamson's life study. The book won't disappoint them.

Edwin Williamson is an Oxford don and esteemed Hispanist whose ''Penguin History of Latin America'' is a small masterpiece of lucidity and triage. It is therefore unsurprising that his ''Borges'' starts strong, with a fascinating sketch of Argentine history and the Borges family's place within it. For Williamson, the great conflict in the Argentine national character is that between the ''sword'' of civilizing European liberalism and the ''dagger'' of romantic gaucho individualism, and he argues that Borges's life and work can be properly understood only in reference to this conflict, particularly as it plays out in his childhood. In the 19th century, grandfathers on both sides of his family distinguished themselves in important battles for South American independence from Spain and the establishment of a centralized Argentine government, and Borges's mother was obsessed with the family's historical glory. Borges's father, a man stunted by the heroic paternal shadow in which he lived, evidently did things like give his son an actual dagger to use on bullies at school, and later sent him to a brothel for devirgination. The young Borges failed both these ''tests,'' the scars of which marked him forever and show up all over the place in his fiction, Williamson thinks.

It is in these claims about personal stuff encoded in the writer's art that the book's real defect lies. In fairness, it's just a pronounced case of a syndrome that seems common to literary biographies, so common that it might point to a design flaw in the whole enterprise. The big problem with ''Borges: A Life'' is that Williamson is an atrocious reader of Borges's work; his interpretations amount to a simplistic, dishonest kind of psychological criticism. You can see why this problem might be intrinsic to the genre. A biographer wants his story to be not only interesting but literarily valuable.** In order to ensure this, the bio has to make the writer's personal life and psychic travails seem vital to his work. The idea is that we can't correctly interpret a piece of verbal art unless we know the personal and/or psychological circumstances surrounding its creation. That this is simply assumed as an axiom by many biographers is one problem; another is that the approach works a lot better on some writers than on others. It works well on Kafka -- Borges's only modern equal as an allegorist, with whom he's often compared -- because Kafka's fictions are expressionist, projective, and personal; they make artistic sense only as manifestations of Kafka's psyche. But Borges's stories are very different. They are designed primarily as metaphysical arguments; they are dense, self-enclosed, with their own deviant logics. Above all, they are meant to be impersonal, to transcend individual consciousness -- ''to be incorporated,'' as Borges puts it, ''like the fables of Theseus or Ahasuerus, into the general memory of the species and even transcend the fame of their creator or the extinction of the language in which they were written.'' One reason for this is that Borges is a mystic, or at least a sort of radical Neoplatonist -- human thought, behavior and history are all the product of one big Mind, or are elements of an immense cabalistic Book that includes its own decoding. Biography-wise, then, we have a strange situation in which Borges's individual personality and circumstances matter only insofar as they lead him to create artworks in which such personal facts are held to be unreal. 

"'Borges: A Life,'' which is strongest in its treatments of Argentine history and politics, is at its very worst when Williamson is discussing specific pieces in light of Borges's personal life. Unfortunately, he discusses just about everything Borges ever wrote. Williamson's critical thesis is clear: ''Bereft of a key to their autobiographical context, no one could have grasped the vivid significance these pieces actually had for their author.'' And in case after case, the resultant readings are shallow, forced and distorted -- as indeed they must be if the biographer's project is to be justified. Random example: ''The Wait,'' a marvelous short-short that appears in the 1949 story collection ''The Aleph,'' takes the form of a layered homage to Hemingway, gangster movies and the Buenos Aires underworld. An Argentine mobster, in hiding from another mobster and living under the pursuer's name, dreams so often of his killers' appearance in his bedroom that, when the assassins finally come for him, he ''gestured at them to wait, and he turned over and faced the wall, as though going back to sleep. Did he do that to awaken the pity of the men that killed him, or because it's easier to endure a terrifying event than to imagine it, wait for it endlessly -- or (and this is perhaps the most likely possibility) so that his murderers would become a dream, as they had already been so many times, in that same place, at that same hour?''

The distant interrogative ending -- a Borges trademark -- becomes an inquisition into dreams, reality, guilt, augury and mortal terror. For Williamson, though, the real key to the story's significance appears to be that ''Borges had failed to win the love of Estela Canto. . . . With Estela gone, there seemed nothing to live for,'' and he represents the story's ending all and only as a depressed whimper: ''When his killers finally track him down, he just rolls over meekly to face the wall and resigns himself to the inevitable.''

It is not merely that Williamson reads every last thing in Borges's oeuvre as a correlative of the author's emotional state. It is that he tends to reduce all of Borges's psychic conflicts and personal problems to the pursuit of women. Williamson's theory here involves two big elements: Borges's inability to stand up to his domineering mother, and his belief, codified in a starry-eyed reading of Dante, that ''it was the love of a woman that alone could deliver him from the hellish unreality he shared with his father and inspire him to write a masterpiece that would justify his life.'' Story after story is thus interpreted by Williamson as a coded dispatch on Borges's amorous career, which career turns out to be sad, timorous, puerile, moony and (like most people's) extremely boring. The formula is applied equally to famous pieces, such as '' 'The Aleph' (1945), whose autobiographical subtext alludes to his thwarted love for Norah Lange,'' and to lesser-known stories like ''The Zahir'':

''The torments described by Borges in this story . . . are, of course, displaced confessions of the extremity of his plight. Estela [Canto, who'd just broken up with him] was to have been the 'new Beatrice,' inspiring him to create a work that would be 'the Rose without purpose, the Platonic, intemporal Rose,' but here he was again, sunk in the unreality of the labyrinthine self, with no prospect now of contemplating the mystic Rose of love.''

Thin though this kind of explication is, it's preferable to the reverse process by which Williamson sometimes presents Borges's stories and poems as ''evidence'' that he was in emotional extremities. Williamson's claim, for instance, that in 1934, ''after his definitive rejection by Norah Lange, Borges . . . came to the brink of killing himself'' is based entirely on two tiny pieces of contemporaneous fiction in which the protagonists struggle with suicide. Not only is this a bizarre way to read and reason -- was the Flaubert who wrote ''Madame Bovary'' eo ipso suicidal? -- but Williamson seems to believe that it licenses him to make all sorts of dubious, humiliating claims about Borges's interior life: ''A poem called 'The Cyclical Night' . . . which he published in La Nacion on October 6, reveals him to be in the throes of a personal crisis''; ''In the extracts from this unfinished poem . . . we can see that the reason for wishing to commit suicide was literary failure, stemming ultimately from sexual self-doubt.'' Bluck. 

Again, it is primarily because of Borges's short stories that anyone will care enough to read about his life. And while Williamson spends a lot of time detailing the explosive success that Borges enjoyed in middle age, after the 1961 International Publishers' Prize (shared with Samuel Beckett) introduced his work to audiences in the United States and Europe, there is little in his book about just why Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) is an important enough fiction writer to deserve such a microscopic bio. The truth, briefly stated, is that Borges is arguably the great bridge between modernism and post-modernism in world literature. He is modernist in that his fiction shows a first-rate human mind stripped of all foundations in religious or ideological certainty -- a mind turned thus wholly in on itself. His stories are inbent and hermetic, with the oblique terror of a game whose rules are unknown and its stakes everything.

And the mind of those stories is nearly always a mind that lives in and through books. This is because Borges the writer is, fundamentally, a reader. The dense, obscure allusiveness of his fiction is not a tic, or even really a style; and it is no accident that his best stories are often fake essays, or reviews of fictitious books, or have texts at their plots' centers, or have as protagonists Homer or Dante or Averroes. Whether for seminal artistic reasons or neurotic personal ones or both, Borges collapses reader and writer into a new kind of aesthetic agent, one who makes stories out of stories, one for whom reading is essentially -- consciously -- a creative act. This is not, however, because Borges is a metafictionist or a cleverly disguised critic. It is because he knows that there's finally no difference -- that murderer and victim, detective and fugitive, performer and audience are the same. Obviously, this has postmodern implications (hence the pontine claim above), but Borges's is really a mystical insight, and a profound one. It's also frightening, since the line between monism and solipsism is thin and porous, more to do with spirit than with mind per se. And, as an artistic program, this kind of collapse/transcendence of individual identity is also paradoxical, requiring a grotesque self-obsession combined with an almost total effacement of self and personality. Tics and obsessions aside, what makes a Borges story Borgesian is the odd, ineluctable sense you get that no one and everyone did it. This is why, for instance, it is so irksome to see Williamson describe ''The Immortal'' and ''The Writing of the God'' -- two of the greatest, most scalp-crinkling mystical stories ever, next to which the epiphanies of Joyce or redemptions of O'Connor seem pallid and crude -- as respective products of Borges's ''many-layered distress'' and ''indifference to his fate'' after various idealized girlfriends dump him. Stuff like this misses the whole point. Even if Williamson's claims are true, the stories so completely transcend their motive cause that the biographical facts become, in the deepest and most literal way, irrelevant.

*Of course, Borges's famous ''Pierre Menard, Author of the 'Quixote' '' makes sport of this very conviction, just as his later ''Borges and I'' anticipates and refutes the whole idea of a literary biography. The fact that his fiction is always several steps ahead of its interpreters is one of the things that make Borges so great, and so modern.

**Actually, these two agendas dovetail, since the only reason anybody's interested in a writer's life is because of his literary importance. (Think about it -- the personal lives of most people who spend 14 hours a day sitting there alone, reading and writing, are not going to be thrill rides to hear about.)

This is part of what gives Borges's stories their mythic, precognitive quality (all cultures' earliest, most vital metaphysics is mythopoetic), which quality in turn helps explain how they can be at once so abstract and so moving.

The biography is probably most valuable in its account of Borges's political evolution. A common bit of literary gossip about Borges is that the reason he wasn't awarded a Nobel Prize was his supposed support for Argentina's ghastly authoritarian juntas of the 1960's and 70's. From Williamson, though, we learn that Borges's politics were actually far more complex and tragic. The child of an old liberal family, and an unabashed leftist in his youth, Borges was one of the first and bravest public opponents of European fascism and the rightist nationalism it spawned in Argentina. What changed him was Peron, whose creepy right-wing populist dictatorship aroused such loathing in Borges that he allied himself with the repressively anti-Peron Revolucion Libertadora. Borges's situation following Peron's first ouster in 1955 is full of unsettling parallels for American readers. Because Peronism still had great popularity with Argentina's working poor, the exiled dictator retained enormous political power, and would have won any democratic national election held in the 1950's. This placed believers in liberal democracy (such as J. L. Borges) in the same sort of bind that the United States faced in South Vietnam a few years later -- how do you promote democracy when you know that a majority of people will, if given the chance, vote for an end to democratic voting? In essence, Borges decided that the Argentine masses had been so hoodwinked by Peron and his wife that a return to democracy was possible only after the nation had been cleansed of Peronism. Williamson's analysis of the slippery slope this decision put Borges on, and his account of the hatchet job that Argentina's leftists did on Borges's political reputation in retaliation for his defection (such that by 1967, when the writer came to Harvard to lecture, the students practically expected him to have epaulettes and a riding crop), make for his book's best chapters.

 Be warned that much of the mom-based psychologizing seems right out of ''Oprah'': e.g., ''However, by urging her son to realize the ambitions she had defined for herself, she unwittingly induced a sense of unworthiness in him that became the chief obstacle to his self-assertion.''

Williamson's chapters on Borges's sudden world fame will be of special interest to those American readers who weren't yet alive or reading in the mid-1960's. I was lucky enough to discover Borges as a child, but only because I happened to find ''Labyrinths,'' an early English-language collection of his most famous stories, on my father's bookshelves in 1974. I believed that the book was there only because of my parents' unusually fine taste and discernment -- which verily they do possess -- but what I didn't know was that by 1974 ''Labyrinths'' was also on tens of thousands of other homes' shelves in this country, that Borges had actually been a sensation on the order of Tolkien and Gibran among hip readers of the previous decade.

 Labyrinths, mirrors, dreams, doubles -- so many of the elements that appear over and over in Borges's fiction are symbols of the psyche turned inward.

Past the flannel plains and blacktop graphs and skylines of canted rust, and
past the tobacco-brown river overhung with weeping trees and coins of sunlight
through them on the water downriver, to the place beyond the windbreak, where
untilled fields simmer shrilly in the A.M. heat: shattercane, lambsquarter,
cutgrass, saw brier, nutgrass, jimsonweed, wild mint, dandelion, foxtail,
spinecabbage, goldenrod, creeping charlie, butterprint, nightshade, ragweed,
wild oat, vetch, butcher grass, invaginate volunteer beans, all heads nodding
in a soft morning breeze like a mother's hand on your cheek. An arrow of
starlings fired from the windbreak's thatch. The glitter of dew that stays
where it is and steams all day. A sunflower, four more, one bowed, and horses
in the distance standing rigid as toys. All nodding. Electric sounds of
insects at their business. Ale-colored sunshine and pale sky and whorls of
cirrus so high they cast no shadow. Insects all business all the time. Quartz
and chert and schist and chondrite iron scabs in granite. Very old land. Look
around you. The horizon trembling, shapeless. We are all of us brothers.

Some crows come overhead then, four, silent with intent, on the wing,
corn-bound for the pasture's wire, where one horse smells at the other's
behind, the lead horse's tail obligingly lifted. Your shoes' brand incised in
the dew. An alfalfa breeze. Socks' burrs. Dry scratching inside a culvert.
Rusted wire and canted posts more a symbol of restraint than a fence per se.
NO HUNTING. The shush of the interstate off past the windbreak. The pasture's
crows standing at angles, turning up patties to get at the worms underneath,
the shapes of the worms incised in the overturned dung and baked by the sun
all day until hardened, there to stay, tiny vacant lines in rows and inset
curls that do not close because head never quite touches tail. Read these.

--ST. AUGUSTINE

Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of U.S. lexicography reveals
ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a
nearly hanging-chad scale? For instance, did you know that some modern
dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and
that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as
corrective responses to the "corruption" and "permissiveness" of certain
liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special
"Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and
writers" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and
traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage
Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a
seamy underbelly?

The occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release
of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the
matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most
comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English
Usage, now a decade out of date.(1) Its format, like that of Gilman and the
handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes
entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap
MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But
the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern
American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is
impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's
management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical
contexts(2) in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a
veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical
linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies
take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes
Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar
can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole
harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define
the highly colloquial term SNOOT.

From one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new
book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested
in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that
offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the
Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American
citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and
ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS
(twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The
sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering
superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE--10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used
as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely
have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for
people like this--Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language
Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT.(3) The word might be slightly
self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be
defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting
you know it.

I submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly
elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America,
and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the
skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the
totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and
the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that
unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's
purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite
withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape
language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have
anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals;
Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate
phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we
know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care,
and we judge them accordingly.

In ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about
contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about
contemporary culture:(4) We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith
in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at
the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated
people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers
and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch
and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most
people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound
nails. We(5) are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.

THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE

Issues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political
issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms
a "Democratic Spirit." A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and
humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the
convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit
to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel
strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent
intellectual integrity--you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself
and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less
continually.

This kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is
up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other
top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives
working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty
are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost
irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to
follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within
the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either
evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over
them.

I submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic,
especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit
further that the issues surrounding "correctness" in contemporary American
usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions
they involve are ones whose answers have to be "worked out" instead of simply
found.

A distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge
that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the
record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very
difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a
Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises
Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine "authority" on issues of
usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very
weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we
as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated
Americans would say, still in process at this time.

A Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished
Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan
Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer
(which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His
1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now,
instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars
for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's
also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society,(6) a worldwide
group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped
from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and
very hard-core SNOOT.

The lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm
Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing,
whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial
persona--the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself--Garner gives us an
almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:
   I realized early at the age of 15(7)--that my primary intellectual interest
   was the use of the English language.... It became an all-consuming'
   passion.... I read everything I could find on the subject. Then, on a
   wintry evening while visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered
   Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled. Never had I held a
   more exciting book.... Suffice it to say that by the time I was 18, I had
   committed to memory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....

Although this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather
significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is
English usage,(8) the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of
the Preface, one that Garner entitles "First Principles": "Before going any
further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author
of a usage dictionary to do--unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to
good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users
should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of
full disclosure ..."(9)

The "unprecedented" and "full disclosure" here are actually good-natured digs
at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars
that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously
liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and
included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on
them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the
contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a
very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and
without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is
both so good and so sneaky.

We regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative
guidance.(10) Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in
The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed
"substandard" or "incorrect." Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to
decide what's OK(11) and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And
simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's
considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the
second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation--"You is." Earlier still,
the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't you but thou. Huge numbers of now acceptable
words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage
authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage
conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still
be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are
corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to
say, why should we believe them?

These sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency.
America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of
language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced
everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an
influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English
grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the
ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities
boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic
article--"Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no
matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by
the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations"--or, at a
somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got
That Way:
   Who sets down all those rules that we all know about from childhood the
   idea that we must never end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with
   a conjunction, that we must use each other for two things and one another
   for more than two ...? The answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,
   that when you look into the background of these "rules" there is often
   little basis for them.

In ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a
Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's
cunning and exemplify it:
   As you might already suspect, I don't shy away from making judgments. I
   can't imagine that most readers would want me to. Linguists don't like it,
   of course, because judgment involves subjectivity.(12) It isn't scientific.
   But rhetoric and usage, in the view of most professional writers, aren't
   scientific endeavors. You don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want
   sound guidance. And that requires judgment.

Whole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this
passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in "I don't
shy away from making judgments" vs. "And that requires judgment." Suffice it
to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in
modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit
rhetorical.

So ...

COROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE

The most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both
lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in
classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the
Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are
affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated
"Trust me." It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively
American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us
not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic
decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and
fears.(13)

These are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT
usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and
bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like
American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's "The
arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely,
`irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect" or critic John Simon's
"The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once
handled their merchandise...." Compare those lines' authorial personas with
Garner's in, e.g., "English usage is so challenging that even experienced
writers need guidance now and then."

The thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage
earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The
book's "feel-good" spirit (in the very best sense of "feel-good") marries
rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely
prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is
an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical
accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this
reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at
the Usage Wars.

You'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little
introductory essays in modern dictionaries--pieces like Webster's DEU's "A
Brief History of English Usage" or Webster's Third's "Linguistic Advances and
Lexicography" or AHD-3's "Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place
of Criticism." But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and
it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be
hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me
or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell
(for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics,
and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're
salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip
Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural
linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to
conservatives who howled(14) when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described
ain't as "used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers
[sic]" was this: "A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial
notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not
prescriptive." These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic
conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic
liberals as Descriptivists.

The former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Satire
or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John
Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a
genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of
whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel
Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in
the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and
Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the
mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin
Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a
kid.(15)

Descriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times.
These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists.
Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or "descriptive")
linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual
roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their
ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention
Garner's Preface gives this crew--
   Somewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries got hijacked by the
   descriptive linguists.(16) who observe language scientifically. For the
   pure descriptivist, it's impermissible to say that one form of language is
   any better than another: as long as a native speaker says it, it's OK--and
   anyone who takes a contrary stand is a dunderhead.... Essentially,
   descriptivists and prescriptivists are approaching different problems.
   Descriptivists want to record language as it's actually used, and they
   perform a useful function--though their audience is generally limited to
   those willing to pore through vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.

--is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the "approaching different
problems" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on
U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over
English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior
high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively--via "freewriting,"
"brainstorming," "journaling," a view of writing as self-exploratory and
-expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic
grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very
language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and
environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed
by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and
perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males(17) and is thus inherently capitalist,
sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think
of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun,
or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies
around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of
things---"Affirmative Action" vs. "Reverse Discrimination," "Pro-Life" vs.
"Pro-Choice," "Undercount" vs. "Vote Fraud," etc.

The Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it.
The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two
main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of
technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method--clinically
objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable
hypothesis--that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the
standards Of "correct" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such
standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's
Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts: "1--Language
changes constantly; 2--Change is normal; 3--Spoken language is the language;
4--Correctness rests upon usage; 5--All usage is relative."

These principles look prima facie OK--commonsensical and couched in the bland
simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science--but in fact they're vague and
muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to
each one of them, viz.:

1--OK, but how much and how fast?

2--Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ?
Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than
others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before
we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?

3--This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's
specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing
else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary
instantiation.(18) Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t
correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about
spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written
English.(19)

4--Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to
imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation
between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally
corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to
correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again,
fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners?
Appalachian Neogaelics?

5--Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's
whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the
above "which people?" is: "All of them!" And it's easy to show why this will
not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it
is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't
observe every last bit of every last native speaker's "language behavior," and
even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and
have to be updated hourly.(20) The fact is that any lexicographer is going to
have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices
are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.

It is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look
for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem
awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists'
"scientific lexicography"--under which, keep in mind, the ideal English
dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic
act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all
these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary--involves an
incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what scientific means. It
requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the
physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has
shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and
is analytically inseparable from it.

If you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that
points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with
interpretation. Recall the New Critics.(21) They believed that literary
criticism was best conceived as a "scientific" endeavor: The critic was a
neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and
objectively describe meanings that were right there--literally inside--pieces
of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's
reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice
it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem
as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant
the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could
exist "objectively," separate from any interpretive act.

The point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are
now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that
underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and
displaced--in Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response
Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of
Pragmatics--and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is
inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation
is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular
ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around
it--decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are
going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got
one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology
is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be
called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.

There's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that
the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:

Even if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century
scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of
natural phenomena might be biased(22) the natural phenomena themselves can be
supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or
interpretation--no such realist supposition can be made about "language
behavior," because this behavior is both hum, an and fundamentally normative.
To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is
by its very nature public--i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private
Language(23) and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem
either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for
example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third
called The American College Dictionary:
   A dictionary can be an "authority" only in the sense in which a book of
   chemistry or of physics or of botany can be an "authority" by the accuracy
   and the completeness of its record of the observed facts of the field
   examined, in accord with the latest principles and techniques of the
   particular science.

This is so stupid it practically drools. An "authoritative" physics text
presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories
about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist
principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better
downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above
the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill
Theory to be included as a "valid" theory in the textbook--just as, for Dr.
Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto
"valid" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are
not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the
importance of "observed facts." It isn't scientific phenomena they're
tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors
are--to be blunt--moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an "authoritative"
ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.

Norm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our
hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do.
Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes:(24) "That mushroom
is poisonous"; "Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire";
"This shelter is mine!" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve
over time, they discover that some ways of using language are "better" than
others--meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume
that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to
eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an
important norm:

People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick" confuses the recipient
about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or
whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats
it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding
this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain
percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s
a good idea.

Maybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people
sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't
mean that they think those things are "good." The whole point of norms is to
help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a
community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this
analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at
norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on
what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption
that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to--well, have a
mushroom.

The connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues
into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which
specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no
particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that
gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for
this is "the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign," and it's used, along with
certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more
philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the
conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual
norms. This "Philosophical Descriptivism" doesn't care much about dictionaries
or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra--that prescriptive
rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its
language meaningful.

The argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the
same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions
as "Did you seen the car keys of me?" or "The show was looked by many people"
are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate
the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody
who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes
these sorts of very deep syntactic errors(25) and you get the basic
proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there
exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that
there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this
Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and
dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and
support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists
and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with
them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the
Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of
language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE
prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basical ly
the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As
Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, "When a scientist considers all the
high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences,
prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations."

This argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological
Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one
is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it
simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of
these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction
against twoway adverbs ("People who eat this often get sick") is an obvious
example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers ("There are
many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others") and about relative
pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify ("She's the mother of an infant
daughter who works twelve hours a day").

Granted, the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely
necessary these rules are it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like
the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on
either side or from the "overall context" or whatever. A listener can usually
figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate
for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra
nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process,
before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra
work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the
recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses
like the above, it simply seems more "considerate" to follow the rules of
correct SWE ... just as it's more "considerate" to de-slob your home before
entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just
more considerate but more respectful somehow--both of your listener and of
what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of
fashion and etiquette, the way you use English "Makes a Statement" or "Sends a
Message"--even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with
the actual information you're trying to transmit.

We've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical
Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly
dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the
traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but "inconsequential
decorations." Another way to state the objection is that just because
something is "decorative" does not necessarily make it "inconsequential."
Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very
question it begs: inconsequential to whom?

Take, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English
usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are
arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are
(like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around
pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100
percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest
to you that having the "correct" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants
instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts),
restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on
archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about
gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar),
and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more
comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the
genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular
sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc.
etc.). Let us grant--as a thought experiment if nothing else--that these are
all reasortable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm.
Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes--shout yes--to the skirt, the
kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare
time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary
prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and
aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.

And yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial
America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even
if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and
genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in
100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to
the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that
child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to
wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent
confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly
discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt
manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself--you're going to stand over your kid and
be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and
inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern
America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all
season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a
Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are
important to him.(26) In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt
is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and
emotional consequences.

You see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the
pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic--doubtless there are whole
books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking
this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs
deploy it in the Wars.(27)

When I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different
things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information
I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me,
the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there
are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g.
"I was attacked by a bear!" to "Goddamn bear tried to kill me!" to "That
ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!" and so on. And different
levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction;
things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication
where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a
familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're
in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to
terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very
delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle
it: "Wow, look at the time"; "Could we finish this up later?"; "Could you
please leave now?"; "Go"; "Get out"; "Get the hell out of here"; "Didn't you
say you had to be someplace?"; "Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my
friend"; "Off you go then, love"; or that sly old telephone-conversation
ender: "Well, I'm going to let you go now"; etc.(n) And then think of all the
different factors and implications of each option.

The point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly
reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary
vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do "judge" one another according
to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on
the basis of all kinds of things--weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make
of vehicle(28)--and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and
occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one
component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance,
meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or
rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody
else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to
acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very
abstract terms: "Correct" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function
of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond--not just to
your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of
any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call
"Audience" or "Discourse Community."(29) And the United States obviously has a
huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or
cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern,
Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston
BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone
knows--especially not certain Prescriptivists--is that many of these non-SWE
dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars,
and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more
linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see
INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects
based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or
ethnicity--Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely
English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-WhoseWorldview-Is-Deeply.
Informed-By-South-Park English-and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone
who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of
course is part of their function(30)).

INTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT
THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND

This rev. happens to have two native English dialects--the SWE of my
hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my
peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the
construction "Where's it at?" instead of "Where is it?" Part of this is a
naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub).
But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms
are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.

[Graphic omitted]For a dogmatic Prescriptivist, "Where's it at?" is
double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose
final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the
redundancy in "the reason is because" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me
dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the
avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an
eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like
spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The
a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT
takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule "stuffy" and lists all kinds
of useful constructions like "the man you were listening to" that we'd have to
discard or distort if we really enforced it.

Plus the apparent redundancy of "Where's it at?"(31) is offset by its metrical
logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the
interrogative adverb. You can't say "Where's it?" So the choice is between
"Where is it?" and "Where's it at?", and the latter, a strong anapest, is
prettier and trips off the tongue better than "Where is it?", whose meter is
either a clunky monosyllabic-foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.

This is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a
certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that
people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to EM. Margaret
Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the
jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a
sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of
SNOOT, the SNOOT WhO Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for
instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled
on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic
language.(32) Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as
it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists--so enthralled with
Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in
Latin(33)--decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner
himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and
SUPERSTITIONS.(34) And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain
cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually
functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like
quickly or angrily but as a "sentence adverb" that indicates the speaker's
attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of
perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only
SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or
grade it down.

The cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by
dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and
stupid (which is a bit like pointing. to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all
Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects HopefuIly's knee-jerk proscription,
too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED
TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is "hotly disputed.., any use of
it is likely to distract some readers." (Garner also points out something I'd
never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in
the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as
other adverbs, as in the clause "I will borrow your book and hopefully read it
soon.")

Whether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one
major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at
least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends,
of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the
dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of
and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An
obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal
differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in
Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class
way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another
thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too
large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a
53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and
says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and
is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids'
reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy--most likely
a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are
standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come
up and greet them with "Yo" and call them "Brothers" and ask "s'up, s'goin
on," pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black
English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended
or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is
remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?

Why: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native
vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some
degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and
arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or
at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are--as
you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to
mention--situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the
appropriate dialect.

Childhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to
have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's
wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of
SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen
them--these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly
and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out "How incalculably
dreadful!" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest
identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly. despised by his peers
and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible
amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if
they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the
vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.

But the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all.
There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about
Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties
of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of
affinity and inclusion.(35) They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids
learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at
lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous
quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him,
there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT,
who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither
he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language
Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or
grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are
really required for "peer rapport," which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term
for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.

This reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff
getting dredged up and worked out here;(36) but the stuff is relevant. The
point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal
position as the class's "slow" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or
bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are
deficient in the same linguistic skill--viz., the ability to move between
various dialects and levels of "correctness," the ability to communicate one
way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and
another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal
adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability
to make them seems part psychological and part something else--perhaps
something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar--and in
truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's "Verbal I.Q." than
test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard
dialectal talent than to cultivate it.

Well-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar
ar),d usage much aught anymore. It s been this way for more than 20 years. The
phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they
cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and
English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned
because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply
doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard
the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp
appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was
traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.

By way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or
attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been
dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about
the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing.(37) I refer
specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English
dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance
or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of
attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just
disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the
trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's
relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in
the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or
desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given,
because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going
to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one
obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher
himself.

I'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers
to wear sunglasses and call students "Dude." What I am suggesting is that the
rhetorical situation of an English class--a class composed wholly of young
people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment
values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are
different from SWE--requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest,
compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.

These arguments are hard to make--not intellectually but emotionally,
politically. Because they are baldly elitist.(38) The real truth, of course,
is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented,
codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as
"Standard" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an
instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and
all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects
to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE
argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male
and the TeaCher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult
Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE
are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his
argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than
as a prophet of its innate superiority.

Because this argument is both most delicate and (I believe) most important
with respect to students of color, here is one version of a spiel I've given
in private conference(39) with certain black students who were (a) bright and
inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written
English facility:
   I don't know whether anybody's told you this or not, but when you're in a
   college English class you're basically studying a foreign dialect. This
   dialect is called 'Standard Written English. [Brief overview of major U.S.
   dialects a la p. 50.] From talking with you and reading your essays, I've
   concluded that your own primary dialect is [one of three variants of SBE
   common to our region]. Now, let me spell something out in my official
   Teacher-voice: The SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds
   of important ways. Some of these differences are grammatical--for example,
   double negatives are OK in Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE
   and SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different ways. Other
   differences have more to do with style--for instance, Standard Written
   English tends to use a lot more subordinate clauses in the early parts of
   sentences, and it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas,
   and, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is "choppy." There are
   tons of differences like that. How much of this stuff do you already know?
   [STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on "I know from the grades and comments
   on my papers that English profs don't think I'm a good writer."] Well, I've
   got good news and bad news. There are some otherwise smart English profs
   who aren't very aware that there are real dialects of English other than
   SWE, so when they're reading your papers they'll put, like, "Incorrect
   conjugation" or "Comma needed" instead of "SWE conjugates this verb
   differently" or "SWE calls for a comma here." That's the good news--it's
   not that you're a bad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special
   rules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe that's not such good
   news, that they were grading you 'down for mistakes in a foreign language
   you didn't even know was a foreign language. That they won't let you write
   in SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going to like this
   news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE either. In my class, you have
   to learn and write in SWE. If you want to study your own dialect and its
   rules and history and how it's different from SWE, fine--there are some
   great books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you find some and
   talk about them with you if you want. But that will be outside class. In
   class--in my English class--you will have to master and write in Standard
   Written English, which we might just as well call "Standard White English,"
   because it was developed by white people and is used by white people,
   especially educated, powerful white people. [RESPONSES by this point vary
   too widely to standardize.] I'm respecting you enough here to give you what
   I believe is the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the
   dialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige, and anybody
   of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender who wants to succeed in
   American culture has got to be able to use SWE. This is How It Is. You can
   be glad about it or sad about it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's
   racist and unjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking
   minute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you should, but
   I'll tell you something: If you ever want those arguments to get listened
   to and taken seriously, you're going to have to communicate them in SWE,
   because SWE is the dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African
   Americans who've become successful and important in U.S. culture know this;
   that's why King's and X's and Jackson's speeches are in SWE, and why
   Morrison's and Angelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books are
   full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges and politicians and
   journalists and doctors and teachers communicate professionally in SWE.
   Some of these people grew up in homes and communities where SWE was the
   native dialect, and these black people had it much easier in school, but
   the ones who didn't grow up with SWE realized at some point that they had
   to learn it and become able to write in it, and so they did. And [INSERT
   NAME HERE], you're going to learn to use it, too, because I am going to
   make you.

I should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were
offended--one lodged an Official Complaint--and that I have had more than one
colleague profess to find my spiel "racially insensitive." Perhaps you do,
too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political
realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and
offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with
euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of
ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the
status of a dialect--one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of
the Usage Wars sort of inside out.

I refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions
failing students become "high-potential" students and poor people
"economically disadvantaged" and people in wheelchairs "differently abled" and
a sentence like "White English and Black English are different and.you better
learn White English if you don't want to flunk" is not blunt but
"insensitive." Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly
people as "aesthetically challenged" and so on), be advised that Politically
Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously
indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own
institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind
of Language Police.

From one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of
Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that
informed the original Descriptivist revolution--namely, the sixties-era
rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality --have now
actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by
tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions
(termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny
in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun
of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that
prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.

Usage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With
respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in
two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on
the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions
are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them--in particular,
mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political
symbolism--By Barry Graham--enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases
to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary
that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's
central fallacy--that a society's mode of expression is productive of its
attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes--and of course it's nothing
but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social
change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage.(40)

Forget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a
grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to
be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact--in its Orwellian
substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality
itself--of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than
traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political
conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national
wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and
energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as "low-income"
or "economically disadvantaged" or "pre-prosperous" rather than constructing
effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal
tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian
euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes
offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political
change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as
a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)

As a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids
and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society
that carefully refers to him as "economically disadvantaged" rather than
"poor." Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting--not just
because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like
many forms of Vogue Usage,(41) PCE functions primarily to signal and
congratulate certain virtues in the speaker--scrupulous egalitarianism,
concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political
implications of language--and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far
more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.

INTERPOLATION ON A RELATED ISSUE IN THE FACE OF WHOSE GHASTLY MALIGNANCY THIS
REVIEWER'S DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT JUST GIVES OUT ALTOGETHER, ADMITTEDLY

This issue is Academic English, a cancer that has metastasized now to afflict
both scholarly writing--
   If such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the future as post-Fordist
   subject, his palpably masochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the
   sublime superstate need to be decoded as the "now all-but-unreadable DNA"
   of the fast industrializing Detroit, just as his Robocop-like strategy of
   carceral negotiation and street control remains the tirelessly American one
   of inflicting regeneration through violence upon the racially heteroglassic
   wilds and others of the inner city.(42)

--and prose as mainstream as The Village Voice's:
   At first encounter, the poems' distanced cerebral surfaces can be daunting,
   evading physical location or straightforward emotional arc. But this
   seeming remoteness quickly reveals a very real passion, centered in the
   speaker's struggle to define his evolving self-construction.

Maybe it's a combination of my SNOOTitude and the fact that I end up having to
read a lot of it for my job, but I'm afraid I regard Academic English not as a
dialectal variation but as a grotesque debasement of SWE, and loathe it even
more than the stilted incoherences of Presidential English ("This is the best
and only way to uncover, destroy, and prevent Iraq from reengineering weapons
of mass destruction") or the mangled pieties of BusinessSpeak ("Our Mission:
to proactively search and provide the optimum networking skills and resources
to meet the needs of your growing business"); and in support of this utter
contempt and intolerance I cite no less an authority than Mr. G. Orwell, who
50 years ago had AE pegged as a "mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence"
in which "it is normal to come across long passages which are almost
completely lacking in meaning."(43)

It probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of
PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in
part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a
vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In
other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write
primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that
his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is
to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is
to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can
maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of
obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE
sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate
doublespeak ("revenue enhancement," "downsizing," pre-owned," "proactive
resource-allocation restructuring") that it's tempting to think AE's real
purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.

The insecurity that drives AE, PCE, and vocab-tape ads is far from groundless,
though. These are tense linguistic times. Blame it on Heisenbergian
Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity,
of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you
will--we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and
interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between
the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or
soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now
pretty much collapsed--or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and
are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance
an argument on "reason" alone.

A vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black
under-graduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels
described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not
crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some
responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay
in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical:
The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility.
It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free
that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my
candor.(44) The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument
per se but with the person making it--namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a
position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility
of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/
authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist.
Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my
Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard
was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were to dog
and ought "logically" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his
academic power over her to coerce her assent (45)).

If for any reason you happen to find yourself sharing this particular
student's perceptions and reaction,(46) I would ask that you bracket your
feelings long enough to recognize that the PWM instructor's very modern
rhetorical dilemma in that office was really no different from the dilemma
faced by a male who makes a Pro-Life argument, or an atheist who argues
against Creation Science, or a Caucasian who opposes Affirmative Action, or an
African American who decries Racial Profiling, or anyone over eighteen who
tries to make a case for raising the legal driving age to eighteen, etc. The
dilemma has nothing to do with whether the arguments themselves are plausible
or right or even sane, because the debate rarely gets that far--any opponent
with sufficiently strong feelings or a dogmatic bent can discredit the
arguments and pretty much foreclose all further discussion with a single,
terribly familiar rejoinder: "Of course you'd say that"; "Easy for you to
say"; "What right do you have ...?"

Now (still bracketing) consider the situation of any reasonably intelligent
and well-meaning SNOOT who sits down to prepare a prescriptive usage guide.
It's the millennium, post-Everything: Whence the authority to make any sort of
credible Appeal for SWE at all?

ARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR
KIND

It isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem
to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs.
obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use
interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's
got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give
any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity ("The
light shone" vs. "I shined the light," etc.), and these would seem to be more
important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of
animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu
and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough.(47) In other words, a
SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage
dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.

But it's still really, really good--and not just lexicographically but
rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any
more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but
Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and
anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or
caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any
sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about
himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his
personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely
there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry,(48) it
struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or
straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't
once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical
persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what
particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up
front were "value judgments."

Bryan Garner is a genius because A Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty
much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control
the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to
transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that
does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His
argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of
both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument
going on at all.

Garner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get:
Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, "authority" is no longer something a
lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the
project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this
authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner
seems to have figured it out--that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be
not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of
unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded
to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good
reasons.

Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of
information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric.(49) Its goal is to recast the
Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in
an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not
only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to
the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.

Of course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU
he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable,
dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason.
His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions--exhaustive
citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of
actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by
the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.

Also thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether
anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed
counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical
reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his
attitude about the fact that most Americans "could care less" isn't scorn or
disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes
that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:
   The reality I care about most is that some people still want to use the
   language well.(50) They want to write effectively; they want to speak
   effectively. They want their language to be graceful at times and powerful
   at times. They want to understand how to use words well, how to manipulate
   sentences, and how to move about in the language without seeming to flail.
   They want good grammar, 'but they want more: they want rhetoric(51) in the
   traditional sense. That is, they want to use the language deftly so that
   it's fit for their purposes.

It's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's
Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to
detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible
technocrat--we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a
real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at
something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily
invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic
Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall "in the
interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ..."),
experience ("that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled
on"), exhaustive and tech-savvy research ("For contemporary usage, the files
of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search
capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW"), an even and judicious
temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: "Sometimes people strive to
abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave
inappropriately"(52)), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance,
including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that
not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for
English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more
important than any one person.

Probably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is
Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her)
own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an
Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in
rhetorical terms, e.g.: "To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is
important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners."
Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the
purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are
identical, and identically rhetorical--which I submit is about as Democratic
these days as you're going to get.

(1) With the advent of online databases, Garner has access to far more
examples of actual usage than did Gilman, and he deploys them to great effect.
(FYI, Oxford's 1996 New Fowler's Modern English Usage is also extremely
comprehensive and good, but its emphasis is on British usage.)

(2) Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one
of those very rare times when "historical context" is the phrase to use and
there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried
"lexico-temporal backdrop" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll
agree is not preferable.)

INTERPOLATION

The above [paragraph] is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost
always sneers and/or winces when he sees "historical context" deployed in a
piece of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from
the reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.

(3) SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a
clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of
Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Satire's column's prose itself. This
reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from
an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T.
stood for "Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance" or "Syntax Nudniks
of Our Time" depended on whether or not you were one.

(4) This is true in my own case at any rate--plus also the "uncomfortable"
part. I teach college English part-time--mostly Lit, not Comp. But I am also
so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing
happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we
immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency
Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody,
teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it
does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college
students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced
only can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard;
I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards. The kids end up scared,
both of me and for me.

(*) Editor's Note: Author insisted this phrase replace "obsessed with" and
took umbrage at the suggestion that this change clearly demonstrated the very
quality he wished to denigrate.

(5) Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to
iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus
to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra. SNOOTitude runs in families. In
ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and
actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the
SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or
both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written
remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At
least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in
all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a
game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a
coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified
the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and
lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend
that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But
the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this
same "game" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.

INTERPOLATION

As something I'm all but sure Harper's will excise, I'll also insert that we
even had a lighthearted but retrospectively chilling little family song that
Mom and we little SNOOTlets would sing in the car on long trips while Dad
silently rolled his eyes and drove (you have to remember the title theme of
Underdog in order to follow the song):

When idiots in this world appear And fail to be concise or clear And solecisms
rend the ear The cry goes up both far and near

For Blunder Dog

Blunder Dog

Blunder Dog

Blunder Dog

[etc.](*)

(*) (Since this'll almost surely get cut, I'll admit that, yes, I, as a kid,
was the actual author of this song, But by this time I'd been thoroughly
brainwashed. And just about the whole car sang along. It was sort of our
family's version of "100 Bottles ... Wall.")

(6) If Samuel Johnson is the Shakespeare of English usage, think of Henry
Watson Fowler as the Eliot or Joyce. His 1926 A Dictionary of Modern English
Usage is the granddaddy of modern usage guides, and its dust-dry wit and
blushless imperiousness have been models for every subsequent classic in the
field, from Erie Partridge's Usage and Abusage to Theodore Bernstein's The
Careful Writer to Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage to Gilman's '89
Webster's.

(7) (Garner prescribes spelling out only numbers under ten. I was taught that
this rule applies just to Business Writing and that in all other modes you
spell out one through nineteen and start using cardinals at 20.(*) De gustibus
non est disputandum.)

(*) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes spelling out all
numbers up to too.

(8) From personal experience, I can assure you that any kid like this is going
to be at best marginalized and at worst savagely and repeatedly Wedgied.

(9) What follow in the Preface are "... the ten critical points that, after
years of working on usage problems, I've settled on." These points are too
involved to treat separately, but a couple of them are slippery in the
extreme--e.g., "10. Actual Usage. In the end, the actual usage of educated
speakers and writers is the over arching criterion for correctness," of which
both "educated" and "actual" would require several pages of abstract
clarification and qualification to shore up against Usage Wars-related
attacks, but which Garner rather ingeniously elects to define and defend via
their application in his dictionary itself.

(10) There's no better indication of The Dictionary's authority than that we
use it to settle wagers. My own father is still to this day living down the
outcome of a high-stakes bet on the correct spelling of meringue, a wager made
on 14 September 1978.

(11) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes okay.

(12) This is a clever half-truth. Linguists compose only one part of the
anti-judgment camp, and their objections to usage judgments involve way more
than just "subjectivity."

(13) In this last respect, recall for example W. J. Clinton's famous "I feel
your pain," which was a blatant if not particularly masterful Ethical Appeal.

(14) Really, howled, blistering reviews and outraged editorials from across
the country--from the Times and The New Yorker and good old Life, or q.v. this
from the January '62 Atlantic: "We have seen a novel dictionary formula
improvised, in great part, out of snap judgments and the sort of theoretical
improvement that in practice impairs; and we have seen the gates propped wide
open in enthusiastic hospitality to miscellaneous confusions and corruptions.
In fine, the anxiously awaited work that was to have crowned cisatlantic
linguistic scholarship with a particular glory turns out to be a scandal and a
disaster."

(15) Note for example the mordant pith (and royal we) of this random snippet
from Partridge's Usage and Abusage:
   anxious of. `I am not hopeless of our future. But I am profoundly anxious
   of it', Beverley Nichols, News of England, 1938: which made us profoundly
   anxious For (or about)--not of--Mr Nichols's literary future.

Or see the near-Himalayan condescension of Fowler, here on some other people's
use of words to mean things the words don't really mean:
   slipshod extension ... is especially likely to occur when some accident
   gives currency among the uneducated to words of learned origin, & the more
   if they are isolated or have few relatives in the vernacular.... The
   original meaning of feasible is simply doable (L facere do); but to the
   unlearned it is a mere token, of which he has to infer the value from the
   contexts in which he hears it used, because such relatives as it has in
   English--Feat, feature, faction, &c.--either fail to show the obvious
   family likeness to which he is accustomed among families of indigenous
   words, or are (like malfeasance) outside his range.

(16) Utter bushwa: As ADMAU's body makes clear, Garner knows exactly when the
Descriptivists started influencing language guides.

(17) (which in fact is true)

(18) (Q.v. "The Pharmakon" in Derrida's La dissemination--but you'd probably
be better off just trusting me.)

(19) Standard Written English (SWE) is also sometimes called Standard English
(SE) or Educated English, but the inditement-emphasis is the same.

SEMI-INTERPOLATION

Plus note that Garner's Preface explicitly names ADMAU's intended audience as
"writers and editors." And even ads for the dictionary in such organs as The
New York Review of Books are built around the slogan "If you like to WRITE ...
Rear to us."(*)

(*) (Yr. SNOOT rev. cannot help observing, w/r/t these ads, that the opening r
in Refer here should not be capitalized after a dependent clause +
ellipses--Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.)

(20) True, some sort of 100 percent compendious real-time Mega-dictionary
might be possible online, though it'd take a small army of lexical webmasters
and a much larger army of in situ actual-use reporters and surveillance techs;
plus it'd be GNP=level expensive.

(21) New Criticism refers to T. S. Eliot and I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis
and Cleanth Brooks and Wimsatt & Beardsley and the whole "close reading"
school that dominated literary criticism from WWI well into the seventies.

(22) ("EVIDENCE OF CANCER LINK REFUTED BY TOBACCO INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS")

(23) This proposition is in fact true, as is interpolatively demonstrated
below, and although the demonstration is extremely persuasive it is also, as
you can see from the size of this FN, lengthy and involved and rather, umm,
dense, so that again you'd probably be better off simply granting the truth of
the proposition and forging on with the main text.

INTERPOLATIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A
PRIVATE LANGUAGE

It's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private
Language. Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy
of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee
hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain
has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This
line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his
own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is
techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very
intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent
potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the
color green and what other people call "the color green" may in fact not be
the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call
Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to
guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience
of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those
color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker
experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we
"mean" by the Word blue is what he "means" by green, etc., etc., until the
Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up
slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.

The point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and
most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has
at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.

In the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief
that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow
"connected" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's
Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the
meanings they do because of certain males and verification tests that are
imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in
which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's
argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically
centers on the fact that a word like pain means what it does for me because of
the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use pain.

If you're thinking that all this foetus not only abstract but also pretty
irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at
all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal
rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only
conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and
ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar
and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial
America's about--class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism,
cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.

(24) Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal
ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws,but they're not
laissez-faire, either.

(25) In his Language Istinct. How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven
Pinker puts it this way: "No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not
to say Apples the eat boy or The child seems sleeping or Who did you meet John
and? or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically
possible combinations of words.

(26) In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peer and
teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag
queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's
coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who
nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself
doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients "the wrong message." But
of course it's all basically the same thing.

(27) In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio
ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are
extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with "DID YOU KNOW
PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?

(28) (... not to mention color, gender, creed-you can see how fraught and
charged all this is going to get)

(29) Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon
that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at
once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)

(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the
term's continued deployment in this article.)

(30) (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a "subdialect" or
"jargon" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse
Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE,
and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no
ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is
Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in
" [Jargon] arises from the urge to save time and space-and occasionally to
conceal meaning from the uninitiated.")

(31) (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since "Where's it from?" isn't
redundant [mainly because whence has vanished into semi-archaism])

(32) A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an
analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic;
English and Chinese, analytic.

(33) (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et
Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)

(34) But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are
clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words
between to and the verb--"We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our
ability respond to these charges"--which Garner calls "wide splits" and
sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s--which is that some are
"perfectly proper" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no
one wide tidy dogmatic ukase can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that "knowing
when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye"--is is a good
example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist
objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound
objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.

(35) The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids'
playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as
much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn
about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being
not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the
obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the
teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us,
but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing
link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.

In sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in
Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc.--that in
fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.

(36) (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)

(37) There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the
Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine--Old Maids of both
genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.

(38) (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a
dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)

(39) (I'm not a total idiot.)

(40) E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint
that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.

(41) A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE
WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list
VW's that bug him and say that "vogue words have such a grip on the popular
mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little
purpose." This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply
wrong, The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least
two different communicative functions--one the transmission of raw info, the
other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker--and Vogue Usage
throws this balance off. Garher's "serve little purpose" is exactly incorrect;
vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain
light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal
B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find
Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.

(42) FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted
from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled "No Contest: English Professors
Are Worst Writers on Campus."

(43) This was in his 1946 "Politics and the English Language," an essay that
despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive
SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous
"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift" in Ecclesiastes as
"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that
success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be
commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the
unpredictable must invariably be taken into account" should be tattooed on the
left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.

(44) Please just don't even say it.

(45) (She professed to have been especially traumatized by the climactic "I am
going to make you," which in retrospect was indeed a mammoth rhetorical
boner.)

(46) (The Dept. head end Dean did not, as it happens, share her reaction ...
though it would be disingenuous not to tell you that they happened also to be
PWM's, which fact did not go unremarked by the complainant, such that the
whole proceeding got pretty darn tense, indeed, before it was all over.)

(47) To be honest, I noticed this omission only because midway through working
on this article I happened to use the word trough in front of the same SNOOT
friend who Likes to compare public English to violin-hammering, and he fell
sideways out of his chair, and it emerged that I have somehow all my life
misheard trough as ending with a th instead of an fend thus have publicly
mispronounced it God knows how many scores of times, and I all but burned
rubber getting home to see whether perhaps the error was so common and human
and understandable that Garner himself had a good-natured entry on it, but no
such luck which in fairness I don't suppose I can really blame Garner for.

(48) (on zwieback vs. zweiback)

(49) (meaning literally Democratictic--it Wants Your Vote)

(50) The last two words of this sentence, of course, are what the Usage Wars
are about--whose "language" and whose "well"? The most remarkable thing about
this sentence is that coming from Garner it doesn't sound naive or obnoxious
but just ... reasonable,

(51) Did you think I was kidding?

(52) (Here this reviewer's indwelling and ever-vigilant SNOOT can't help but
question why Garner uses a comma before the conjunction in this sentence,
since what follows the conjunction is neither an independent clause nor any
kind of plausible complement for strive to. But respectful disagreement
between people of goodwill is of course Democratically natural and healthy
and, when you come right down to it, kind of fun.)

The Wild Numbers by Philibert Schogt

Four Walls Eight Windows, New York, 2000. 159 pp. $18. ISBN 1-56858-166-1

Math's cultural stock has risen hard in recent years, no doubt driven by the
same booming and metastatic Knowledge Economy that's turned yesterday's non
grata nerd into today's cybertycoon. Call the phenomenon "Geek Chic" or
"[Hip(2b).sup.2]" or whatever you will: abstract tech is now sexy, the
mathematician a viable commercial hero--see, for example, the success of
recent films like Good Will Hunting and [Pi].

Or, a better instance of math's new cachet here is Amir D. Aczel's Fermat's
Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem, which
made nonfiction bestseller lists in 1996 and transformed Princeton's Andrew
Wiles into a weird kind of horn-rimmed pop icon, and in the wake of which has
appeared everything from Paul Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and
Sylvia Nasar's A Beautiful Mind to David Berlinski's Newton's Gift and Charles
Seife's Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea.

Though fiction, Philibert Schogt's The Wild Numbers (herein WN) and Apostolos
Doxiadis's Uncle Petros & Goldbach's Conjecture (herein UPGC) both draw
heavily on Aczel's Fermat's Last Theorem as well as on G. H. Hardy's A
Mathematician's Apology (1). And there are other, rather striking similarities
between the two novels. Both are set in the world of academic mathematics and
feature characters whose specialty is number theory, higher math's most purely
abstract branch. Both revolve around their protagonists' quests to solve
famous and long-standing number-theoretic problems. And both have been
translated by their own authors from foreign-language originals.

The facts of these two novels' close resemblance and near-simultaneous release
here in the United States, as well as the vigor with which their U.S.
publishers are hyping them (2), appear to signal the inception of a whole new
commercial genre--the "Math Melodrama" as it were. This is a development that
should come as no surprise, given the success of some of the other titles
mentioned above, not to mention the commercial success in recent years of
other nascent tech-intensive genres (e.g., the cyberpunk of Gibson et seq.,
the Clancy-style technothriller, and the
plucky-young-hackers-thwarting-evil-monolithic-institutions of Sneakers,
Hackers, and The Matrix).

As exemplified by WN and UPGC in fiction and Fermat's Last Theorem and A
Beautiful Mind in non-, the Math Melodrama can be roughly characterized as
combining the "Vocational Travelogue" (3) charms of genre authors like Arthur
Hailey and Michael Crichton with some of the weightier allegorical functions
that other genres and their heroes often serve--the Western sheriff as emblem
of Apollonian order, the Noir private eye as existential hero, the plucky
young hacker as Odyssean trickster. The Math Melodrama's own allegorical
template appears to be more classically Tragic, its hero a kind of
Prometheus-Icarus figure whose high-altitude genius is also hubris and Fatal
Flaw. If this Sounds a bit grandiose, well, it is; but it's also a fair
description of the way Math Melodramas characterize the project of pure
math--as nothing less than the mortal quest for Divine Truth. What's odd here
is that whether a particular reader accepts this characterization or sees it
as pretentious and silly will often depend less on the qualities of the Math
Melodramas themselves than on certain biographical facts about the reader,
namely how much knowledge and experience of higher math he or she happens to
have.

This sort of oddity is, in fact, a frequent problem in reviewing "genre
fiction," which is a type of narrative it's usually fair to call "the sort of
thing someone who likes this sort of thing is apt to like." The evaluative
criteria tend to be rather special for such fiction. Instead of the basically
aesthetic assay the reviewer gets to make of most literary fiction--"Is this
piece of fiction good?"--criticism of genre fiction is ultimately more
rhetorical--"To whom will this piece of fiction appeal?" In other words, with
all but the broadest and coarsest fiction, the central questions about novels
like WN and UPGC concern what rhetoricians call "audience": What is the
intended audience for these books? and is this audience apt to find the novels
satisfying on the same terms by which it finds other Math Melodramas
satisfying? and if not, are there other audiences whom these books are more
likely to satisfy? and so on. One reason this is a problem for reviewers is
that book reviews are usually supposed to be short, clear, and relatively
simple; but rhetorical criteria tend to yield very complex, sometimes even
paradoxical conclusions. In the case of WN and UPGC, the paradox is that the
type of audience most likely to accept and appreciate these novels' lofty,
encomiastic view of pure math is also the audience most apt to be disappointed
by the variously vague, reductive, or inconsistent ways the novels handle the
actual mathematics they're concerned with.

To put it in a simpler, more book review-ish way: Neither of these novels is
very good (one, in fact, is downright bad); but the precise ways in which
they're not very good will vary directly with how much an individual reader
already knows about the extraordinary field these two books are trying to
dramatize (4).

Not just professional mathematicians, but almost anyone lucky enough ever to
have studied higher math understands what a pity it is that most students
never pursue the subject past its introductory levels and therefore know only
the dry and brutal problem-solving of Calc I or Intro Stats (which is roughly
analogous to halting one's study of poetry at the level of grammar and
syntax). Modern math is like a pyramid, and the broad fundament is often not
fun. It is at the higher and apical levels of geometry, topology, analysis,
number theory, and mathematical logic that the fun and profundity start, when
the calculators and context less formulae fall away and all that's left are
pencil and papers and what gets called "genius," viz. the particular blend of
reason and ecstatic creativity that characterizes what is best about the human
mind. Those who've been privileged (or forced) to study it understand that the
practice of higher mathematics is, in fact, an "art" (5) and that it depends
no less than other arts on inspiration, courage, toil, etc., but with the
added stricture that the "truths" the art of math tries to express are
deductive, necessary, a priori truths, capable of both derivation and
demonstration by logical proof (6).

It may be that mathematics is not generally recognized as one of the arts
precisely because so much pyramidal training and practice is required in order
to appreciate its aesthetics; math is perhaps the ultimate in acquired tastes
(7). And it's maybe because of math's absolute, wholly abstract Truth that so
many people still view the discipline as dry or passionless and its
practitioners as asocial dweebs. Some Science readers will probably know all
too well the frustration of trying to describe the beauty and power of Gauss's
differential geometry or the Banach-Tarski Paradox to someone who remembers
only the drudgery of factoring quadratic equations or the terror of a trig
midterm. In fact, the weird fear and distaste that low-level math provokes in
so many is part of what makes the emergence of the Math Melodrama exciting: If
the genre can find ways to vivify pure math and communicate the discipline's
extraordinary beauty and passion to the average reader (8), both readers and
math itself stand to gain.

The ways in which Schogt's and Doxiadis's novels go about trying to humanize
and animate math are also similar. Besides both struggling to solve classic
problems in number theory--the actual Goldbach Conjecture in UPGC, a
fictitious conundrum called "Beauregard's Wild Number Problem" (9) in WN--the
books' protagonists also both conceive of their projects almost wholly in
terms of personal achievement, glory. WN's Isaac Swirl, a once-promising
student whose career has stagnated, spends much time fantasizing about solving
the Wild Number Problem and having "an international symposium held in my
honor ... and, now that I was not just a mathematician, but a famous
mathematician, women would suddenly find me attractive, not just eccentric or
at best amusing." And UPGC's Petros Papachristos, although already a
number-theorist of substantial reputation who holds an endowed chaff at the
University of Munich, nevertheless "sought in mathematics a great, almost
transcendent success, a total triumph that would bring him world fame.... And
to be complete, this triumph should be exclusively his own." Despite their
different stations and attainments, the two protagonists also suffer almost
identically (and at great length) from the insecurity of measuring themselves
against their colleagues and the fear that someone else will solve "their"
problem first. Petros actually rejoices when Srinivasa Ramanujan (10) dies
young of tuberculosis, simply because Ramanujan's "unique intellect was the
only force he considered capable of purloining his prize." Both protagonists'
work is characterized as an anxious race against the clock and calendar; both
novels make much of the fact that pure math is a "young man's game" and that
the vast majority of important mathematicians do their best work before 35
(11). And both heroes brood and expound at great length about the particular
despair of being a good but not immortally great mathematician, a
mathematician brilliant enough truly to appreciate the genius of Riemann,
Euler, Poincare et al. but not brilliant enough to be their equal.

Interestingly, though, the most important similarity between the novels
concerns the rhetorical problems of audience mentioned above, and the biggest
differences between the two books concern the ways they try to handle those
problems. Oddly, the better novel is also the one that seems to be the more
confused and confusing about just what its audience is.

The Wild Numbers, translated from the Dutch De wilde getallen and transferred
in locale from Amsterdam to some nameless U.S. college town, is not the better
novel. It's designed to be sort of a schlemiel-comedy a la Thurber's Mitty or
Amis's Lucky Jim. WN's Isaac is a mediocrity who at the start of the novel is
under-published and reduced to doing scutwork calculations and "refinements"
for his superstar colleague Dimitri Arkanov (12) and at age 35 goes around
saying stuff like "I felt old and depressed. There seemed to be no more room
for dreams at my age. Everything was measured in terms of success and
failure.... I concluded that I was a lesser human being in every respect." His
prospects suddenly change when Isaac stumbles into working on "wild numbers,"
which are described this way:
   Beauregard had defined a number of deceptively simple operations, which,
   when applied to a whole number [integer?], at first resulted in fractions
   [rationals?]. But if the same steps were repeated often enough, the
   eventual outcome was once again a whole number [huh?]. Or, as Beauregard
   cheerfully observed: "In all numbers lurks a wild number, guaranteed to
   emerge when you provoke them long enough." 0 yielded the wild number 11, 1
   brought forth 67, 2 itself, 3 suddenly manifested itself as 4769, 4,
   surprisingly, brought for 67 again.

In an all-nighter of migrainous epiphany, Isaac comes to believe he's found
the longs-ought answer to the Wild Number Problem, which is apparently a
fictional variant of number-theoretic puzzles like the Twin Primes Problem
(13): "How many wild numbers are there? Are there a finite number that keep
coming up, and if so, how many, or are there an infinite number?" Isaac's
proof that the set of all wilds is infinite appears at first to be sound, and
it is confirmed and lauded by Arkanov and submitted to a prestigious journal,
catapulting Isaac into the mathematical limelight and prompting all sorts of
wacky plot-complications before it is finally discovered that the proof
doesn't work after all (but by which time Isaac's found true love with a
caustic divorcee who's also had horrible career reverses, so everything works
out O.K. in the end).

The major problem with The Wild Numbers looks at first to be artistic but is
actually rhetorical. All the book's math is, as mentioned, made up, which is
not necessarily a problem--all sorts of great science fiction, from Isaac
Asimov to Larry Niven, is replete with fictional math and high tech. What is a
problem, though, is that the fictional math in WN is extremely important but
also extremely vague, comprising mostly repeated and contextless verbiage--"If
I could only establish its K-reducibility with the aid of a suitable
calibrator set!" without any definitions or even cursory fleshing-out, so that
the book's math-speak ends up most resembling the absurd pseudo-jargon of bad,
old low-budget sci fi movies ("Quick, Lieutenant, prepare the antigenic
nanomodule for immediate stabilization flux!").

Apart from its intrinsic weaknesses, the sketchy made-up math here clearly
indicates that The Wild Numbers is meant to appeal mostly to readers with
little or no high-math background, an audience that either won't know that the
impressive-sounding terminology is fake or won't mind that the terms never get
connected to each other or anything else. This, too, is not necessarily a
problem; many successful books, from Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land to
Ellroy's L. A. Confidential, use sort of perfunctory genre-conventions as
scaffolding for what are really complex and essentially human dramas (i.e.,
for literature). But it's true that a genre book whose particular
genre-elements lack technical depth or resonance must depend for its appeal on
other, more traditionally literary qualities like plot, character, style, etc.
And this is a very real problem for WN, because as any kind of literary
narrative it is off-the-charts bad, its characters mere 2D types (the neurotic
schlemiel, the kindly mentor, the pompous crank, the vulpine reporter, the
fiancee who Doesn't Understand) and its plot howlingly implausible (e.g., for
most of the book both Isaac and Nobel-laureate Arkanov supposedly fail to spot
in Isaac's proof a basic, freshman-level logical flaw, the eventual discovery
of which is sort of the novel's pie-in-the-schlemiel's-face climax). Worst, or
at least most distracting, is the fact that the author-translator's English
seems rudimentary at best (14) and the actual line-by-line prose of WN is
often so stiff and clunky--"How the tiny, quivering flame of my intuition was
able to withstand the numerous onslaughts of my doubts remains a mystery to
me"--or riddled with ESL-ish solecisms--"She pouted her tip"; "I found back my
love for mathematics" (15)--or unintentionally funny--"Her tongue probing deep
into my mouth left little room for mathematical reflection"--or just plain
bad--"They could not help but open like flowers in the brilliant sunshine of
his presence, revealing their innermost secrets to him"--as to make the reader
suffer that terrible, embarrassed-for-someone-else feeling on the author's
behalf.

It is true that Uncle Petros & Goldbach Conjecture is also author-translated
(from the original O Theios Petros kai i Eikasia tou Golbach) and its prose
often awkward or stilted: "I was not made of the same mettle as he--this I
realized now beyond the shadow of a doubt." But here the clunky English is
mitigated somewhat by UPGC's Greco-European setting and the fact that much of
its action takes place before 1930. The novel's nested structure is itself
almost Victorian: The middle-aged narrator, describing in retrospect the
history of his childhood relationship with his reclusive uncle, recounts
Petros's own life story in a series of flashbacks "as told to" him by the
great mathematician himself. The elaborate set-up notwithstanding, it is
Petros's obsessive and tormented career that drives the novel and comprises
its heart.

UPGC is about as far from a schlemiel-comedy as you can get. It's more like a
cross between the Myth of Icarus and Goethe's Werther, and it's serious as a
heart attack (16). Born in Greece around the turn of the century, Petros
Papachristos is recognized as a child math prodigy and shipped across Europe
to the University of Berlin, where in 1916 he receives his doctorate with a
dissertation on "solving a particular variety of differential equations" that
earns young Petros early acclaim because of its applications in WWI artillery
targeting. It is also at the university that Petros has his first and only
love affair, with his German-language tutor (a young lady by the rather
unsubtle name of Isolde), who toys with his affections and then elopes with a
Prussian officer. In not its best moment, UPGC tries to establish this (wince)
Isolde as Petros's initial motive for tackling the Goldbach Conjecture:
   In order to win her heart back, Petros now decided, there could be no
   half-measures.... he should have to accomplish amazing intellectual feats,
   nothing short of becoming a Great Mathematician. But how does one become a
   Great Mathematician? Simple: by solving a Great Mathematical Problem!
   "Which is the most difficult problem in mathematics, Professor?" he asked
   [his advisor] at their next meeting, trying to feign mere academic
   curiosity.

Whereupon Petros devotes the remainder of his professional life to the G.C.,
that Everest of unsolved problems. His twenty-year labor, which ends in
failure and devastation, combines periods of seclusion in Germany with
extended trips to Cambridge and Vienna, in which latter there are scenes of
him rubbing elbows with some of 20th-century math's most important historical
figures. The use of this Forrest Gump-ish device implies that UPGC is written
for readers who are at least familiar enough with higher math to know who
Hardy, Ramanujan, Godel, and Turing are; but many of the celebrity-scenes
themselves are cheesy and kind of irritating. The complex and sensitive Hardy
readers know from his Apology, for instance, gets reduced in Doxiadis's novel
to a sort of gouty old curmudgeon who spouts inanities like "Don't you forget
it, Papachristos, this blasted Conjecture is difficult!"

Its treatment of the "real" Hardy is a good example of UPGC's particular
rhetorical problem: The readers who will actually know who Godfrey Harold
Hardy is are also the readers most likely to be put off by the way the book
portrays him (17). And Doxiadis's novel runs into this sort of
logico-rhetorical problem again and again, because its big weakness as genre
fiction is its weird, ambivalent confusion about just what kind of audience
it's for.

As with Schogt's WN, there's no better instance of this confusion than the way
pure math is rendered here, although in UPGC the math is 100% real and
intricately connected to the book's characters and themes. Petros's Herculean
labors on his proof are recounted to the reader in the form of fireside
declamations to his nephew (i.e., the narrator as a child), who's enough of a
mathematical ephebe that Petros can plausibly keep stopping to deliver quick
little mini-lectures on the history of number theory, from Euclid's reductio
proof of the infinity of primes, to the major theorems of Fermat, Euler, and
Gauss on primes' distribution and succession, to the Goldbach Conjecture and
Petros's own analytic attack thereon via "the Theory of Partitions (the
different ways of writing an integer as a sum)."

It gets more complicated, though, because the narrator as a grown man now has
an extensive math background, and he himself laces the novel with explanatory
asides on everything from Cavafy poems to the Riemann Zeta Function. The
problem is that Doxiadis's decisions about what needs explicating and what
doesn't are often so inconsistent as to seem bizarre. It's not just that there
are long and irrelevant footnotes on, for example, Godel's method of suicide,
Poincare's theory of the unconscious, or the novel properties of the number
1729 (18). It is that the narrator of UPGC will often take time to carefully
define very basic terms like "integers" and "primes" or to include patronizing
asides like "It should be pointed out to the non-specialist that mathematical
[text]books cannot normally be enjoyed like novels, in bed, in the bathtub,
sprawled in an easy chair, or perched on the commode"--all of which clearly
imply a non-math audience--while, on the other hand, UPGC is also studded with
rarefied technical phrases like "n's ratio to the natural logarithm,"
"Peano-Dedekind axiomatic system," "partial differential equation in the
Clairaut form," and (no kidding) "The orders of the torsion subgroups of
[[Omega].sub.n] and the Adams spectral sequence" that are tossed around
without any kind of explanation, which (especially together with the h clef
appearances of Godel, J. E. Littlewood, et al.)seems to presume a highly
math-literate reader.

And if all the narrator's strange elementary definitions are disregarded as
mere slips or snafus, and one decides that UPGC's actual intended audience is
one with a solid high-math background (19), there remains an equally strange
inconsistency. This lies in the narrative's discussions of the Goldbach
Conjecture itself, and of its history in the early 20th century. For one
thing, UPGC makes hardly mention at all of the crucial distinction between
Euler's "strong Goldbach Conjecture" [see (4)] and the Conjecture's equally
famous "weak" version, which states that all odd numbers [is greater than or
equal to] 9 are the sum of three odd primes. Nor, despite all the detailed
descriptions of Petros's labors and all the long excursuses on pre-WWII number
theory, does the novel ever once mention Euler's phi (or "totient") function
or the ingenious "sieve"-type methods that real mathematicians were using to
attack the G.C. in the 1920s and 1930s. In fact, even though UPGC gives us
page after page on Petros's anxiety about Ramanujan's work on the G.C. (which
was in reality very slight), there's no mention of any of the actual important
published results of the time, e.g. Schnirelmann's 1931 proof of the upper
limit of primes of which an even integer can be the sum and Estermann's 1938
proof that almost all even numbers are the sums of two primes. Strangest of
all, though Doxiadis's narrator spends a lot of time discussing the difference
between algebraic and analytic number theory (as well as tracing out Gauss's
"asymptotic" hypothesis of the Prime Number Theorem, and Hadamard and Vallee
Poussin's 1896 proof of the P.N.T. using analytic tools), there is not one
reference in the book to I. M. Vinogradov, the Russian mathematician who in
1937 revolutionized analytic number theory by introducing a powerful method
for getting very accurate estimates of trigonometric sums and using it to
prove the weak G.C. for sufficiently large numbers (20). Historically, it is
Vinogradov who would have been Petros's real rival, the "unique intellect" he
really feared; and it is not Godel's but Vinogradov's Theorem that might
plausibly have caused Papachristos to despair.

The thing to realize here is that none of these omissions would necessarily
matter had not Doxiadis chosen to make UPGC so dependent on actual
number-theory and real historical characters. As it stands, though, the
audience knowledgeable enough to appreciate all the "real" math and history
woven into this novel is also the audience most likely to notice the strange
absence in the book of so much really real historical work on the Conjecture.
Here once again, then, is a form of the weird, paradoxical-looking problem
(viz., that necessary conditions for liking the novel are also sufficient
conditions for disliking it) that pretty much destroys this book, whose author
can't decide whom he's writing for.

It would be unfair to Doxiadis, though, not to acknowledge that both his novel
and its flaws are far more interesting than Schogt's WN, and moreover that
UPGC does include some moving and rather lovely passages:
      The loneliness of the researcher doing original mathematics is unlike
   any other. In a very real sense of the word, he lives in a universe that is
   totally inaccessible, both to the greater public and to his own immediate
   environment. Even those closest to him cannot partake of his joys and his
   sorrows in any significant way, since it is all but impossible for them to
   understand their content.

The novel also offers at least one sub-theme of genuine insight and
originality, one that manages to go beyond anything Hardy had to say about the
tragedies of math. This particular thematic line concerns Petros's ambition
and his place in the mathematical community; and its allegorical touchstone
appears to be not Icarus but Minos, the Cretan king who so coveted a certain
great white bull, which the god Poseidon had conjured out of sea-foam to help
him win the throne, that Minos broke his sworn promise to return it via
religious sacrifice and instead kept the bull for himself (21).

It is true that doing original math is "lonely." But it is also true that
professional mathematicians compose a community. The reality, which Petros
never seems to recognize, is that the "fame and immortality" he so craves will
depend entirely on the value of his work to other mathematicians. The role of
professional community is so important in nearly all branches of scientific
endeavor, in fact, that most Science readers can probably already appreciate
what Lewis Hyde's The Girl (22) tries to convey to its own more general
audience:
   [T]he task of assembling a mass of disparate facts into a coherent whole
   clearly lies beyond the powers of a single mind or even a single
   generation. All such broad intellectual undertakings call for a community
   of scholars, one in which each individual thinker can be awash in the ideas
   of his comrades so that a sort of "group mind" develops, one that is
   capable of cognitive tasks beyond the power of any single person.

Notwithstanding all the narrator's heavy declarations that "Uncle Petros' sin
was Pride" and his retreat into paralyzed seclusion "a form of burnout" or
"scientific battle fatigue," it emerges in the novel that the real cause of
Petros's tragedy is his progressive withdrawal from the professional community
as his ambition to solve the Conjecture becomes a rapacity that transforms his
colleagues first into rivals and then into enemies. The novel's middle
sections trace this progression out nicely. It starts in Cambridge, when
Petros rejects an offer of professional collaboration with Hardy and
Littlewood because he fears that "[t]heir problems would become his own and,
what's worse, their fame would inevitably outshine his," and determines
instead to work on the G.C. alone, withdrawing to Munich. There, over years of
seclusion and nonstop work, privacy becomes secrecy, and Petros's fear and
suspicion of other mathematicians approaches "the point of paranoia. In order
to avoid his colleagues' drawing conclusions from the items he withdrew from
the library, he began to ... ask for an article in a scientific journal only
in order to get his hands on the issue that also contained another article,
the one he really wanted." (See also Petros's aforementioned "wild joy" at the
death of Ramanujan.)

The real Minoan-type crisis, though, comes about halfway through the novel,
when Petros achieves an important "intermediate result" in his progress toward
the Conjecture--a "deep, pioneering theorem ... which opened new vistas in the
Theory of Numbers"--and has to decide what to do with it. Petros's internal
debate about whether to publish the result (which is really a
Hyde-versus-Minos argument about membership in a community) is probably the
novel's best moment:
   Undoubtedly, its publication would secure him recognition in the
   mathematical world much greater than that achieved by his method for
   solving differential equations. In fact, it would probably catapult him to
   the first ranks of the small but select international community of number
   theorists, practically on the same level as its great stars.

      By making his discovery public, he would also be opening the way into
   the [Goldbach] problem to other mathematicians who would build on it by
   discovering new results and expand the limits of the field in a way a lone
   researcher, however brilliant, could scarcely hope. The results they would
   achieve would, in turn, aid him in his pursuit of the proof to the
   Conjecture. In other words ... he would be acquiring a legion of assistants
   in his work. Unfortunately, there was another side to this coin: one of the
   new unpaid (also unasked for) assistants might conceivably stumble upon a
   better way to apply his theorem and manage, God forbid, to prove Goldbach's
   Conjecture before him.

      He didn't have to deliberate long. The danger far outweighed the
   benefit. He wouldn't publish.

From here on, the die is cast. And because he is not a king, it is not his
community but Petros himself who receives the inevitable punishment for this
"hoarding of the general benefit" (23). What happens is that his unpublished
result is independently discovered by another mathematician, a development
Petros finds out about only years later, from Hardy, who "expressed his
amazement that Petros had not been aware of this, since its publication had
caused a sensation in the circles of number theorists and brought great
acclaim to its young author" (24).

As UPGC's plot unfolds, this sort of Aesopian, reap-just-what-you-sow
punishment gets inflicted on Petros again and again, worsening as each
ego-blow increases his alienation and paranoia and sends him deeper into a
kind of professional solipsism. Far more than any supposed misreading of
Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, it is this solipsism that leads to
Petros's "failure"--as both a mathematician and a person--and he ends up
rather like Milton's Satan, not just alone but Alone, sustaining himself on
the sort of megalomaniacal self-pity that creative people everywhere know and
dread:
   "I, Petros Papachristos, never having published anything of value, will go
   down in mathematical history--or rather will not go down in it--as having
   achieved nothing. This suits me fine, you know. I have no regrets.
   Mediocrity would never have satisfied me. To an ersatz, footnote kind of
   immortality, I prefer ... total obscurity!"

Despite the confused and confusing math-labyrinth it's hidden inside, the
embedded story of Petros's fall is in fact a kind of monstrous gem, one in
whose facets readers of many different backgrounds and tastes might see parts
of themselves reflected. Apparent implication: If math can be art, so
sometimes can genre.

References and Notes

(1.) This classic long essay, originally published in 1940 and re-released by
Cambridge University Press in 1992, is the unacknowledged father of most of
the last decade's math-prose. There is very little that any of the recent
books do that Hardy's terse and beautiful Apology did not do first, better,
and with rather less fuss.

(2.) WN's cover comes with a blurb from Fermat's Last Theorem's Aczel, who
must have been on some kind of euphoriant medication--"l have never read a
better fictional description of what it's like to work in pure math"--as well
as the breathless marketing tag "THE LINE BETWEEN GENIUS AND MADNESS IS A THIN
ONE." UPGC's publisher's big tactic is to offer a million-dollar bounty to
anyone who can prove Goldbach's Conjecture before 2002.

(3.) "Vocational Travelogue" is a shorthand way of acknowledging that for a
long time one reason people used to read fiction was for a kind of imaginative
tourism to places and cultures they'd never get to really see; that
modernity's jetliners, TV, etc. have pretty well made this function obsolete;
but that modern tech has also created such extreme vocational specialization
that today few people are in a position to know much about any professional
field other than their own; and thus that a certain amount of fiction's
"touristic" function now consists in giving readers dramatized access to the
nuts and bolts of different professional disciplines and specialties.

(4.) in fairness to all concerned, this variability in readers' mathematical
backgrounds is a problem for almost anyone trying to write general-interest
prose about math, a problem that Hardy refers to as "the restrictions under
which I am writing. On the one hand my examples must be very simple, and
intelligible to a reader who has no specialized mathematical knowledge.... And
on the other hand my examples should be drawn from `pukka' mathematics, the
mathematics of the working professional mathematician." Note that this sort of
thing is a problem even for rather more special-interest writing like this
book review itself. Is it, for example, necessary to inform or remind the
average Science reader that Fermat's Last Theorem (c. 1637) states that where
n is an integer and n [is greater than] 2, the equation xn + yn = zn has no
nonzero integer solutions? or that Goldbach's Conjecture (or rather the
"strong" G.C, as reformulated by Leonhard Euler in 1742) is that every even
integer [is greater than] 4 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers?
As it happens, this reviewer is not certain whether it's necessary or not, and
the fact that these lines have not been deleted by Science's editors (i.e.,
that you are reading them at all) may indicate that the editors are not
totally sure either.

(5.) Hardy, whose Apology talks about this better than anything else ever has,
explains that "The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or poet's,
must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together
in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test; there is no permanent place in
the world for ugly mathematics."

(6.) The assumption here will be that the typical Science reader already knows
what "a priori," "deductive truth," and "logical proof" mean and is at least
roughly familiar with the relationship between pure math and formal logic, if
for no other reason than that to gloss tangential stuff like this would take
up enormous amounts of space and time and might we[[ also alienate the
(presumably large) percentage of Science's readership who already know the
stuff and are apt to find such glosses not only otiose but annoying--this
reviewer can actually imagine such readers looking increasingly aggrieved and
impatient and saying to themselves, "Who does he think he's talking to?" All
this is mentioned only to underscore once again the rhetorical diceyness of
the whole math-prose enterprise, a diceyness that lies at the very center of
this review's criticisms of the two novels.

(7.) It's worth noting that as so much contemporary poetry, classical music,
etc. become ever more abstract and involute and technically complex, their own
audiences get ever smaller and more specialized. With few exceptions, the
people who truly appreciate a piece of language-poetry or an atonal fugue are
people with extensive educations in the history and theory of these arts. And
this increasing exclusivity in the arts has much less to do with good old
"cultural elitism" than with our era's tendency toward greater and greater
specialization--it is not at all an accident that the majority of people who
read contemporary poetry are themselves contemporary poets.

(8.) "Average reader" is kind of a synecdoche for "people who read mainly for
diversion or entertainment." These people are American genre fiction's basic
audience. It is true that Hardy's Apology, as well as novels from Don
DeLillio's Ratner's Star and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow to Neal
Stephenson's Cryptonomicon have already deployed higher math in interesting
and significant ways. But books like these are belle lettres, literature, for
which the audience is, again, usually small and rather specialized. Genre
books are mass-audience books and are marketed accordingly.

(9.) The putative author of this problem, one "Anatole Millechamps de
Beauregard" (b. 1791), is a kind of biographical hybrid of yon Neumann and
Galois, on whose florid life story Schogt spends most of a chapter.

(10.) Like many of UPGC's supporting characters, Ramanujan was a real
number-theorist, an Indian savant discovered and mentored by Hardy. Robert
Kanigal's The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan is another
of the post-Fermat math-bios now on the market.

(11.) The real source of this insight is Hardy, in his Apology's famous "No
mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than
any other art or science, is a young man's game," which UPGC's narrator rips
off without any attribution at all: "Mathematics, you see, is a young man's
game. It is one of the few human endeavors where youth is a necessary
requirement [sic] for greatness." This is probably the place to point out that
Doxiadis's whole novel is filled with what appear to be little more than very
slight rephrasings from Hardy's Apology or C. R Snow's famous Foreword to it.
At one point, Doxiadis even cribs nearly word for word a deathbed exchange
between Hardy and Ramanujan and tags it with the footnote "Hardy also recounts
the incident in his Mathematician's Apology without, however, acknowledging my
uncle's presence." This is not only intrusive and irritating but wrong,
because it is not in the Apology but in Snow's Foreword that the scene really
appears.

(12.) The work Isaac is doing for Arkanov is on "calibrator sets" and
"K-reducibility," two made-up terms that figure prominently in the plot's math
but are never specified or explained.

(13.) Here the reviewer's assumption is that if the T.P.P. is unfamiliar or
the analogy unhelpful it can just be passed over with no hard feelings on
either side.

(14.) Schogt's original Dutch prose might, of course, be a thing of wonder.

(15.) The Wild Numbers' American publisher seems equally culpable for the
prose here. If Four Walls Eight Windows is going to let an only semi-bilingual
Philibert Schogt translate his own Dutch, why didn't they at least help him
with basic English usage.

(16.) And it's just about as subtle with respect to its thematics: The
narrator repeatedly and sans irony describes his uncle as an "Ideal Romantic
Hero" (caps his) and says stuff like "Think of the biblical Tree of Knowledge
or the Prometheus of mythology. People like him have surpassed the common
measure; they've come to know more than is necessary to man, and for this
hubris they have to pay."

(17.) There's a way more grievous example of this sort of thing involving Kurt
Godel and the plot's first real crisis. Alan Turing (here a wide-eyed
unclergrad) accidentally exposes Petros to Godel's First Incompleteness
Theorem in 1933, whereupon Petros freaks out because he fears that the
Goldbach Conjecture may be one of the F. L. Theorem's "formally unprovable"
propositions. This is so implausible and reductive as to be almost offensive.
As Science's readership is hereby presumed [q.v. (6)] to more or less know
already, Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is concerned with the abstract
possibility of Completeness in axiomatic systems, and the formally unprovable
propositions it succeeds in deriving are all very special self-reference-type
cases, the mathematical equivalent of the "1 am lying" paradox. To believe
that the First Incompleteness Theorem could apply to actual number-theoretic
problems like the Goldbach Conjecture is so crude and confused that there is
no way that a professional mathematician of Petros's attainments could
possibly entertain what the novel says is "the one and only, dizzying,
terrifying question that had jumped into his mind the moment he'd heard of
Godel's result.... what if the Incompleteness Theorem also applied to his
problem? What if Goldbach's Conjecture was unprovable?"

(18.) Some of these footnotes are so weird and U.S.-reader inappropriate that
it's worth giving a concrete example, such as the footnote to a line on page
41 about the narrator enrolling in a U.S. college: "According to the American
system, a student can go through the first two years of university without
being obliged to declare an area of major concentration for his degree or, if
he does so, is free to change his mind until the beginning of the Junior
(third) year," the very meaning of which is anyone's guess.

(19.) N.B. here that the following main-text paragraph itself is geared to a
very-strong-math-background audience; nobody else is going to get the
paragraph's references, and this reviewer has neither the space nor the
expertise to elucidate them. So feel free to skip it if you do not fit the
paragraph's demographic.

(20.) Unless you are yourself a professional mathematician, the best place to
find a nonlethal discussion of this proof (which is known in number theory as
"Vinogradov's Theorem"--that's how famous this guy was) is in Section C of R.
K. Guy's Unsolved Problems in Number Theory.

(21.) You might further recall (from, e.g., Ovid's Metamorphoses) that this
bull ends up begetting on Minos's queen the Minotaur, a hideous teratoid
monster who has to be secreted in a special labyrinth and propitiated with
human flesh, and who basically symbolizes the moral rot at the heart of
Minos's reign. That rot is, as Joseph Campbell describes it in The Hero With a
Thousand Faces, a certain kind of alienated selfishness:
   The return of the bull should have symbolized Minos' selfless submission to
   the functions of his role. By the sacrilege of the refusal of the rite [of
   sacrifice], however, the individual cuts himself as a unit off from the
   larger whole of the community.... He is the hoarder of the general benefit.
   He is the monster avid for the greedy rights of "my and mine."

(22.) L. Hyde, The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property (1979).

(23.) Clearly, Petros's real sin is not "Pride" so much as plain old
selfishness, Greed. It's not clear whether UPGC's narrator truly fails to
grasp this, or whether he is being presented as naive, or whether the whole
thing's just a translation problem.

(24.) Obvious though it is, Doxiadis apparently fears that his audience won't
get the compact irony here, so he has Hardy then rather sniffily advise Petros
"that it might in the future be more profitable for him to stay in closer
contact with his scientific colleagues."

The author's recent works include Brief Interviews with Hideous Men and the
eBook Up Simbal: 7 Days on the Trail of an Anticandidate.

Uncle Petros & Goldbach's Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis

Bloomsbury USA, New York, 2000. 219 pp. $23.95. ISBN 1-58234-067-6.

Math's cultural stock has risen hard in recent years, no doubt driven by the
same booming and metastatic Knowledge Economy that's turned yesterday's non
grata nerd into today's cybertycoon. Call the phenomenon "Geek Chic" or
"[Hip(2b).sup.2]" or whatever you will: abstract tech is now sexy, the
mathematician a viable commercial hero--see, for example, the success of
recent films like Good Will Hunting and [Pi].

Or, a better instance of math's new cachet here is Amir D. Aczel's Fermat's
Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem, which
made nonfiction bestseller lists in 1996 and transformed Princeton's Andrew
Wiles into a weird kind of horn-rimmed pop icon, and in the wake of which has
appeared everything from Paul Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and
Sylvia Nasar's A Beautiful Mind to David Berlinski's Newton's Gift and Charles
Seife's Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea.

Though fiction, Philibert Schogt's The Wild Numbers (herein WN) and Apostolos
Doxiadis's Uncle Petros & Goldbach's Conjecture (herein UPGC) both draw
heavily on Aczel's Fermat's Last Theorem as well as on G. H. Hardy's A
Mathematician's Apology (1). And there are other, rather striking similarities
between the two novels. Both are set in the world of academic mathematics and
feature characters whose specialty is number theory, higher math's most purely
abstract branch. Both revolve around their protagonists' quests to solve
famous and long-standing number-theoretic problems. And both have been
translated by their own authors from foreign-language originals.

The facts of these two novels' close resemblance and near-simultaneous release
here in the United States, as well as the vigor with which their U.S.
publishers are hyping them (2), appear to signal the inception of a whole new
commercial genre--the "Math Melodrama" as it were. This is a development that
should come as no surprise, given the success of some of the other titles
mentioned above, not to mention the commercial success in recent years of
other nascent tech-intensive genres (e.g., the cyberpunk of Gibson et seq.,
the Clancy-style technothriller, and the
plucky-young-hackers-thwarting-evil-monolithic-institutions of Sneakers,
Hackers, and The Matrix).

As exemplified by WN and UPGC in fiction and Fermat's Last Theorem and A
Beautiful Mind in non-, the Math Melodrama can be roughly characterized as
combining the "Vocational Travelogue" (3) charms of genre authors like Arthur
Hailey and Michael Crichton with some of the weightier allegorical functions
that other genres and their heroes often serve--the Western sheriff as emblem
of Apollonian order, the Noir private eye as existential hero, the plucky
young hacker as Odyssean trickster. The Math Melodrama's own allegorical
template appears to be more classically Tragic, its hero a kind of
Prometheus-Icarus figure whose high-altitude genius is also hubris and Fatal
Flaw. If this Sounds a bit grandiose, well, it is; but it's also a fair
description of the way Math Melodramas characterize the project of pure
math--as nothing less than the mortal quest for Divine Truth. What's odd here
is that whether a particular reader accepts this characterization or sees it
as pretentious and silly will often depend less on the qualities of the Math
Melodramas themselves than on certain biographical facts about the reader,
namely how much knowledge and experience of higher math he or she happens to
have.

This sort of oddity is, in fact, a frequent problem in reviewing "genre
fiction," which is a type of narrative it's usually fair to call "the sort of
thing someone who likes this sort of thing is apt to like." The evaluative
criteria tend to be rather special for such fiction. Instead of the basically
aesthetic assay the reviewer gets to make of most literary fiction--"Is this
piece of fiction good?"--criticism of genre fiction is ultimately more
rhetorical--"To whom will this piece of fiction appeal?" In other words, with
all but the broadest and coarsest fiction, the central questions about novels
like WN and UPGC concern what rhetoricians call "audience": What is the
intended audience for these books? and is this audience apt to find the novels
satisfying on the same terms by which it finds other Math Melodramas
satisfying? and if not, are there other audiences whom these books are more
likely to satisfy? and so on. One reason this is a problem for reviewers is
that book reviews are usually supposed to be short, clear, and relatively
simple; but rhetorical criteria tend to yield very complex, sometimes even
paradoxical conclusions. In the case of WN and UPGC, the paradox is that the
type of audience most likely to accept and appreciate these novels' lofty,
encomiastic view of pure math is also the audience most apt to be disappointed
by the variously vague, reductive, or inconsistent ways the novels handle the
actual mathematics they're concerned with.

To put it in a simpler, more book review-ish way: Neither of these novels is
very good (one, in fact, is downright bad); but the precise ways in which
they're not very good will vary directly with how much an individual reader
already knows about the extraordinary field these two books are trying to
dramatize (4).

Not just professional mathematicians, but almost anyone lucky enough ever to
have studied higher math understands what a pity it is that most students
never pursue the subject past its introductory levels and therefore know only
the dry and brutal problem-solving of Calc I or Intro Stats (which is roughly
analogous to halting one's study of poetry at the level of grammar and
syntax). Modern math is like a pyramid, and the broad fundament is often not
fun. It is at the higher and apical levels of geometry, topology, analysis,
number theory, and mathematical logic that the fun and profundity start, when
the calculators and context less formulae fall away and all that's left are
pencil and papers and what gets called "genius," viz. the particular blend of
reason and ecstatic creativity that characterizes what is best about the human
mind. Those who've been privileged (or forced) to study it understand that the
practice of higher mathematics is, in fact, an "art" (5) and that it depends
no less than other arts on inspiration, courage, toil, etc., but with the
added stricture that the "truths" the art of math tries to express are
deductive, necessary, a priori truths, capable of both derivation and
demonstration by logical proof (6).

It may be that mathematics is not generally recognized as one of the arts
precisely because so much pyramidal training and practice is required in order
to appreciate its aesthetics; math is perhaps the ultimate in acquired tastes
(7). And it's maybe because of math's absolute, wholly abstract Truth that so
many people still view the discipline as dry or passionless and its
practitioners as asocial dweebs. Some Science readers will probably know all
too well the frustration of trying to describe the beauty and power of Gauss's
differential geometry or the Banach-Tarski Paradox to someone who remembers
only the drudgery of factoring quadratic equations or the terror of a trig
midterm. In fact, the weird fear and distaste that low-level math provokes in
so many is part of what makes the emergence of the Math Melodrama exciting: If
the genre can find ways to vivify pure math and communicate the discipline's
extraordinary beauty and passion to the average reader (8), both readers and
math itself stand to gain.

The ways in which Schogt's and Doxiadis's novels go about trying to humanize
and animate math are also similar. Besides both struggling to solve classic
problems in number theory--the actual Goldbach Conjecture in UPGC, a
fictitious conundrum called "Beauregard's Wild Number Problem" (9) in WN--the
books' protagonists also both conceive of their projects almost wholly in
terms of personal achievement, glory. WN's Isaac Swirl, a once-promising
student whose career has stagnated, spends much time fantasizing about solving
the Wild Number Problem and having "an international symposium held in my
honor ... and, now that I was not just a mathematician, but a famous
mathematician, women would suddenly find me attractive, not just eccentric or
at best amusing." And UPGC's Petros Papachristos, although already a
number-theorist of substantial reputation who holds an endowed chaff at the
University of Munich, nevertheless "sought in mathematics a great, almost
transcendent success, a total triumph that would bring him world fame.... And
to be complete, this triumph should be exclusively his own." Despite their
different stations and attainments, the two protagonists also suffer almost
identically (and at great length) from the insecurity of measuring themselves
against their colleagues and the fear that someone else will solve "their"
problem first. Petros actually rejoices when Srinivasa Ramanujan (10) dies
young of tuberculosis, simply because Ramanujan's "unique intellect was the
only force he considered capable of purloining his prize." Both protagonists'
work is characterized as an anxious race against the clock and calendar; both
novels make much of the fact that pure math is a "young man's game" and that
the vast majority of important mathematicians do their best work before 35
(11). And both heroes brood and expound at great length about the particular
despair of being a good but not immortally great mathematician, a
mathematician brilliant enough truly to appreciate the genius of Riemann,
Euler, Poincare et al. but not brilliant enough to be their equal.

Interestingly, though, the most important similarity between the novels
concerns the rhetorical problems of audience mentioned above, and the biggest
differences between the two books concern the ways they try to handle those
problems. Oddly, the better novel is also the one that seems to be the more
confused and confusing about just what its audience is.

The Wild Numbers, translated from the Dutch De wilde getallen and transferred
in locale from Amsterdam to some nameless U.S. college town, is not the better
novel. It's designed to be sort of a schlemiel-comedy a la Thurber's Mitty or
Amis's Lucky Jim. WN's Isaac is a mediocrity who at the start of the novel is
under-published and reduced to doing scutwork calculations and "refinements"
for his superstar colleague Dimitri Arkanov (12) and at age 35 goes around
saying stuff like "I felt old and depressed. There seemed to be no more room
for dreams at my age. Everything was measured in terms of success and
failure.... I concluded that I was a lesser human being in every respect." His
prospects suddenly change when Isaac stumbles into working on "wild numbers,"
which are described this way:
   Beauregard had defined a number of deceptively simple operations, which,
   when applied to a whole number [integer?], at first resulted in fractions
   [rationals?]. But if the same steps were repeated often enough, the
   eventual outcome was once again a whole number [huh?]. Or, as Beauregard
   cheerfully observed: "In all numbers lurks a wild number, guaranteed to
   emerge when you provoke them long enough." 0 yielded the wild number 11, 1
   brought forth 67, 2 itself, 3 suddenly manifested itself as 4769, 4,
   surprisingly, brought for 67 again.

In an all-nighter of migrainous epiphany, Isaac comes to believe he's found
the longs-ought answer to the Wild Number Problem, which is apparently a
fictional variant of number-theoretic puzzles like the Twin Primes Problem
(13): "How many wild numbers are there? Are there a finite number that keep
coming up, and if so, how many, or are there an infinite number?" Isaac's
proof that the set of all wilds is infinite appears at first to be sound, and
it is confirmed and lauded by Arkanov and submitted to a prestigious journal,
catapulting Isaac into the mathematical limelight and prompting all sorts of
wacky plot-complications before it is finally discovered that the proof
doesn't work after all (but by which time Isaac's found true love with a
caustic divorcee who's also had horrible career reverses, so everything works
out O.K. in the end).

The major problem with The Wild Numbers looks at first to be artistic but is
actually rhetorical. All the book's math is, as mentioned, made up, which is
not necessarily a problem--all sorts of great science fiction, from Isaac
Asimov to Larry Niven, is replete with fictional math and high tech. What is a
problem, though, is that the fictional math in WN is extremely important but
also extremely vague, comprising mostly repeated and contextless verbiage--"If
I could only establish its K-reducibility with the aid of a suitable
calibrator set!" without any definitions or even cursory fleshing-out, so that
the book's math-speak ends up most resembling the absurd pseudo-jargon of bad,
old low-budget sci fi movies ("Quick, Lieutenant, prepare the antigenic
nanomodule for immediate stabilization flux!").

Apart from its intrinsic weaknesses, the sketchy made-up math here clearly
indicates that The Wild Numbers is meant to appeal mostly to readers with
little or no high-math background, an audience that either won't know that the
impressive-sounding terminology is fake or won't mind that the terms never get
connected to each other or anything else. This, too, is not necessarily a
problem; many successful books, from Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land to
Ellroy's L. A. Confidential, use sort of perfunctory genre-conventions as
scaffolding for what are really complex and essentially human dramas (i.e.,
for literature). But it's true that a genre book whose particular
genre-elements lack technical depth or resonance must depend for its appeal on
other, more traditionally literary qualities like plot, character, style, etc.
And this is a very real problem for WN, because as any kind of literary
narrative it is off-the-charts bad, its characters mere 2D types (the neurotic
schlemiel, the kindly mentor, the pompous crank, the vulpine reporter, the
fiancee who Doesn't Understand) and its plot howlingly implausible (e.g., for
most of the book both Isaac and Nobel-laureate Arkanov supposedly fail to spot
in Isaac's proof a basic, freshman-level logical flaw, the eventual discovery
of which is sort of the novel's pie-in-the-schlemiel's-face climax). Worst, or
at least most distracting, is the fact that the author-translator's English
seems rudimentary at best (14) and the actual line-by-line prose of WN is
often so stiff and clunky--"How the tiny, quivering flame of my intuition was
able to withstand the numerous onslaughts of my doubts remains a mystery to
me"--or riddled with ESL-ish solecisms--"She pouted her tip"; "I found back my
love for mathematics" (15)--or unintentionally funny--"Her tongue probing deep
into my mouth left little room for mathematical reflection"--or just plain
bad--"They could not help but open like flowers in the brilliant sunshine of
his presence, revealing their innermost secrets to him"--as to make the reader
suffer that terrible, embarrassed-for-someone-else feeling on the author's
behalf.

It is true that Uncle Petros & Goldbach Conjecture is also author-translated
(from the original O Theios Petros kai i Eikasia tou Golbach) and its prose
often awkward or stilted: "I was not made of the same mettle as he--this I
realized now beyond the shadow of a doubt." But here the clunky English is
mitigated somewhat by UPGC's Greco-European setting and the fact that much of
its action takes place before 1930. The novel's nested structure is itself
almost Victorian: The middle-aged narrator, describing in retrospect the
history of his childhood relationship with his reclusive uncle, recounts
Petros's own life story in a series of flashbacks "as told to" him by the
great mathematician himself. The elaborate set-up notwithstanding, it is
Petros's obsessive and tormented career that drives the novel and comprises
its heart.

UPGC is about as far from a schlemiel-comedy as you can get. It's more like a
cross between the Myth of Icarus and Goethe's Werther, and it's serious as a
heart attack (16). Born in Greece around the turn of the century, Petros
Papachristos is recognized as a child math prodigy and shipped across Europe
to the University of Berlin, where in 1916 he receives his doctorate with a
dissertation on "solving a particular variety of differential equations" that
earns young Petros early acclaim because of its applications in WWI artillery
targeting. It is also at the university that Petros has his first and only
love affair, with his German-language tutor (a young lady by the rather
unsubtle name of Isolde), who toys with his affections and then elopes with a
Prussian officer. In not its best moment, UPGC tries to establish this (wince)
Isolde as Petros's initial motive for tackling the Goldbach Conjecture:
   In order to win her heart back, Petros now decided, there could be no
   half-measures.... he should have to accomplish amazing intellectual feats,
   nothing short of becoming a Great Mathematician. But how does one become a
   Great Mathematician? Simple: by solving a Great Mathematical Problem!
   "Which is the most difficult problem in mathematics, Professor?" he asked
   [his advisor] at their next meeting, trying to feign mere academic
   curiosity.

Whereupon Petros devotes the remainder of his professional life to the G.C.,
that Everest of unsolved problems. His twenty-year labor, which ends in
failure and devastation, combines periods of seclusion in Germany with
extended trips to Cambridge and Vienna, in which latter there are scenes of
him rubbing elbows with some of 20th-century math's most important historical
figures. The use of this Forrest Gump-ish device implies that UPGC is written
for readers who are at least familiar enough with higher math to know who
Hardy, Ramanujan, Godel, and Turing are; but many of the celebrity-scenes
themselves are cheesy and kind of irritating. The complex and sensitive Hardy
readers know from his Apology, for instance, gets reduced in Doxiadis's novel
to a sort of gouty old curmudgeon who spouts inanities like "Don't you forget
it, Papachristos, this blasted Conjecture is difficult!"

Its treatment of the "real" Hardy is a good example of UPGC's particular
rhetorical problem: The readers who will actually know who Godfrey Harold
Hardy is are also the readers most likely to be put off by the way the book
portrays him (17). And Doxiadis's novel runs into this sort of
logico-rhetorical problem again and again, because its big weakness as genre
fiction is its weird, ambivalent confusion about just what kind of audience
it's for.

As with Schogt's WN, there's no better instance of this confusion than the way
pure math is rendered here, although in UPGC the math is 100% real and
intricately connected to the book's characters and themes. Petros's Herculean
labors on his proof are recounted to the reader in the form of fireside
declamations to his nephew (i.e., the narrator as a child), who's enough of a
mathematical ephebe that Petros can plausibly keep stopping to deliver quick
little mini-lectures on the history of number theory, from Euclid's reductio
proof of the infinity of primes, to the major theorems of Fermat, Euler, and
Gauss on primes' distribution and succession, to the Goldbach Conjecture and
Petros's own analytic attack thereon via "the Theory of Partitions (the
different ways of writing an integer as a sum)."

It gets more complicated, though, because the narrator as a grown man now has
an extensive math background, and he himself laces the novel with explanatory
asides on everything from Cavafy poems to the Riemann Zeta Function. The
problem is that Doxiadis's decisions about what needs explicating and what
doesn't are often so inconsistent as to seem bizarre. It's not just that there
are long and irrelevant footnotes on, for example, Godel's method of suicide,
Poincare's theory of the unconscious, or the novel properties of the number
1729 (18). It is that the narrator of UPGC will often take time to carefully
define very basic terms like "integers" and "primes" or to include patronizing
asides like "It should be pointed out to the non-specialist that mathematical
[text]books cannot normally be enjoyed like novels, in bed, in the bathtub,
sprawled in an easy chair, or perched on the commode"--all of which clearly
imply a non-math audience--while, on the other hand, UPGC is also studded with
rarefied technical phrases like "n's ratio to the natural logarithm,"
"Peano-Dedekind axiomatic system," "partial differential equation in the
Clairaut form," and (no kidding) "The orders of the torsion subgroups of
[[Omega].sub.n] and the Adams spectral sequence" that are tossed around
without any kind of explanation, which (especially together with the h clef
appearances of Godel, J. E. Littlewood, et al.)seems to presume a highly
math-literate reader.

And if all the narrator's strange elementary definitions are disregarded as
mere slips or snafus, and one decides that UPGC's actual intended audience is
one with a solid high-math background (19), there remains an equally strange
inconsistency. This lies in the narrative's discussions of the Goldbach
Conjecture itself, and of its history in the early 20th century. For one
thing, UPGC makes hardly mention at all of the crucial distinction between
Euler's "strong Goldbach Conjecture" [see (4)] and the Conjecture's equally
famous "weak" version, which states that all odd numbers [is greater than or
equal to] 9 are the sum of three odd primes. Nor, despite all the detailed
descriptions of Petros's labors and all the long excursuses on pre-WWII number
theory, does the novel ever once mention Euler's phi (or "totient") function
or the ingenious "sieve"-type methods that real mathematicians were using to
attack the G.C. in the 1920s and 1930s. In fact, even though UPGC gives us
page after page on Petros's anxiety about Ramanujan's work on the G.C. (which
was in reality very slight), there's no mention of any of the actual important
published results of the time, e.g. Schnirelmann's 1931 proof of the upper
limit of primes of which an even integer can be the sum and Estermann's 1938
proof that almost all even numbers are the sums of two primes. Strangest of
all, though Doxiadis's narrator spends a lot of time discussing the difference
between algebraic and analytic number theory (as well as tracing out Gauss's
"asymptotic" hypothesis of the Prime Number Theorem, and Hadamard and Vallee
Poussin's 1896 proof of the P.N.T. using analytic tools), there is not one
reference in the book to I. M. Vinogradov, the Russian mathematician who in
1937 revolutionized analytic number theory by introducing a powerful method
for getting very accurate estimates of trigonometric sums and using it to
prove the weak G.C. for sufficiently large numbers (20). Historically, it is
Vinogradov who would have been Petros's real rival, the "unique intellect" he
really feared; and it is not Godel's but Vinogradov's Theorem that might
plausibly have caused Papachristos to despair.

The thing to realize here is that none of these omissions would necessarily
matter had not Doxiadis chosen to make UPGC so dependent on actual
number-theory and real historical characters. As it stands, though, the
audience knowledgeable enough to appreciate all the "real" math and history
woven into this novel is also the audience most likely to notice the strange
absence in the book of so much really real historical work on the Conjecture.
Here once again, then, is a form of the weird, paradoxical-looking problem
(viz., that necessary conditions for liking the novel are also sufficient
conditions for disliking it) that pretty much destroys this book, whose author
can't decide whom he's writing for.

It would be unfair to Doxiadis, though, not to acknowledge that both his novel
and its flaws are far more interesting than Schogt's WN, and moreover that
UPGC does include some moving and rather lovely passages:
   The loneliness of the researcher doing original mathematics is unlike any
   other. In a very real sense of the word, he lives in a universe that is
   totally inaccessible, both to the greater public and to his own immediate
   environment. Even those closest to him cannot partake of his joys and his
   sorrows in any significant way, since it is all but impossible for them to
   understand their content.

The novel also offers at least one sub-theme of genuine insight and
originality, one that manages to go beyond anything Hardy had to say about the
tragedies of math. This particular thematic line concerns Petros's ambition
and his place in the mathematical community; and its allegorical touchstone
appears to be not Icarus but Minos, the Cretan king who so coveted a certain
great white bull, which the god Poseidon had conjured out of sea-foam to help
him win the throne, that Minos broke his sworn promise to return it via
religious sacrifice and instead kept the bull for himself (21).

It is true that doing original math is "lonely." But it is also true that
professional mathematicians compose a community. The reality, which Petros
never seems to recognize, is that the "fame and immortality" he so craves will
depend entirely on the value of his work to other mathematicians. The role of
professional community is so important in nearly all branches of scientific
endeavor, in fact, that most Science readers can probably already appreciate
what Lewis Hyde's The Girl (22) tries to convey to its own more general
audience:
   [T]he task of assembling a mass of disparate facts into a coherent whole
   clearly lies beyond the powers of a single mind or even a single
   generation. All such broad intellectual undertakings call for a community
   of scholars, one in which each individual thinker can be awash in the ideas
   of his comrades so that a sort of "group mind" develops, one that is
   capable of cognitive tasks beyond the power of any single person.

Notwithstanding all the narrator's heavy declarations that "Uncle Petros' sin
was Pride" and his retreat into paralyzed seclusion "a form of burnout" or
"scientific battle fatigue," it emerges in the novel that the real cause of
Petros's tragedy is his progressive withdrawal from the professional community
as his ambition to solve the Conjecture becomes a rapacity that transforms his
colleagues first into rivals and then into enemies. The novel's middle
sections trace this progression out nicely. It starts in Cambridge, when
Petros rejects an offer of professional collaboration with Hardy and
Littlewood because he fears that "[t]heir problems would become his own and,
what's worse, their fame would inevitably outshine his," and determines
instead to work on the G.C. alone, withdrawing to Munich. There, over years of
seclusion and nonstop work, privacy becomes secrecy, and Petros's fear and
suspicion of other mathematicians approaches "the point of paranoia. In order
to avoid his colleagues' drawing conclusions from the items he withdrew from
the library, he began to ... ask for an article in a scientific journal only
in order to get his hands on the issue that also contained another article,
the one he really wanted." (See also Petros's aforementioned "wild joy" at the
death of Ramanujan.)

The real Minoan-type crisis, though, comes about halfway through the novel,
when Petros achieves an important "intermediate result" in his progress toward
the Conjecture--a "deep, pioneering theorem ... which opened new vistas in the
Theory of Numbers"--and has to decide what to do with it. Petros's internal
debate about whether to publish the result (which is really a
Hyde-versus-Minos argument about membership in a community) is probably the
novel's best moment:
   Undoubtedly, its publication would secure him recognition in the
   mathematical world much greater than that achieved by his method for
   solving differential equations. In fact, it would probably catapult him to
   the first ranks of the small but select international community of number
   theorists, practically on the same level as its great stars.

   By making his discovery public, he would also be opening the way into the
   [Goldbach] problem to other mathematicians who would build on it by
   discovering new results and expand the limits of the field in a way a lone
   researcher, however brilliant, could scarcely hope. The results they would
   achieve would, in turn, aid him in his pursuit of the proof to the
   Conjecture. In other words ... he would be acquiring a legion of assistants
   in his work. Unfortunately, there was another side to this coin: one of the
   new unpaid (also unasked for) assistants might conceivably stumble upon a
   better way to apply his theorem and manage, God forbid, to prove Goldbach's
   Conjecture before him.

   He didn't have to deliberate long. The danger far outweighed the benefit.
   He wouldn't publish.

From here on, the die is cast. And because he is not a king, it is not his
community but Petros himself who receives the inevitable punishment for this
"hoarding of the general benefit" (23). What happens is that his unpublished
result is independently discovered by another mathematician, a development
Petros finds out about only years later, from Hardy, who "expressed his
amazement that Petros had not been aware of this, since its publication had
caused a sensation in the circles of number theorists and brought great
acclaim to its young author" (24).

As UPGC's plot unfolds, this sort of Aesopian, reap-just-what-you-sow
punishment gets inflicted on Petros again and again, worsening as each
ego-blow increases his alienation and paranoia and sends him deeper into a
kind of professional solipsism. Far more than any supposed misreading of
Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, it is this solipsism that leads to
Petros's "failure"--as both a mathematician and a person--and he ends up
rather like Milton's Satan, not just alone but Alone, sustaining himself on
the sort of megalomaniacal self-pity that creative people everywhere know and
dread:
   "I, Petros Papachristos, never having published anything of value, will go
   down in mathematical history--or rather will not go down in it--as having
   achieved nothing. This suits me fine, you know. I have no regrets.
   Mediocrity would never have satisfied me. To an ersatz, footnote kind of
   immortality, I prefer ... total obscurity!"

Despite the confused and confusing math-labyrinth it's hidden inside, the
embedded story of Petros's fall is in fact a kind of monstrous gem, one in
whose facets readers of many different backgrounds and tastes might see parts
of themselves reflected. Apparent implication: If math can be art, so
sometimes can genre.

References and Notes

(1.) This classic long essay, originally published in 1940 and re-released by
Cambridge University Press in 1992, is the unacknowledged father of most of
the last decade's math-prose. There is very little that any of the recent
books do that Hardy's terse and beautiful Apology did not do first, better,
and with rather less fuss.

(2.) WN's cover comes with a blurb from Fermat's Last Theorem's Aczel, who
must have been on some kind of euphoriant medication--"l have never read a
better fictional description of what it's like to work in pure math"--as well
as the breathless marketing tag "THE LINE BETWEEN GENIUS AND MADNESS IS A THIN
ONE." UPGC's publisher's big tactic is to offer a million-dollar bounty to
anyone who can prove Goldbach's Conjecture before 2002.

(3.) "Vocational Travelogue" is a shorthand way of acknowledging that for a
long time one reason people used to read fiction was for a kind of imaginative
tourism to places and cultures they'd never get to really see; that
modernity's jetliners, TV, etc. have pretty well made this function obsolete;
but that modern tech has also created such extreme vocational specialization
that today few people are in a position to know much about any professional
field other than their own; and thus that a certain amount of fiction's
"touristic" function now consists in giving readers dramatized access to the
nuts and bolts of different professional disciplines and specialties.

(4.) in fairness to all concerned, this variability in readers' mathematical
backgrounds is a problem for almost anyone trying to write general-interest
prose about math, a problem that Hardy refers to as "the restrictions under
which I am writing. On the one hand my examples must be very simple, and
intelligible to a reader who has no specialized mathematical knowledge.... And
on the other hand my examples should be drawn from `pukka' mathematics, the
mathematics of the working professional mathematician." Note that this sort of
thing is a problem even for rather more special-interest writing like this
book review itself. Is it, for example, necessary to inform or remind the
average Science reader that Fermat's Last Theorem (c. 1637) states that where
n is an integer and n [is greater than] 2, the equation xn + yn = zn has no
nonzero integer solutions? or that Goldbach's Conjecture (or rather the
"strong" G.C, as reformulated by Leonhard Euler in 1742) is that every even
integer [is greater than] 4 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers?
As it happens, this reviewer is not certain whether it's necessary or not, and
the fact that these lines have not been deleted by Science's editors (i.e.,
that you are reading them at all) may indicate that the editors are not
totally sure either.

(5.) Hardy, whose Apology talks about this better than anything else ever has,
explains that "The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or poet's,
must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together
in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test; there is no permanent place in
the world for ugly mathematics."

(6.) The assumption here will be that the typical Science reader already knows
what "a priori," "deductive truth," and "logical proof" mean and is at least
roughly familiar with the relationship between pure math and formal logic, if
for no other reason than that to gloss tangential stuff like this would take
up enormous amounts of space and time and might we[[ also alienate the
(presumably large) percentage of Science's readership who already know the
stuff and are apt to find such glosses not only otiose but annoying--this
reviewer can actually imagine such readers looking increasingly aggrieved and
impatient and saying to themselves, "Who does he think he's talking to?" All
this is mentioned only to underscore once again the rhetorical diceyness of
the whole math-prose enterprise, a diceyness that lies at the very center of
this review's criticisms of the two novels.

(7.) It's worth noting that as so much contemporary poetry, classical music,
etc. become ever more abstract and involute and technically complex, their own
audiences get ever smaller and more specialized. With few exceptions, the
people who truly appreciate a piece of language-poetry or an atonal fugue are
people with extensive educations in the history and theory of these arts. And
this increasing exclusivity in the arts has much less to do with good old
"cultural elitism" than with our era's tendency toward greater and greater
specialization--it is not at all an accident that the majority of people who
read contemporary poetry are themselves contemporary poets.

(8.) "Average reader" is kind of a synecdoche for "people who read mainly for
diversion or entertainment." These people are American genre fiction's basic
audience. It is true that Hardy's Apology, as well as novels from Don
DeLillio's Ratner's Star and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow to Neal
Stephenson's Cryptonomicon have already deployed higher math in interesting
and significant ways. But books like these are belle lettres, literature, for
which the audience is, again, usually small and rather specialized. Genre
books are mass-audience books and are marketed accordingly.

(9.) The putative author of this problem, one "Anatole Millechamps de
Beauregard" (b. 1791), is a kind of biographical hybrid of yon Neumann and
Galois, on whose florid life story Schogt spends most of a chapter.

(10.) Like many of UPGC's supporting characters, Ramanujan was a real
number-theorist, an Indian savant discovered and mentored by Hardy. Robert
Kanigal's The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan is another
of the post-Fermat math-bios now on the market.

(11.) The real source of this insight is Hardy, in his Apology's famous "No
mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than
any other art or science, is a young man's game," which UPGC's narrator rips
off without any attribution at all: "Mathematics, you see, is a young man's
game. It is one of the few human endeavors where youth is a necessary
requirement [sic] for greatness." This is probably the place to point out that
Doxiadis's whole novel is filled with what appear to be little more than very
slight rephrasings from Hardy's Apology or C. R Snow's famous Foreword to it.
At one point, Doxiadis even cribs nearly word for word a deathbed exchange
between Hardy and Ramanujan and tags it with the footnote "Hardy also recounts
the incident in his Mathematician's Apology without, however, acknowledging my
uncle's presence." This is not only intrusive and irritating but wrong,
because it is not in the Apology but in Snow's Foreword that the scene really
appears.

(12.) The work Isaac is doing for Arkanov is on "calibrator sets" and
"K-reducibility," two made-up terms that figure prominently in the plot's math
but are never specified or explained.

(13.) Here the reviewer's assumption is that if the T.P.P. is unfamiliar or
the analogy unhelpful it can just be passed over with no hard feelings on
either side.

(14.) Schogt's original Dutch prose might, of course, be a thing of wonder.

(15.) The Wild Numbers' American publisher seems equally culpable for the
prose here. If Four Walls Eight Windows is going to let an only semi-bilingual
Philibert Schogt translate his own Dutch, why didn't they at least help him
with basic English usage.

(16.) And it's just about as subtle with respect to its thematics: The
narrator repeatedly and sans irony describes his uncle as an "Ideal Romantic
Hero" (caps his) and says stuff like "Think of the biblical Tree of Knowledge
or the Prometheus of mythology. People like him have surpassed the common
measure; they've come to know more than is necessary to man, and for this
hubris they have to pay."

(17.) There's a way more grievous example of this sort of thing involving Kurt
Godel and the plot's first real crisis. Alan Turing (here a wide-eyed
unclergrad) accidentally exposes Petros to Godel's First Incompleteness
Theorem in 1933, whereupon Petros freaks out because he fears that the
Goldbach Conjecture may be one of the F. L. Theorem's "formally unprovable"
propositions. This is so implausible and reductive as to be almost offensive.
As Science's readership is hereby presumed [q.v. (6)] to more or less know
already, Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is concerned with the abstract
possibility of Completeness in axiomatic systems, and the formally unprovable
propositions it succeeds in deriving are all very special self-reference-type
cases, the mathematical equivalent of the "1 am lying" paradox. To believe
that the First Incompleteness Theorem could apply to actual number-theoretic
problems like the Goldbach Conjecture is so crude and confused that there is
no way that a professional mathematician of Petros's attainments could
possibly entertain what the novel says is "the one and only, dizzying,
terrifying question that had jumped into his mind the moment he'd heard of
Godel's result.... what if the Incompleteness Theorem also applied to his
problem? What if Goldbach's Conjecture was unprovable?"

(18.) Some of these footnotes are so weird and U.S.-reader inappropriate that
it's worth giving a concrete example, such as the footnote to a line on page
41 about the narrator enrolling in a U.S. college: "According to the American
system, a student can go through the first two years of university without
being obliged to declare an area of major concentration for his degree or, if
he does so, is free to change his mind until the beginning of the Junior
(third) year," the very meaning of which is anyone's guess.

(19.) N.B. here that the following main-text paragraph itself is geared to a
very-strong-math-background audience; nobody else is going to get the
paragraph's references, and this reviewer has neither the space nor the
expertise to elucidate them. So feel free to skip it if you do not fit the
paragraph's demographic.

(20.) Unless you are yourself a professional mathematician, the best place to
find a nonlethal discussion of this proof (which is known in number theory as
"Vinogradov's Theorem"--that's how famous this guy was) is in Section C of R.
K. Guy's Unsolved Problems in Number Theory.

(21.) You might further recall (from, e.g., Ovid's Metamorphoses) that this
bull ends up begetting on Minos's queen the Minotaur, a hideous teratoid
monster who has to be secreted in a special labyrinth and propitiated with
human flesh, and who basically symbolizes the moral rot at the heart of
Minos's reign. That rot is, as Joseph Campbell describes it in The Hero With a
Thousand Faces, a certain kind of alienated selfishness:
   The return of the bull should have symbolized Minos' selfless submission to
   the functions of his role. By the sacrilege of the refusal of the rite [of
   sacrifice], however, the individual cuts himself as a unit off from the
   larger whole of the community.... He is the hoarder of the general benefit.
   He is the monster avid for the greedy rights of "my and mine."

(23.) Clearly, Petros's real sin is not "Pride" so much as plain old
selfishness, Greed. It's not clear whether UPGC's narrator truly fails to
grasp this, or whether he is being presented as naive, or whether the whole
thing's just a translation problem.

(24.) Obvious though it is, Doxiadis apparently fears that his audience won't
get the compact irony here, so he has Hardy then rather sniffily advise Petros
"that it might in the future be more profitable for him to stay in closer
contact with his scientific colleagues."

The Daddy was around the side of the house hanging a door for the tenant when
he heard the child's screams and the Mommy's voice gone high between them. He
could move fast, and the back porch gave onto the kitchen, and before the
screen door had banged shut behind him the Daddy had taken the scene in whole,
the overturned pot on the floortile before the stove and the burner's blue jet
and the floor's pool of water still steaming as its many arms extended, the
toddler in his baggy diaper standing rigid with steam coming off his hair and
his chest and shoulders scarlet and his eyes rolled up and mouth open very
wide and seeming somehow separate from the sounds that issued, the Mommy down
on one knee with the dishrag dabbing pointlessly at him and matching the
screams with cries of her own, hysterical so she was almost frozen. Her one
knee and the bare little soft feet were still in the steaming pool, and the
Daddy's first act was to take the child under the arms and lift him away from
it and take him to the sink, where he threw out plates and struck the tap to
let cold wellwater run over the boy's feet while with his cupped hand he
gathered and poured or flung more cold water over his head and shoulders and
chest, wanting first to see the steam stop coming off him, the Mommy over his
shoulder invoking God until he sent her for towels and gauze if they had it,
the Daddy moving quickly and well and his man's mind empty of everything but
purpose, not yet aware of how smoothly he moved or that he'd ceased to hear
the high screams because to hear them would freeze him and make impossible
what had to be done to help his child, whose screams were regular as breath
and went on so long they'd become already a thing in the kitchen, something
else to move quickly around. The tenant side's door outside hung half off its
top hinge and moved slightly in the wind, and a bird in the oak across the
driveway appeared to observe the door with a cocked head as the cries still
came from inside. The worst scalds seemed to be the right arm and shoulder,
the chest and stomach's red was fading to pink under the cold water and his
feet's soft soles weren't blistered that the Daddy could see, but the toddler
still made little fists and screamed except now merely on reflex from fear the
Daddy would know he thought possible later, small face distended and thready
veins standing out at the temples and the Daddy kept saying he was here he was
here, adrenaline ebbing and an anger at the Mommy for allowing this thing to
happen just starting to gather in wisps at his mind's extreme rear still hours
from expression. When the Mommy returned he wasn't sure whether to wrap the
child in a towel or not but he wet the towel down and did, swaddled him tight
and lifted his baby out of the sink and set him on the kitchen table's edge to
soothe him while the Mommy tried to check the feet's soles with one hand
waving around in the area of her mouth and uttering objectless words while the
Daddy bent in and was face to face with the child on the table's checkered
edge repeating the fact that he was here and trying to calm the toddler's
cries but still the child breathlessly screamed, a high pure shining sound
that could stop his heart and his bitty lips and gums now tinged with the
light blue of a low flame the Daddy thought, screaming as if almost still
under the tilted pot in pain. A minute, two like this that seemed much longer,
with the Mommy at the Daddy's side talking sing-song at the child's face and
the lark on the limb with its head to the side and the hinge going white in a
line from the weight of the canted door until the first wisp of steam came
lazy from under the wrapped towel's hem and the parents' eyes met and
widened-the diaper, which when they opened the towel and leaned their little
boy back on the checkered cloth and unfastened the softened tabs and tried to
remove it resisted slightly with new high cries and was hot, their baby's
diaper burned their hand and they saw where the real water'd fallen and pooled
and been burning their baby all this time while he screamed for them to help
him and they hadn't, hadn't thought and when they got it off and saw the state
of what was there the Mommy said their God's first name and grabbed the table
to keep her feet while the father turned away and threw a haymaker at the air
of the kitchen and cursed both himself and the world for not the last time
while his child might now have been sleeping if not for the rate of his
breathing and the tiny stricken motions of his hands in the air above where he
lay, hands the size of a grown man's thumb that had clutched the Daddy's thumb
in the crib while he'd watched the Daddy's mouth move in song, his head cocked
and seeming to see way past him into something his eyes made the Daddy
lonesome for in a strange vague way. If you've never wept and want to, have a
child. Break your heart inside and something will a child is the twangy song
the Daddy hears again as if the lady was almost there with him looking down at
what they've done, though hours later what the Daddy won't most forgive is how
badly he wanted a cigarette right then as they diapered the child as best they
could in gauze and two crossed handtowels and the Daddy lifted him like a
newborn with his skull in one palm and ran him out to the hot truck and burned
custom rubber all the way to town and the clinic's ER with the tenant's door
hanging open like that all day until the hinge gave but by then it was too
late, when it wouldn't stop and they couldn't make it the 'child had learned
to leave himself and watch the whole rest unfold from a point overhead, and
whatever was lost never thenceforth mattered, and the child's body expanded
and walked about and drew pay and lived its life untenanted, a thing among
things, its self's soul so much vapor aloft, falling as rain and then rising,
the sun up and down like a yoyo.

The depressed person was in terrible and unceasing emotional pain, and the
impossibility of sharing or articulating this pain was itself a component of
the pain and a contributing factor in its essential horror.

Despairing, then, of describing the emotional pain itself, the depressed
person hoped at least to be able to express something of its context -- its
shape and texture, as it were -- by recounting circumstances related to its
etiology. The depressed person's parents, for example, who had divorced when
she was a child, had used her as a pawn in the sick games they played, as in
when the depressed person had required orthodonture and each parent had
claimed -- not without some cause, the depressed person always inserted, given
the Medicean legal ambiguities of the divorce settlement -- that the other
should pay for it. Both parents were well-off, and each had privately
expressed to the depressed person a willingness, if push came to shove, to
bite the bullet and pay, explaining that it was a matter not of money or
dentition but of "principle." And the depressed person always took care, when
as an adult she attempted to describe to a supportive friend the venomous
struggle over the cost of her orthodonture and that struggle's legacy of
emotional pain for her, to concede that it may well truly have appeared to
each parent to have been, in fact, a matter of "principle," though
unfortunately not a "principle" that took into account their daughter's
feelings at receiving the emotional message that scoring petty points off each
other was more important to her parents than her own maxillofacial health and
thus constituted, if considered from a certain perspective, a form of neglect
or abandonment or even outright abuse, an abuse clearly connected -- here she
nearly always inserted that her therapist concurred with this assessment -- to
the bottomless, chronic adult despair she suffered every day and felt
hopelessly trapped in.

The approximately half-dozen friends whom her therapist -- who had earned both
a terminal graduate degree and a medical degree -- referred to as the
depressed person's Support System tended to be either female acquaintances
from childhood or else girls she had roomed with at various stages of her
school career, nurturing and comparatively undamaged women who now lived in
all manner of different cities and whom the depressed person often had not
laid eyes on in years and years, and whom she called late in the evening,
long-distance, for badly needed sharing and support and just a few well-chosen
words to help her get some realistic perspective on the day's despair and get
centered and gather together the strength to fight through the emotional agony
of the next day, and to whom, when she telephoned, the depressed person always
apologized for dragging them down or coming off as boring or self-pitying or
repellent or taking them away from their active, vibrant, largely pain-free
long-distance lives. She was, in addition, also always extremely careful to
share with the friends in her Support System her belief that it would be whiny
and pathetic to play what she derisively called the "Blame Game" and blame her
constant and indescribable adult pain on her parents' traumatic divorce or
their cynical use of her. Her parents had, after all -- as her therapist had
helped the depressed person to see -- done the very best they could do with
the emotional resources they'd had at the time. And she had, the depressed
person always inserted, laughing weakly, eventually gotten the orthodonture
she'd needed. The former acquaintances and classmates who composed her Support
System often told the depressed person that they just wished she could be a
little less hard on herself, to which the depressed person responded by
bursting involuntarily into tears and telling them that she knew all too well
that she was one of those dreaded types of everyone's grim acquaintance who
call at inconvenient times and just go on and on about themselves. The
depressed person said that she was all too excruciatingly aware of what a
joyless burden she was, and during the calls she always made it a point to
express the enormous gratitude she felt at having a friend she could call and
get nurturing and support from, however briefly, before the demands of that
friend's full, joyful, active life took understandable precedence and required
her (i.e., the friend) to get off the telephone.

The feelings of shame and inadequacy the depressed person experienced about
calling members of her Support System long-distance late at night and
burdening them with her clumsy attempts to describe at least the contextual
texture of her emotional agony were an issue on which she and her therapist
were currently doing a great deal of work in their time together. The
depressed person confessed that when whatever supportive friend she was
sharing with finally confessed that she (i.e., the friend) was dreadfully
sorry but there was no helping it she absolutely had to get off the telephone,
and had verbally detached the depressed person's needy fingers from her
pantcuff and returned to the demands of her full, vibrant long-distance life,
the depressed person always sat there listening to the empty apian drone of
the dial tone feeling even more isolated and inadequate and unempathized-with
than she had before she'd called. The depressed person confessed to her
therapist that when she reached out long-distance to a member of her Support
System she almost always imagined that she could detect, in the friend's
increasingly long silences and/or repetitions of encouraging cliches, the
boredom and abstract guilt people always feel when someone is clinging to them
and being a joyless burden. The depressed person confessed that she could well
imagine each "friend" wincing now when the telephone rang late at night, or
during the conversation looking impatiently at the clock or directing silent
gestures and facial expressions communicating her boredom and frustration and
helpless entrapment to all the other people in the room with her, the
expressive gestures becoming more desperate and extreme as the depressed
person went on and on and on. The depressed person's therapist's most
noticeable unconscious personal habit or tic consisted of placing the tips of
all her fingers together in her lap and manipulating them idly as she listened
supportively, so that her mated hands formed various enclosing shapes -- e.g.,
cube, sphere, cone, right cylinder -- and then seeming to study or contemplate
them. The depressed person disliked the habit, though she was quick to admit
that this was chiefly because it drew her attention to the therapist's fingers
and fingernails and caused her to compare them with her own.

The depressed person shared that she could remember, all too clearly, how at
her third boarding school she had once watched her roommate talk to some boy
on their room's telephone as she (i.e., the roommate) made faces and gestures
of entrapped repulsion and boredom with the call, this popular, attractive,
and self-assured roommate finally directing at the depressed person an
exaggerated pantomime of someone knocking on a door until the depressed person
understood that she was to open their room's door and step outside and knock
loudly on it so as to give the roommate an excuse to end the call. The
depressed person had shared this traumatic memory with members of her Support
System and had tried to articulate how bottomlessly horrible she had felt it
would have been to have been that nameless pathetic boy on the phone and how
now, as a legacy of that experience, she dreaded, more than almost anything,
the thought of ever being someone you had to appeal silently to someone nearby
to help you contrive an excuse to get off the phone with. The depressed person
would implore each supportive friend to tell her the very moment she (i.e.,
the friend) was getting bored or frustrated or repelled or felt she (i.e., the
friend) had other more urgent or interesting things to attend to, to please
for God's sake be utterly candid and frank and not spend one moment longer on
the phone than she was absolutely glad to spend. The depressed person knew
perfectly well, of course, she assured the therapist,(1) how such a request
could all too possibly be heard not as an invitation to get off the telephone
at will but actually as a needy, manipulative plea not to get off -- never to
get off -- the telephone.

The depressed person's parents had eventually split the cost of her
orthodonture; a professional arbitrator had been required in order to
structure this compromise and, subsequently, to negotiate shared payment
schedules for the depressed person's boarding schools and Healthy Eating
Lifestyle summer camps and oboe lessons and car and collision insurance, as
well as for the cosmetic surgery needed to correct a malformation of the
anterior spine and alar cartilage of the depressed person's nose which had
given her what felt like an excruciatingly pronounced and snoutish pug nose
and had, coupled with the external orthodontic retainer she had to wear
twenty-two hours a day, made looking at herself in the mirrors of her rooms at
her boarding schools feel like more than any person could possibly stand.
Also, in the year that her father remarried, he, in either a gesture of rare
uncompromised caring or a coup de grace that the depressed person's mother had
said was designed to make her own feelings of humiliation and superfluousness
complete, had paid in toto for the riding lessons, jodhpurs, and outrageously
expensive boots the depressed person had needed in order to gain admission to
her second-to-last boarding school's Riding Club, a few of whose members were
the only girls at this school who the depressed person felt, she had confessed
to her father on the telephone in tears late one truly horrible night, even
remotely accepted her at all and around whom the depressed person hadn't felt
so totally pig-nosed and brace-faced and inferior that it had been a daily act
of enormous personal courage and will just to leave her room and go cat dinner
in the dining hall.

The professional arbitrator her parents' lawyers had agreed on for help in
structuring their compromises had been a highly respected conflict-resolution
specialist named Walter D. ("Walt") Ghent Jr. The depressed person had never
even laid eyes on Walter D. ("Walt") Ghent Jr., though she had been shown his
business card -- complete with its parenthesized invitation to informality --
and his name had been invoked bitterly in her hearing on countless occasions,
along with the fact that he billed at a staggering $130 an hour plus expenses.
Despite overwhelming feelings of reluctance on the part of the depressed
person, the therapist had strongly supported her in taking the risk of sharing
with members of her Support System an important emotional realization she
(i.e., the depressed person) had achieved during an Inner-child-focused
Experiential Therapy Retreat Weekend which the therapist had supported her in
taking the risk of enrolling in and giving herself open-mindedly over to the
experience of. In the I.-C.-F.E.T. Retreat Weekend's Small-Group Drama-therapy
Room, other members of her small group had role-played the depressed person's
parents and the parents' significant others and attorneys and myriad other
emotionally painful figures from her childhood, and had slowly encircled the
depressed person, moving in steadily together so that she could not escape,
and had (i.e., the small group had) dramatically recited specially prepared
lines designed to evoke and reawaken trauma, which had almost immediately
evoked in the depressed person a surge of agonizing emotional memories and had
resulted in the emergence of the depressed person's Inner Child and a
cathartic tantrum in which she had struck repeatedly at a stack of velour
cushions with a bat of polystyrene foam and had shrieked obscenities and had
reexperienced long-pent-up wounds and repressed feelings, the most important
of which being a deep vestigial rage over the fact that Walter D. ("Walt")
Ghent Jr. had been able to bill her parents $130 an hour plus expenses for
playing the role of mediator and absorber of shit while she had had to perform
essentially the same coprophagous services on a more or less daily basis for
free, for nothing, services which were not only grossly unfair and
inappropriate for a child to feel required to perform but which her parents
had then turned around and tried to make her, the depressed person herself, as
a child, feel guilty about the staggering cost of Walter D. Ghent Jr., as if
the cost and hassle were her fault and undertaken only on her spoiled little
fat-thighed pig-nosed shiteating behalf instead of simply because of her
fucking parents' utterly fucking sick inability to communicate directly and
share honestly and work through their own sick issues with each other. This
exercise had allowed the depressed person to get in touch with some really
core resentment-issues, the small-group facilitator at the Inner-Child-Focused
Experiential Therapy Retreat Weekend had said, and could have represented a
real turning point in the depressed person's journey toward healing, had the
public shrieking and velour-cushion-pummeling not left the depressed person so
emotionally shattered and drained and traumatized and embarrassed that she'd
felt she had no choice but to fly back home that night and miss the rest of
the Weekend.

The eventual compromise which she and her therapist worked out together
afterward was that the depressed person would share the shattering emotional
realizations of the I.-C.-F. E.T.R. Weekend with only the two or three very
most trusted and unjudgingly supportive members of her Support System, and
that she would be permitted to reveal to them her reluctance about sharing
these realizations and to inform them that she knew all too well how pathetic
and blaming they (i.e., the realizations) might sound. In validating this
compromise, the therapist, who by this time had less than a year to live, said
that she felt she could support the depressed person's use of the word
"vulnerable" more wholeheartedly than she could support the use of the word
"pathetic," which word (i.e., "pathetic") struck the therapist as toxically
self-hating and also somewhat manipulative, an attempt to protect oneself
against the possibility of a negative judgment by making it clear that one was
already judging oneself far more negatively than any listener could have the
heart to. The therapist -- who during the year's cold months, when the
abundant fenestration of her home office kept the room chilly, wore a pelisse
of hand-tanned Native American buckskin that formed a somewhat ghastlily
moist-looking flesh-colored background for the enclosing shapes her hands
formed in her lap -- said that she felt comfortable enough in the validity of
their therapeutic connection together to point out that a chronic mood
disorder could itself be seen as constituting an emotionally manipulative
defense mechanism: i.e., as long as the depressed person had the depression's
affective discomfort to preoccupy her, she could avoid feeling the deep
vestigial childhood wounds which she was apparently determined to keep
repressed at all costs.(2)

Several months later, when the depressed person's therapist suddenly died --
as the result of what was determined to be an "accidentally" toxic combination
of caffeine and homeopathic appetite suppressant but which, given the
therapist's extensive medical background, only a person in very deep denial
indeed could fail to see must have been, on some level, intentional -- without
leaving any sort of note or cassette or encouraging last words for any of the
patients who had come to connect emotionally with the therapist and establish
some degree of intimacy even though it meant making themselves vulnerable to
the possibility of adult loss- and abandonment-traumas, the depressed person
found this fresh loss so shattering, its resultant hopelessness and despair so
unbearable, that she was forced now to reach frantically and repeatedly out to
her Support System, calling three or even four different supportive friends in
an evening, sometimes calling the same friends twice in one night, sometimes
at a very late hour, and sometimes, even, the depressed person felt
sickeningly sure, either waking them up or maybe interrupting them in the
midst of healthy and joyful sexual intimacy with their partner. In other
words, sheer emotional survival now compelled the depressed person to put
aside her innate feelings of shame at being a pathetic burden and to lean with
all her might on the empathy and nurture of her Support System, despite the
fact that this, ironically, had been one of the two issues about which she had
most vigorously resisted the therapist's counsel.

The therapist's death could not have occurred at a worse time, coming as it
did just as the depressed person was beginning to process and work through
some of her core shame- and resentment-issues concerning the therapeutic
process itself, the depressed person shared with her Support System. For
example, the depressed person had shared with the therapist the fact that it
felt ironic and demeaning, given her parents' dysfunctional preoccupation with
money and all that that preoccupation had cost her, that she was now in a
position where she had to pay a professional therapist $90 an hour to listen
patiently and respond empathetically. It felt demeaning to have to purchase
patience and empathy, the depressed person had confessed to her therapist, and
was an agonizing echo of the childhood pain she was so anxious to put behind
her. The therapist, after attending very closely and patiently to what the
depressed person later acknowledged to her Support System could all too easily
have been interpreted as just a lot of ungrateful whining, and after a long
pause during which both of them had gazed at the digiform ovoid cage which the
therapist's mated hands at that moment composed,(3) had responded that, while
she might sometimes disagree with the substance of what the depressed person
said, she nevertheless wholeheartedly supported the depressed person in
sharing whatever feelings the therapeutic relationship itself brought up so
that they could work together on exploring safe, appropriate environments and
contexts for their expression.(4)

The depressed person's recollection and sharing of the therapist's supportive
responses brought on further, even more unbearable feelings of loss and
abandonment, as well as waves of resentment and self-pity which she knew all
too well were repellent in the extreme, the depressed person assured her
Support System, whose members she was by this time calling almost constantly,
sometimes even during the day, from her workplace, swallowing her pride and
dialing their work numbers and asking them to take time away from their own
vibrant, stimulating careers to listen supportively and share and help the
depressed person find some way to process this grief and loss and find some
way to survive. Her apologies for burdening these friends during daylight
hours at their workplaces were elaborate, vociferous, and very nearly
constant, as were her expressions of gratitude to the Support System for just
Being There for her, because she was discovering again, with shattering new
clarity in the wake of the therapist's wordless abandonment, just how
agonizingly few and far between were the people with whom she could ever hope
to really communicate and forge intimate, mutually nurturing relationships to
lean on. The depressed person's work environment, for example, was totally
toxic and dysfunctional, making the idea of trying to bond in any mutually
supportive way with coworkers ludicrous. And her attempts to reach out in her
isolation and develop caring relationships through church groups or nutrition
or holistic stretching classes or community woodwind ensembles had proved so
excruciating, she shared, that she had been reduced to begging the therapist
to withdraw her gentle suggestion that the depressed person try her best to do
so. And as for the idea of girding herself and venturing out once again into
the emotionally Hobbesian meat market of the dating scene ... at this juncture
the depressed person usually laughed hollowly into the speaker of the headset
telephone she wore at the terminal inside her cubicle and asked whether it was
even necessary to go into why her intractable depression and highly charged
trust-issues rendered this idea a sheer pie-in-the-sky flight of pathetic and
denial-ridden fancy, at best.

By this stage in the grieving process, the depressed person's emotional agony
had so completely overwhelmed her vestigial defense mechanisms that whenever a
member of her Support System finally said that she was dreadfully sorry but
she absolutely had to get off the telephone, the primal instinct for sheer
emotional survival now drove the depressed person to swallow every last
tattered remnant of pride and to beg shamelessly for two or even just one more
minute of the friend's time and attention, and -- if the "supportive friend"
held firm and terminated the conversation -- to spend now hardly any time
listening dully to the dial tone or gnawing the ragged cuticle of her index
finger or grinding the heel of her hand savagely into her forehead or feeling
anything other than sheer primal desperation as she hurriedly dialed the next
ten-digit number on her Support System Telephone List, which by this time had
been photocopied several times and placed in the depressed person's address
book, workstation terminal's PHONE.VIP file, billfold, minilocker at the
Holistic Stretching and Nutrition Center, and in a special pocket inside the
back cover of the leatherbound Feelings Journal which the depressed person --
at her late therapist's suggestion(5) -- carried with her at all times.

It was at this same point, driven by desperation to abandon all defenses and
to share her deepest feelings with what was possibly the single most trusted
and indispensable member of her Support System, that the depressed person
shared that she felt she had found, somehow, finally, the willingness to risk
trying to follow the second of the late overdosed therapist's two suggestions
which she (i.e., the depressed person) had most vehemently resisted over the
course of their work together. The depressed person proposed now to take an
unprecedented emotional risk and to begin asking certain important persons in
her life to tell her straight out whether they had ever secretly felt
contempt, derision, judgment, or repulsion for her, and was choosing to begin
this vulnerable interrogative process with the one particularly nurturing and
dependable and trustworthy Support System member with whom she was sharing via
her workstation's telephone right this moment.(6) She had resolved, the
depressed person shared, to ask these potentially deeply traumatizing
questions without preamble or apology or interpolated self-criticism. She
wished to hear, with no holds barred, her very most valuable friend's honest
opinion of her, the potentially negative and judging and traumatic and hurtful
parts as well as the positive and affirming and supportive and nurturing
parts. The depressed person stressed that she was serious about this: the
honest assessment of her by an objective but deeply caring confidante felt, at
this point in time, like a literal matter of life and death.

For she was frightened, the depressed person confessed to the trusted and
convalescing friend, profoundly frightened by what she felt she was learning
about herself following the sudden death of a therapist who for nearly four
years had been her single most valuable resource and trusted support and --
with no offense intended to any of the members of her Support System -- her
very best friend in the world. For she had discovered, the depressed person
confessed, that when she took her daily Quiet Time now, during the grieving
process, and got quiet and centered and looked deep within, she could neither
feel nor identify any feelings for the therapist as a person, as a person who
had died, a person who only somebody in truly stupefying denial could fail to
see had probably taken her own life, and thus a person who, the depressed
person posited, had possibly suffered levels of emotional pain and isolation
and despair which were comparable to or maybe even exceeded the depressed
person's own. And thus that although the depressed person had had agonizing
feelings aplenty since the therapist's suicide, these feelings appeared to be
all and only for herself, i.e., for her loss, her abandonment, her grief, her
trauma and pain and primal affective survival. And that this terrifying set of
realizations, instead of awakening in her any feelings of compassion, empathy,
or Other-directed grief for the therapist -- and here the depressed person
waited patiently for an episode of retching in the especially available
trusted friend to pass so that she could take the emotional risk of sharing
this with her -- these realizations seemed merely to have brought up in the
depressed person still more feelings about herself. At this point, sharing,
the depressed person paused to swear up and down to her long-distance, gravely
ill, frequently retching, but still caring and intimate friend that there was
no toxic or manipulative self-hatred in this confession, only profound fear:
the depressed person was frightened for herself, for as it were "[her] self"
-- i.e., her "spirit" or "soul," her capacity for basic human empathy and
compassion -- she told the supportive friend with the neuroblastoma. She was
asking sincerely, the depressed person said, honestly, desperately: what kind
of person could seem to feel nothing -- "nothing," she emphasized -- for
anyone but herself? She wept into the headset telephone and said she was
shamelessly begging her now single most valuable friend and confidante in the
world to share her (i.e., the friend with the virulent malignancy in her
adrenal medulla's) brutally candid assessment, to pull no punches, to say
nothing reassuring or supportive or exculpatory which she did not honestly
believe to be true. She trusted her, she assured her. She had decided, she
shared, that her very life itself, however fraught with agony and despair and
indescribable loneliness, depended, at this point in her journey toward
healing, on inviting -- even, if necessary, begging shamelessly for -- honest
feedback, even if that feedback was traumatic or hurtful. The depressed person
therefore urged her terminally ill friend to go on, to not hold back, to let
her have it: What terms might be used to describe and assess such a
solipsistic, self-consumed, bottomless emotional vacuum and sponge as she now
appeared to herself to be? How was she to decide and describe -- even to
herself, facing herself-what all she had learned said about her?

(1) The multiform shapes the therapist's mated fingers assumed nearly always
resembled various geometrically diverse cages, an association which the
depressed person had not shared with the therapist because its symbolism
seemed too overt and simplistic to waste their valuable time together on. The
therapist's fingernails were long and well-maintained, whereas the depressed
person's nails were compulsively bitten so short and ragged that the quick
sometimes protruded and began spontaneously to bleed.

(2) The depressed person's therapist was always extremely careful to avoid
appearing to suggest that she (i.e., the depressed person) had in any
conscious way chosen or chosen to cling to her endogenous depression. Defenses
against intimacy, the therapist held, were almost always arrested or vestigial
survival mechanisms: they had, at one time, been environmentally appropriate
and had served to shield an otherwise defenseless childhood psyche against
unbearable trauma, but in nearly all cases these mechanisms became
inappropriately imprinted and outlived their purpose, and now "in adulthood,"
ironically, caused a great deal more trauma and pain than they prevented.

(3) The therapist -- who was substantially older than the depressed person but
still younger than the depressed person's mother, and who resembled that
mother in almost no respects -- sometimes annoyed the depressed person with
her habit of from time to time glancing very quickly at the large bronze
sunburst-design clock on the wall behind the recliner in which the depressed
person customarily sat, glancing so quickly and almost furtively at the clock
that what bothered the depressed person more and more over time was not the
act itself but the therapist's apparent effort to hide or disguise it. One of
the therapeutic relationship's most significant breakthroughs, the depressed
person told members of her Support System, had come when she had finally been
able to share that she would prefer it if the therapist would simply look
openly up at the bronze helioform clock instead of apparently believing -- or
at least behaving, from the depressed person's admittedly hypersensitive
perspective, as if she believed -- that the hypersensitive depressed person
could be fooled by the therapist's dishonestly sneaking an observation of the
time into something designed to look like a routine motion of the head or
eyes. And that while they were on the whole subject, the depressed person had
to confess that she sometimes felt demeaned and enraged when the therapist's
face assumed its customary expression of boundless patience, an expression
which the depressed person said she knew very well was intended to communicate
attention and unconditional support but which sometimes felt to the depressed
person like emotional detachment, like professional courtesy she was paying
for instead of the intensely personal compassion and empathy she sometimes
felt she had spent her whole life starved for. She was sometimes resentful,
she shared, at being nothing but the object of the therapist's professional
courtesy or of the so-called "friends" in her pathetic "Support System"'s
charity and abstract guilt.

(4) Or even that, for example, to be totally honest, it felt demeaning and
somehow insulting to know that today (i.e., the day of the seminal session
during which the depressed person had opened up and risked sharing all these
issues and feelings about the therapeutic relationship), at the moment their
appointed time together was up and they had risen from their respective
recliners and hugged awkwardly and said their goodbyes until their next
appointment, that at that moment all of the therapist's seemingly intensely
personally focused attention and interest in the depressed person would then
be withdrawn and effortlessly transferred onto the next whiny spoiled
self-involved snaggletoothed pig-nosed fat-thighed pathetic shiteater who was
waiting to come in and cling pathetically to the hem of the therapist's
pelisse, so desperate for a personally interested friend that they would pay
almost as much per month for the temporary illusion of one (i.e., of an actual
friend) as they paid in fucking rent. This even though the depressed person
knew quite well, she had said, holding up a pica-gnawed hand to prevent
interruption, that the therapist's professional detachment was in fact not at
all incompatible with true caring, and that it meant that the depressed person
could for once be totally open and honest without ever having to be afraid
that the therapist would take anything she said personally or judge it or in
any way resent or reject the depressed person; that, ironically, in certain
ways the therapist was actually an absolutely ideal friend for the depressed
person: i.e., here, after all, was a person who would truly and attentively
listen and care and give emotional support and empathy and yet would expect
absolutely nothing back in terms of empathy or emotional support or really any
human consideration at all. The depressed person knew perfectly well that it
was in fact the $90 an hour which made the therapeutic relationship's
simulacrum of friendship so ideally clean and one-sided. And yet she
nevertheless found it demeaning to feel that she was spending $1,080 a month
to purchase what was in many respects just a fantasy-friend who fulfilled her
(i.e., the depressed person's) infantile fantasies of getting her emotional
needs met by an Other without having to empathize with or even consider the
valid human needs of the Other, an empathy and consideration which the
depressed person then tearfully confessed she often despaired of ever even
having it in her to be able to give. The depressed person had here inserted
that she secretly worried constantly that it was her own inability to get
outside her needy self-centeredness and to truly emotionally give that had
made her attempts at intimate, mutually nurturing relationships with men such
a traumatic and agonizing across-the-board failure. And that her resentments
about the cost of therapy were in truth less about the actual expense -- which
she freely admitted she could afford -- than about the idea of paying for an
artificially one-sided relationship, the depressed person then laughing
hollowly to indicate that she heard and acknowledged the unwitting echo of her
cold, niggardly, emotionally unavailable parents in the stipulation that what
was objectionable was the idea or "principle" of an expense. What it really
felt like sometimes was as if the hourly therapeutic fee were a kind of ransom
or "protection money," purchasing the depressed person an exemption from the
scalding internal self-contempt and mortification of telephoning distant
former friends she hadn't even laid fucking eyes on in years and had no
legitimate claim on the friendship of anymore and telephoning them uninvited
at night and intruding on their functional and blissfully ignorantly joyful if
somewhat shallow and unconscious lives and appealing shamelessly to their
compassion and leaning shamelessly on them and trying to articulate the
essence of her unceasing emotional pain when that very pain and despair and
loneliness rendered her, the depressed person knew, far too self-involved to
be able ever truly to Be There in return for the supportive friends to reach
out and lean on in return, i.e., that the depressed person's was a
pathetically starved and greedy omnineediness that only a complete idiot would
not expect the members of her so-called "Support System" to detect all too
easily, and to be repelled by, and to stay on the telephone only out of the
barest and most abstract human charity, all the while rolling their eyes and
making faces and looking at the clock and wishing desperately that the phone
call were over or that the depressed person would call someone else or that
the depressed person had never been born and didn't even exist "if the truth
be told," if the therapist really wanted the "totally honest sharing" she kept
"alleging [she] want[ed]," the depressed person later tearfully confessed to
her Support System she had hissed derisively at the therapist, her face (i.e.,
the depressed person's face) contorted in what she imagined must have been a
repulsive admixture of rage and self-pity. If the therapist really wanted the
truth, the depressed person had finally shared from a hunched and near-fetal
position beneath the sunburst clock, sobbing uncontrollably, the depressed
person really felt that what was really unfair was that she was unable, even
with the trusted and admittedly compassionate therapist, to communicate her
depression's terrible and unceasing agony itself, agony which was the
overriding and a priori reality of her every waking minute -- i.e., not being
able to share the way it felt, what it actually felt like for the depressed
person to be literally unable to share it, as for example if her very life
depended on describing the sun but she were allowed to describe only shadows
on the ground ... The depressed person had then laughed hollowly and
apologized to the therapist for employing such a floridly melodramatic
analogy. She shared all this later, with her Support System, following the
therapist's death from homeopathic caffeinism, including her (i.e., the
depressed person's) reminiscence that the therapist's display of attention
during this seminal but ugly and humiliating breakthrough session had been so
intense and professionally uncompromising that she had blinked far less often
than any listener the depressed person had ever opened up to face-to-face had
ever blinked. The two most special and trusted current members of her Support
System had responded, almost verbatim, that it sounded as though the therapist
had been very special and the depressed person obviously missed her very much;
and the one particularly trusted and valuable, physically ill long-distance
friend whom the depressed person leaned on more heavily than on any other
friend during the grieving process suggested that the most loving and
appropriate way to honor both the therapist's memory and the grief over her
loss might be for the depressed person to try to become as special and caring
and nurturing a friend to herself as the late therapist had been.

(5) As a natural part of the grieving process, sensuous details and affective
memories flooded the depressed person's agonized psyche at random and
unpredictable moments, pressing in on her and clamoring for expression and
processing. The buckskin pelisse, for example, though the therapist had seemed
almost fetishistically attached to the Native American garment and during cool
weather had worn it, seemingly, on a near-daily basis, was always immaculately
clean and always presented an immaculately raw- and moist-looking flesh-toned
backdrop to the varioform cages the therapist's unconscious hands composed. It
had never been clear how or by what process the therapist's authentic
pelisse's buckskin was able to stay so perfectly clean -- unless, the
depressed person confessed to imagining, the therapist had worn it only for
their particular appointments. The therapist's chilly home office also
contained, on the wall opposite the bronze clock and behind the therapist's
recliner, a stunning molybdenum desk-and-personal-computer-hutch ensemble, one
shelf of which was lined, on either side of the deluxe Braun coffeemaker, with
small framed photographs of the therapist's husband and sisters and son; and
the depressed person often broke into fresh sobs of grief and self-excoriation
on her workstation's headset telephone as she confessed to her Support System
that she had never even asked the therapist's intimate loved ones' names.

(6) The singularly valuable and supportive friend on the telephone was an
alumna of one of the depressed person's boarding schools, a generous,
nurturing divorced mother of two in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, who had
recently undergone her second course of chemotherapy for a virulent
neuroblastoma, which greatly reduced the number of activities and
responsibilities in her full, vibrant, undepressed life, and who thus was not
only almost always at home but also enjoyed nearly unlimited conflict-free
availability and time to share on the telephone, for which the depressed
person was now careful to enter a daily prayer of gratitude in her Feelings
Journal.

"I'm like thirteen, it's my birthday, and we go to a like renowned Italian
place in Cranston to celebrate. I'm from Cranston. My big sister is there,
also, who always wears a mood ring that's always brown. I get the spinach
manicotti Genovese, which my dad he always says it's real good here. But then
he doesn't order it. But I do. The waiter brings it out in this little like
metal skillet thing steaming all over the place. He puts it down in front of
me on a little like stand-up trivet thing on the tablecloth. The tablecloth's
white. This is a story to answer your question. The waiter says to me to be
cautious and wait a little bit with this dish because it's hot and the skillet
thing is real hot so please be very cautious. My dad gets the pappardelle with
sausage and mushrooms and a side of baby calamari. My big sister tried a
suicide attempt and always has to wear long sleeves; my mom makes her. And I
take and like to reach out one hand and touch the skillet thing to see if it's
really so hot. It burns my hand, and I yank it back and then sit there holding
my hand out for my mom to look at. She's concerned. But my dad, he's been
watching the whole thing while he's eating his calamari, and he's almost
choking with laughter at me touching the skillet. There's this thing with his
lip when he laughs. My sister always puts her hands over her ears. `Boy,
that's a whole little character study of you right there,' he laughs. Big red
loud laugh. My hand is red, also."

B.I. #14 St. Davids PA

"It's cost me every sexual relationship I ever had. I don't know why I do it.
I'm not a political person, I don't consider myself. I'm not one of these
America First, read the newspaper, will Buchanan get the nod people. I'll be
doing it with some girl, it doesn't matter who. It's when I start to come.
That it happens. I'm not a Democrat. I don't even vote. I freaked out about it
one time and called a radio show about it, a doctor on the radio, anonymously,
and he diagnosed it as the uncontrolled yelling of involuntary words or
phrases, frequently insulting or scatological, which is coprolalia is the
official term. Except when I start to come and always start yelling it it's
not insulting, and it's not obscene, it's always the same thing, and it's
always so weird but I don't think insulting. I think it's just weird. And
uncontrolled. It's like it comes out the same way the spooge comes out, it
feels like that. I don't know what it's about and I can't help it."

Q.

"`Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom!' Only way louder. As in really
shouting it. Uncontrollably. I'm not even thinking it until it comes out and I
hear it. `Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom!' Only louder than
that: `VICTORY--'"

Q.

"Well it totally freaks them out, what do you think? And I just about roll
over and die of the embarrassment. I don't ever know what to say. What do you
say if you just shouted `Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom!' right
when you came?"

Q.

"It wouldn't be so embarrassing if it wasn't so totally fucking weird. If I
had any clue about what it was about. You know?"

Q. ...

"God, now I'm embarrassed as hell."

Q.

"But all there is is the once. That's what I mean about it costing. I can tell
how bad it freaks them out, and I get embarrassed and never call them again.
Even if I try to explain. And it's the ones that'll act all understanding like
they don't care and it's okay and they understand and it doesn't matter that
embarrass me the worst, because it's so fucking weird to yell `Victory for the
Forces of Democratic Freedom!' when you're shooting off that I can always tell
they're totally freaked out and just condescending down to me and pretending
they understand, and those are the ones where actually I actually end up
almost getting pissed off and don't even feel embarrassed not calling them or
totally avoiding them, the ones that say `I think I could love you anyway.'"

B.I. #3 Trenton NJ [Overheard]

R--: "So I'm last off again as usual and all that business like that there."

A--: "Yes just wait and relax in your seat be the last off why everybody right
away all the time has get up the minute it stops and cram into the aisle so

R--: "Just wait and finally coming out of the jetway thing and into the you
know gate are greeting areas as usual thinking I'll just get a cab out to--"

A--: "Still but always depressing on these cold calls to come out into the
gate greeting area and see everybody getting met and with the squeals and the
hugs and limo guys holding up all the names on cardboard that aren't your name
and the l--"

R--: "Just shut it for one fucking second will you because listen to this
because except it's mostly emptied out by the time I get out there."

A--: "The people by that juncture are mostly all dispersed you're saying."

R--: "Except for over there's this one girl left over by the rope looking in
peering gazing in down the jetway thing there as she sees it's me as I'm
looking at her as I come out because it's emptied out except for her, our eyes
meet and all that business like that there, and what does she she up and goes
down on her knees drops crying and with the waterworks and all that business
hitting slapping the carpet and scratching at gouging little tufts and fibers
out of the cheap-ass product they buy where the low-polymer glue starts the
backing separating almost right away and ends up tripling their twenty-quarter
M and R costs as I sure don't have to tell you and all bent over slapping and
gouging at the product with the nails, bent over so you can you know just
about see her tits. Totally hysterical and with the waterworks and all like
that there."

A--: "Another cheery welcome to Dayton for your fucking cold calls, we're
pleased to wel--"

R--: "No but the story it turns out the story when I you know go over to say
are you okay is anything the matter and like that and get a better shot of I
have to tell you some pretty fucking incredible tits under this like tight
little top like leotard top thing under this coat she's all down and bent over
and in like bitchslapping herself in the head and still doing manual field
stresses on this gate area product where she says this guy that she was in
love with and all that business there that said he was in love with her too
except he was already engaged from priorly when they meet and fall vehemently
in love so there's all this back and forth and storm and drag business like
that and I'm lending the ear to her standing there but finally she says but
finally the guy gets off the fence and finally says how he's surrendering to
his love for this girl here with the tits and commits to her and says how he's
going to go and tell this other girl in Tulsa where the guy lives that he's
engaged to about this girl here and break it off in Tulsa and finally
surrender and commit to this hysterical girl with the tits that loves him more
than life herself and felt a merger of `souls' with him and all that violin
business like that and felt like finally for chrissakes after all the
one-track shitheels she'd got the runaround from she finally she felt like
here at last she's met a guy she could trust and love and merge `souls' with
the sort of violins and hearts and fl--"

A--: "And blah blah blah."

R--: "Blah and says off the guy goes flying back to Tulsa to finally break the
engagement off with the prior girl like he committed he would and then fly
right back to the arms of this girl standing with the Kleenex with the tits in
Dayton here in the gate area with the waterworks crying out her eyes to yours
truly."

A--: "Oh like we can't see this coming."

R--: "Fuck you and that he puts his hand over his heart and all like that
there and swears he's coming back to her and he'll be on that plane there with
the flight number and time and she swears she'll be there with the tits to
meet him, and how she tells all her friends she's finally in love the real
thing and how he's breaking it off and coming right back and she cleans up her
place for him to stay there when he comes back and gets her hair done up all
big with spray like they do and dribbles perfume on her you know zones and all
that business like the usual story and puts on her best pink jeans did I
mention she's got on these pink jeans and heels that say fuck me in like
numerous major world languages--"

A--: "Heh heh."

R--: "By this juncture now we're in that little coffee shop thing just in from
the USAir gates that shitty one with no chairs that you have to with your
shitty two-dollar coffee stand up at the tables with your sample case and bag
and all your shit on the low-end tile not even thermoset of the floor they got
that's already starting to curl at the grout and keep handing her Kleenexes
and lend the ear and all that business there after she vacuums out the car and
even replaces the little freshener thing hanging off the rearview and hauls
ass to be on time to the airport to meet the flight number this so-called
trustable guy swore on his fucking mother's life he'd be on."

A--: "Guy's a shitheel from the old school."

R--: "Shut up and that how she says how he even called her she gets the call
right as she's smearing the last drib of perfume on her zone and gets her hair
all sprayed out in directions like they do to haul ass to the airport it rings
and it's this guy and there's all this hiss and static on the phone and she
says he says how he's calling from the sky is how romantically he puts it
calling her inflight on the flight on that little inflight phone you're
supposed to slide your card through out of the back of the seat in front of
you and saying how--"

A--: "The markup on those things go six bucks a minute it's a racket and all
the surcharges rated out of the region you're flying over right then with a
double spread if the region they say adjoins at the grid's desig--"

R--: "But that's not the point do you want to hear this how the point's this
girl says she gets there early in the gate area greeting area and already with
some of the waterworks already from love and violins of commitment finally and
trust and stands she says all joy and trusting like a pathetic fool she says
while it gets in finally the flight and we and they all start herding all in
their big rush out the jetway thing and he's not in the first wave out and
he's not in the second wave how they come out in these little waves clumps
like the thing's taking some kind of almost shit you know how--"

A--: "Jesus I ought to the amount of fucking times I spend on jetw--"

R--: "And says like a pathetic a total fool her faith never faltering she kept
peering gazing over the octoweave rope maroon octoweave with that nice
faux-velvet finish the rope of the area over at the side during all the
hugging and everybody meeting or going off to Baggage and every time expecting
this guy in the next wave out, clump, and then the next and next and like
that, waiting."

A--: "Poor little muttski"

R--: "That then at the end there I come off the last off as usual and nobody
else after except the crew pulling their little near identical little bags
those near little bags that always bug me somehow and that's it I'm the last
and she--"

A--: "So you're explaining it wasn't you that she's screaming and hitting the
floor it's just that you're the last of them off and you're not this shitheel
guy. The bastard even must of faked that call, the static if you run your
Remington it makes static that'll sound like a--"

R--: "And I'm telling you you never saw anybody so the word heartbroken you
think it's just words blah blah but then you see this girl with her hand
knocking herself in the head for being such a fool crying so hard she can't
mostly breathe and all that business like that, hugging herself and rocking
and slapping the shit out of the table so bad you have to lift the coffee off
to keep it from knocking over and how men are shits and don't trust them all
her friends said and she finally she met one she thinks she can finally trust
to really give in and surrender and commit to do the right thing and they're
right, she's a fool, men are just shit."

A--: "Men mostly are shit, you're right, heh heh."

R--: "And I'm basically, I'm standing there holding coffee I don't even it's
too late I don't want even decaf I'm lending the ear and my heart I got to say
it my heart going out a little bit to this girl for this heartbreak. I swear
kid never but you have never seen anything like this heartbreak on this girl
with the tits, and I start telling her how she's right the guy's a shit and
don't even deserve and how it's true most guys are shit and how my heart's
going out and all like that."

A--: "Heh heh. So then what happened?"

R--: "Heh heh."

A--: "Heh heh heh."

R--: "You really got to ask?"

A--: "You bastard. You shitheel."

R--: "Well you know how it is I mean what are you going to do."

A--: "You shitheel."

R--: "Well you know."

B.I. #42 Peoria Heights IL

"The soft plopping sounds. The slight gassy sounds. The little involuntary
grunts. The special sigh of an older man at a urinal, the way he establishes
himself there and sets his feet and aims and then lets out a timeless sigh you
know he's not aware of.

"This was his environment. Six days a week he stood there. Saturdays a double
shift. The needles-and-nails quality of urine into water. The unseen rustle of
newspapers on bare laps. The odors."

Q.

Top-rated historic hotel in the state. The finest lobby, the single finest
men's room between the two coasts, surely. Marble shipped from Italy. Stall
doors of seasoned cherry. Since 1969 he's stood there. Rococo fixtures and
scalloped basins. Opulent and echoing. A large opulent echoing room for men of
business, substantial men, men with places to go and people to see. The odors.
Don't ask about the odors. The difference between some men's odors, the
sameness in all men's odors. All sounds amplified by tile and Florentine
stone. The moans of the prostatic. The hiss of the sinks. The ripping
extractions of deep-lying phlegm, the plosive and porcelain splat. The sounds
of fine shoes on dolomite flooring. The inguinal rumbles. The hellacious
ripping explosions of gas and the sound of stuff hitting the water.
Half-atomized by pressures brought to bear. Solid, liquid, gas. All the odors.
Odor as environment. All day. Nine hours a day. Standing there in Good-Humor
white. Men coming in, men going out. Eight stalls, six urinals, sixteen sinks.
Do the math. What were they thinking?"

Q. ...

"It's what he stands in. In the sonic center. Where the shine stand used to
be. In the crafted space between the end of the sinks and the start of the
stalls. The space designed for him to stand. The vortex. Just outside the long
mirror's frame, by the sinks--a continuous sink of Florentine marble, sixteen
scalloped basins, leaves of gold foil around the fixtures, mirror of good
Danish plate. In which men of substance drag material out of the corners of
their eyes and squeeze their pores, blow their nose in the sinks and walk off
without rinsing. He stood all day with his towels and small cases of
personal-size toiletries. A trace of balsam in the three vents' whisper. The
vents' threnody is inaudible unless the room is empty. He stands there when
it's empty too. This is his occupation; this is his career. Dressed all in
white like a masseur. Plain white Hanes T and white pants and tennis shoes he
had to throw out if so much as a spot. He takes their cases and topcoats,
guards them, remembers without asking whose is whose. Speaking as little as
possible in all those acoustics. Appearing at men's elbows to hand them
towels. An impassivity that is effacement. This is my father's career."

Q. ...

"The stalls' fine doors end a foot from the floor--why is this? Why this
tradition? Is it descended from animals' stalls? is the word stall related
from animals? Fine stalls that afford some visual privacy and nothing else. If
anything they amplify the sounds inside, bullhorns on end. You hear it all.
The balsam makes the odors worse by sweetening them. The toes of dress shoes
defiled along the row of spaces beneath the doors. The stalls full after
lunch. A long rectangular box of shoes. Some tapping. Some of them humming,
speaking aloud to themselves, forgetting they are not alone. The flatus and
tussis and meaty splats. Defecation, egestion, extrusion, dejection,
purgation, voidance. The unmistakable rumble of the toilet-paper dispensers.
The occasional click of nail clippers or depilatory scissors. Effluence.
Emission. Orduration, micturition, transudation, emiction, feculence,
catharsis--so many synonyms--why? What are we trying to say to ourselves in so
many ways?"

Q. ...

"The olfactory clash of different men's colognes, deodorants, hair tonic,
mustache wax. The rich smell of the foreign and unbathed. Some of the stalls'
shoes touching their mate hesitantly, tentatively, as if sniffing it. The damp
lisp of buttocks shifting on padded seats. The tiny pulse of each bowl's pool.
The little dottles that survive flushing. The urinals' ceaseless purl and
trickle. The indole stink of putrefied food, the eccrine tang to the jackets,
the uremic breeze that follows each flush. Men who will touch fixtures only
with tissue. Men who trail paper out of the stalls, their own comet's tail,
the paper lodged in their anus. Anus. The word anus. The anuses of the
well-to-do ranging above the bowl's water, flexing, puckering, distending.
Soft faces squeezed right in effort. Old men who require all kinds of ghastly
help--lowering and arranging another man's shanks, wiping another man. Silent,
wordless, impassive. Whisking the shoulders of another man, shaking off
another man, removing a pubic hair from the pleat of another man's slacks. For
coins. The sign says it all. Men who tip, men who do not tip. The effacement
cannot be too complete or they forget he is there when it comes time to tip.
The trick of his demeanor is to appear only provisionally there, to exist all
and only if needed. Aid without intrusion. Service without servant. No man
wants to know another man can smell him. Millionaires who do not tip. Natty
men who splatter the bowls and tip a nickel. Heirs who steal towels. Tycoons
who pick their noses with their thumb. Philanthropists who throw cigar butts
on the floor. Self-made men who spit in the sink. Wildly rich men who do not
flush and without a thought leave it to someone else to flush because this is
literally what they are used to--the old saw Would you do this at home.

"He bleached his work clothes himself, ironed them. Never a word of complaint.
Impassive. The sort of man who stands in one place all day. Sometimes the very
soles of the shoes visible under there, in the stalls, of vomiting men. The
word vomit. The mere word. Men being ill in a room with acoustics. All the
mortal sound he stood in every day. Try to imagine. The soft expletives of
constipated men, men with colitis, ileus, irritable, bowel, lientery,
dyspepsia, diverticulitis, ulcers, bloody flux. Men with colostomies handling
him the bag to dispose of. An equerry of the human. Hearing without hearing.
Seeing only need. The slight nod that in men's rooms is acknowledgment and
deferral at once. The ghastly metastasized odors of continental breakfasts and
business dinners. A double shift when he could. Food on the table, a roof,
children to educate. His arches would swell from the standing. His bare feet
were blancmanges. He showered thrice daily and scrubbed himself raw, but the
job still followed him. Never a word.

"The door tells the whole story. MEN. I haven't seen him since 1978 and I know
he's still there, all in white, standing. Averting his eyes to preserve their
dignity. But his own? His own five senses? What are those three monkeys'
names? His task is to stand there as if he were not there. Not really. There's
a trick to it. A special nothing you look at."

Q.

"I didn't learn it in a men's room, I can tell you that."

Q.

"Imagine not existing until a man needs you. Being there and yet not there. A
willed translucence. Provisionally there, contingently there. The old saw
Lives to serve. His career. Breadwinner. Every morning up at six, kiss us all
goodbye, a piece of toast for the bus. He could eat for real on his break. A
bellman would go to the deli. The pressure produced by pressure. The rich
belches of expense-account lunches. The mirrors' remains of sebum and pus and
sneezes detritus. Twenty-eight, no -nine years at the same station. The grave
nod he'd receive a tip with. The inaudible thank-you to the regulars.
Sometimes a name. All those solids tumbling out of all those large soft warm
fat moist white anuses, flexing. Imagine. To attend so much passage. To see
men of substance at their most elemental. His career. A career man."

Q.

"Because he brought his work home. The face he wore in the men's room. He
couldn't take it off. His skull conformed to fit it. This expression or rather
lack of expression. Attendant and no more. Alert but absent. His face. Beyond
reserved. As if forever conserving himself for some ordeal to come."

Q.

"I own nothing white. Not one white thing, I can tell you that much. I
eliminate in silence or not at all. I tip. I never forget that someone is
there.

"Yes and do I admire the fortitude of this humblest of working men? The
stoicism? The Old-World grit? To stand there all those years, never one sick
day, serving? Or do I despise him, you're wondering, feel disgust, contempt
for any man who'd stand effaced in that miasma and dispense towels for coins?"

Q.

"...."

Q.

"What were the two choices again?"

"I have to admit it was a big reason for marrying her, thinking I wasn't
likely going to do better than this because of the way she had a good body
even after she'd had a kid. Trim and good and good legs--she'd had a kind but
wasn't all blown out and veiny and sagged. It probably sounds shallow, but
it's the truth. I'd always had this major dread of marrying some good-looking
woman and then we have a kid and it blows her body out but I still have to
have sex with her because this is who I've signed on to have sex with the
whole rest of my life. This probably sounds awful, but in her case it was like
she was pre-tested--the kid didn't blow her body out, so I knew she'd be a
good bet to sign on and have kids with and still try to have sex. Does that
sound shallow? Tell me what you think. Or does the real truth about this sort
of thing always sound shallow, you know, everybody's real reasons? What do you
think? How does it sound?"

B.I. #48 Appleton WI

"It is on the third date that I will invite them back to the apartment. It is
important to understand that, for there even to be a third date, there must
exist some sort of palpable affinity between us, something by which I can
sense that they will go along. Perhaps go along [flexion of upraised fingers
to signify tone quotes] is not a fortuitous phrase for it. I mean, perhaps,
[flexion of upraised fingers to signify tone quotes] play. Meaning join me in
the contract and subsequent activity."

Q.

"Nor can I explain how I sense this mysterious affinity. This sense that a
willingness to go along would not be out of the question. Someone once told me
of an Australian profession known as [flexion of upraised fingers]
chicken-sexing, in--"

Q.

"Bear with me a moment now. Chicken-sexing. Since hens have a far greater
commercial value than males, cocks, roosters, it is apparently vital to
determine the sex of a newly hatched chick. In order to know whether to expend
capital on raising it or not, you see. A cock is nearly worthless, apparently,
on the open market. The sex characteristics of newly hatched chicks, however,
are entirely internal, and it is impossible with the naked eye to tell whether
a given chick is a hen or a cock. This is what I have been told, at any rate.
A professional chicken-sexer, however, can nevertheless tell. The sex. He can
go through a brood of freshly hatched chicks, examining each one entirely by
eye, and tell the poultry farmer which chicks to keep and which are cocks. The
cocks are to be allowed to perish. `Hen, hen, cock, cock, hen,' and so on and
so forth. This is apparently in Australia. The profession. And they are nearly
always right. Correct. The fowl determined to be hens do in fact grow up to be
hens and return the poultry farmer's investment. What the chicken-sexer cannot
do, however, is explain how he knows. The sex. It's apparently often a
patrilineal profession, handed down from father to son. Australia, New
Zealand. Have him hold up a new-hatched chick, a young cock shall we say, and
ask him how he can tell that it is a cock, and the professional chicken-sexer
will apparently shrug his shoulders and say `Looks like a cock to me.'
Doubtless adding `mate,' much the way you or I would add `my friend' or
`sir.'"

Q. ...

"This is the aptest analogy I can summon to explain it. Some mysterious sixth
sense, perhaps. Not that I'm right 100 percent of the time. But you would be
surprised. We will be on the ottoman, having a drink, enjoying some music,
light conversation. This is now on the third date together, late in the
evening, after dinner and perhaps a film or a bit of dancing. I do very much
like to dance. We are not seated close together on the ottoman. Usually I am
at one end and she at the other. Though it is only a four-and-a-half-foot
ottoman. It's not a terribly long piece of furniture. However, the point is
that we are not in a posture of particular intimacy. Very casual and so on. A
great deal of complex body over all the prior time spent in one another's
company, which I will not bore you by attempting to go into. So then. When I
sense the moment is right--on the ottoman, comfortable, with drinks, perhaps
some Ligeti on the audio system--I will say, without any discernible context
or lead-in that you could point to as such, `How would you feel about my tying
you up?' Those nine words. Just so. Some rebuff me on the spot. But it is a
small percentage. Very small. Perhaps shockingly small. I will know whether
it's going to happen the moment I ask. I can nearly always tell. Again, I
cannot fully explain how. There will always be a moment of complete silence,
heavy. You are, of course, aware that social silences have varied textures,
and they communicate a great deal. This silence will occur whether I'm to be
rebuffed or not, whether I have been incorrect about the [flexion of upraised
fingers to signify tone quotes] hen or not. Her silence, and the weight of
it--a perfectly natural reaction to such a shift in the texture of a hitherto
casual conversation. And it brings to a sudden head all the romantic tensions
and cues and body language of the first three dates. Initial or early-stage
dates are fantastically rich from a psychological standpoint. Doubtless you
are aware of this. Any sort of courtship ritual, game of sizing one another
up, gauging. There is, afterward, always that eight-beat silence. They must
allow the question to [finger flexion] sink in. This was an expression of my
mother's, by the way. To let such-and-such [finger flexion] sink in, and as it
happens it is nearly perfect as a descriptor of what occurs."

Q.

"Alive and kicking. She lives with my sister and her husband and their two
small children. Very much alive. Nor do--rest assured that I do not delude
myself that the low percentage of rebuffs is due to any overwhelming allure on
my part. This is not how an activity like this works. In fact, it is one
reason why I propose the possibility in such a bold and apparently graceless
way. I withhold any attempt at charm or assuasion. Because I know full well
that their response to the proposal depends on factors internal to them. Some
will wish to play. A few will not. That is all there is to it. The only real
[finger flexion] talent I profess is the ability to gauge them, screen them,
so that by the--such that a preponderance of the third dates are, if you will,
[finger flexion] hens rather than [finger flexion] cocks. I use avian tropes
as metaphors, not in any way to characterize the subjects but rather to
emphasize my own unanalyzable ability to know, intuitively, as early as the
first date, whether they are, if you will, [f.f.] ripe for the proposal. To
tie them up. And that is just how I put it. I do not dress it up or attempt to
make it seem any more [sustained f.f.] romantic or exotic than that. Now, as
to the rebuffs. The rebuffs are very rarely hostile, very rarely, and then
only if the subject in question really in fact does wish to play but is
conflicted or emotionally unequipped to accept this wish and so must use
hostility tot he proposal as a means of assuring herself that no such wish or
affinity exists. This is sometimes known as [f.f] aversion coding. It is very
easy to discern and decipher, and as such it is nearly impossible to take the
hostility personally. The rare subjects about whom I've simply been incorrect,
on the other hand, are often amused, or sometimes curious and thus
interrogative, but in all events in the end they simply decline the proposal
in clear and forthright terms. These are the cocks I have mistaken for hens.
It happens. As of my last reckoning, I have been rebuffed just over 15 percent
of the time. On the third date. This figure is actually a bit high, because it
includes the hostile, hysterical, or affronted rebuffs, which do not
result--at least in my opinion--which do not result from my misjudging a
[f.f.] cock."

Q.

"Again, please note that I do not posses or pretend to possess specialized
knowledge about poultry or professional brood-management. I use the metaphors
only to convey the apparent ineffability of my intuition about prospective
players in the [f.f.] game I propose. Nor, please also note, do I so much as
touch them or in any way flirt with them before the third date. Nor, on that
third date, do I launch myself at them or move toward them in any way as I hit
them with the proposal. I propose it bluntly but unthreateningly from my end
of a four-and-a-half-foot ottoman. I do not a Lothario. I know what the
contract is about, and it is not about seduction, conquest, intercourse, or
algolagnia. What it is about is my desire symbolically to work out certain
internal complexes consequent to my rather irregular childhood relations with
my mother and twin sister. It is not [f.f.] S and M, and I am not a [f.f.]
sadist, and I am not interested in subjects who wish to be [f.f.] hurt. My
sister and I are fraternal twins, by the way, and now in adulthood look
scarcely anything alike. What I am about, when I suddenly inquire, a propose
nothing, whether I might take them into the other room and tie them up, is
describable, at least in part, in the phrase of Marchesani and Van Slyke's
theory of masochistic symbolism, as proposing a contractual scenario [no
f.f.]. The crucial factor here is that I am every bit as interested in the
contract as in the scenario. Hence the blunt formality, the mix of aggression
and decorum in my proposal. They took her in after she suffered a series of
small but not life-threatening strokes, cerebral events, and simply could no
longer get around well enough to live on her own. She refused even to consider
institutional care. This was not a possibility so far as she was concerned. My
sister, of course, came immediately to the rescue. Mummy now has her own room,
while my sister's two children must now share one. The room is on the first
floor to prevent her having to negotiate the staircase, which is steep and
uncarpeted. I have to tell you, I know precisely what the whole thing is
about."

Q.

"It is easy to know, there on the ottoman, that it is going to happen. That I
have gauged the affinity correctly. Ligeti, whose work, you are doubtless
aware, is abstract nearly to the point of atonality, provides the ideal
atmosphere in which to propose the contractual scenario. Over 85 percent of
the time, the subject accepts. There is no [f.f.] predatory thrill at the
subject's [f.f.] acquiescence, because it is not a matter of acquiescence at
all. Not at all. I will ask how they feel about the idea of my tying them up.
There will be a dense and heavily charged silence, a gathering voltage in the
air above the ottoman. In that voltage the question dwells until it has, come
on dit, [f.f.] sunk in. They will, in most cases, abruptly change their
position on the ottoman so as suddenly to straighten their posture--this is an
unconscious gesture designed to communicate strength and autonomy, to assert
that they alone have the power to decide how to respond to the proposal. It
stems from an insecure fear that something ostensibly weak or pliable in their
character might have led me to view them as candidates for [sustained f.f.]
domination or bondage. People's psychological dynamics are fascinating--that a
subject's first, unconscious concern is what it might be about her that might
prompt such a proposal, might lead a man to think such a thing might be
possible. Reflexively concerned, in other words, about their
self-presentation. You would almost have to be there in the room with us to
appreciate the very, very complex and fascinating dynamics that accompany this
charged silence. In point of fact, in its naked assertion of personal power,
the sudden improvement in posture in fact communicates a clear desire to
submit. To accept. To play. In other words, any assertion of [f.f.] power
signifies, in this charged context, a hen. In the heavily stylized formalism
of [f.f.] masochistic play, you see, the ritual is contracted and organized in
such a way that the apparent inequality in power is, in fact, fully empowered
and autonomous."

Q.

"Thank you. This shows me you really are attending. That you are an acute and
assertive listener. Nor have I put it very gracefully. What would render you
and I, for example, going to my apartment and entering into some contractual
activity that included my tying you up true play is that it would be entirely
different from my somehow luring you home and once there launching myself at
you and overpowering you and tying you up. There would be no play in that. The
play is in your freely and autonomously submitting to being tied up. The
purpose of the contractual nature of masochistic or [f.f.] bonded play--I
propose, she accepts, I propose something further, she accepts--is to
formalize the power structure. Ritualize it. The [f.f.] play is the submission
to bondage, the giving up of power to another, but the [f.f.] contract --the
[f.f.] rules, as it were, of the game--the contract ensures that all
abdications of power are freely chosen. In other words, an assertion that one
is secure enough in one's concept of one's own personal power to
ritualistically give up that power to another person--in this example, me--who
will then proceed to take off your slacks and sweater and underthings and tie
your wrists and ankles to my antique bedposts with satin thongs. I am, of
course, for the purposes of this conversation, merely using you as an example.
Do not think that I am actually proposing any contractual possibility with
you. I scarcely know you. Not to mention the amount of context and explanation
I am granting you here--this is not how I operate. [Laughter.] No, my dear,
you have nothing to fear from me."

Q.

"But of course you are. My own mother was, by all accounts, a magnificent
individual, but of somewhat, shall we say, uneven temperament. Erratic and
uneven in her domestic and day-to-day affairs. Erratic in her dealings with,
of her two twin children, most specifically me. This has bequeathed me certain
psychological complexes having to do with power and, perhaps, trust. The
regularity of the acquiescence is nearly astounding. As the shoulders come up
and her overall posture becomes more erect, the head is thrown back as well,
such that she is now sitting up very straight and appears almost to be
withdrawing from the conversational space, still on the ottoman but
withdrawing as far as she possibly can within the strictures of that space.
This apparent withdrawal, while intended to communicate shock and surprise and
thus that she is most decidedly not the sort of person to whom the possibility
ever of being invited to permit someone to tie her up would ever even occur,
actually signifies a profound ambivalence. A [finger flexion] conflict. By
which I mean that a possibility which had hitherto existed only internally,
potentially, abstractly, as a part of the subject's unconscious fantasies or
repressed wishes, has now suddenly been externalized and given conscious
weight, made [f.f.] real as an actual possibility. Hence the fascinating irony
that body language intended to convey shock does indeed convey shock but a
very different sort of shock indeed. namely the abreactive shock of repressed
wishes bursting their strictures and penetrating consciousness, but from an
external source, from a concrete other who is also male and a partner in the
mating ritual and thus always ripe for transference. The phrase [no f.f.] sink
in is thus far more appropriate than you might originally have imagined. Such
penetration, of course, requires time only when there is [f.f.] resistance. Or
for example doubtless you know the hoary cliche [f.f.] I can't believe my
ears. Consider its import."

Q. ...

"My own experience indicates that the cliche does not mean [sustained f.f.] I
can't believe that this possibility now exists in my consciousness but rather
something more along the lines of [sustained and increasingly annoying f.f.] I
cannot believe that this possibility is now originating from a point external
to my consciousness. It is the same sort of shock, the several-second delay in
internalizing or processing, which accompanies sudden bad news or a sudden,
inexplicable betrayal by a hitherto trusted authority figure and so on and so
forth. This interval of shocked silence is one during which entire
psychological maps are being redrawn, and during this interval any gesture or
affect on the subject's part will reveal a great deal more about her than any
amount of banal conversation or even clinical experimentation ever would.
Reveal."

Q.

"I meant woman or young woman, not [f.f.] subject per se."

Q.

"The true cocks, the rare ones I have misjudged, will yield the briefest of
these shocked pauses. They will smile politely, or even laugh, and then will
decline the proposal in very direct and forthright terms. No harm, no foul.
[Laughter.] No pun intended--[f.f.] cock, foul. These subjects' internal
psychological maps have ample room for the possibility of being tied up, and
they freely consider it and freely reject it. They are simply not interested.
I have no problem with this, with discovering I've mistaken a cock for a hen.
Again, I am not interested in forcing or cajoling or persuading anyone against
her will. I am certainly not going to beg her. That is not what this is about.
The--and force is not what this is about. The others--the long, weighted,
high-voltage pause, the postural and effective shock--whether they acquiesce
or become offended, outraged, these are the true hens, players, these are the
ones whom I have not at all misjudged. As their heads are thrown back--but
their eyes are on me, fixed, looking at me, [f.f.] gazing and so on, with all
the intensity one associates with someone trying to decide whether or not they
can [f.f.] trust you. With [f.f.] trust now connoting a great many different
possible things--whether you are having them on, whether you are serious but
are pretending to have them on in order to forestall embarrassment should they
be outraged or disgusted, or whether you are in earnest but mean the proposal
abstractly, as a hypothetical question such as [f.f.] What would you do with a
million dollars? meant to elicit psychological information about their
personality in possible deliberation as to a fourth date. And so on and so
forth. Or rather whether it is in fact a serious proposal. Even as--they are
looking at you because they are trying to read you. To size you up, as you
have apparently sized them up, as the proposal appears to imply. This is why I
always propose it in a blunt, undisguised way, abjuring wit or segue or
preparation or coloratura in the pronunciation of the contractual possibility.
I want to communicate to them as best I can that the proposal is serious and
concrete. That I am opening my own consciousness up to them and to the
possibility of rejection or even disgust. This is why I answer their intense
gaze with a bland gaze of my own and say nothing to embellish or complicate or
color or interrupt the processing of their own internal psychic reaction. I
force them to acknowledge to themselves that both I and the proposal are in
deadly earnest."

Q. ...

"But again please note I am in no way aggressive or threatening about it. This
is what I meant by [f.f.] bland gaze. I do not propose it in a creepy or
lascivious way, and I do not appear in any way eager or hesitant or
conflicted. Nor aggressive or threatening. This is crucial. You're doubtless
aware, from your own experience, that one's natural unconscious reaction, when
someone's body language suggests a withdrawal or leaning-away from him, is
automatically to lead forward, or in, as a way to compensate and preserve the
original spatial relation. I consciously avoid this reflex. This is extremely
important. One does not nervously shift or lean or lick one's lips or
straighten one's tie while a proposals like this is sinking in. I once, on a
third date, found myself with one of those annoying isolated jumping muscles
or twitches in my scalp which seized on and off throughout the evening and, on
the ottoman, made it appear that I was raising and lowering one eyebrow in a
rapid and lascivious way, which in the psychically charged aftermath of the
sudden proposal simply torpedoed the whole things. And this subject was by no
stretch of the imagination a cock--this was a hen or I've never inspected a
hen--yet one involuntary twitch in one eyebrow decapitated the whole
possibility, such that the subject not only left in such a frenzy of
conflicted disgust that she forgot her purse and never returned telephone
messages in which I phoned several times and offered simply to return the
purse to her at some neutral public location. The disappointment nevertheless
drove home a valuable lesson as to just how delicate a period of internal
processing and cartography this post-proposals moment can be. My mother's
problem was that toward me--her eldest child, the elder of the twins,
significantly--her nurturing instincts rant to rather erratic extremes of as
it were [f.f.] hot and cold. She could at one moment be very, very, very warm
and maternal, and then in the flash of an instant would become angry with me
over some real or imagined trifle and would completely withdraw her affection.
She became cold and rejecting, rebuffing any attempts as a small child on my
part to receive reassurance and nurture, sometimes sending me alone to my
bedroom and refusing to let me out for some rigidly specified period while my
twin sister continued to enjoy unconfined freedom of movement about the house
and also continued to receive warmth and maternal affection. Then, after the
rigid period of confinement was over--I mean to say the precise instant my
[f.f.] time-out was completed--Mummy would open the door and embrace me warmly
and blot my tears away with her sleeve and would claim that all was forgiven,
all was well again. This flood of reassurance and nurture would once again
seduce me into [f.f.] trusting her and revering her and ceding emotional power
to her, rendering me vulnerable to devastation all over again whenever she
might choose again to turn cold and look at me as if I were some sort of
laboratory specimen she'd never seen before. This cycle played itself out
repeatedly throughout our childhood relation, I am afraid."

Q.

"Yes, accentuated by the fact that she was by vocation a professional
clinician, a psychiatric caseworker who administered tests and diagnostic
exercises at a sanitarium in the neighboring town. A career she recommenced
the moment my sister and I entered the school system, as barely toddler. My
mother's imago all but rules my adult psychological life, I am aware, forcing
me again and again to propose and negotiate contracted rituals where power is
freely given and taken and submission ritualized and control ceded and then
returned of my own free will. [Laughter.] Of the subject's, rather. Will. It
is also my mother's legacy that I know precisely what my interest in carefully
gauging a subject and on the third evening suddenly proposing that she allow
me to immobilize her with satin restraints is, derives, comes from. Much of
the annoying, pedantic jargon I just to describe the rituals also derives from
my mother, who, far more than did our kindly but repressed and somewhat
castrated father, modeled speech and behavior for us as children. My mother
processed a [sustained f.f.] Master's Degree in Clinical Social Work, one of
the first conferred upon a female diagnostician in the upper Midwest. My
sister is a housewife and mother and aspires to be nothing more, at least not
consciously. For example, [f.f.] ottoman was Mummy's term for both the sofa
and the twin love seats in our living room. My own apartment's sofa has a back
and arms and is, of course, technically a sofa or couch, but I seem
unconsciously to insist on referring to it as an ottoman. This is an
unconscious habit I seem unable to modify. In fact I have ceased tying. Some
complexes are better accepted and simply yielded to rather than struggling
against the imago by sheer force of will. Mummy--who was, of course, after
all, you are aware, someone whose profession involved keeping persons confined
and probing and testing them and breaking them and bending them to the will of
what the state authorities deemed mental health--quite hopelessly broke my own
will early on. I have accepted this and reached an accord with it and have
erected complex structures in which to come symbolically to terms with it and
redeem it. That is what this is about. Neither my sister's husband nor my
father was ever involved in poultry in any way. My father, until his stroke,
was a low-level executive in the insurance industry. Though of course the term
[f.f.] chicken was often used in our subdivision--by the children with whom I
played and acted out various primitive rituals of socialization--to describe a
weak, cowardly individual, an individual whose will could easily be bent to
the purposes of others. Unconsciously, I may perhaps employ poultry metaphors
in describing the contractual rituals as a symbolic way of asserting my own
power over those who, paradoxically, autonomously agree to submit. With little
other fanfare we will proceed into the other room, to the bed. I am very
excited. My manner has now changed, somewhat, to a more commanding,
authoritative demeanor. But not creepy and not threatening. Some subjects have
professed to see it as [f.f.] menacing, but I can assure you no menace is
intended. What is being communicated now is a certain authoritative command
based solely on contractual experience as I inform the subject that I am going
to [f.f.] instruct her. I radiate an expertise that may, I admit, to someone
of a particular psychological makeup, appear menacing. All but the most
hardened fowl begin asking me what it is I want them to do. I, on the other
hand, very deliberately exclude the word [f.f.] want and its analogues from my
instructions. I am not about expressing wishes or asking or pleading or
persuading here, I inform them. That is not what this is about. We are now in
my bedroom, which is small and dominated by a king-sized Edwardian-style
four-poster bed. The bed itself, which appears enormous and deceptively
sturdy, might communicate a certain menace, conceivably, in view of the
contract we have entered into. I always phrase it as [no f.f.] This is what
you are to do, You are to do such-and-such and so on and so forth. I tell them
how to stand and when to turn and how to look at me. Articles of clothing are
to be removed in a certain very particular order."

Q.

"Yes but the order is less important than that there is an order, and that
they comply. Underthings are always last. I am intensely but unconventionally
excited. My manner is brusque and commanding but not menacing. It is
no-nonsense. Some appear nervous, some affect to appear nervous. A few roll
their eyes or make small dry jokes to reassure themselves that they are merely
[f.f.] playing along. They are to fold their clothes and place them at the
foot of the bed and to recline and lie supine and to erase all vestige of
affect or expression from their face as I remove my own clothing."

Q.

"Sometimes, sometimes not. The excitement is intense but not specifically
genital. My own undressing has been matter-of-fact. Neither ceremonial nor
hurried. I radiate command. A few chicken out part of the way through, but
very, very few. Those who wish to go, go. The confinement is very abstract.
The thongs are black satin, mail-order. You would be surprised. As they comply
with each request, command, I utter little phases of positive reinforcement,
such as, for instance, Good and That's a good girl. I tell them that the knots
are double slips and will tighten automatically if they struggle or resist. In
fact they are not. In fact there is no such thing as a double-slip knot. The
crucial moment occurs when they lie nude before me, bound tightly at wrists
and ankles to the bed's four posts. Unknown to them, the bedposts are
decorative and not at all sturdy and could no doubt be snapped by a determined
effort to free themselves. I say, You are now entirely in my power. Recall
that she is nude and bound to the bedspots, spread-eagled. I am standing
unclothed at the foot of the bed. I then consciously alter the expression on
my face and ask, Are you frightened? Depending on their own demeanor here, I
sometimes alter this to, Aren't you frightened? This is the crucial moment.
This is the moment of truth. The entire ritual--perhaps ceremony would be
better, more evocative, because we--of course the whole thing from proposal
onward is about ceremony--and the climax is the subject's response to this
prompt. To Are you frightened? What is required is a twin acknowledgment. She
is to acknowledged that she is wholly in my power at this moment. And she must
also say she trust me. She must acknowledge that she is not afraid I will
betray or abuse the power I've been ceded. The excitement is at its absolute
peak during this interchange, reaching a sustained climax which persists for
exactly as long as it takes me to extract these assurances from her."

Q.

"Pardon me?"

Q.

"I've already told you. I weep. It is then that I weep. Have you been paying
event the slightest attention, slouched there? I lie down beside them and weep
and explain to them the psychological origins of the game and the needs if
serves in me. I open my innermost psyche to them and beg compassion. Rare is
the subject who is not deeply, deeply moved. They comfort me as best they can,
restricted as they are by the bonds I've made."

Q.

"Whether it ends in actual intercourse depends. It's unpredictable. There's
simply to way to tell."

Q. ...

"Sometimes one just has to go with the mood."

B.I. #28 Ypsilanti MI [Simultaneous]

K--:"What does today's woman want. That's the big one."

E--: "I agree. It's the big one all right. It's the what-do-you-call ..."

K--: "Or put another way, what do today's women think they want versus what do
they really deep down want."

Q.

K--: "From a male."

E--: "From a guy."

K--: "Sexually."

E--: "In terms of the old mating dance."

K--: "Whether it sounds Neanderthal or not,

I'm still going to argue it's big one. Because not the whole question today's
become such a mess."

E--: "You can say that again."

K--: "Because now the modern woman has an unprecedented amount of
contradictory stuff laid on her about what it is she's supposed to want and
how she's expected to conduct herself sexually."

E--: "The modern woman's a mess of contradictions that they lay on themselves
that drives them nuts."

K--: "It's what makes it so difficult to know what they want. Difficult but
not impossible."

E--: "Like take you classic Madonna-versus-whore contradiction. Good girl
versus slut. The girl you respect and take home to meet Mom versus the girl
you just fuck."

K--: "Yet let's not forget that overlaid atop this is the new
feminist-slash-postfeminist expectation that women are sexual, that it's okay
to whistle at a man's ass and be aggressive and go after what you want. That
it's okay to fuck around. That for today's woman it's almost mandatory to fuck
around."

E--: "With still, underneath, the old respectable-girl-versus-slut thing. It's
okay to fuck around if you're a feminist but it's also not okay to fuck around
because most guys aren't feminists and won't respect you and won't call you
again if you fuck around."

K--: "Do but don't. A double bind."

E--: "A paradox. Damned either way. The media perpetuates it."

K--: "You can imagine the load of internal stress all this dumps on their
psyches."

E--: "Come along way baby, my ass.

K--: "That's why so many of them are nuts."

E--: "Out of their minds with internal stress."

K--: "It's not even really their fault."

E--: "Who wouldn't be nuts with that kind of mess of contradictions lain on
them all the time in today's media culture."

K--: "The point being that this is what makes it so difficult, when for
example you're sexually interested in one, to figure out what she really wants
from a male."

E--: "It's a total mess. You can go nuts trying to figure out what tack to
take. She might go for it, she might not. Today's woman's a total crapshoot.
It's like trying to figure out a Zen koan. Where what they want's concerned,
you pretty much have to just shut your eyes and leap."

K--: "I disagree."

E--: "I meant metaphorically."

K--: "I disagree that it's impossible to deduce what it is they really want."

E--: "I don't think I said impossible."

K--: "Though I do agree that in today's post-feminist era it's unprecedentedly
difficult and takes some serious deductive firepower and imaginations.

E--: "I mean if it were really literally impossible then where would we be as
a species?"

K--: "And I do agree that you can't necessarily go just by what they say they
want."

E--: "Because are they only saying it because they think they're suppose to?"

K--: "My position is that actually most of the time you can figure out what
they want, I mean almost logically deduce it, if you're willing to make the
effort to understand them and to understand the impossible situation they're
in."

E--: "But you can't just go by what they say, is the big thing."

K--: "There I'd have to agree. What modern feminists-slash-postfeminists will
say they want is mutuality and respect of their individual autonomy. If sex is
going to happen, they'll say, it has be by mutual consensus and desire between
two autonomous equals who are each equally responsible for their own sexuality
and its expression."

E--: "That's almost word for word what I've heard them say."

K--: "And it's total horseshit."

E--: "They all sure have the empowerment-lingo down pat, that's for sure."

K--: "You can easily see what horseshit it is if you start by recognizing the
impossible double bind we've already discussed."

E--: "It's not all that hard to see."

Q.

K--: "That she's expected to be both sexually liberated and autonomous and
assertive, and yet at the same time she's still conscious of the old
respectable-girl-versus-slut dichotomy, and knows that some girls still let
themselves be used sexually out of a basic lack of self-respect, and she still
recoils at the idea of ever being seen as this kind of pathetic roundheel sort
of woman."

E--: "Plus remember the postfeminists girl now knows that the male sexual
paradigm and the female's fundamentally different--"

K--: "Mar's and Venus."

E--: "Right, exactly, and she knows that as a woman she's naturally programmed
to be more high-minded and long-term about sex and to be thinking more in
relationship terms than just fucking terms, so if she just immediately breaks
down and fucks you she's on some level still getting take advantage of, she
thinks."

K--: "This, of course, is because today's postfeminist era is also today's
postmodern era, in which supposedly everybody now knows everything about
what's really going on underneath all the semiotic codes and cultural
conventions, and everybody supposedly knows what paradigms everybody is
operating out of, and so we're all as individuals held to be far more
responsible for our sexuality, since everything we do is now unprecedentedly
conscious and informed."

E--: "While at the same time she's still under this incredible biological
pressure to find a mate and settle down and nest and breed, for instance go
read this thing The Rules and try to explain its popularity any other way."

K--: "The point being that women today are now expected to be responsible both
to modernity and to history."

E--: "Not to mention sheer biology."

K--: "Biology's already included in the range of what I mean by history."

E--: "So you're using history more in a Foucaultvian sense."

K--: "I'm talking about history being a set of conscious intentional human
responses to a whole range of forces of which biology and evolution are a
part."

E--: "The point is it's an intolerable burden on women."

K--: "The real point is that in fact they're just logically incompatible,
these two responsibilities."

E--: "Even if modernity itself is a historical phenomenon, Foucault would
say."

K--: "I'm just pointing out that nobody can honor two logically incompatible
sets of perceived responsibilities. This has nothing to do with history, this
is pure logic.

E--: "Personally, I blame media."

K--: "So what's the solution."

E--: "Schizophrenic media discourse exemplified by like for example Cosmo--on
one hand be liberated, on the other make sure you get a husband."

K--: "The solution is to realize that today's women are in an impossible
situation in terms of what their perceived sexual responsibilities are."

E--: "I can bring home the bacon mm mm mm mm fry in a pan mm mm mm mm."

K--: "And that, as such, they're naturally going to want what any human being
faced with two irresolvably conflicting sets of responsibilities is going to
want. Meaning that what they're really going to want is some way out of these
responsibilities."

E--: "An escape hatch."

K--: "Psychologically speaking."

E--: "A back door."

K--: "Hence the timeless importance of: passion."

E--: "They want to be both responsible and passionate."

K--: "No, what they want is to experience a passion so huge, overwhelming,
powerful, and irresistible that it obliterates any guilt or tension or
culpability they might feel about betraying their perceived responsibilities."

E--: "In other words what they want from a is passion."

K--: "They want to be swept off their feet. Blown away. Carried off on the
wings of. The logical conflict between their responsibilities can't be
resolved, but their postmodern awareness of this conflict can be."

E--: "Escaped. Denied."

K--: "Meaning that, deep down, they want a man who's going to be so
overwhelmingly passionate and powerful that they'll feel that they have no
choice, that this thing is bigger than both of them, that they can forget
there's even such a thing as postfeminist responsibilities."

E--: "Deep down, they want to be irresponsible."

K--: "I suppose in a way I agree, though I don't think they can really be
faulted for it, because I don't think it's conscious."

E--: "It dwells as a Lacanian cry in the infantile unconscious, the lingo
would say."

K--: "I mean it's understandable, isn't it? The more these logically
incompatible responsibilities are forced on today's females, the stronger
their unconscious desire for an overwhelmingly powerful, passionate male who
can render the whole double bind irrelevant by so totally overwhelming them
with passion that they can allow themselves to believe they couldn't help it,
that the sex wasn't a matter of conscious choice that they can be held
responsible for, that ultimately if anyone was responsible it was the male."

E--: "Which explains why the bigger the so-called feminist, the more she'll
hang on you and follow you around after you sleep with her."

K--: "I'm not sure I'd go along with that."

E--: "But if follows that the bigger the feminist, the more grateful and
dependent she's going to be after you've ridden in your white charger and
relieved her of responsibility."

K--: "What I disagree with is E--'s scornful use of so-called. I just don't
think that today's feminists are being consciously insincere in all their talk
about autonomy. Just as I don't think they're strictly to blame of the
terrible bind they've found themselves in. Though deep down I do have to agree
that women are historically ill-equipped for taking genuine responsibility for
themselves."

Q.

E--: "I don't suppose either of you saw where the Little Wrangler's room was
in this place."

K--: "I don't mean that in any kind of
just-another-Neanderthal-male-grad-student
-putting-down-women-because-he's-too-insecure-to
-countenance-their-sexual-subjectivity way. And I'd go to the wall to defend
them against scorn or culpability for a situation that is clearly not their
fault.

E--: "Because it's getting to be time to answer nature's page, if you know
what I mean."

K--: "I mean, even looking at the evolutionary aspect, you have to agree that
a certain lack of autonomy-slash-responsibility was an obvious genetic
advantage as far as primitive human females went, since a weak sense of
autonomy would drive a primitive female toward a primitive male to provide
food and protection."

E--: "While your more autonomous, butch-type female would be out hunting on
her own, actually competing with the males for food."

K--: "But the point is that it was the less self-sufficient less autonomous
females who found mates and bred."

E--: "And raised offspring."

K--: "And thus perpetuated the species."

E--: "Natural selection favored the ones who found mates instead of going out
hunting. I mean, how many cave paintings of female hunters do you ever see?"

K--: "historically, we should probably note that once the quote-unquote weak
female has mated and bred, she shows an often spectacular sense of
responsibility where her offspring are concerned. It's not that females have
no capacity for responsibility. That's not what I'm talking about."

E--: "They do make great moms."

K--: "What we're talking about here is single adult preprimipara females,
their genetic-slash-historical capacity for autonomy, for as it were
self-responsibility, in their dealings with males."

E--: "Evolution has bred it out of them. Look at the magazines. Look at
romance novels."

K--: "What today's woman wants, in sort, is a male with both the passionate
sensitivity and the logical firepower to discern that all her pronouncements
about autonomy are actually desperate cries in the wilderness of the double
bind."

E--: "They all want it. They just can't say it."

K--: "Putting you, today's interested male, in the paradoxical role of almost
their therapist or priest."

E--: "They want absolution."

K--: "When they say, `I am my own person,' `I do not need a man,' I am
responsible for my own sexuality,' they are actually telling you precisely
what they want you to make them forget."

E--: "They want to be rescued."

K--: "They want you on one level whole-heartedly to agree and respect what
they're saying and on another, deeper level to recognize that it's all
complete horseshit and to gallop in on your white charger and overwhelm them
with passion, just as males have been doing since time immemorial."

E--: "That's why you can't take what they say at face value or it'll drive you
nuts."

K--: "Basically it's all still an elaborate semiotic code, with the new
postmodern semions of autonomy and responsibility replacing the old premodern
semions of chivalry and courtship.

E--: "I really do have o see a man about a prancing pony."

K--: "The only way not to get lost in the code is to approach the whole issue
logically. What is she really saying?"

E--: "No doesn't mean yes, but it doesn't mean no, either."

K--: "I mean, the capacity for logic is what distinguished us from animals to
begin with."

E--: "Which, no offense, but logic's not exactly a woman's strong suit."

K--: "Although if the whole sexual situation is illogical, it hardly makes
sense to blame today's woman for being weak on logic or for giving off a
constant barrage of paradoxical signals."

E--: "In other words, they're not responsible for not being responsible, K--'s
saying."

K--: "I'm saying its' tricky and difficult but that if you use your head it's
not impossible."

E--: "Because think about it: if it was really impossible, where would the
species be?"

K--: "Life always finds a way."

"I always think, `What if I can't?' Then I always think, `Oh shit, don't think
that.' Because thinking about it can make it happen. Not like it's happened
that often. But I get scared about it. We all do. Anybody tells you they
don't, they're full of it. They're scared it might happen. Then I always
think, `I wouldn't even be worried about it if she wasn't here.' Then I get
pissed off. It's like I think she's expecting something. That if she wasn't
lying there expecting it and wondering and, like, evaluating, it wouldn't have
even occurred to me. Then I get almost kind of pissed off. I'll get so pissed
off, I'll stop even giving a shit about can I or not. It's like I want to show
her up. It's like, "Okay, bitch, you asked for it." Then everything goes
fine."

From a speech given by David Foster Wallace in March at "Metamorphosis: A New Kafka," a symposium sponsored by the PEN American Center in New York City to celebrate the publication of a new translation of "The Castle" by Schocken Books.

One reason for my willingness to speak publicly on a subject for which I am sort of underqualified is that it affords me a chance to declaim for you a short story of Kafka's that I have given up teaching in literature classes and miss getting to read aloud. Its English title is "A Little Fable":

"Alas," said the mouse, "the world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when at last I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into," "You only need to change your direction," said the cat, and ate it up.

For me, a signal frustration in trying to read Kafka with college students is that it is next to impossible to get them to see that Kafka is funny...Nor to appreciate the way funniness is bound up with the extraordinary power of his stories. Because, of course, great short stories and great jokes have a lot in common. Both depend on what communication-theorists sometimes call "exformation," which is a certain quantity of vital information removed from but evoked by a communication in such a way as to cause a kind of explosion of associative connections within the recipient. This is probably why the effect of both short stories and jokes often feels sudden and percussive, like the venting of a long-stuck valve. It's not for nothing that Kafka spoke of literature as "a hatchet with which we chop at the frozen seas inside us." Nor is it an accident that the technical achievement of great short stories is often called "compression" -- for both the pressure and the release are already inside the reader. What Kafka seems able to do better than just about anyone else is to orchestrate the pressure's increase in such a way that it becomes intolerable at the precise instant it is released.

The psychology of jokes helps account for part of the problem in reading Kafka. We all know that there is no quicker way to empty a joke of its peculiar magic than to try to explain it -- to point out, for example, that Lou Costello is mistaking the proper name "Who" for the interrogative pronoun "who," etc. We all know the weird antipathy such explanations arouse in us, a feeling not so much of boredom as offense, like something has been blasphemed. This is a lot like the teacher's feeling at running a Kafka story through the gears of your standard undergrad-course literary analysis -- plot to chart, symbols to decode, etc. Kafka, of course, would be in a unique position to appreciate the irony of submitting his short stories to this kind of high-efficiency critical machine, the literary equivalent of tearing the petals off and grinding them up and running the goo through a spectrometer to explain why a rose smells so pretty.1 Franz Kafka, after all, is the writer whose story "Poseidon" imagines a sea-god so overwhelmed with administrative paperwork that he never gets to sail or swim, and whose "In the Penal Colony" conceives description as punishment and torture as edification and the ultimate critic as a needled harrow whose coup de grace is a spike through the forehead.

Another handicap, even for gifted students, is that -- unlike, say, Joyce's or Pound's -- the exformative associations Kafka's work creates are not intertextual or even historical. Kafka's evocations are, rather, unconscious and almost sub-archetypal, the little-kid stuff from which myths derive; this is why we tend to call even his weirdest stories nightmarish rather than surreal. Not to mention that the particular sort of funniness Kafka deploys is deeply alien to kids whose neural resonances are American. The fact is that Kafka's humor has almost none of the particular forms and codes of contemporary U.S. amusement. There's no recursive word-play or verbal stunt-pilotry, little in the way of wisecracks or mordant lampoon. There is no body-function humor in Kafka, nor sexual entendre, nor stylized attempts to rebel by offending convention. No Pynchonian slapstick with banana peels or rapacious adenoids. No Rothish satyriasis or Barthish metaparody or arch Woody-Allenish kvetching. There are none of the ba-bing ba-bang reversals of modern sit-coms; nor are there precocious children or profane grandparents or cynically insurgent co-workers. Perhaps most alien of all, Kafka's authority figures are never just hollow buffoons to be ridiculed, but are always absurd and scary and sad all at once, like In the Penal Colony's Lieutenant.

My point is not that his wit is too subtle for U.S. students. In fact, the only halfway effective strategy I've come up with for exploring Kafka's funniness in class involves suggesting to students that much of his humor is actually sort of unsubtle, or rather anti-subtle. The claim is that Kafka's funniness depends on some kind of radical literalization of truths we tend to treat as metaphorical. I opine to them that some of our deepest and most profound collective intuitions seem to be expressible only as figures of speech, that that's why we call these figures of speech "expressions." With respect to "The Metamorphosis," then, I might invite students to consider what is really being expressed when we refer to someone as "creepy" or "gross" or say that somebody was forced to "eat shit" in his job. Or to reread "In the Penal Colony" in light of expressions like "tonguelashing" or "She sure tore me a new asshole" or the gnomic "By a certain age, everybody has the face he deserves." Or to approach "A Hunger Artist" in terms of tropes like "starved for attention" or "love-starved" or the double entendre in the term "self-denial," or even as innocent a factoid as that the etymological root of "anorexia" happens to be the Greek word for longing.

The students usually end up engaged here, which is great, but the teacher still sort of writhes with guilt, because the comedy-as-literalization-of-metaphor tactic doesn't begin to countenance the deeper alchemy by which Kafka's comedy is always also tragedy, and this tragedy always also an immense and reverent joy. This usually leads to an excruciating hour during which I backpedal and hedge and warn students that, for all their wit and exformative voltage, Kafka's stories are not fundamentally jokes, and that the rather simple and lugubrious gallows humor which marks so many of Kafka's personal statements -- stuff like his "There is hope, but not for us" -- is not what his stories have got going on.

What Kafka's stories have, rather, is a grotesque and gorgeous and thoroughly modern complexity. Kafka's humor -- not only not neurotic but anti-neurotic, heroically sane -- is, finally, a religious humor, but religious in the manner of Kierkegaard and Rilke and the Psalms, a harrowing spirituality against which even Ms. O'Connor's bloody grace seems a little bit easy, the souls at stake pre-made.

And it is this, I think, that makes Kafka's wit inaccessible to children whom our culture has trained to see jokes as entertainment and entertainment as reassurance.2 It's not that students don't "get" Kafka's humor but that we've taught them to see humor as something you get -- the same way we've taught them that a self is something you just have. No wonder they cannot appreciate the really central Kafka joke -- that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home. It's hard to put into words up at the blackboard, believe me. You can tell them that maybe it's good they don't "get" Kafka. You can ask them to imagine his art as a kind of door. To envision us readers coming up and pounding on this door, pounding and pounding, not just wanting admission but needing it, we don't know what it is but we can feel it, this total desperation to enter, pounding and pushing and kicking, etc. That, finally, the door opens...and it opens outward: we've been inside what we wanted all along. Das ist komisch.

1 A more grad-schoolish literary-theory-type machine, on the other hand, is designed to yield the conclusion that one has been deluded into imagining there was any scent in the first place.

2 There are probably whole Johns Hopkins U. Press books to be written on the particular lallating function humor serves at this point in the U.S. psyche. Nonetheless, a crude but concise way to put the whole thing is that our present culture is, both developmentally and historically, "adolescent." Since adolescence is pretty much acknowledged to be the single most stressful and frightening period of human development -- the stage when the adulthood we claim to crave begins to present itself as a real and narrowing system of responsibilities and limitations2a -- it's not difficult to see why we as a culture are so susceptible to art and entertainment whose primary function is to "escape." Jokes are a kind of art, and since most of us Americans come to art essentially to forget ourselves -- to pretend for a while that we're not mice and all walls are parallel and the cat can be outrun -- it's no accident that we're going to see "A Little Fable" as not all that funny, in fact as maybe being the exact sort of downer-type death-and-taxes thing for which "real" humor serves as a respite.

2aYou think it's a coincidence that it's in college that most Americans do their most serious falling-down drinking and drugging and reckless driving and rampant fucking and mindless general Dionysian-type reveling? It's not. They're adolescents, and they're terrified, and they're dealing with their terror in a distinctively American way. Those naked boys hanging upside down out of their frat-house's windows on Friday night are simply trying to get a few hours' escape from the stuff that any decent college has forced them to think about all week.}}

spanked pink of the head of his thingie. The slight wince when he'd first
enter her down there. The vague hot-penny taste of rawness when she took his
thingie in her mouth -- she seldom took him in her mouth. however; there was
something about it that she felt he did not quite like.

For the first three to three and a half years of their marriage together, this
wife, being young (and full of herself (she realized only later), believed it
was something about her. The problem. She worried that there was something
wrong with her. With her technique in making love. Or maybe that some unusual
roughness or thickness or hitch down there was hard on his thingie, and hurt
it. She was aware that she liked to press her pubic bone and the base of her
button against him and grind when they made love together, sometimes. She
ground against him as gently as she could herself to remember to, but she was
aware that she often did it as she was moving towards having her sexual climax
and sometimes forgot herself, and afterwards she was often worried that she
had selfishly forgotten about his thingie and might have been too hard on it.

They were a young couple and had no children, though sometimes they talked
about having children, and about all the irrevocable changes and
responsibilities that this would commit them to.

The wife's method of contraception was a diaphragm until she began to worry
that something about the design of its rim or the way she inserted or wore it
might be wrong and hurt him, might add to whatever it was about their
lovemaking together that seemed hard on him. She searched his face when he
entered her; she remembered to keep her eyes open and watched for the slight
wince that may or may not (she realized only later, when she had some mature
perspective) have actually been pleasure, may have been the same kind of
revelational pleasure of coming together as close as two married bodies could
come together and feeling the warmth and closeness it so hard to keep her eye
and senses alert to whatever she might be doing wrong.

In those early years, the wife felt that she was totally happy with the
reality of their sexlife together. The husband was a great lover, and his
attentiveness and sweetness and skill drove her almost mad with pleasure, the
wife felt. The only negative part was her irrational worry that something was
wrong with her or that she was doing something wrong that kept him from
enjoying their sexlife together as much as she did. She worried that the
husband was too considerate and unselfish to risk hurting her feelings by
taking about whatever was wrong. He had never complained about being sore or
raw, or of slightly wincing when he first entered her, or said anything other
than that he loved her and totally loved her down there more than he could
say. He said that she was indescribably soft and warm and sweet down there and
that entering her was indescribably great. He said she drove him half insane
with passion and love when she ground against him as she was getting ready to
have her sexual climax. He said nothing but generous and reassuring things
about their sexlife together. He always whispered compliments to her after
they had made love, and held her, and considerately regathered the bedcovers
around her legs as the wife's sexual heartrate slowed and she began to feel
chilly. She loved to feel her legs still tremble slightly under the cocoon of
bedclothes he gently regathered around her. They also developed the intimacy
of him always getting her Virginia Slims and lighting one for her after they
had made love together.

The young wife felt that the husband was a simply wonderful lovemaking
partner, considerate and attentive and unselfish and virile and sweet, better
than she probably deserved; and as he slept, or if he arose in the middle of
the night to check on foreign markets and turned on the light in the master
bathroom adjoining their bedroom and inadvertently woke her (she slept lightly
in those early years, she realized later), the wife's worries as she lay awake
in their bed were all about herself. Sometimes she touched herself down there
while she lay awake, but it wasn't in a pleasurable way. The husband slept on
his side, facing away. He had a hard time sleeping, due to career stress, and
could only fall asleep in one position. Sometimes she watched him sleep. Their
master bedroom had a nightlight down near the baseboard. When he arose in the
night, she believed it was to check the status of the yen. Insomnia could
cause him to drive all the way downtown to the firm in the middle of the
night. There were the rupiah and the won and the that to be monitored and
checked, also. He was in charge of the weekly chore of grocery shopping, which
he habitually also performed late at night. Amazingly (she realized only
later, after she had had an epiphany and had rapidly matured), it had never
occurred to her to check on anything.

She loved it when he gave oral sex but worried that he didn't like it as much
when she reciprocated and took him in her mouth. He almost always stopped her
after a short time, saying it made him want to be inside her down there
instead of in her mouth. She felt that there must be something wrong with her
oral sex technique that made him not like it as much as she did, or hurt him.
He had gone all the way to his sexual climax in her mouth only twice in their
marriage together, and both times had taken practically forever. Both times
took so long that her neck was stiff the next day, and she worried that he
hadn't liked it even though he had said he wouldn't even describe in words how
much he liked it. She once gathered her nerve together and drove out to Adult
World and bought a Dildo, but only to practice her oral sex technique on. She
was inexperienced in this, she knew. The slight tension or distraction she
thought she felt in him when she moved down the bed and took the husband's
thingie in her mouth could have been nothing but her own selfish imagination;
the whole problem could be in her head, she worried. She had been tense and
uncomfortable at Adult World. Except for the cashier, she had been the only
female in the store, and the cashier had given her a look that she didn't
think was very appropriate or professionally courteous at all, and the young
wife had taken the plastic bag with the Dildo to her car and driven out of the
crowded parking lot so fast that she was afraid her tires might have squealed.
The husband never slept in the nude; he wore clean briefs and a T-shirt.

She sometimes had dreams in which they were driving together and every other
vehicle on the road was an ambulance.

The husband never said anything about oral sex together except that he loved
her and that she drove him mad with passion when she took him in her mouth.
But when she took him in her mouth and flattened her tongue to suppress the
well-known Gag Reflex and moved her head up and down as far down as her
ability allowed, making a ring of her thumb and first finger to stimulate the
part of his shaft she could not fit in her mouth, giving him oral sex, the
wife always sensed a tension in him; she always thought she could detect a
slight rigidity in the muscles of his abdomen and legs and worried that he was
tense or distracted. His thingie often tasted raw and/or sore, and she was
concerned that her teeth or saliva might be stinging him and subtracting from
his pleasure. She worried about her technique at it, and practiced in secret.
Sometimes, during oral sex in their love-making together, she thought it felt
as if he was trying to have his sexual climax quickly so as to have the oral
sex be over ASAP and that that that was why he couldn't for so long. She tried
making pleased, excited sounds with her mouth full of his thingie; then, lying
awake later, she sometimes worried that the sounds she had made had perhaps
sounded strangled or distressing and had only added to his tension.

This immature, inexperienced, emotionally labile young wife lay alone in their
bed very late on the night of their third wedding anniversary. The husband,
whose career was high-stress and caused insomnia and frequent awakenings, had
arisen and gone into the master bathroom and then downstairs to his study,
then later she had heard the sound of his car. The Dildo, which she kept
hidden at the bottom of her sachet drawer, was so inhuman and impersonal and
tasted so horrid that she had to all but force herself to practice with it.
Sometimes he drove to his office in the middle of the night to check the
overseas markets in more depth; trade never ceased somewhere in the world's
many currencies. More and more often she lay awake in bed and worried. She had
become woozy at their special anniversary dinner and had nearly spoiled their
evening together. Sometimes, when she had him in her mouth, she became almost
overwhelmed with fear that the husband wasn't enjoying it, and would have an
overwhelming desire to bring him to his sexual climax in order to have some
kind of selfish "proof" that he enjoyed being in her mouth, and would
sometimes forget herself and the techniques she had practiced and begin
bobbing her head almost frantically and moving her fist frantically up and
down around his thingie, sometimes actually sucking at his thingie's little
hole, exerting actual suction, and she worried that she chafed or bent or hurt
him when she did this. She worried that the husband could unconsciously sense
her anxiety about whether he enjoyed having his thingie in her mouth and that
it actually was this that prevented him from enjoying oral sex together as
much as she enjoyed it. Sometimes she berated herself for her insecurities --
the husband was under enough stress already, due to his career. She felt that
her fear was selfish, and worried that the husband could sense her fear and
selfishness and that this drove a wedge into their intimacy together. There
was also the riyal to be checked at night, the dirham, the Burmese kyat.
Australia used the dollar but it was a different kind of dollar and had to be
monitored. Taiwan, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Liberia, New Zealand: all deployed
dollars of fluctuant value. The determinants of the ever-changing status of
the yen were very complex. The husband's promotion had resulted in the new
career title Stochastic Currency Analyst; his business cards and stationery
all included the title. There were complex equations. The husband's mastery of
the computer's financial programs and currency software were already legendary
at the firm, a colleague had told her during a party while the husband was
using the bathroom again.

She worried that whatever the problem with her was, it felt impossible to sort
out rationally in her mind to any degree. There was no way to talk about it
with him -- there was no way the wife could think of to even start such a
conversation. She would sometimes clear her throat in the special way that
meant she had something on her mind, but then her mind froze. If she asked him
whether there was anything wrong with her, he would believe she was asking for
reassurance and would automatically reassure her -- she knew him. His
professional specialty was the yen, but other currencies impacted the yen and
had to be continually analyzed. Hong Kong's dollar was also different and
impacted the status of the yen. Sometimes at night she worried she might be
crazy. She had ruined a previous intimate relationship with irrational
feelings and fears, she knew. Almost in spite of herself, she later returned
to the same Adult World store and bought an X-rated videotape, storing it in
its box in the same hiding place as the Dildo, determined to study and compare
the sex techniques of the women in the video. Sometimes when he was asleep on
his side at night, the wife would arise and walk around to the other side of
the bed and kneel on the floor and watch the husband in the dim glow of their
nightlight, study his sleeping face, as if hoping to discover there some
unspoken thing that would help her stop worrying and feel more sure that their
sexlife together pleased him as much as it pleased her. The X-rated videotape
had explicit color photos of women giving their partners oral sex right there
on the box. Stochastic meant random or conjectural or containing numerous
variables that all had to be monitored closely; the husband joked sometimes
that it meant being paid to drive yourself insane.

Adult World, which had one side of marital aids and three sides of X-rated
features, as well as a small dark hall leading to something else in the rear
and a monitor playing an explicit X-rated scene right there above the cash
register, smelled horrid in a way that reminded the young wife of absolutely
nothing else in her experience. She later wrapped the Dildo in several plastic
bags and put it out in the trash on the night before Trash Day. The only
significant thing she felt she learned from studying the videotape was that
the men often seemed to like to look down at the women when the women had them
in their mouth and to see their thingie going in and out of the woman's mouth.
She believed that this might very well explain the husband's abdominal muscles
tensing when she took him in her mouth -- he could be straining to raise up
slightly to see it -- and she began to debate with herself whether her hair
might be too long to allow him to see his thingie go in and out of her mouth
during oral sex, and began to debate whether or not to get her hair cut short.
She was relieved that she had no worries about being less attractive or sexual
than the actresses in the X-rated videotape: these women had gross
measurements and obvious implants (as well as their own share of slight
asymmetries, she noted), as well as dyed, bleached, and badly damaged hair
that didn't look touchable or strokable at all. Most notably, the women's eyes
were hard and empty -- you could just tell they weren't experiencing any
intimacy or pleasure and didn't care if their partners were pleased.

Sometimes the husband would arise at night and use the master bathroom and
then go out to his workshop off the garage and try to unwind for an hour or
two with his hobby of furniture refinishing.

Adult World was all the way out on the other side of town, in a tacky district
of fast food and auto dealerships off the expressway; neither time she had
hurried out of the parking lot did the wife see any cars she recognized. The
husband had explained before their wedding that he'd slept in clean briefs and
a T-shirt ever since he was a child -- he was simply not comfortable sleeping
in the nude. She had recurring bad dreams, and he would hold her and speak
reassuringly until she was able to get back to sleep. The stakes of the
Foreign Currency Came were high, and his study downstairs remained locked when
not in use. She began to consider psychotherapy.

Insomnia actually referred not to difficulty fallling asleep but to early and
irrevocable awakening, he had explained.

Not once in the first three and a half years of their marriage together did
she ask her husband why his thingie was hurt or sore, or what she might do
differently, or what the cause was. It simply felt impossible to do this. (The
memory of this paralyzed feeling would astound her later in life, when she was
a very different person.) Asleep, her husband sometimes looked to her like a
child on its side sleeping, curled all tightly into itself, a fist to its
face, the face flushed and its expression so concentrated it appeared almost
angry. She would kneel next to the bed at a slight angle to the husband so
that the weak light of the baseboard's nightlight fell onto his face and watch
his face and worry about why, irrationally, it felt impossible to simply ask
him. She had no idea why he put up with her or what he saw in her. She loved
him very much.

On the evening of their third wedding anniversary, the young wife had fainted
in the special restaurant he had taken her to to celebrate. One minute she was
trying to swallow her sorbet and looking at the husband over the candle and
the next she was looking up at him as he knelt above her asking what was
wrong, his face smooshy and distorted like the reflection of a face in a
spoon. She was frightened and embarassed. The bad dreams at night were brief
and upsetting and seemed always to concern either the husband or his car in
ways she could not pin down. Never once had she checked a Discover statement.
It had never even occurred to her to inquire why the husband insisted on doing
all the grocery shopping alone late at night; she had felt only shame at the
way his generosity highlighted her own irrational selfishness. When, later
(long after the galvanic dream, the call, the question, the tears, and her
epiphany at the window), she reflected on the towing self-absorption of her
naivete in those years, the wife always felt a mixture of contempt and
compassion for the child she had been. She had never been what one would call
a stupid person. Both times at Adult World, she had paid with cash. The credit
cards were in the husband's name.

The way she finally decided that something was wrong with her was this: either
something was really wrong with her, or something was wrong with her for
irrationally worrying so much about whether something was wrong with her. The
logic of this seemed airtight. She lay at night and held the worry in her mind
and turned it this way and that and watched it make reflections of itself
inside itself like a fine diamond.

The young wife had had only one other lover before meeting her husband. She
was inexperienced and knew it. She suspected that her brief strange bad dreams
might be her inexperienced Ego trying, unconsciously, to shift the anxiety
onto the husband, to protect itself from the knowledge that something was
wrong with her and made her sexually hurtful or unpleasing. Things had ended
badly with her first lover, she was well aware. The padlock on the door of the
workshop off the garage was not unreasonable: power tools and refinished
antiques were valuable assets. In one of the bad dreams, she and the husband
lay together after lovemaking, snuggling contentedly, and the husband lit a
Virginia Slims and then refused to give it to her, holding it before her while
it burned itself down. In another, they again lay contentedly after lovemaking
together, and he asked her if it had been as good for him as it had been for
her. The door to his study was the only other door that stayed locked; the
study contained a lot of sophisticated computer and telecommunications
equipment, giving the husband access to up-to-the-minute information on
foreign currency market activity.

In another of the bad dreams, the husband sneezed and then kept sneezing, over
and over and over again, and nothing she did could help or make it stop. In
another, she herself was the husband and was entering the wife sexually,
ranging above the wife in the Missionary Position, and he (that is, the wife,
dreaming) felt the wife grind her pubis uncontrollably against him and start
to have her sexual climax, and then he began thrusting faster in a calculated
way and making pleased male sounds in a calculating way and then feigned
having his own sexual climax, calculatingly making the sounds and facial
expressions of having his climax but withholding it, the climax, then
afterwards going into the master bathroom and making horrid faces at himself
in the mirror while he climaxed into the toilet. The status of some foreign
currencies could fluctuate violently over the course of a single night, the
husband had explained. Whenever she woke from a bad dream, he always woke up,
too, and held her and asked what was the matter and lit a cigarette for her or
stroked her side very attentively and reassured her that everything was all
right. Then he would arise from bed, since he was now awake, and go downstairs
to check the status of the yen. The wife liked to sleep in the nude after
lovemaking together, but the husband almost always put his clean briefs back
on before using the bathroom or turning away onto his side to sleep. The wife
would lie awake and try not to spoil something so wonderful by driving herself
crazy with worry. She worried that her tongue was rough and pulpy from smoking
and might abrade his thingie, or that unbeknownst to her her teeth were
scraping his thingie when she took the husband in her mouth for oral sex. She
worried that her new haircut was too short and made her face look chubby. She
worried about her breasts. She worried about the way her husband's face seemed
to her to look when they made love together.

Another bad dream, which recurred more than once, involved the downtown street
the husband's firm was on, a view of the empty street late at night, in a
light rain, and the husband's car with its special license plate she'd
surprised him with at Christmas driving very slowly up the street towards the
firm and then passing the firm without stopping and proceeding off down the
wet street to some other destination. The wife worried about the fact that
this dream her so much -- there was nothing in the scene of the dream to
explain the creepy feeling it gave her -- and about the way she could not seem
to bring herself to talk openly to him about any of the dreams. She feared
that she would feel somehow as if she were accusing him. She could not explain
this feeling, and it gnawed at her. Nor could she think of any way to ask the
husband about exploring the idea of psychotherapy -- she knew he would
generously agree at once, but he would be concerned, and the wife dreaded the
feeling of being unable to explain in any rational way to ease his concern.
She felt alone and trapped in her worry; she was lonely in it.

During their lovemaking together, the husband's face sometimes wore what
seemed (to her) less an expression of pleasure than of intense concentration,
as if he were about to sneeze and trying not to.

Early in the fourth year of their marriage together, the wife felt herself
becoming obsessed with the irrational suspicion that her husband was sexually
climaxing into the master bathroom's toilet at night. She examined the
toilet's rim and the bathroom trash basket closely almost every day,
pretending to clean, feeling increasingly out of control. The old trouble with
swallowing sometimes returned. She felt herself becoming obsessed with the
suspicion that her husband took no genuine pleasure in their lovemaking
together but was concentrated only on making her feel pleasure, forcing her to
feel pleasure and passion; lying, awake at night, she feared that he took some
kind of twisted pleasure in imposing pleasure on her. And yet, just educated
enough to be full of doubts (and of herself) at this innocent time, the young
wife also believed that these irrational suspicions and obsessions could be
merely her own youthful, self-centered Ego displacing its inadequacies and
fears of sustained intimacy onto the innocent husband; and she was desperate
not to spoil their relationship with insane displaced suspicions, like the way
she had failed and wrecked the relationship with her previous lover because of
irrational worries.

And so the wife fought with all her strength against her callow, inexperienced
mind (she thought), convinced that any real problem lay in her own selfish
imagination and/or her inadequate sexual persona. She fought against the worry
she felt about the way, nearly always, when she had moved down his body in the
bed and taken him in her mouth, the husband would nearly always (it seemed
then), after waiting with tense and rigid abdominal muscles for what felt
somehow like the minimum considerate amount of time with his thingie in her
mouth, would always reach gently down and pull her gently but firmly back up
his body to kiss her passionately and enter her from below, gazing into her
eyes with a very concentrated expression as she sat astride him, she sitting
always slightly hunched out of embarrassment at the asymmetry of her breasts.
The way he would exhale sharply in either passion or possibly displeasure and
reach down and pull the wife up and slide his thingie inside her in one smooth
motion, the gasp sharp as if involuntary, as if trying to convince her that
merely having his thingie in her mouth drove him crazy with desire to be all
the way up inside her down there, he said, and to have her, he said, "right up
close" against him instead of "so far away" down his body. This nearly always
made her feel somehow uneasy as she sat astride him, hunched and bobbing and
with his hands on her hips and sometimes forgetting herself and grinding down
with her pubic bone against his pubis, fearful that the grinding plus her
weight on him could cause injury but often for-getting herself and bearing
down and grinding against him with less and less caution, sometimes even
arching her back and thrusting out her breasts to be touched, until the moment
he nearly always -- nine times out of ten, on average -- gave another gasp of
either passion or impatience and rotated slightly onto his side with his hands
on her hips, rolling her gently but firmly over with him until she was beneath
him and he ranged over her and either still had his thingie deep in her or
else reentered her smoothly from above; he was very smooth and graceful in
these movements and never hurt her changing positions and rarely had to
reenter, but it caused the wife some worry, afterward, that he almost never
came to his sexual climax (if indeed he ever really did come to his climax)
from beneath her, that as he felt his climax building inside himself he seemed
to feel an obsessive need to rotate and be inside her from above, from the
familiar Missionary Position of male dominance, and although it made his
thingie feel even more deeply inside her down there, which the wife enjoyed
very much, she worried that the husband's need to have her beneath him at the
sexual climax indicated that something she did when sitting astride him and
moving either hurt him or denied him the sort of intense pleasure that would
lead to his sexual climax; and so the wife to her distress sometimes found
herself preoccupied with worry even as they finished and she began to have
another small aftershock of climax while grinding gently against him from
below and searching his face for evidence of a truly genuine climax there and
sometimes crying out in pleasure beneath him in a voice that sounded, she
sometimes thought, less and less like her own.

The sexual relationship the wife had had prior to meeting her husband had
occurred when she was a very young woman -- hardly more than a child, she
realized later. It had been a committed, monogamous relationship with a man
whom she had felt very close to and who was a wonderful lover, passionate and
giving and very skilled (she had felt) in sexual technique, who was very vocal
and affectionate during lovemaking, and attentive, and had loved to be in her
mouth for oral sex, and had never seemed hurt or sore or distracted when she
forgot herself and ground against him, and always closed his eyes in
passionate pleasure when he began to move uncontrollably into his sexual
climax, and whom she had (at that young age) felt that she loved and loved
being with and could easily imagine marrying and being in a committed
relationship with forever ... all until she had begun, late in the first year
of their relationship together, to suffer from irrational suspicions that her
lover was imagining making love with other women during his lovemaking with
her. The fact that the lover closed his eyes when he experienced intense
pleasure, which at first had made her feel sexually secure and pleased, began
to worry her a great deal, and the suspicion that he was imagining being
inside of other women when he was inside of her became more and more of a
dreadful conviction, even though she also felt that it was irrational and only
in her mind and would have hurt the lover's feelings just terribly if she had
said anything to him about it, until finally it became an obsession, even
though there was no tangible evidence for it and she had never said anything
about it; and even though she believed the whole thing was almost certainly
just in her head, the obsession became so terrible and overwhelming that she
began to avoid making love with him, and began having sudden irrational bursts
of emotion over trivial issues in their relationship together, bursts of
hysterical rage or tears that were in fact bursts of irrational worry that he
was having fantasies about sexual encounters with other women. She had felt,
towards the end of the relationship, as if she were totally inadequate and
self-destructive and crazed, and she came away from the relationship with a
terrible fear of her own mind's ability to torment her with irrational
suspicions and to poison a committed relationship, and this added to the
torment she felt about the obsessive worrying she was now experiencing in her
sexual relationship with the husband, a relationship that had also, at first,
seemed to be more close and intimate and fulfilling than she could rationally
believe she deserved, knowing about herself all she believed she did.

PART TWO. YEN4U

She once, as an adolescent, in an Interstate rest-stop women's room, on a
wall, above and to the right of vending machines for tampons and feminine
hygiene products, had seen, surrounded by the coarse declamations and crudely
drawn genitalia and the simple and somehow plangent obscenities inscribed
there in varied anonymous hands, standing out in both color and force, a
single small red felt-tip block-capital rhyme,

IN DAYS OF OLD

WHEN MEN WERE BOLD

AND WOMEN WEREN'T INVENTED

THEY ALL DRILLED HOLES

IN ROADSIDE POLES

AND STOOD THERE QUITE

CONTENTED [,]

tiny and precise and somehow -- via something about the tiny hand's precision
against all that surrounding scrawl -- less coarse or bitter than somehow
simply sad, and had remembered it ever since, and sometimes thought of it, for
no apparent reason, in the darkness of her marriage's innocent years,
although, to the best of her later recollection, the only real significance
she had attached to the memory was that it was funny what stuck with you.

PART THREE. ADULT WORLD

Meanwhile, in the present, the immature wife fell deeper and deeper inside
herself and inside her worry and became more and more unhappy.

What changed everything and saved everything was the fact that she had an
epiphany. She had the epiphany three years and seven months into the marriage.

In secular psychodevelopmental terms, an epiphany is a sudden life-changing
realization, often one that catalyzes a person's maturation. The person, in
one blinding flash, "grows up," "comes of age." "Put[s] away childish things."
Releases illusions gone moist and rank from a grip of years' duration.
Becomes, for good or ill, a citizen of reality

In reality, genuine epiphanies are vanishingly rare. In contemporary adult
life, maturation and acquiescence to reality are gradual processes,
incremental and often imperceptible, not unlike the formation of dental
calculus. Modern usage usually deploys epiphany as a metaphor. It is only in
dramatic representations, religious iconography, and the "magical thinking" of
children that the achievement of true insight is compressed to a single
blinding flash.

What precipitated the young wife's genuine epiphany was her eventual
abandonment of mentation in favor of frantic and concrete action.(*) She
abruptly (within hours of deciding) telephoned the lover whom she'd formerly
been in a committed relationship with, now by all accounts a successful
associate manager at a local auto dealership, and implored him to meet her.
Placing this call was one of the most difficult, embarrassing things the wife
(whose name was Jeni) had ever done. It appeared irrational and risked seeming
totally inappropriate and disloyal -- she was married, this was her former
lover, they had not exchanged a word in almost five years, their relationship
had ended badly. But she was in crisis -- she feared, as she put it to the
ex-lover over the telephone, for the very soundness of her mind, and needed
his help, and would, if necessary, beg him for it. The former lover agreed to
meet Jeni for lunch at a fast food restaurant near the auto dealership the
following day.

The crisis that had galvanized the wife, Jeni Roberts, into action was itself
precipitated by nothing more than another of her bad dreams, albeit one which
comprised a kind of compendium of many of the other bad dreams she'd suffered
during the early years of her marriage. The dream was not itself the epiphany,
but its effect was galvanic. The husband's car slowly passes his firm and
proceeds off down the street in a light rain, its YEN4U license plate
receding, followed by Jeni Roberts's car. Then Jeni Roberts is driving on the
heavy-flow expressway that circumscribes the town, trying desperately to catch
up with the husband's car. Her wipers' beat matches that of her heart. She
cannot see the car with its special personalized license plate anywhere up
ahead but feels that special anxious dream-certainty that it is there. In the
dream, every other vehicle on the expressway is symbolically associated with
emergency and crisis -- all three lanes are filled with ambulances, police
cars, paddywagons, fire engines, Highway Patrol cruisers, and emergency
vehicles of every description, sirens all singing their heart-stopping arias
and all their emergency lights activated and flashing in the rain so that Jeni
Roberts feels as though her car is swimming in color. An ambulance directly in
front of her will not let her by; it changes lanes whenever she does. The
nameless anxiety of the dream is simply horrid -- the wife -- Jeni -- feels
she must (wiper) must (wiper) must catch the husband's car in order to avert
some kind of crisis so horrible it has no name. A river of what looks to be
sodden Kleenex flows windblown along the expressway's breakdown lane; Jeni's
mouth feels full of raw hot sores; it is night and wet and the whole road
swims with emergency colors -- spanked pinks and slapped reds and the blue of
critical asphyxia. It is when they are wet that you realize why they call
Kleenex tissue, flowing by. The wipers match her urgent heart, and the
ambulance still, in the dream, will not let her by; she slaps frantically at
the steering wheel in desperation. In the window at the rear of the ambulance,
as if in answer, appears a splayed hand pressing and slapping at the glass, a
hand reaching up from some sort of emergency stretcher or gurney and opening
spiderishly out to slap and press whitely against the glass in full view of
Jeni Roberts's Accord's retractable halogen headlights so that she sees the
distinctive ring on the ring finger of the male hand splayed bloodlessly
against the glass and screams (in the dream) in recognition and cuts hard
left, cutting off various other emergency vehicles, to pull abreast of the
ambulance and tell it to stop because the stochastic husband she loves and
must catch up to is inside supine sneezing on a stretcher slapping frantically
at the rear window (such is the dream's emotional motive force that the wife
actually wets the bed, she discovers on waking); and but then however as she
pulls even with the ambulance and lowers her passenger window with the
Accord's automatic feature in the rain and gesticulates frantically for the
ambulance driver to lower his window so she can implore him to stop it's the
husband (in the dream) driving the ambulance, it's his left profile at the
wheel -- which the wife has always somehow been able to tell he prefers to his
right profile and customarily sleeps on the right side of their bed partly
with this fact in mind, though they'd never spoken openly about the husband's
possible insecurities about his right profile -- and as the husband turns his
face towards Jeni Roberts through the glass and lit rain as she gesticulates
it seems to be both him and not him, her husband's familiar and much-loved
face mangled and pulsing with blood-colored light and wearing a facial
expression indescribable as anything other than Obscene.

It was the look on the face that (slowly) turned to look at her from the
ambulance -- a face that in the very most enuretic and disturbing way both was
and was not the face of the husband she loved -- that galvanized Jeni Roberts
wake and prompted her to gather her nerve together and make the frantic
humiliating call to the man she had once thought seriously of marrying, an
associate sales manager and probationary Rotarian whose facial asymmetry -- he
had suffered a traumatic childhood accident that subsequently caused the left
half of his face to develop differently from the right side of his face; his
left nostril was unusually large, and gaped, and his left eye, which appeared
to be almost all iris, was surrounded by concentric rings and bags of slack
flesh that constantly twitched and throbbed as traumatized nerves randomly
fired -- was what, Jeni had decided after the relationship foundered, had
helped cause the uncontrollable suspicion that he had a secret, impenetrable
part to his character that fantasized lovemaking with other women even while
his healthy, perfectly symmetrical, and seemingly uninjurable thingie was
inside her. The ex-lover's left eye also faced and scanned a markedly
different direction than did his dextral, more normally developed eye, a
feature which had somehow been advantageous to the former lover in his auto
sales career, he tried to explain.

Crisis notwithstanding, Jeni Roberts felt awkward and very nearly mortified
with embarrassment as she and the ex-lover met and selected their meal options
and sat down together in a window-side booth of molded plastic and made
radically incongruous small talk while she prepared to try to ask the question
that would accidentally precipitate her epiphany and a whole new less innocent
and self-deluded stage of her married life. She had decaf in a disposable cup
and put in six prepackaged creamers as her former sexual partner sat with his
entree's Styrofoam box unopened and gazed both through the window and at her.
He had a ring on his pinkiefinger, and his sportcoat was unbuttoned, and the
white shirt beneath the coat bore the distinctive furrows of an oxfordcloth
dress shirt that had only recently been removed from its retail packaging. The
sunlight through the big window was noon-colored and made the crowded
franchise feel like a greenhouse; it was hard to breathe. The associate sales
manager watched as she started the tops of the creamers with her teeth to
safeguard her nails and removed them and placed them in the foil ashtray and
dumped the thimblefuls of creamer into the disposable cup and stirred them in
with a complimentary square-tipped stirrer one after another, the look in his
developmentally appropriate eye the puddly look of nostalgia. She was still
profligate with the creamer. She had both a wedding band and a diamond
engagement ring, and the rock wasn't cheap by a long shot. The former lover's
stomach hurt and eye-flesh was ticcing especially bad because of how now they
were in the dreaded last three bank days of the month and Mad Mike's Hyundai
put unbelievable pressure on reps to move units in the last three days so they
could go on that month's books and inflate the books for the clowns in the
regional office. The young wife cleared her throat several times in her
special way that the man solely responsible for the performance of all Mad
Mike's reps remembered all too well, doing the dry nervous thing with her
throat to communicate the fact that she recognized how inappropriate a
question like this was going to appear at this juncture, with them with their
unhappy history and now no longer in any way even like slightly connected, and
her happily married, and that she felt embarrassed but was also in some kind
of she was saying genuine crisis-type situation about something, and desperate
-- the way usually only serious credit problems made people look desperate and
trapped like that -- her eyes with that drowning look in them of she was
begging him not to take advantage of her desperate position in any way
including judgment or ridicule at her expense. Plus and how she always drank
her coffee with two hands around the cup even in a hot environs like this one
here. Hyundai-U.S.'s volume, margins, and financing terms were among the
countless economic conditions affected by fluctuations in the value of the yen
and related Pacific currencies. The young wife had spent an hour at the mirror
in order to choose the shapeless blouse and slacks she wore, actually taking
her contacts back out in order to wear her glasses as well, and nothing on her
face in the win-dowlight but a quick dab-and-blot of gloss. The expressway's
flow glittered through the window that lit up her right side with sun. The Mad
Mike's lot, with its plastic pennants and a man in a wheelchair with his wife
or like nurse being worked by fat Kidder in the hospital gown and
arrow-through-head pros-thesis the reps all had to wear on the days Messerly
was there to keep tabs, lay within the divided purview of the former lover --
who still loved her, Jeni Ann Orzolek of Marketing 204, and not his current
fiancee, he realized with the sickening wince of a mortal wound reopened --
and beyond it, shimmering in the heat, the Adult World lot, with its all makes
and classes of vehicle day and night, moving them through like Mike Messerly
could only fantasize.

(*) In this, her epiphany accorded fully with the Western tradition, in which
insight is the product of lived experience rather than mere thought.

SCHEMA: PART FOUR TITLE: ONE FLESH

"As blindingly sudden and dramatic as a question about any man's sexual
imagination is going to appear, it was not the question itself which caused
Jeni Roberts's epiphany and rapid maturation, but what she found herself
gazing at as she asked it."

-- PT. 4 epigraph, in stylistic mode of "Adult World (I)" ([right arrow]
highlights format change from dramatic/stochastic to schematic/ordered)

1a. Question Jeni Roberts asks is whether Former Lover had indeed fantasized
about other women during lovemaking w/ her.

1a(1) Inserted at beginning of question is participial phrase: "After
apologizing for how irrational and inappropriate it must sound after all this
time ..."

1b. At some point during J.'s question, J. follows F. L.'s gaze out fast-food
window & sees husband's special vanity license plate among vehicles in Adult
World lot [right arrow] epiphany. Epiph unfolds more or less independently
while facially asymmetric F. L. responds to J.'s question.

1c. Flat narr description of J.'s sddn pallor & inability to hold cup steady
as J. undergoes suddn blndng realization that hsbnd is secret compulsive
masturbator & that insomnia/yen is doubtless cover for secret trips to Adult
World to view/purchase/masturbate self raw to XXX films & images & that
suspicions of hsbnd's ambivalence about "sexlife together" have in fact been
prescient intuitions & that hsbnd has suffered from inner deficits/psychic
torment of which J.'s own self-conscious anxieties have kept her from having
any real idea [point of view (1c) all objective, exterior desc only].

2a. Mnwhile F. L. is answering J.'s question in vehement negative, tears
appearing in eye: holy shit no god no, no, never, he loved her always, was
never as fully "there" as when he & J. were making love. [If in J.'s p.o.v.,
ins. "together" after "love."]

2a(1) At emotional height of dialogue, tears streaming down 1/2 face, F. L.
confesses/declares that he still loves J., has all this time, 5 yrs., in fact
sometimes still thinks of J. while making love to his current fiancee, which
causes him to feel guilty (& "like I'm not really there") w/ fiancee.
[Transcribe F. L.'s whole answer [right arrow] emotional focus of scene is off
J. while J. undergoes trauma of sddnly realizing hsbnd is secret compulsive
masturbator -- avoids prblm of trying to convey epiphany in narr expo.]

2b. Coincidence [N.B.: too heavy?]: F. L. confesses that he also still
sometimes secretly masturbates to memories of making love w/ J., sometimes to
point of making himself raw/sore. [[right arrow] F. L.'s "confession" both
reinforcing J.'s epiphany w/r/t male masturbation & providing her w/
much-needed injection of sexual esteem. (N.B. w/r/t Theme: implicit sadness of
F. L. making soul-rending confession of love while J. is 1/2 distracted by
trauma of (1b)'s epiphany; i.e. = further networks of misconnection, emotional
asymmetry.)]

2b(1) Tone of F. L.'s confessions tremndsly moving & high-affect, & J. (even
though traumatized w/r/t (1b) & (1c)'s epiphany) never once doubts the truth
of what he says; feels she "really did know this man" & c.

2b(1a) Narr [not J.] notes sudden appearance of red & demonic-looking gleam in
hypertrophic iris of F L.'s left ["bad"?] eye, which could be either trick of
light or genuine demonic gleam [= p.o.v. change/narr intrusion].

2c. Mnwhile F. L., interpreting J.'s pallor & digital palsy as
requital/positive response to his declarations of enduring love, begs her to
leave hsbnd for him, or alternatively to come directly to Holiday Inn just
down the expressway & spend rest of afternoon making passionate love [[right
arrow] w/ dmnc sinistral gleam & c.].

2d. J. (still gone pale a la Dostoyevsky's Nastasya F.) acquiesces w/r/t
adulterous H. I. interlude [flat = "she says, `Umm, OK'"]. F. L. buses tray w/
uneaten entree & empty cup & creamers & c., follows J. out into fast-food lot.
J. waits in Accord while F. L. attempts to sneak own car out of M. M. Hyundai
lot w/o Messerly or sales reps seeing him leave on high-pressure end-of-month
sales day.

2d(1) J.'s precise mtvation for acquiescing to Holiday Inn interlude left
opaque [entails (2d) is in p.o.v. of F. L. Comic description of F. L. trying
to crawl across lot & slip into car unseen from M. M. showroom has
undercurrent of creepiness [right arrow] congruence w/ subthemes of secrecy,
creepy incongruity, opaque shame].

3a. J.'s car fllws F. L.'s car down expressway toward Holiday Inn. Sudden
sun-shower forces J. to activate wipers.

3b. F. L. turns into Holiday Inn lot, expects to see J.'s Accord turn in
behind him. Accord does not turn in, continues down expressway. [Abrupt change
in p.o.v. [right arrow] J., driving across town toward home, imagines F. L.
leaping out of his car & running frantically across Holiday Inn lot in
downpour to stand at edge of expressway & watch Accord recede, disappearing in
traffic. J. imagines F. L.'s wet/forlorn/asymmetr image dwndlng in rear-view
mirror.

3c. J., driving home, finds herself weeping for F. L. & F. L.'s dwndlng image
instead of for self. Weeps for hsbnd, "... how bottomlessly lonely his secrets
must make him" [p.o.v.?]. Notes this & speculates on significance of "weeping
for" [= "on behalf of"?] men. Bgning (3c), J.'s speculations evince new
sophistication/comprehension/ maturity. Pulls into home's driveway feeling
"... queerly exultant."

3d. Narr intrusion, expo on Jeni Roberts [same flat & pedantic tone as
[paragraph]s 3, 4 of "A.W. (I)" PT. 3]: While following F. L.'s car down
expressway, J. hadn't "changed mind" about having adulterous sex w/ F. L.; had
merely "realized it was unnecessary." Understands that she has had
life-changing epiphany. Has "... bec[o]me a woman as well as a wife," etc.
etc.

3d(1) J. hereafter referred to by narr as "Ms. Jeni Orzolek Roberts"; hsbnd
referred to as "the secret compulsive masturbator."

4a(I) Epiloguous expo. on J.O.R. [right arrow] extension of narrative arc.
"Ms. Jeni Orzolek Roberts, from that day forward, kept the memory of her
lover's desperate, 1/2-wet face faithfully shaped within her," etc. Realizes
hsbnd has "interior deficits" that "... ha[d] nothing to do with her as a
wife[/woman]," etc. Survives this aftershock of epiphany, + various other
(standard) aftershocks. [Possible mntn of psychotherapy, but in upbeat terms:
psychth now "freely chosen" rather than dsprtly tried.] J.O.R. establishes
separate investment portfolio w/ substantial positions in gold futures &
large-cap mining stock. Quits smoking w/ help of transdermal patches.
Realizes/slowly accepts that hsbnd loves his secret loneliness and "interior
deficits" more than he loves her. [Possible mention of obscure Support Group
for spouses of s.c.m.'s -- any such thing? "Mast-Anon"? "Co-Jack"? (N.B.:
avoid easy gags).] Realizes that true wellsprings of love, security,
gratification must originate within self(*); &, w/ this realization, J.O.R.
joins rest of adult hmn. race, no longer "full of herself"/
"inexperienced"/"young."

4a(II) Marriage enters new, more adult phase ["honeymoon over" an easy gag?].
Never once in sbsqnt yrs of marriage do J.O.R. & hsbnd discuss his s.c.m. or
interior agony/loneliness/"deficits" [hammer home fiduciary pun]. J.O.R.
doesn't know whether hsbnd suspects she knows about his s.c.m. or Discover
charges at Adult World; she does not care. Reflects w/ amused irony on new
significance of persistent adlsc mmry. of rest-stop graffito. Hsbnd continues
to arise at nite & leave master bedrm; sometimes J.O.R. hears car start as she
"stirs only slightly and returns at once to sleep," etc. Ceases worrying w/r/t
whether hsbnd enjoys "sexlife" w/ her; continues to love hsbnd even tho she no
longer believes he's "wonderful" [/"attentive"] partner. Sex between them
finds its own level; by 5th year it's every 2 weeks. The sex is "nice" -- less
intense but less scary [/"lonely"]. J.O.R. ceases to search hsbnd's face
during sex.

4a(II(1)) Taking "authentic responsibility for self," J.O.R. "... gradually
begins exploring masturbation as a well-spring of personal pleasure," etc.
Revisits A.W.; becomes almost rglr. Purchases 2nd dildo, then
"Penetrator!![R]" dildo w/ vibrator, "Pink Pistollero[R] Pistol-Grip
Massager," finally "Scarlet Garden MX-1000[R] Vibrator with Clitoral Suction
and Fully Electrified 12 Inch Cervical Stimulator" ["$179.99 retail"]. Narr.
inserts that her new dresser/vanity ensemble contains no sachet drawer.
[Irony: J.O.R.'s appliances found on A.W wall labeled MARITAL AIDS (2 hvy?).]
By marriage's 6th year, hsbnd frqntly away on "emergency trips to the Pacific
Rim"; J.O.R. masturbating almost daily.

4a(II(1a)) Narr expo: J.O.R.'s most frequent/ pleasurable masturbation fantasy
in 6th year of marriage = a faceless, hypertrophic male figure who loves but
cannot seduce J.O.R. spurns all other living women & chooses instead to
masturbate to fantasies of J.O.R.

4a(III) Concl. [paragraph]: 7th, 8th year: Hsbnd masturbates secretly, J.O.R.
openly. Their now bimonthly sex is both "... a submission to and celebration
of certain freely embraced realities." Neither appears to mind. Narr: binding
them now is that deep and unspoken complicity that in adult marriage is
covenant/love. "They were now married, cleaved,(**) one flesh, [a union that]
afforded Jeni Roberts a cool and steady joy...."

4b. Concl [embed]: "... ready thus to begin, in a calm and mutually respectful
way, to discuss having children [together]."

(*) [N.B.: narr tone here mxmly flat/dry/affectless/distant -- no discernible
endorsement of cliche]

(**) [/"cloven"? (avoid ez gag)]

THE FOUR-COLOR BROCHURE, PART I

I have now seen sucrose beaches and water a very bright blue. I have seen an
all-red leisure suit with flared lapels. I have smelled suntan lotion spread
over 2,100 pounds of hot flesh. I have been addressed as "Mon" in three
different nations. I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide.
I have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly)
joined a conga line.

I have seen a lot of really big white ships. I have seen schools of little
fish with fins that glow. I have seen and smelled all 145 cats inside the
Ernest Hemingway residence in Key West, Florida. I now know the difference
between straight bingo and Prize-O. I have seen fluorescent luggage and
fluorescent sunglasses and fluorescent pince-nez and over twenty different
makes of rubber thong. I have heard steel drums and eaten conch fritters and
watched a woman in silver lame projectile-vomit inside a glass elevator. I
have pointed rhythmically at the ceiling to the two-four beat of the same
disco music I hated pointing at the ceiling to in 1977.

I have learned that there are actually intensities of blue beyond very bright
blue. I have eaten more and classier food than I've ever eaten, and done this
during a week when I've also learned the difference between "rolling" in heavy
seas and "pitching" in heavy seas. I have heard a professional cruise-ship
comedian tell folks, without irony, "But seriously." I have seen fuchsia
pantsuits and pink sport coats and maroon-and-purple warm-ups and white
loafers worn without socks. I have seen professional blackjack dealers so
lovely they make you want to clutch your chest. I have heard upscale adult
U.S. citizens ask the ship's Guest Relations Desk whether snorkeling
necessitates getting wet, whether the trapshooting will held outside, whether
the crew sleeps on board, and what time the Midnight Buffet is. I now know the
precise mixocological difference between a Slippery Nipple and a Fuzzy Navel.
I have, in one week, been the object of over 1,500 professional smiles. I have
burned and peeled twice. I have met Cruise Staff with the monikers "Mojo
Mike," "Cocopuff," and "Dave the Bingo Boy."

I have felt the full cloth weight of a subtropical sky. I have jumped a dozen
times at the shattering, flatulence-of-the-gods-like sound of a cruise ship's
horn. I have absorbed the basics of mah-jongg and learned how to secure a life
jacket over a tuxedo. I have dickered over trinkets with malnourished
children. I have learned what it is to become afraid of one's own cabin
toilet. I have now heard--and am powerless to describe--reggae elevator music.

I now know the maximum cruising speed of a cruise ship in knots (though I
never did get clear on just what a knot is). I have heard people in deck
chairs say in all earnestness that it's the humidity rather than the heat. I
have seen every type of erythema, pre-melanomic lesion, liver spot, eczema,
wart, papular cyst, pot belly, femoral cellulite, varicosity, collagen and
silicone enhancement, bad tint, hair transplants that have not taken--i.e., I
have seen nearly naked a lot of people I would prefer not to have seen nearly
naked. I have acquired and nurtured a potentially lifelong grudge against the
ship's hotel manager (whose name was Mr. Dermatis and whom I now and
henceforth christen Mr. Dermatitis(1))', an almost reverent respect for my
table's waiter, and a searing crush on my cabin steward; Petra, she of the
dimples and broad candid brow, who always wore a nurse's starched and rustling
whites and smelled of the cedary Norwegian disinfectant she swabbed bathroom
down with, and who cleaned my cabin within a centimeter of its life at least
ten times a day but could never be caught in the actual act of cleaning--a
figure of magical and abiding charm, and well worth a postcard all her own.

I now know every conceivable rationale for somebody spending more than $3,000
to go on a Caribbean cruise. To be specific: voluntarily and for pay, I
underwent a 7-Night Caribbean (7NC) Cruise on board the m.v. Zenith (which no
wag could resist immediately rechristening the m.v. Nadir), a 47,255-ton ship
owned by Celebrity Cruises, Inc., one of the twenty-odd cruise lines that
operate out of south Florida and specialize in "Megaships," the floating
wedding cakes with occupancies in four figures and engines the size of branch
banks.(2) The vessel and facilities were, from what I now understand of the
industry's standards, absolutely top-hole. The food was beyond belief, the
service unimpeachable, the shore excursions and shipboard activities organized
for maximal stimulation down to the tiniest detail. The ship was so clean and
white it looked boiled. The western Caribbean's blue varied between
baby-blanket and fluorescent; likewise the sky. Temperatures were uterine. The
very sun itself seemed preset for our comfort. The crew-to-passenger ratio was
1.2 to 2. It was a Luxury Cruise.

All of the Megalines offer the same basic product--not a service or a set of
services but more like a feeling: a blend of relaxation and stimulation,
stressless indulgence and frantic tourism, that special mix of servility and
condescension that's marketed under configurations of the verb "to pamper."
This verb positively studs the Megalines' various brochures:" . . .as you've
never been pampered before," ". . .to pamper yourself in our Jacuzzis and
saunas, "Let us pamper you," "Pamper yourself in the warm zephyrs of the
Bahamas." The fact that adult Americans tend to associate the word "pamper"
with a certain other consumer product is not an accident, I think, and the
connotation is not lost on the mass-market Megalines and their advertisers.

PAMPERED TO DEATH, PART I

Some weeks before I underwent my own Luxury Cruise, a sixteen-year-old male
did a half gainer off the upper deck of a Megaship. The news version of the
suicide was that it had been an unhappy adolescent love thing, a shipboard
romance gone bad. But I think part of it was something no news story could
cover. There's something about a mass-market Luxury Cruise that's unbearably
sad. Like most unbearably sad things, it seems incredibly elusive and complex
in its causes yet simple in its effect: on board the Nadir (especially at
night, when all the ship's structured fun and reassurances and gaiety ceased)
I felt despair. The word "despair" is overused and banalized now, but it's a
serious word, and I'm using it seriously. It's close to what people call dread
or angst, but it's not these things, quite. It's more like wanting to die in
order to escape the unbearable sadness of knowing I'm small and weak and
selfish and going, without doubt, to die. It's wanting to jump overboard.

I, who had never before this cruise actually been on the ocean, have for some
reason always associated the ocean with dread and death. As a little kid I
used to memorize shark-fatality data. Not just attacks. Fatalities. The Albert
Kogler fatality off Baker's Beach, California, in 1963 (great white); the USS
Indianapolis smorgasbord off Tinian in 1945 (many varieties, authorities think
mostly makos and blacktip)(3); the
most-fatalities-attributed-to-a-single-shark series of incidents around
Matawan/Spring Lake, New Jersey, in 1926 (great white again; this time they
netted the fish in Raritan Bay and found human parts in gastro--I know which
parts, and whose). In school I ended up writing three different papers on "The
Cast-away" section of Moby-Dick, the chapter in which a cabin boy falls
overboard and is driven mad by the empty immensity of what he finds himself
floating in. And when I teach school now I always teach Stephen Crane's
horrific "The Open Boat," and I get bent out of shape when the kids think the
story's dull or just a jaunty adventure: I want them to suffer the same
marrow-level dread of the oceanic I've always felt, the intuition of the sea
as primordial nada, bottomless depths inhabited by toothstudded things rising
angelically toward you. This fixation came back with a long-repressed
vengeance on my Luxury Cruise,(4) and I made such a fuss about the one
(possible) dorsal fin I saw off starboard that my dinner companions at Table
64 finally had to tell me, with all possible tact, to shut up about the fin
already.

I don't think it's an accident that 7NC Luxury Cruises appeal mostly to older
people. I don't mean decrepitly old, but like fiftyish people for whom their
own mortality is something more than an abstraction. Most of the exposed
bodies to be seen all over the daytime Nadir were in various stages of
disintegration. And the ocean itself turns out to be one enormous engine of
decay. Seawater corrodes vessels with amazing speed--rusts them, exfoliates
paint, strips varnish, dulls shine, coats ships' hulls with barnacles and kelp
and a vague and ubiquitous nautical snot that seems like death incarnate. We
saw some real horrors in port, local boats that looked as if they had been
dipped in a mixture of acid and shit, scabbed with rust and goo, ravaged by
what they float in.

Not so the Megalines' ships. It's no accident they're so white and clean, for
they're clearly meant to represent the Calvinist triumph of capital and
industry over the primal decayaction of the sea. The Nadir seemed to have a
whole battalion of wiry little Third World guys who went around the ship in
navy-blue jumpsuits scanning for decay to overcome. Writer Frank Conroy, who
has an odd little essaymercial in the front of Celebrity Cruises' 7NC
brochure, talks about how "it became a private challenge for me to try to find
a piece of dull bright-work, a chipped rail, a stain in the deck, a slack
cable, or anything that wasn't perfectly shipshape. Eventually, toward the end
of the trip, I found a capstan [a type of nautical hoist, like a pulley on
steroids] with a half-dollar-sized patch of rust on the side facing the sea.
My delight in this tiny flaw was interrupted by the arrival, even as I stood
there, of a crewman with a roller and a bucket of white paint. I watched as he
gave the entire capstan a fresh coat and walked away with a nod."

Here's the thing: A vacation is a respite from unpleasantness, and since
consciousness of death and decay are unpleasant, it may seem weird that the
ultimate American fantasy vacation involves being plunked down in an enormous
primordial stew of death and decay. But on a 7NC Luxury Cruise, we are
skillfully enabled, in the construction of various fantasies of triumph over
just this death and decay. One way to "triumph" is via the rigors of
self-improvement (diet, exercise, cosmetic surgery, Franklin Quest
time-management seminars), to which the crew's amphetaminic upkeep of the
Nadir is an unsubtle analogue. But there's another way out, too: not
titivation but titillation; not hard work but hard play. See in this regard
the 7NC's constant activities, festivities, gaiety, song; the adrenaline, the
stimulation. It makes you feel vibrant, alive. It makes your existence seem
non-contingent.(5) The hard-play option promises not a transcendence of
death-dread so much as just drowning it out: "Sharing a laugh with your
friends(6) in the lounge after dinner, you glance at your watch and mention
that it's almost showtime.... When the curtain comes down after a standing
ovation, the talk among your companions turns to, What next?' Perhaps a visit
to the casino or a little dancing in the disco? Maybe a quiet drink in the
piano bar or a starlit stroll around the deck? After discussing all your
options, everyone agrees: "Let's do it all!'"

Dante this isn't, but Celebrity Cruises' brochure is an extremely powerful and
ingenious piece of advertising. Luxury Megalines' brochures are always
magazine-size, heavy and glossy, beautifully laid out, their text offset by
art-quality photos of upscale couples'[7] tanned faces in a kind of rictus of
pleasure. Celebrity's brochure, in particular, is a real two-napkin drooler.
It has little hypertextish offsets boxed in gold, with bites like INDULGENCE
BECOMES EASY and RELAXATION BECOMES SECOND NATURE and (my favorite) STRESS
BECOMES A FAINT MEMORY. The text itself is positively Prozacian: Just standing
at the ship's rail looking out to sea has a profoundly soothing effect. As you
drift along like a cloud on water, the weight of everyday life is magically
lifted away, and you seem to be floating on a sea of smiles. Not just among
your fellow guests but on the faces of the ship's staff as well. As a steward
cheerfully delivers your drinks, you mention all of the smiles among the crew.
He explains that every Celebrity staff member takes pleasure in making your
cruise a completely carefree experience and treating you as an honored
guest.(8) Besides,he adds, there's no place else they'd rather be. Looking
back out to sea, you couldn't agree more."

This is advertising (i.e., fantasy-enablement), but with a queerly
authoritarian twist. Note the imperative use of the second person and a
specificity out of detail that extends even to what you will say (you will say
"I couldn't agree more" and "Let's do it all!"). You are, here, excused from
even the work of constructing the fantasy, because the ads do it for you. And
this near-parental type of advertising makes a very special promise, a
diabolically seductive promise that's actually kind of honest, because it's a
promise that the Luxury Cruise itself is all about honoring. The promise is
not that you can experience great pleasure but that you will. They'll make
certain of it. They'll micromanage every iota of every pleasure-option so that
not even the dreadful corrosive action of your adult consciousness and agency
and dread can fuck up your fun. Your troublesome capacities for choice, error,
regret, dissatisfaction, and despair will be removed from the equation. You
will be able--finally, for once--to relax, the ads promise, because you will
have no choice. Your pleasure will, for 7 nights and 6.5 days, be wisely and
efficiently managed. Aboard the Nadir, as is ringingly foretold in the
brochure, you will get to do "something you haven't done in a long, long time:
Absolutely Nothing."

How long has it been since you did Ab-solutely Nothing? I know exactly how
long it's been for me. I know how long it's been since I had every need met
choicelessly from someplace outside me, without my having to ask. And that
time I was floating, too, and the fluid was warm and salty, and if I was in
any way conscious I'm sure I was dreadless, and was having a really good time,
and would have sent postcards to everyone wishing they were here.

BOARDING

A 7NC's pampering is maybe a little uneven at first, but it starts right at
the airport, where you don't have to go to Baggage Claim, because people from
the Megaline get your suitcases for you and take them straight to the ship. A
bunch of other Megalines besides Celebrity Cruises operate out of Fort
Lauderdale, and the flight down from O'Hare is full of festive-looking people
dressed for cruising. It turns out that the retired couple sitting next to me
on the plane is booked on the Nadir. This is their fourth Luxury Cruise in as
many years. It is they who tell me about the news reports of the kid jumping
overboard. The husband wears a fishing cap with a very long bill and a T-shirt
that says BIG DADDY.

7NC Luxury Cruises always start and finish on a Saturday. Imagine the day
after the Berlin Wall came down if everybody in East Germany was plump and
comfortable-looking and dressed in Caribbean pastels, and you'll have a pretty
good idea what the Fort Lauderdale airport terminal looks like today. Near the
back wall, a number of brisk-looking older ladies in vaguely naval outfits
hold up printed signs--HLND, CELEB, CUND CRN. You're supposed to find your
particular Megaline's brisk lady and coalesce around her as she herds a
growing ectoplasm of Nadirites out to buses that will ferry you to the piers
and what you quixotically believe will be immediate and hassle-free boarding.
Apparently the airport is just your average sleepy midsize airport six days a
week and then every Saturday resembles the fall of Saigon.

Now we're riding to the piers in a column of eight chartered Greyhounds. Our
convoy's rate of speed and the odd deference shown by other traffic give the
whole procession a vaguely fulnereal quality. Fort Lauderdale proper looks
like one extremely large golf course, but the Megalines' piers are in
something called Port Everglades, an industrial area zoned for blight, with
warehouses and transformer parks and stacked boxcars and vacant lots. We pass
a huge field of those hammer-shaped automatic oil derricks all bobbing
fellatially, and on the horizon past them is a fingernail clipping of shiny
sea. Whenever we go over bumps or train tracks, there's a huge mass clicking
sound from all the cameras around everybody's neck. I haven't brought any sort
of camera and feel a perverse pride about this.

The Nadir's traditional berth is Pier 21. "Pier," although it conjures for me
images of wharfs and cleats and lapping water, turns out here to denote
something like what "airport" denotes; viz., a zone and not a thing. There is
no real view of the ocean, no docks, no briny smell to the air, but as we
enter the pier zone there are a lot of really big white ships that blot out
most of the sky.

From inside, Pier 21 seems kind of like a blimpless blimp hangar,
high-ceilinged and echoey. It has walls of unclean windows on three sides, at
least 2,500 orange chairs in rows of twenty-five, a kind of desultory snack
bar, and rest rooms with very long lines. The acoustics are brutal and it's
tremendously loud. Some of the people in the rows of chairs appear to have
been here for days: they have the glazed encamped look of people at airports
in blizzards. It's now 11:32 A.M., and boarding will not commence one second
before 2:00 P.M.; a P.A. announcement politely but firmly declares Celebrity's
seriousness about this. The P.A. lady's voice is what you imagine a British
supermodel would sound like. Everyone clutches a numbered card like identity
papers at Checkpoint Charlie. Pier 21's pre-boarding blimp hangar is not as
bad as, say, New York City's Port Authority bus terminal at 5:00 P.M. on
Friday, but it bears little resemblance to any of the stressless pamper-venues
detailed in the Celebrity brochure, which I am not the only person in here
thumbing through and looking at wistfully. A lot of people are also now
staring with subwayish blankness at other people. A kid whose T-shirt says
SANDY DUNCAN'S EYE(9) is carving something in the plastic of his chair. There
are quite a few semi-old people traveling with really desperately old people
who are clearly their parents. Men after a certain age simply should not wear
shorts, I've decided; the skin seems denuded and practically crying out for
hair, particularly on the calves. It's just about the only body area where you
actually want more hair on older men. A couple of these glabrous-calved guys
are fieldstripping their camcorders with military expertise. There's also a
fair number of couples in their twenties and thirties, with a honeymoonish
aspect to the way their heads rest on each other's shoulders.

Somewhere past the big gray doors behind the rest rooms' roiling lines is a
kind of umbilical passage leading to what I assume is the actual Nadir, which
outside the hangar's windows presents as a tall wall of total white metal. The
Chicago lady and BIG DADDY are playing Uno with another couple, who turn out
to be friends they'd made on a Princess Alaska cruise in '93. By this time I'm
down to slacks and T-shirt and tie, and the tie looks like it's been washed
and hand-wrung. Perspiring has lost its novelty. Celebrity Cruises seems to be
reminding us that the real world we're leaving behind includes crowded public
waiting areas with no A.C. and indifferent ventilation. Now it's 12:55 P.M.
Although the brochure says the Nadir sails at 4:30 and that you can board
anytime from 2:00 P.M. until then, it looks as if all 1,374 Nadir passengers
are already here, plus a fair number of relatives and well-wishers.

Every so often I sort of orbit the blimp hangar, eavesdropping, making small
talk. The universal topic of discussion is "Why Are You Here?" Nobody uses the
word "pamper" or "luxury." The word that gets used over and over is "relax."
Everybody characterizes the upcoming week as either a long-put-off reward or a
last-ditch effort to salvage sanity and self from some inconceivable crockpot
of pressure, or both. A lot of the explanatory narratives are long and
involved, and some are sort of lurid--including a couple of people who have
finally buried a terminal, hideously lingering relative they'd been nursing at
home for months.

Finally we are called for boarding and moved in a columnar herd toward the
Passport Check and Deck 3 gangway beyond. We are greeted (each of us) and
escorted to our cabins by not one but two Aryan-looking hostesses from the
Hospitality Staff. We are led over plush plum carpet to the interior of what
one presumes is the actual Nadir, washed now in high-oxygen A.C. that seems
subtly balsam-scented, pausing, if we wish, to have our pre-cruise photo taken
by the ship's photographer, apparently for some Before and After souvenir
ensemble Celebrity Cruises will try to sell us at the end of the week. My
hostesses are Inga and Geli, and they carry my book bag and suit coat,
respectively. I start seeing the first of more WATCH YOUR STEP signs than
anyone could count--it turns out that a Megaship's flooring is totally uneven,
and everywhere there are sudden little steplets up and down. It's an endless
walk--up, fore, aft, serpentine through bulkheads and steel-railed corridors,
with mollified jazz coming out of little round speakers in a beige enamel
ceiling. At intervals on every wall are the previously mentioned
cross-sectioned maps and diagrams.(10)

The elevator is made of glass and is noiseless, and Inga and Geli smile
slightly and gaze at nothing as together we ascend, and it's a very close race
as to which of the two smells better in the enclosed chill. Soon we are
passing little teak-lined shipboard shops with Gucci, Waterford, Wedgwood,
Rolex, and there's a crackle in the jazz and an announcement in three
languages about Welcome and Willkommen and how there will be a compulsory
Lifeboat Drill an hour after sailing.

By 3:15 P.M. I am installed in Nadir Cabin 1009 and immediately eat almost a
whole basket of free fruit and lie on a really nice bed and drum my fingers on
my swollen tummy.

UNDER SAIL

Our horn is genuinely planet-shattering. Departure at 4:30 turns out to be a
not untasteful affair of crepe and horns. Each deck has walkways outside, with
railings made of really good wood. It's now overcast, and the ocean way below
is dull and frothy. Docking and undocking are the two times the Megacruiser's
captain actually steers the ship; Captain G. Panagiotakis has now wheeled us
around and pointed our snout at the open sea, and we--large and white and
clean-- are under sail.

The whole first two days and nights are bad weather, with high-pitched winds,
heaving seas, spume lashing the portholes' glass. For forty-plus hours it's
more like a North Sea Cruise, and the Celebrity staff goes around looking
regretful but not apologetic, and in all fairness it's hard to find a way to
blame Celebrity Cruises, Inc. for the weather. The staff keeps urging us to
enjoy the view from the railings on the lee side of the Nadir. The one other
guy who joins me in trying out the non-lee side has his glasses blown off by
the gale. I keep waiting to see somebody from the crew wearing the traditional
yellow slicker, but no luck. The railing I do most of my contemplative gazing
from is on Deck 10, so the sea is way below, slopping and heaving around, so
it's a little like looking down into a briskly flushing toilet. No fins in
view.

In heavy seas, hypochondriacs are kept busy taking their gastric pulse every
couple of seconds and wondering whether what they're feeling is maybe the
onset of seasickness. Seasickness-wise, though, it turns out that bad weather
is sort of like battle: there's no way to know ahead of time how you'll react.
A test of the deep and involuntary stuff of a man. I myself turn out not to
get seasick. For the whole first rough-sea day, I puzzle over the fact that
every other passenger on the m.v. Nadir looks to have received identical
little weird shaving-cuts below his or her left ear--which in the case of
female passengers seems especially strange--until I learn that these little
round Band-aidish things on everybody's neck are special new super-powered
transdermal motion-sickness patches, which apparently nobody with any kind of
clue about 7NC Luxury Cruising now leaves home without. A lot of the
passengers get seasick anyway, these first two howling days. It turns out that
a seasick person really does look green, though it's an odd and ghostly green,
pasty and toadish, and more than a little corpselike when the seasick person
is dressed in formal dinner wear.

For the first two nights, who's feeling seasick and who's not and who's not
now but was a little while ago or isn't feeling it yet but thinks it's maybe
coming on, etc., is a big topic of conversation at Table 64 in the Five-Star
Caravelle Restaurant.(11) Discussing nausea and vomiting while eating
intricately prepared gourmet foods doesn't seem to bother anybody. Common
suffering and fear of suffering turn out to be a terrific ice-breakering is
pretty important, because on a 7NC you eat at the same designated table with
the same companions all week.

There are seven other people with me at good old Table 64, all from south
Florida. Four know one another in private landlocked life and have requested
to be at the same table. The other three people are an old couple and their
granddaughter, whose name is Mona. I am the only first-time Luxury Cruiser at
Table 64. With the conspicuous exception of Mona, I like all my tablemates a
lot, and I want to get a description of supper out of the way fast and avoid
saying much about them for fear of hurting their feelings by noting any
character defects or eccentricities that might seem potentially mean. Besides
me, there are five women and two men, and both men are completely silent
except on the subjects of golf, business, transdermal motion-sickness
prophylaxis, and the legalities of getting stuff through customs. The women
carry Table 64's conversational ball. One of the reasons I like all these
women (except Mona) so much is that they laugh really hard at my jokes, even
lame or very obscure jokes, although they all have this curious way of
laughing where they sort of scream before they laugh, so that for one
excruciating second you can't tell whether they're getting ready to laugh or
whether they're seeing something hideous and screamworthy over your shoulder.

My favorite tablemate is Trudy, whose husband is back home managing some
sudden crisis at the couple's cellular-phone business and has given his ticket
to Alice, their heavy and extremely well-dressed daughter, who is on spring
break from Miami U. and who is for some reason very anxious to communicate to
me that she has a Serious Boyfriend, whose name is apparently Patrick. Alice's
continual assertion of her relationship-status may be a defensive tactic
against Trudy, who keeps pulling professionally retouched 4 x 5 glossies of
Alice out of her purse and showing them to me with Alice sitting right there,
and who, every time Alice mentions Patrick, suffers some sort of weird facial
tic or grimace where the canine tooth on one side of her face shows but the
other side's doesn't. Trudy is fifty-six and looks--and I mean this in the
nicest possible way--rather like Jackie Gleason in drag, and has a
particularly loud pre-laugh scream that is a real arrythmia-producer, and is
the one who coerces me into Wednesday night's conga line, and gets me strung
out on Snowball Jackpot Bingo. Trudy is also an incredible lay authority on
7NC Luxury Cruises, this being her sixth in a decade; she and her best friend,
Esther (thinfaced, subtly ravaged-looking, the distaff part of the couple from
Miami), have tales to tell about Carnival Princess, Crystal, and Cunard too
fraught with libel potential to reproduce here.

By midweek it starts to strike me that I have never before been party to such
a minute and exacting analysis of the food and service of a meal I am just at
that moment eating. Nothing escapes the attention of T and E: the symmetry of
the parsley sprigs atop the boiled baby carrots, the consistency of the bread,
the flavor and mastication-friendliness of various cuts of meat, the celerity
and flambe technique of the various pastry guys in tall white hats who appear
tableside when items have to be set on fire (a major percentage of the
desserts in the Five-Star Caravelle Restaurant have to be set on fire), and so
on. The waiter and busboy keep circling the table, going "Finish? Finish?"
while Esther and Trudy have exchanges like:

"Honey you don't look happy with the potatoes. What's the problem."

"I'm fine. It's fine. Everything's fine."

"Don't lie. Honey with that face who could lie? Frank, am I right? This is a
person with a face incapable of lying."

"There's nothing wrong Esther darling, I swear it."

"You're not happy with the conch."

"All right. I've got a problem with the conch."

"Did I tell you? Frank, did I tell her? [Frank silently probes his ear with
pinkie. "Was I right? Trudy I could tell just by looking you weren't happy."

"I'm fine with the potatoes. It's the conch."

"Did I tell you about seasonal fish on ships? What did I tell you?"

"The potatoes are good."

Mona is eighteen. Her grandparents have been taking her on a Luxury Cruise
every spring since she was five. Mona always sleeps through both breakfast and
lunch and spends all night at the Scorpio Disco and in the Mayfair Casino
playing the slots. She is six two if she's an inch. She's going to attend Penn
State next fall, because the agreement is that she'll receive a
four-wheel-drive vehicle if she goes someplace where there might be snow. She
is unabashed in recounting this college-selection criterion. She is an
incredibly demanding passenger and diner, out her complaints about slight
aesthetic and gustatory imperfections at table lack Trudy and Esther's
discernment and come off as simply churlish. Mona is also kind of
strange-looking: a body like Brigitte Nielsen or some centerfold on steroids,
and above it, framed in resplendent blond hair, the tiny unhappy face of a
kind of corrupt doll. Her grandparents, who retire every night right after
supper, always make a small ceremony after dessert of handing Mona $100 to go
have some fun" with. This $100 bill is always in one of those little
ceremonial bank envelopes that has Franklin's face staring out of a
porthole-like window in the front, and written on the envelope in red Magic
Marker is always "We Love You, Honey." Mona never once says thank you. She
also rolls her eyes at just about everything her grandparents say, a habit
that very quickly drives me up the wall.

Mona's special customary gig on 7NC Luxury Cruises is to lie to the waiter and
maitre d' and say that Thursday is her birthday, so that at the Formal supper
on Thursday she gets bunting and a heart-shaped helium balloon tied to her
chair, and her own cake, and pretty much the whole restaurant staff comes out
and forms a circle around her and sings to her. Her real birthday, she informs
me on Monday, is July 29, and when I quietly observe that July 29 is also the
birthday of Benito Mussolini, Mona's grandmother shoots me kind of a
death-look, although Mona herself is excited at the coincidence, apparently
confusing the names Mussolini and Maserati.

The weather in no way compromised the refinement of meals at Table 64. Even in
heavy seas, 7NC Megaships don't yaw or throw you around or send bowls of soup
sliding across tables. Only a certain slight unreality to your footing lets
you know you're not on land. At sea, a room's floor feels somehow 3-D, and
your footing demands a slight attention that good old static land never needs.
You don't ever quite hear the ship's big engines, but when your feet are
planted you can feel them--a kind of spinal throb, oddly soothing.

Walking is a little dreamy also. There are constant slight shifts in torque
from the waves' action. When heavy waves come straight at a Megaship's snout,
the ship goes up and down along its long axis--this is called "pitching." It
produces the disorienting sensation that you're walking on a very slight
downhill grade and then level and then on a very slight uphill grade. Some
evolutionarily retrograde reptilebrain part of the central nervous system is
apparently reawakened, though, and manages all this so automatically that it
requires a good deal of attention to notice anything more than that walking
feels a little dreamy.

"Rolling," on the other hand, is when waves hit the ship from the side and
make it go up and down along its crosswise axis. When the Nadir rolls, what
you feel is a very slight increase in the demands placed on the muscles of
your left leg, then a strange absence of all demand, then extra demands on the
right leg.

We never pitch badly,but every once in a while some really big, Poseidon
Adventure-grade wave must have come and hit the Nadir's side, because the
asymmetric leg-demands sometimes won't stop or reverse and you keep having to
put more and more weight on one leg until you're exquisitely close to tipping
over. The cruise's first night, steaming southeast for Jamaica, features some
really big waves from starboard, and in the casino after supper it's hard to
tell who's had too much of the '71 Richebourg and who's just doing a
roll-related stagger. Add in the fact that most of the women are wearing high
heels, and you can imagine some of the vertiginous
staggering-flailing-clutching that goes on. Almost everyone on the Nadir has
come in couples, and when they walk during heavy seas they tend to hang on
each other like freshman steadies. You can tell they like it: the women have
this trick of sort of folding themselves into the men and snuggling as they
walk, and the men's postures improve and their faces firm up and they seem to
feel unusually solid and protective. It's easy to see why older couples like
to cruise.

Heavy seas are also great for sleep, it turns out. The first two mornings
there's hardly anybody at Early Seating Breakfast. Everybody sleeps in. People
with insomnia of years' standing report uninterrupted sleep of nine, ten, even
eleven hours. Their eyes are childlike and wide with wonder as they report
this. Everyone looks younger when they've had a lot of sleep. There's rampant
daytime napping too. By the end of the week, when we've had all manner of
weather, I finally see what it is about heavy seas and marvelous rest: in
heavy seas you feel rocked to sleep, the windows' spume a gentle shushing,
engines' throb a mother's pulse.

THE FOUR-COLOR BROCHURE, PART II

Did I mention that famous writer and Iowa Writers' Workshop Chairperson Frank
Conroy has his own experiential essay about cruising right there in
Celebrity's 7NC brochure? Well he does, and the thing starts out on the Pier
21 gangway that first Saturday with his family:(12)

With that single, easy step, we entered a new

world, a sort of alternate reality to the one on

shore. Smiles, handshakes, and we were whisked

away to our cabin by a friendly young woman from

Guest Relations.

Then they're outside along the rail for the Nadir's sailing:

... We became aware that the ship was pulling

away. We had felt no warning, no trembling of

the deck, throbbing of the engines or the like. It

was as if the land were magically receding, like

some ever-so-slow reverse zoom in the movies.

This is pretty much what Conroy's whole "My Celebrity Cruise or 'All This and
a Tan, Too'" is like. Its full implications don't hit me until I reread it
supine on Deck 12 the first sunny day. Conroy's essay is graceful and lapidary
and persuasive. I submit that it is also completely insidious and bad. Its
badness does not consist so much in its constant and mesmeric referances to
fantasy and alternate realities and the palliative powers of professional
pampering--

I'd come on board after two months of intense

and moderately stressful work, but now it seemed

a distant memory. . . . I realized it had been a

week since I'd washed a dish, cooked a meal,

gone to the market, done an errand or, in fact,

anything at all requiring a minimum of thought

and effort. My toughest decisions had been

whether to catch the afternoon showing of Mrs.

Doubtfire or play bingo. --nor in the surfeit of happy adjectives and the tone
of breathless approval throughout--

Bright sun warm still air, the brilliant blue-green

of the Caribbean under the vast lapis lazuli

dome of the sky...For all of us, our fantasies and

expectations were to be exceeded, to say the least.

... When it comes to service, Celebrity Cruises

seems ready and able to deal with anything.

Rather, part of the essay's real badness can be found in the way it reveals
once again the Megaline's sale-to sail agenda of micromanaging not only one's
perceptions of a 7NC but even one's own interpretation and articulation of
those perceptions. In other words, Celebrity's P.R. people go and get a
respected writer to pre-articulate and -endorse the 7NC experience, and to do
it with a professional eloquence and authority that few lay perceivers and
articulators could hope to equal.(13) But the really major badness is that the
project and placement of "My Celebrity Cruise . . ." are sneaky and
duplicitous and well beyond whatever eroded pales still exist in terms of
literary ethics. Conroy's "essay" appears as an inset, on skinnier pages and
with different margins than the rest of the brochure, creating the impression
that it has been excerpted from some large and objective thing Conroy wrote.
But it hasn't been. The truth is that Celebrity Cruises paid Frank Conroy
up-front to write it,[14] even though nowhere in or around the essay is there
anything acknowledging that it's a paid endorsement, not even one of the
little "So-and-so has been compensated for his services" that flashes at your
TV screen's lower right during celebrity-hosted infomercials. Instead, inset
on this weird essaymercial's first page is a photo of Conroy brooding in a
black turtleneck, and below the photo an author bio with a list of Conroy's
books that includes the 1967 classic Stop-time, which is arguably the best
literary memoir of the twentieth century and is one of the books that first
made poor old humble yours truly want to try to be a writer.

In the case of Frank Conroy's "essay," Celebrity Cruises is trying to position
an ad in such a away that we come to it with the lowered guard and leading
chin we reserve for coming to an essay, for something that is art (or that is
at least trying to be art). An ad that pretends to be art is--at absolute
best--like somebody who smiles at you only because he wants something from
you. This is dishonest, but what's insidious is the cumulative effect that
such dishonesty has on us: since it offers a perfect simulacrum of goodwill
without goodwill's real substance, it messes with our heads and eventually
starts upping our defenses even in cases of genuine smiles and real art and
true goodwill. It makes us feel confused and lonely and impotent and angry and
scared. It causes despair.(15)

But for this particular 7NC consumer, Conroy's ad-as-essay ends up having a
truthfulness about it that I'm sure is unintentional. As my week on the Nadir
wears on, I begin to see this essaymercial as a perfectly ironic reflection of
the mass-market cruise experience itself. The essay is polished, powerful,
impressive, clearly the best that money can buy. It presents itself as being
for my benefit. It manages my experiences and my interpretation of those
experiences and takes care of them for me in advance. It seems to care about
me. But it doesn't, not really, because first and foremost it wants something
from me. So does the cruise itself. The pretty setting and glittering ship and
sedulous staff and solicitous fun-managers all want something from me, and
it's not just the price of my ticket--they've already got that. Just what it
is that they want is hard to pin down, but by early in the week I can feel it
building: it circles the ship like a fin.

PAMPERED TO DEATH, PART II

Celebrity's brochure does not lie or exaggerate, however, in the luxury
department, and I now confront the journalist problem of not being sure how
many examples I need to list in order to communicate the atmosphere of
sybaritic and nearly insanity-producing pampering on board the m.v. Nadir.
Take, as one example, the moment right after sailing when I want to go out to
Deck 10's port rail for some introductory vista-gazing and thus decide I need
some zinc oxide for my peel-prone nose. My zinc oxide's still in my big duffel
bag, which at that point is piled with all of Deck 10's other luggage in the
little area between the 10-Fore elevator and the 10-Fore staircase while
little guys in cadet-blue Celebrity jumpsuits, porters (entirely Lebanese, it
seems), are cross-checking the luggage tags with the Nadir's passenger list
and lugging everything to people's cabins.

So I come out and spot my duffel among the luggage, and I start to grab and
haul it out of the towering pile of leather and nylon, thinking I'll just
whisk the bag back to Cabin 1009 myself and root through it and find my zinc
oxide. One of the porters sees me starting to grab the bag, though, and he
dumps all four of the massive pieces of luggage he's staggering with and leaps
to intercept me. At first I'm afraid he thinks I'm some kind of baggage thief
and wants to see my claim check or something. But it turns out that what he
wants is my duffel: he wants to carry it to 1009 for me. And I, who am about
half again this poor little herniated guy's size (as is the duffel bag
itself), protest politely, trying to be considerate, saying Don't Fret, Not a
Big Deal, Just Need My Good Old Zinc Oxide, I'll Just Get the Big Old Heavy
Weather-Stained Sucker Out of Here Myself.

And now a very strange argument ensues, me versus the Lebanese porter,
because, I now understand, I am putting this guy, who barely speaks English,
in a terrible kind of sedulous-services double bind, a paradox of pampering:
The Passenger's Always Right versus Never Let a Passenger Carry His Own Bag.
Clueless at the time about what this poor man is going through, I wave off
both his high-pitched protests and his agonized expression as mere servile
courtesy, and I extract the duffel and lug it up the hall to 1009 and slather
the old beak with zinc oxide and go outside to watch Florida recede
cinematically a la F. Conroy.

Only later do I understand what I've done. Only later do I learn that that
little Lebanese Deck-10 porter had his head just about chewed off by the (also
Lebanese) Deck,10 Head Porter, who had his own head chewed off by the Austrian
Chief Steward, who received confirmed reports that a passenger had been seen
carrying his own bag up the port hallway of Deck 10 and now demanded a rolling
Lebanese head for this clear indication of porterly dereliction, and the
Austrian Chief Steward had reported the incident to a ship's Officer in the
Guest Relations Department, a Greek guy with Revo shades and a walkie-talkie
and epaulets so complex I never did figure out what his rank was; and this
high-ranking Greek guy actually came around to 1009 after Saturday's supper to
apologize on behalf of practically the entire Chandris shipping line and to
assure me that ragged-necked Lebanese heads were even at that moment rolling
down various corridors in piacular recompense for my having had to carry my
own bag. And even though this Greek officer's English was in lots of ways
better than mine, it took me no less than ten minutes to detail the double
bind I'd put the porter in--brandishing at relevant moments the actual tube of
zinc oxide that had caused the whole snafu--ten or more minutes before I could
get enough of a promise from the Greek officer that various chewed-off heads
would be reattached and employee records unbesmirched to feel comfortable
enough to allow the officer to leave;(16) and the whole incident was
incredibly frazzling and despair-fraught, and filled almost half a spiral
notebook, and is here recounted in only its barest psychoskeletal outline.

This grim determination to indulge the passenger in ways that go far beyond
any halfwaysane passenger's own expectations is everywhere on the Nadir. Some
wholly random examples: My cabin bathroom has plenty of thick fluffy towels,
but when I go up to lie in the sun I don't have to take any of my cabin's
towels, because the two upper decks' sun areas have big carts loaded with even
thicker and fluffier towels. These carts are stationed at convenient intervals
along endless rows of gymnastically adjustable deck chairs that are themselves
phenomenally fine deck chairs, sturdy enough for even the portliest sunbather
but also narcoleptically comfortable, with heavy-alloy frames over which is
stretched some mysterious material that combines canvas's quick-drying
durability with cotton's absorbency and comfort--certainly a welcome step up
from public pools' deck-chair material of Kmartish plastic that sticks to your
skin and produces farty suction-noises whenever you shift your sweaty weight
on it. And each of the sun decks is manned by a special squad of full-time
Towel Guys, so that when you're well-done on both sides and ready to quit and
you spring easily out of the deck chair you don't have to pick up your towel
and take it with you or even bus it into the cart's Used Towel slot, because a
Towel Guy materializes the minute your fanny leaves the chair and removes your
towel for you and deposits it in the slot. (Actually, the Towel Guys are such
overachievers that even if you get up for just a second to reapply zinc oxide
or gaze contemplatively out over the railing at the sea, when you turn back
around your towel's often gone and your deck chair has been refolded to its
uniform 45-degree at-rest angle, and you have to readjust your chair all over
again and go to the cart to get a fresh fluffy towel, of which there is
admittedly not a short supply.)

Down in the Five-star Caravelle Restaurant, the waiter(17) will not only bring
you a lobster--as well as a second and even a third lobster(18)--with
methamphetaminic speed but will also incline over you with gleaming
claw-cracker and surgical fork and dismantle it for you, sparing you the green
goopy work that's the only remotely rigorous thing about lobster. And at the
Windsurf Cafe, up on Deck 11 by the pools, where there's always an informal
buffer lunch, there's never that bovine line that makes most cafeteria such a
downer, and there are about seventy-three varieties of entree alone, and the
sort of coffee you marry somebody for being able to make; and if you have too
many things on you tray, a waiter will materialize as you peel away from the
buffer and will carry your tray (even thouh it's a cafeteria, there are all
these waiters standing around with Nehru jackets and white towels draped over
left arms watching you, not quite making eye contact but scanning for any
little way to be of service, plus plumjacketed sommeliers walking around to
see if you need a non-buffer libation, plus a whole other crew of maitre d's
and supervisors watching the waiters and sommeliers and tall-hatted buffet
servers to make sure you don't do something for yourself that could be done
for you).

Every public surface on the m.v. Nadir that isn't stainless steel or glass or
varnished parquet or dense and good-smelling sauna-type wood is plush blue
carpet that never has a chance to accumulate even one flecklet of lint because
jumpsuited Third World guys are always at it with Siemens A.G.[R] vacuums. The
elevators are Euroglass and yellow steel and stainless steel and a kind of
wood-grain material that looks too shiny to be real wood but makes a sound
when you thump it that's an awful lot like real wood.(19) The elevators and
stairways between decks seem to be the particular objects of the anal
retention of a whole special Elevator and Staircase custodial crew. During the
first two days of rough seas, when people vomited a lot (especially after
supper and apparently extra-especially on the elevators and stairways), these
puddles of vomit inspired a veritable feeding-frenzy of wet/dry vacs and spot
remover and all-trace-of-odoreradicator chemicals applied by this elite
Special Forces-type crew.

And don't let me forget room service, which on a 7NC Luxury Cruise is called
"cabin service." Cabin service is in addition to the eleven scheduled daily
opportunities for public eating, and it's available twenty-four hours a day
and is free: all you have to do is hit x72 on the bedside phone, and ten or
fifteen minutes later a guy who wouldn't even dream of hitting you up for a
gratuity appears with: "Thinly Sliced Ham and Swiss Cheese on White Bread with
Dijon Mustard" or "The Combo: Cajun Chicken with Pasta Salad, and Spicy
Salsa," or a whole page of other sandwiches and platters from the Services
Directory--and the stuff deserves serves to be capitalized, believe me. As a
king of semi-agoraphobe who spends massive amounts of time in my cabin, I come
to have a really complex dependency/shame relationship with cabin service.
Since finally finding out about it Monday, I've ended up availing myself of
cabin service every night--more like twice a night, to be honest--even though
I find it extremely embarrassing to be calling up x72 asking to have even more
rich food brought to me when there have already been eleven gourmet eating-ops
that day.20 Usually what I do is spread my notebooks and Fielding's Guide to
Worldwide Cruises 1995 and pens and various materials out all over the bed so
that when the cabin service guy appears at the door he'll see all this
belletristic material and figure I'm working really hard on something
belletristic right here in the cabin and have doubtless been too busy to have
hit all the public meals and thus am legitimately entitled to the indulgence
of even more rich food.

My experience with the cabin cleaning, though, is perhaps the ultimate example
of pampering stress. The fact of the matter is that I rarely even see 1009's
Cabin Steward, Petra, which is why, on the occasions when I do see her, I
practically hold her prisoner and yammer at her like an idiot. But I have good
reason to believe she sees me, because every time I leave 1009 for more than
like half an hour, when I get back it's cleaned and dusted again and the
towels replaced and the bathroom agleam. Don't get me wrong: in a way it's
great. I'm in Cabin 1009 a lot, and I also come and go a lot, and when I'm in
here I sit in bed and write in bed while eating fruit and generally mess up
the bed. But whenever I dart out and then come back, the bed is freshly made
up and hospital-cornered and there's another mintcentered chocolate on the
pillow.

I grant that mysterious invisible room cleaning is every slob's fantasy, like
having a mom without the guilt. But ther is also a creeping uneasiness about
it that presents--at least in my own case--as a king of paranoia. Because
after a couple days of this fabulous invisible room cleaning, I start to
wonder how exactly Petra knows when I'm in 1009 and when I'm not. It's now
that it occurs to me that I hardly ever see her. For a while I try
experiments, like all of a sudden darting out into the 10-Port hallway to see
if I can catch Petra hunched somewhere keeping track of who is decabining, and
DECHI scour the whole hallway-and-ceiling area for evidence of some kind of
camera monitoring movements outside the cabin doors. Zilch on both fronts. But
then I, see that the mystery's even more complex and unsettling than I'd first
thought, because my cabin gets cleaned always and only during intervals when
I'm gone for more than half an hour. When I go out, how can Petra or her
supervisors possibly know how long I'm going to be gone? I try leaving 1009 a
couple of times and then dashing back after ten or fifteen minutes to see
whether I can catch Petra in delicti, but she's never there. I try making an
ungodly mess, then leaving and hiding somewhere 6n a lower deck, then dashing
back after exactly twenty-nine minutes-again when I come bursting through the
door there's no Petra and no cleaning. Then I leave the cabin with exactly the
same expression and appurtenances as before and this time stay hidden for
thirty-one minutes and then haul ass back--again no sighting of Petra, but now
1009 is sterilized and gleaming, and there's a mint on the pillow's new case.
I scrutinize every inch of every surface I pass as I circle the deck during
these little experiments: no cameras or motionsensors or anything in evidence
anywhere that would explain how They know.(21) Sof for a while I theorize that
somehow a special crewman is assigned to each passenger and follows that
passenger at all times, using extremely sophisticated personal-surveillance
techniques and reporting back to Steward HQ my movements and activities and
projected time of cabin-return. For about a day I try taking evasive
actions--whirling to check behind me, popping around corners, darting in and
out of gift shops via different doors, etc.--but I never see one flaming sign
of anybody engaged in surveillance. By the time I quit trying, I'm feeling
half-crazed, and my countersurveillance measures are drawing frightened looks
and even some temple-tapping from 10-Port's other guests.

MY CABIN

I who am not a true agoraphobe but am what might be called a "borderline
agoraphobe" or "semi-agoraphobe," come therefore understandably to love very
deeply "Cabin 1009/Exterior Port."[22] It is made of a fawn-colored enamelish
polymer and its walls are extremely thick and solid: I can drum annoyingly on
the wall above my bed for up to five minutes before my aft neighbors pound
(very faintly) back. My cabin is thirteen size-eleven Keds long by twelve Keds
wide. The cabin door has three separate locking technologies and trilingual
lifeboat and - jacket instructions bolted to its wall and a whole deck of
multilingual DO NOT DISTURB cards hanging from the inside knob. Right by the
door is the Wondercloset, a complicated honeycomb of shelves and drawers and
hangers and cubbyholes and a Personal Fireproof Safe. The Wondercloset is so
intricate in its utilization of every available cubic centimeter that all I
can say is it must have been designed by a very organized person indeed.
Inside are extra chamois blankets and hypoallergenic pillows and plastic
Celebrity Cruises bags of all different sizes and configurations for your
laundry, optional dry cleaning, etc.

The cabin's porthole is indeed round, but it is not small, and in terms of its
importance to the room's mood and raison it resembels a cathedral's rose
window. It's made of that kind of very thick glass that tellers at drive-up
banks stand behind. You can thump the glass with your fist and it won't even
vibrate. Every morning at exactly 8:34 A.M. a Filipino guy in a blue jumpsuit
stands on one of the lifeboats that hang in rows between Decks 9 and 10 and
sprays my porthole with a hose, to get the salt off, which is always fun to
watch.

Cabin 1009's dimensions are just barely on the good side of the line between
very very snug and cramped. Packed into its near-square are a big good bed and
two bedside tables with lamps and an 18-inch TV with five At-Sea Cable [R]
options. There's also a white enamel desk that doubles as a vanity, and a
round glass table on which sits a basket that's alternately filled with fresh
fruit and husks and rinds of same. Every time I leave the cabin for more than
the requisite half-hour I come back to find a new basket of fruit, covered in
snug blue-tinted plastic wrap, on the glass table. It's good fresh fruit and
it's always there. I've never eaten so much fruit in my life.

MY BATHROOM

Cabin 1009's bathroom deserves extravagant praise. I've seen more than my
share of bathrooms, and this is one bitchingly nice bathroom. It is five and a
half Keds to the edge of the shower's step up and sign to WATCH YOUR STEP. The
room is done in white enamel and gleaming stylized brushed and stainless
steel. Its overhead lighting is some kind of blue-intensive Eurofluorescence
that's run through a diffusion filter so that it's diagnostically acute
without being brutal. Next to the light switch is an Alisco Scirocco [R]hair
dryer that's brazed right onto the wall and comes on automatically when you
take it out of the mount; the Scirocco's HIGH setting just about takes your
head off. The sink is huge, and its bowl is deep without seeming precipitous
or ungentle of grade. Good plate mirror covers the whole wall over the sink.
The steel soap dish is striated to let sog-water out and minimize that
annoying underside-of-the-bar slime. The ingenious consideration of the
anti-slime soap dish is particularly affecting. Keep in mind that 1009 is a
mid-price single cabin. The mind positively reels at what a luxury
penthouse-type cabin's bathroom must be like.

Merely enter 1009's bathroom and hit the overhead lights and on comes an
automatic exhaust fan whose force and aerodynamism give steam or offensive
odors just no quarter at all.[23] The fan's suction is such that if you stand
right underneath its louvered vent it maked you hair stand straight up on your
head, which together with the abundantly rippling action of the Scirocco hair
dryer makes for hours of fun in the lavishly lit mirror.

The shower itself overachieves in a very big way. The HOT setting's water is
exfoliatingly hot, but it takes only one preset manipulation of the shower
knob to get perfect 98.6-degree water. My own personal home should have such
water pressure: the showerhead's force pins you helplessly to the stall's
opposite wall, and the head's MASSAGE setting makes your eyes roll up and your
sphincter just about give.(24) The showerhead and its flexible steel line are
also detachable, so you can hold the head and direct its punishing stream just
at your particularly dirty right knee or something.

But all this is still small potatoes compared with 1009's fascinating and
potentially malevolent toilet. A harmonious concordance of elegant form and
vigorous function, flanked by rolls of tissue so soft as to be without
perforates for tearing, my toilet has above it this sign:

THIS TOILET IS CONNECTED TO A VACUUM

SEWAGE SYSTEM. PLEASE DO NOT THROW INTO

THE TOILET ANYTHING [SIC] THAN ORDINARY

TOILET WASTE AND TOILET PAPER

The toilet's flush produces a brief but traumatizing sound, a kind of held
high-B gargle, as of some gastric disturbance on a cosmic scale. Along with
this sound comes a suction so awasomely powerful that it's both scary and
strangely comforming: your waste seems less removed than hurled from you, and
with a velocity that lets you feel as though the waste is going to end up
someplace so far away that it will have become an abstraction, a king of
existential sewage-treatments system.(25)

THE OCEAN

Traveling at sea for the first time is a chance to realize that the ocean is
not one ocean. The water changes. The Atlantic that seethes off the eastern
United States is glaucous and lightless and looks mean. Around jamaica,
though, it's more like a milky aquamarine. Off the Cayman Islands it's an
electric blue, and off Cozumel it's almost purple. Same deal with the beaches.
You can tell right away that south Florida's sand comes from rocks: it hurts
your bare feet and has that sort of mineralish glitter to it. But Ocho Rios's
beach is more like dirty sugar, and Cozumel's is like clean sugar, and at
places along the coast of Grand Cayman the sand's texture is more like flour,
silicate, its white as dreamy and vaporous as clouds' white. The only real
constant to the nautical topography of the Nadir's Caribbean is its unreal and
almost retouched-looking prettiness. It's impossible to describe right; the
closest I can come is to say that it all looks; expensive.

TABLE 64'S WAITER

Our waiter's name is, as previously mentioned, Tibor. Mentally I refer to him
as "the Tibster," but never out loud. Tibor has dismantled my artichokes and
my lobsters and taught me that extra-well-done is not the only way meat can be
palatable. We have sort of bonded, I feel. He is thirty-five and about five
four and plump, and his movements have the birdlike economy characteristic of
small plump graceful men. His face is at once round and pointy, and rosy. His
tux never wrinkles. His hands are soft and pink. Menu-wise, Tibor advises and
recommends, but without the hauteur that has always made me hate the
gastropedantic waiters in classy restaurants. He is omnipresent without being
unctuous or oppressive; he is kind and warm and fun. He is the Head Waiter for
Tables 64-67 at all three meals. He can carry three trays without
precariousness and never looks harried or on the edge the way most multitable
waiters look. He seems like he cares.

Tibor's cuteness has been compared by the women at Table 64 to that of a
button. But I have learned not to let his cuteness fool me. Tibor is a pro.
His commitment to personally instantiating the Nadir's fanatical commitment to
excellence is the one thing about which he shows no sense of humor. If you
fuck with him in this area he will feel pain and will make no effort to
conceal it. On the second night at supper, for example, Tibor was circling the
table and asking each of us how our entree was, and we all regarded this as
just one of those perfunctory waiter-questions and perfunctorily smiled back
and said Fine, Fine--and Tibor finally stopped and looked down at us all with
a pained expression and changed his timbre slightly so that it was clear he
was addressing the whole table: "Please. I ask each: is excellent? Please. If
excellent, you say, and I am happy. If not excellent, please: do not say
excellent. Let me fix. Please." There was no hauteur or pedantry or even anger
as he addressed us. He just meant what he said. His expression was babe-naked,
and we heard him, and nothing was perfunctory again.

Mornings, the Tibster wears a red bow tie and smells faintly of sandalwood.
Early Seating Breakfast is the best time to be with Tibor, because he's not
very busy and can be initiated into chichat without looking pained at
neglecting his duties. He doesn't know I'm on the Nadir as a pseudojournalist.
I'm not sure why I haven't told him--somehow I think it might make things hard
for him. During E.S.B. chitchat I never ask him anything about the Nadir
(except for precise descriptions of whatever dorsal fins he's seen), not out
of deference to Mr. Dermatitis's injunctions but because I'd just about die if
Tibor got into any trouble on my account.

Tibor's ambition is someday to return to his native Budapest for good and with
his Nadir-savings open a sort of newspaper-and-beret-type sidewalk cafe that
specializes in something called cherry soup. With this in mind, two days from
now in Fort Lauderdale I'm going to tip the Tibster way more than the
suggested $3 U.S. per diem, balancing out my total expenses by radically
undertipping both our liplessly sinister maitre d' and our sommelier, an
unctuously creepy Ceylonese guy the whole table has christened the Velvet
Vulture.

PORT CALL

Mornings in port are a special time for the semi-agoraphobe, because just
about everybody else gets off the ship and goes ashore for Organized Shore
Excursions or for unstructured peripatetic tourist stuff, and the m.v. Nadir's
upper decks have the eerily delicious deserted quality of your folks' house
when you're home sick as a kid and everybody else is gone. We're docked off
Cozumel, Mexico. I'm on Deck 12. A couple of guys in software-company T-shirts
jog fragrantly by every couple of minutes, but other than that it's just me
and the zinc oxide and hat and about a thousand empty and identically folded
deck chairs. The 12-Aft Towel Guy has almost nobody to exercise his zeal on,
and by 10:00 a.m. I'm on my fifth new towel.

Here the semi-agoraphobe can stand alone at the ship's highest port rail and
look pensively out to sea, which off Cozumel is a kind of watery indigo
through which you can see the powdery white of the bottom. In the middle
distance, underwater coral formations are big cloud-shapes of deeper purple.
Out past the coral, the water gets progressively darker in orderly stripes, a
phenomenon that I think has to do with perspective. It's all extremely pretty
and peaceful. Besides me and the Towel Guy and the orbiting joggers, there's
only a supine older lady reading Codependent No More and a man standing way up
at the fore part of the starboard rail videotaping the sea. This sad and
cadaverous guy, who by the second day I'd christened Captain Video, has tall
hard gray hair and Birkenstocks and very thin hairless calves, and he's one of
the cruise's more prominent eccentrics.(26) Pretty much everybody on the Nadir
qualifies as camera-crazy, but Captain Video camcords absolutely everything,
including meals, empty hallways, endless games of geriatric bridge--even
leaping onto Deck 11's raised stage during Tuesday's Pool Party to get the
crowd from the musicians' angle. He is the only passenger besides me who I
know for a fact is cruising without a relative or companion,and certain
additional similarities between him and me tend to make me uncomfortable, and
I try to avoid him.

From Deck 12's starboard rail you can took down at the army of Nadir
passengers being disgorged by the Deck 3 gangway. They keep pouring out of the
door and down the narrow gangway. As each person's sandal hits the pier a
sociolinguistic transformation from Cruiser to Tourist is effected. A
serpentine line of 1,300-plus upscale tourists with currency to unload and
experiences to experience stretches all the way down the Cozumel pier, which
leads to a kind of megaquonset structure where Organized Shore Excursions and
T-shirts and cabs or mopeds into San Miguel are available. The word around
good old Table 64 last night was that in primitive and incredibly poor Cozumel
the U.S. dollar is treated like a U.F.O.: "They worship it when it lands."

Locals along the Cozumel pier are offering Nadirites a chance to have their
picture taken holding a very large iguana. Yesterday, on the Grand Cayman
pier, locals had offered them the chance to have their picture taken with a
guy wearing a peg leg and hook, while off the Nadir's port bow a fake pirate
ship plowed back and forth across the bay all morning, firing blank broadsides
and getting on everybody's nerves.

Off to the southeast, now, another Megacruiser is moving in to dock. It moves
like a force of nature and resists the idea that so much mass is being steered
by anything like a hand on a tiller. I can't imagine what trying to maneuver
one of these puppies into the pier is like. Parallel parking a semi into a
spot the same size as the semi with a blindfold on and four tabs of LSD in you
might come close. Our docking this morning at sunrise involved an antlike
frenzy of crewmen and shore personnel and an anchor that spilled from the
ship's navel and upward of a dozen ropes, which the crew insists on calling
"lines," even though each one is at least the same diameter as a tourist's
head.

I cannot convey to you the sheer and surreal scale of everything: the towering
ship, the ropes, the anchor, the pier, the vast lapis lazuli dome of the sky.
Looking down from a great height at your countrymen waddling into
poverty-stricken ports in expensive sandals is not one of the funner moments
of a 7NC Luxury Cruise, however. There is something inescapably bovine about a
herd of American tourists in motion, a certain greedy placidity. I feel guilty
by perceived association. I've barely been out of the U.S.A. before, and never
as part of a high-income herd, and in port-even up here above it all on Deck
12, watching-I'm newly and unpleasantly conscious of being an American, the
same way I'm always suddenly conscious of being white every time I'm around a
lot no-white people. I cannot help imagining us as we appear to them, the
bored Jamaicans and Mexicans, or especially to the non-Aryan and hard-driven
crew of the Nadir. All week I've found myself doing everything I can to
distance myself in the crew's eyes from the bovine herd I'm part of: I eschew
cameras and sunglasses and pastel Caribbeanwear; I make a big deal of carrying
my own luggage and my own cafeteria tray and am effusive in my thanks for the
slightest service. Since so many of my shipmates shout, I make it a point of
special pride to speak extra-quietly to crewmen whose English is poor. But, of
course, part of the overall despair of this Luxury Cruise is that whatever I
do I cannot escape my own essential and newly unpleasant Americanness. Whether
up here or down there, I am an American tourist, and am thus ex officio large,
fleshy, red, loud, coarse, condescending, self-absorbed, spoiled,
appearance-conscious, greedy, ashamed, and despairing.

Up on 12-Aft, Captain Video isn't filming now but is looking at the harbor
through a square he's made of his hands. He's the type where you can tell
without even looking closely that he's talking to himself. This other white
cruise ship is docking right next to us, a procedure that apparently demands a
lot of coded blasts on its world-ending horn. But maybe the single best visual
in the harbor is the group of Nadirites learning to snorkel in the lagoonish
waters just offshore; off the port bow I can see a good 150 solid citizens
floating face-down, motionless, looking like the massed and bloated victims of
some hideous mishap--from this height it's a macabre and riveting sight. I
have given up looking for dorsal fins in port. It turns out that sharks are
never seen in pretty Caribbean ports, though a couple of Jamaicans had lurid
if dubious stories of barracudas that could take off a limb in one surgical
drive-by.

Now right up alongside the Nadir, on the other side of the pier, is finally
docked and secured the m.v. Dreamward, with the peach-on-white color scheme
that I think means it's owned by Norwegian Cruise Line.(27) Its Deck 3 gangway
now protrudes and almost touches our Deck 3 gangway--sort of obscenely--and
the Dreamward's passengers, identical in all important respects to the Nadir's
passengers, are now streaming down the gangway and massing and moving down the
pier in a kind of canyon of shadow made by the tall walls of our two ships'
hulls. A lot of the Dreamward's passengers turn and crane to marvel at the
size of what's just disgorged them. Captain Video, inclined now way over the
starboard rail so that only the toes of his sandals are still touching deck,
is filming them as they look up at us; and more than a few of the
Dreamwardites way be own camcorders and point them up our way in a kind of
retaliatory gesture, and for just a moment they and Captain Video compose a
tableau that looks almost classically post-modern.

Because the Dreamward is lined up right next to us, almost porthole to
porthole, with its Deck 12's port rail right up flush against our Deck 12's
starboard rail, the Dreamward's shore-shunners and I can stand at the rails
and check each other out like muscle cars lined up at a stoplight. I can see
the Dreamward's railleaners looking the Nadir up and down, their faces shiny
with high-SPF sunblock. The Dreamward is blindingly white,.white to a degree
that seems somehow aggressive and makes the Nadir's white look more like buff
or cream. Its snout is a little more tapered and aerodynamic-looking than our
snout, and its trim is a kind of fluorescent peach, and the beach umbrellas
around its Deck 11 pools are also peach, whereas our beach umbrellas are
salmon, which has always seemed odd, given the white-and-navy motif of the
Nadir, and now seems to me ad hoc and shabby. The Dreamward has more pools on
Deck 11 than we do, and what looks like a whole other additional pool behind
clear glass on Deck 6; and its pools' blue is that distinctive chlorine-blue,
whereas the Nadir's two small pools are both seawater and kind of icky.

On all its decks, all the way down, the Dreamward's cabins have little white
balconies for private open-air sea gazing. Its Deck 12 has a full-court
basketball setup with peach-colored nets and backboards as white as Communion
wafers. I notice that each of the little towel carts on the Dreamward's Deck
12 is manned by its very own Towel Guy, and that their Towel Guys are ruddily
Nordic and wear neither sunglasses nor a look of Dickensian oppression.

The point is that, standing here next to Captain Video, looking, I start to
feel an almost prurient envy of the Dreamward. I imagine its interior to be
cleaner than ours, larger, more lavishly appointed. I imagine the Dreamward's
food being even more varied and punctiliously prepared, its casino less
depressing, its stage entertainment less cheesy, its toilets less menacing,
its pillow mints bigger. The little private balconies outside the Dreamward's
cabins, in particular, seem far superior to a porthole of bank-teller glass,
which now seems suddenly chintzy and sad.

I am suffering here from a delusion, and I know it's a delusion, this envy of
another ship, but still it's painful. It's also representative of a
psychological syndrome that I notice has gotten steadily worse as my Luxury
Cruise wears on, a mental list of dissatisfactions that started off picayune
but has quickly become despairgrade. I know that the syndrome's cause is not
simply the contempt-bred of a week's familiarity with the poor old Nadir, and
that the source of all the dissatisfactions isn't the Nadir at all but rather
that ur-American part of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the
dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately
WANTS. Hence this syndrome by which, for example, just four days ago I
experienced such embarrassment over the perceived self-indulgence of ordering
even more gratis food from cabin service that I littered the bed with fake
evidence of hard work and missed meals, whereas by last night I find myself
looking at my watch in real annoyance after fifteen minutes and wondering
where the fuck is that cabin service guy with the tray already. And by now I
notice how the tray's sandwiches are kind of small, and how the wedge of dill
pickle always soaks into the starboard crust of the bread, and how the port
hallway is too narrow to really let me put the used cabin service tray outside
1009's door at night when I'm done eating, so that the tray sits in the cabin
all night and in the morning adulterates the olfactory sterility of 1009 with
a smell of rancid horseradish, and how this seems, by the Luxury Cruise's
fifth day, deeply dissatisfying.

Death and Conroy notwithstanding, we're maybe now in a position to appreciate
the falsehood at the dark heart of Celebrity's brochure. For this--the promise
to sate the part of me that always and only WANTS-is the central fantasy the
brochure is selling. The thing to notice is that the real fantasy here isn't
that this promise will be kept but that such a promise is keepable at all.
This is a big one, this lie.(28) And of course I want to believe it; I want to
believe that maybe this ultimate fantasy vacation will be enough pampering,
that this time the luxury and pleasure will be so completely and faultlessly
administered that my infantile part will be sated at last. But the infantile
part of me is, by its very nature and essence, insatiable. In fact, its whole
raison consists of its insatiability. In response to any environment of
extraordinary gratification and pampering, the insatiable-infant part of me
will simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its
homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction. And sure enough, after a few days of
delight and then adjustment on the Nadir, the Pamper-swaddled part of me that
WANTS is now back, and with a vengeance. By Wednesday, I'm acutely conscious
of the fact that the A.C. vent in my cabin hisses (loudly), and that although
I can turn off the reggae Muzak coming out of the speaker in the cabin I
cannot turn off the even louder ceiling-speaker out in the 10-Port hall. Now I
notice that when Table 64's towering busboy uses his crumb-scoop to clear off
the tablecloth between courses he never seems to get quite all the crumbs.
When Petra makes my bed, not all the hospital corners are at exactly the same
angle. Most of the nightly stage entertainment in the Celebrity Show Lounge is
so bad it's embarrassing, and the ice sculptures at the Midnight Buffet often
look hurriedly carved, and the vegetable that comes with my entree is
continually overcooked, and it's impossible to get really numbingly cold water
out of 1009's bathroom tap.

I'm standing here on Deck 12 looking at the Dreamward, which I bet has cold
water that'd turn your knuckles blue, and, like Frank Conroy, part of me
realizes that I haven't washed a dish or tapped my foot in line behind
somebody with multiple coupons at a supermarket checkout in a week; and yet
instead of feeling refreshed and renewed I'm anticipating how totally
stressful and demanding and unpleasurable a return to regular landlocked adult
life is going to be now that even just the premature removal of a towel by a
sepulchral crewman seems like an assault on my basic rights, and the
sluggishness of the Aft elevator is an outrage. And as I'm getting ready to go
down to lunch I'm mentally drafting a really mordant footnote on my single
biggest peeve about the Nadir: they don't even have Mr. Pibb; they foist Dr.
Pepper on you with a maddeningly unapologetic shrug when any fool knows that
Dr. Pepper is no substitute for Mr. Pibb, and it's an absolute goddamned
travesty, or--at best--extremely dissatisfying indeed.

SOME ORGANIZED FUN

Every night, Cabin Steward Petra, when she turns down the bed, leaves on your
pillow-along with the day's last mint and Celebrity's printed card wishing you
sweet dreams in six language--the next day's Nadir Daily, a little four-page
ersatz newspaper printed on white in a royal-blue font. The ND has historical
nuggets on upcoming ports, pitches for Organized Shore Excursions and specials
in the Gift Shop, and stem stuff in boxes with malaprop headlines like
QUARANTINES ON TRANSIT OF FOOD and MISUSE OF DRUG ACTS 1972.

We've rounded the final turn and are steaming on our return vector from
Cozumel toward Key West, and today is one of the week's two "At-Sea" days,
when shipboard activities are at their densest and most organized. This is the
day I've picked to use the ND as a Baedeker as I leave Cabin 1009 for a period
well in excess of half an hour and plunge headfirst into the experiential fray
and keep a precise and detailed log of some really representative activities:

10:00 a.m.: Three simultaneous venues of Managed Fun, all aft on Deck 9: Darts
Tournament, take aim and hit the bull's eye! Shuffleboard Shuffle, join your
fellow guests for a morning game. Ping-Pong Tournament, meet the Cruise Staff
at the tables, Prizes to the Winners! Organized shuffleboard has always filled
me with dread. Everything about it suggests infirm senescence and death: it's
a game played on the skin of a void, and the rasp of the sliding puck is the
sound of that skin getting abraded away bit by bit. I also have a morbid but
wholly justified fear of darts stemming from a childhood trauma too
hair-raising to discuss here. I play Ping-Pong for an hour.

11:00 a.m.: Navigation Lecture. Join Captain Nico and learn about the ship's
Engine Room, the Bridge, and the basic "nuts and bolts" of the ship's
operation. I am there. The m.v. Nadir can carry 460,000 gallons of
nautical-grade diesel fuel. It burns between 40 and 70 tons of this fuel a
day, depending on how hard it's traveling. The ship has two turbine engines on
each side, one big "Papa" and one (comparatively) little "Son." Each engine
has a propeller that is 17 feet in diameter and is adjustable through a
lateral rotation of 23.5 degrees for maximum torque. It takes the Nadir .9
nautical miles to come to a complete stop from a speed of 18 knots. The Nadir
can go slightly faster in certain kinds of rough seas than it can go in calm
seas (this is for technical reasons that won't fit on the napkin I'm taking
notes on). Captain Nico's English is not going to win any elocution ribbons,
but he is a veritable blowhole of hard data. He's about my age and height and
is just ridiculously good-looking(29) Captain Nico wears Ray-Bans, but without
a touristic fluorescent cord. This is also the day my paranoia about Mr.
Dermatitis contriving somehow to jettison me from the Nadir via Cabin 1009's
Vacuum-Section Toilet is at its emotional zenith, and I've decided in advance
to keep a real low journalistic profile at this event. I ask a total of one
little innocuous question, right at the start, and Captain Nico responds with
a witticism--"How we start engines? Not with the key of ignition, I can tell
you!"--that gets a large and rather unkind laugh from the crowd.

It turns out that the long-mysterious "m.v." in "m.v. Nadir" stands for
"motorized vessel." The m.v. Nadir cost $250,310,000 U.S. to build. It was
christened in Papenburg, West Germany, in 1992 with a bottle of ouzo instead
of champagne. The Nadir's three onboard generators produce 9 megawatts of
power. The ship's bridge turns out to be what lies behind the very intriguing
triple-locked bulkhead near the aft Towel Cart on Deck 10. The bridge is
"where the equipments are--radars, indication of weathers and all these
things." Two years of postgraduate study is required of officer wannabes just
to get a handle on the navigational math involved; "also there is much
learning for the computers." Captain Nico explains that the Nadir subscribes
to something called GPS: "This Global Positioning System is using the
satellites above to know the position at all times, which gives this data to
the computer." It emerges that when we're not negotiating ports and piers, a
kind of computerized Autocaptain pilots the ship.(30)

The all-male audience here consists of bald solid thick-wristed fiftyish men
who all look like the kind of guy who rises to CEO a company out of its
engineering department instead of some MBA program. A number of them are
clearly Navy veterans or yachtsmen or something. They compose a very
knowledgeable audience and ask involved questions about the "bore" and
"stroke" of the engines, the management of "multi-radial torque," and the
hydrodynamics of "midship stabilizers." They're all the kinds of men who look
like they're smoking cigars even when they're not. Every, body's complexion is
hectic from sun and salt spray and a surfeit of Slippery Nipples. A 7NC
Megaship's maximum possible cruising speed is 21.4 knots. No way I'm going to
raise my hand in this kind of crowd and ask what a knot is.

12:40 P.M.: I seem to be out on 9-Aft hitting golf balls off an Astroturf
square into a densemesh nylon net that balloons impressively out toward the
sea when a golf ball hits it. Thanatopic shuffleboard continues over to
starboard; ominous little holes in the deck, bulkhead, railing, and even my
little Astroturf square testify to my wisdom in having steered clear of the
a.m. Darts Tourney

2:00 p.m.: Now I'm in Deck 12's Olympic Health Club, in the back area, in the
part that's owned by Steiner of London,[R] a kind of floating spa, and I'm
asking to be allowed to watch one of the "Phytomer/Ionithermie Combination
Treatment De-Toxifying Inch Loss Treatments" that some of the heftier ladies
onboard have been raving about, and I am being told that it's not really a
spectator-type thing, that there's nakedness involved, and that if I want to
see it I'm going to have to be the subject of one. Between the quoted price of
the treatment and some pretty troubling references in the Steiner of London
brochure to "electrodes using faradism and galvanism," I opt to forfeit this
bit of managed pampering. If you back off from something really big, the
creamy-faced staffers then try to sell you on a facial, which they say "a
number" of male Nadirites have pampered themselves with this week, but I
decline this as well, figuring that at this point in the week the procedure
would consist mostly in exfoliating half-peeled skin.

2:30 p.m.: Now I'm down in Deck 8's Rainbow Room for "Behind the Scenes." Meet
your Cruise Director Scott Peterson and find out what it's really like to work
on a cruise ship! Scott Peterson is a tan guy with tall rigid hair, a
high-watts smile, an escargot mustache, and a gleaming Rolex--basically the
sort of guy who looks entirely at home in sockless white loafers and a
mint-green golf shirt--and is one of my very least favorite Celebrity Cruises
employees, though with Scott Peterson it's a case of mildly enjoyable
annoyance rather than the terrified loathing I feel for Mr. Dermatitis. The
very best way to describe Scott Peterson's demeanor is that it looks like he's
constantly posing for a photograph nobody is taking. He mounts the Rainbow
Room's low brass dais, reverses his chair, sits like a cabaret singer, and
holds forth. There are maybe fifty people attending, and I have to admit that
some of them seem to like Scott Peterson a lot, and to enjoy his talk, a talk
that, not surprisingly, turns out to be more about what it's like to be Scott
Peterson than about what it's like to work on the good old Nadir. Topics
covered include where and under what circumstances Scott Peterson grew up, how
Scott Peterson got interested in cruise ships, how Scott Peterson and his
college roommate got their first jobs together on a cruise ship, some
hilarious booboos in Scott Peterson's first months on the job, every celebrity
Scott Peterson has personally met and shaken the hand of, how much Scott
Peterson loves the people he gets to meet working on a cruise ship, how much
Scott Peterson loves just working on a cruise ship in general, how Scott
Peterson met the future Mrs. Scott Peterson working on a cruise ship, and how
Mrs. Scott Peterson now works on a different cruise ship and how challenging
it is to sustain an intimate relationship as warm and in all respects
wonderful as that of Mr. and Mrs. Scott Peterson when you work on different
cruise ships and lay eyes on each other only about every sixth week, except
that now Scott Peterson's grateful to be able to announce that Mrs. Scott
Peterson happens to be on a well-earned vacation and is as a rare treat here
this week cruising on the m.v. Nadir with him and is, as a matter of fact,
right here with us in the audience today, and wouldn't Mrs. S. P. like to
stand up and take a bow.

3:05 p.m.: I've darted for a minute into Deck 7's Celebrity Show Lounge to
catch some of the rehearsals for tomorrow night's climactic Passenger Talent
Show. Two crew-cut and badly burned U. Texas guys are doing a minimally
choreographed dance number to a recording of "Shake Your Groove Thing."
Assistant Cruise Director Dave the Bingo Boy is coordinating activities from a
canvas director's chair at stage left. A septuagenarian from Halifax,
Virginia, tells six jokes and sings "One Day at a Time (Sweet Jesus)." A
retired Century 21 realtor from Idaho does a long drum solo to "Caravan. The
climactic Passenger Talent Show is apparently a 7NC tradition, as was
Tuesday's Special Costume Party. Some of the Nadirites are deeply in this
stuff and have brought their own costumes and props. A lithe Canadian couple
does a tango complete with pointy black shoes and a rose in teeth. The finale
is apparently going to be four consecutive stand-up comedy routines delivered
by very old men. These men totter on one after the other. One has a
three-footed cane, another a necktie that looks uncannily like a Denver
omelette, another an excruciating stutter. What follow are four successive
interchangeable routines where die manner and humor are like exhumed time
capsules of the 1950s: jokes about how impossible it is to understand women,
about how very much men want to play golf and how their wives try to keep them
from playing golf, etc. The routines have the same kind of flamboyant
unhipness that makes my own grandparents objects of my pity, awe, and
embarrassment all at the same time. One of the senescent quartet refers to his
appearance tomorrow night as a "gig."

3:20 p.m.: The ND neglects to mention that the trapshooting is a competitive
Organized Activity. The charge is $1 a shot, but you have to purchase your
shots in sets of ten, and there's a large and vaguely gun-shaped plaque for
the best score. I arrive at 8-Aft late; a male Nadirite is already shooting,
and several other males have formed a line and are waiting to shoot. The
Nadir's wake is a big fizzy V way below the aft rail. Two sullen Greek NCOs in
earmuffs run the show. I am seventh and last in line. The other guys refer to
the targets as "pigeons," but what they really look like is little discuses
painted the Day-Glo orange of expensive hunting wear. The orange, I posit, is
for ease of visual tracking, and the color must really help, because the trim
bearded guy in aviator glasses currently shooting is wreaking absolute
devastation in the air over the stem.

I assume you already know the basic trapshooting conventions from movies or
TV: the lackey at the weird little catapultish device, the bracing and
pointing and order to Pull!, the combination thud and kertwang of the
catapult, the brisk crack of the weapon, and the midair disintegration of the
luckless pigeon. Everybody in line with me is male, though there are a number
of females in the crowd that's watching the competition from the 9-Aft balcony
above and behind us.

From the line, watching, three things are striking: (a) what on TV is a brisk
crack is here a whooming roar that apparently is what a shotgun really sounds
like; (b) trapshooting Looks comparatively easy, because now the stocky older
guy who's replaced the trim bearded guy at the rail is also blowing these
little fluorescent plates away one after the other, so that a steady rain of
lumpy orange crud is falling into the Nadir's wake;(c) a clay pigeon, when
shot, undergoes a frigtheningly familiar-looking midflight
peripeteia--erupting material, changing vector, and plummeting seaward in a
corkscrewy way that all eerily recalls footage of the 1986 Challenger
disaster.

All the shooters who precede me seem to fire with a kind of casual scorn, and
all get eight out of ten or above. But it turns out that, of these six guys,
three have military-combat backgrounds, another two are L. L. Bean-model-type
brothers who spend weeks every year hunting various fast-flying species with
their "Papa" in southern Canada, and the last has got not only his own
earmuffs, plus his own shotgun in a special crushed-velvet lined case, but
also his own trapshooting range in his backyard(31) in North Carolina. When
it's finally my turn, the earmuffs they give me have somebody. else's ear-oil
on them and don't fit my head very well. The gun itself is shockingly heavy
and stinks of what I'm told is cordite, small pubic spirals of which are still
exiting the barrel from the Korea-vet who preceded me and is tied for first
with 10/10. The two brothers are the only entrants even near my age; both got
scores of 9/10 and are now appraising me coolly from identical
prep-school-slouch positions against the starboard rail. The Greek NCOs seem
extremely bored. I am handed the heavy gun and told to "be bracing a hip"
against the aft rail and then to place the stock of the weapon against, no,
not the shoulder of my hold-the-gun arm but the shoulder of my
pull-the-trigger arm. (My initial error in this latter regard results in a
severely distorted aim that makes the Greek by the catapult do a rather neat
drop-and-roll.

Let's not spend a lot of time drawing this whole incident out. Let me simply
say that, yes, my own trapshooting score was noticeably lower than the other
entrants' scores, then simply make a few disinterested observations for the
benefit of any novice contemplating trapshooting from a 7NC Megaship, and then
we'll move on: (1) A certain level of displayed ineptitude with a firearm will
cause everyone who knows anything about firearms to converge on you all at the
same time with cautions and advice and handy tips. (2) A lot of the advice in
(1) boils down to exhortations to "lead" the launched pigeon, but nobody
explains whether this means that the gun's barrel should move across the sky
with the pigeon or should instead sort of lie in static ambush along some
point in the pigeon's projected path. (3) Whatever a "hair trigger" is, a
shotgun does not have one. (4) If you've never fired a gun before, the urge to
close your eyes at the precise moment of concussion is, for all practical
purpose, irresistible. (5) The well-known "kick" of a fired shotgun is no
misnomer; it knocks you back several steps with your arms pinwheeling wildly
for balance, which when you're holding a still-loaded gun results in mass
screaming and ducking and then on the next shot a conspicuous thinning of the
crowd in the 9-Aft gallery above. Finally, (6), know that an unshot discus's
movement against the vast lapis lazuli dome of the open ocean's sky is
sun-like--i.e., orange and parabolic and right-to-left--and that its
disappearance into the sea is edge-first and splashless and sad.

THE HEADLINE ENTERTAINMENT

Other Celebrity Showtime headline entertainments this week have included a
Vietnamese comedian who juggles chain saws, a husband-and-wife team that
specializes in Broadway love medleys, and, most notably, a singing
impressionist named Paul Tanner, who made simply an enormous impression on
Table 64's Trudy and Esther, and whose impressions of Engelbert Humperdinck,
Tom Jones, and particularly Perry Como were apparently so stirring that a
special Popular Demand Encore Performance by Paul Tanner has been hastily
scheduled to follow tomorrow night's climactic Passenger Talent Show. For
tonight, though, the Nadir Daily announces: CELEBRITY SHOWTIME Celebrity
Cruises Proudly Presents HYPNOTIST NIGEL ELLERY.

Hypnotist Nigel Ellery is British and looks uncannily like a 1950s B-movie
villain. Introducing him, Cruise Director Scott Peterson informs us that Nigel
Ellery "has had the honor of hypnotizing both Queen Elizabeth II and the Dalai
Lama."(32) Nigel Ellery's act combines hypnotic hijinks with rather standard
Borscht Belt patter and audience abuse. And it ends up being such an absurdly
suitable microcosm of the week's whole 7NC Luxury Cruise experience that it's
almost like a setup, some weird form of pseudojournalistic pampering.

First off, we learn that not everyone is susceptible to serious hypnosis:
Nigel Ellery puts the Celebrity Show Lounge's whole 300-plus crowd through
some simple in-your-seat tests to determine who is suggestibly "gifted" enough
to "participate" in the "fun" to come. (33) Second, when the sex most suitable
subjects--all still locked in their complex contortions from the in-your-seat
tests--are assembled onstage, Nigel Ellery spends a very long time reassuring
them and us that absolutely nothing will happen that they do not wish to have
happen. He then persuades a young lady from Akron that a loud Hispanic voice
is issuing from the left cup of her brassiere. Another lady is induced to
smell something ghastly coming off the man in the chair next to her, a man who
himself believes that the seat of his chair periodically heats to 100 degrees
Celsius. The other three subjects, respectively, flamenco, believe they are
not just nude but woefully ill-endowed, and are made to shout "Mommy, I wanna
wee-wee!" when Nigel Ellery tells them good night. The audience laughs very
hard at all the right times. And there is something genuinely funny (not to
mention symbolic) about watching these well-dressed U.S. adult cruisers behave
strangely for no reason they understand; it is as if the hypnosis enables them
to construct fantasies so vivid that the subjects do not even know they are
fantasies, which is of course funny.

Maybe the single most strikingly comprehensive 7NC symbol, though, is Nigel
Ellery, himself. The hypnotist's boredom and hostility are not only
undisguised but incorporated kind of ingeniously into the entertainment
itself: Ellery's boredom gives him the same air of weary expertise that makes
us trust doctors and policemen, and his hostile stage-persona is what gets the
biggest roars of approval and laughter from the crowd. He does unkind
imitations of people's U.S. accents. He ridicules questions from the subjects
and audience. He makes his eyes burn Rasputinishly and tells people they're
going to wet the bed at exactly 3:00 A.M. Each moment of naked ill-will is
followed by a palms-out assurance that he's just kidding and that he loves us
and that we are a simply marvelous audience. The spectators--mostly
middle-aged, it looks like--rock back and forth with mirth and slap their
knees and dab at their eyes with hankies.

For me, at the end of a full day of Managed Fun, Nigel Ellery's act is not
particularly astounding or side-splitting or entertaining. What it is is
weird. There's something crucially key about Luxury Cruises in evidence here:
being entertained by someone who clearly dislikes you, and feeling that you
deserve that dislike at the same time you resent it. The show's climax has the
six subjects all lined up doing syncopated Rockette kicks. Because my own
dangerous mesmeric susceptibility makes it important that I not follow
Ellery's hypnotic suggestions too closely or get too deeply involved, I find
myself, in my plush seat, going farther and farther away, sort of creatively
visualizing an epiphanic Frank Conroy-type moment of my own, trying to see the
hypnotist and subjects and audience and ship itself with the eyes of someone
not aboard, imagining the m.v. Nadir right at this moment, all lit up and
steaming north, in the dark, at night, with a strong west wind pulling the
moon backward through a skein of clouds--the Nadir a constellation, complexly
aglow, angelically white, festive, imperial. Yes, this: it would look like a
floating palace to any poor soul out here on the ocean at night, alone in a
dinghy, or not even in a dinghy but simply and terribly floating, treading
water, out of sight of land. This deep disassociative trance--Nigel Ellery's
true unconscious gift to me--lasted all through the next day and night. This
period I spent entirely in Cabin 1009, in bed, mostly looking out the spotless
porthole, with trays and rinds all around me, feeling a little bit dulled but
mostly good--good to be on the Nadir and good to know that soon I would get
off the ship, that I had survived (in a way) being pampered to death (in a
way)--and so I stayed in bed. And even though the trance made me miss the
final night's Talent Show and Midnight Farewell Buffet and Saturday's docking
(at which there was apparently even more crepe and waving and explosive
goodwill) and a chance to have my After-photo taken with Captain G.
Panagiotakis, reentry into the stresses and demands of quotidian landlocked
real-world life wasn't nearly as bad as a week of absolutely nothing had led
me to fear. (1) Somewhere he'd gotten the impiression that I was an
investigative journalist and wouldn't let me see the galley, bridge, or staff
decks, or interview any of the crew in an on-the-record way, and he wore
sunglasses indoors, and epaulets, and kept talking on the phone for long
stretches of time in Greek when I was in his office after I'd skipped the
karaoke semifinals in the Rendez-Vous Lounge to make a special appointment to
see him, and I wish him ill. (2) Of the Megalines out of south Florida there's
also Commodore, Costa, Majesty, Regal, Dolphin, Princess, Royal Caribbean,
Renaissance, Royal Cruise Line, Holland America, Cunard, Norwegian Cruise
Line, Crystal, and Regency Cruises. Plus the Wal-mart of the cruise industry,
Carnival, which the other lines refer to sometimes as "Carnivore. " The
present market's various inches--singles, Old People, Theme, Special Interest,
Corporate, Party, Family, Mass-market, Luxury, Ab-surd Luxury, Grotesque
Luxury--have all pretty much been carved and staked out and are now competed
for viciously. The 7NC Megaship cruiser is a genre of ship all its own, like
the destroyer. The ships tend to be designed in America, built in Germany,
registered out of Liberia, and both captained and owned, for the most part, by
Scandinavians and Greeks, which is kind of interesting, since these are the
same peoples who have dominated sea travel pretty much forever. Celebrity
Cruises is owned by the Chandris Group; the X on their three ships'
smokestacks isn't an X but a Greek chi, for Chandris, a Greek shipping family
so ancient and powerful they apparently regarded Onassis as a punk. (3) Robert
Shaw as Quint reprised the whole incident in 1975's Jaws, a film, as you can
imagine, that was like fetish-porn to me at age thirteen. (4) I'll admit that
on the very first night of the 7NC I asked the staff of the Nadir's Five-Star
Caravelle Restaurant whether I could maybe have a spare bucket of au jus
drippings from supper so that I could try chumming for sharks off the back
rail of the top deck, and that this request struck everybody from the maitre
d' on down as disturbing and maybe even disturbed, and that it turned out to
be a serious journalistic faux pas, because I'm almost positive the maitre d'
passed this disturbing tidbit on to Mr. Dermatitis and that it was a big
reason why I was denied access to places like the ship's galley, thereby
impoverishing the sensuous scope of this article. It also revealed how little
I understood the Nadir's sheer size: twelve decks up is 150 feet, and the au
jus drippings would have dispersed into a vague red cologne by the time they
hit the water, with concentrations of blood inadequate to attract or excite a
serious shark, whose fin would have probably looked like a pushpin from that
height anyway. (5) The Nadir's got literally hundreds of cross-sectional maps
of the ship on every deck, at every elevator and junction, each with a red dot
and a YOU ARE HERE. It doesn't take long to figure out that these are less for
orientation than for reassurance. (6) Constant references to "friends" in the
brochure's text; part of this promise of escape from dread is that no cruiser
is ever alone. (7) Always couples, and even in group shots it's always groups
of couples. I never did get hold of a brochure for an actual Singles Cruise,
but the mind reels. There was a "Singles Get Together" (sic) on die Nadir that
first Saturday night, held in Deck 8's Scorpio Disco, which after an hour of
self-hypnosis and controlled breathing I steeled myself to go to, but even the
Get Together was three-fourths established couples, and the few of us Singles
under like seventy all looked grim and self-hypnotized, and the whole affair
seemed like a true wrist-slitter, and I beat a retreat after half an hour
because Jurassic Park was scheduled to run on the TV that night, and I hadn't
yet looked at the whole schedule and seen that Jurassic Park would play
several dozen times over the coming week. (8) The press liaison for
Celebrity's P.R. firm (the charming and Debra Winger-voiced Ms. Wiessen) had
this bold explanation for the cheery service: "The people on board--the
staff--are really part of one big family. You probably noticed this when you
were on the ship. They really love what they're doing and love serving people
and they pay attention to what everybody wants and needs. " This was not what
I observed. What I observed was that the Nadir was one very tight ship, run by
an elite cadre of very hard-assed Greek officers and supervisors, that the
staff lived in mortal terror of these bosses, who watched them with enormous
beadiness at all times, and that the crew worked almost Dickensianly hard, too
hard to feet truly cheery about it. My sense was that Cheeriness was up there
with Celerity and Servility on the clipboarded evaluation sheets the Greek
bosses were constantly filling out on the crew. My sense was that a crewman
could get fired for a pretty small lapse, and that getting fired by these
Greek officers might well involve a spotlessly shined shoe in the ass and then
a really long swim. (9) Journalistic follow-up has revealed that this is the
name of a band that I feel confident betting is: Punk. (10) Like all
Megaships, the Nadir has given each deck some 7NC-related name rather than a
number, and already I am forgetting whether the Fantasy Deck is Deck 7 or 8.
Deck 12 is called the Sun Deck; 11 is the Marina Deck and has the pool and
cafe; 10 I forget; 9 is the Bahamas Deck; 8 is Fantasy and 7 is Galaxy (or
vice versa), and they contain all the venues for serious eating and dancing
and casinoing and Headline Entertainment; 6 I never did get straight; 5 is the
Europa Deck and comprises the Nadir's corporate nerve center--a huge
high-ceilinged bank-looking lobby with everything done in lemon and salmon and
brass plating

around the Guest Relations Desk and the Purser's Desk and the Hotel Manager's
Desk, with water running down massive pillars with sound that all but drives
you to the nearest urinal; 4 is cabins; everything below is all business and
off-limits. (11) This is on Deck 7, the serious dining room, and it's never
called just "the Caravelle Restaurant" (and never just "the Restaurant")
--it's always "the Five-Star Caravelle Restaurant." (12) Conroy took the same
Celebrity cruise as I, the Seven-night Western Caribbean on the good old
Nadir, in May 1994. He and his family cruised for free. I know details like
this because Conroy talked to me on the phone, and answered nosy questions,
and was frank and forthcoming and in general just totally decent about the
whole thing. (13) E.g., after reading Conroy's essay on board, whenever I'd
look up at the sky, it wouldn't be the sky I was seeing, it was the vast lapis
lazuli dome of the sky. (14) Phone inquiries about the origins of Professor
Conroy's essaymercial yielded two separate explanations: (1) From Celebrity
Cruises' P.R. liaison Ms. Wiessen (after a two-day silence that I've come to
understand as the P.R. equivalent of covering the microphone with your hand
and leaning over to confer with counsel): "Celebrity saw an article he wrote
in Travel and Leisure magazine, and they were really impressed with how he
could create these mental postcards, so they went to ask him to write about
his cruise experience for people who'd never been on a cruise before, and they
did pay him to write the article, and they really took a gamble, really,
because they had to pay him whether he liked it or not, and whether they liked
the artcle or not, but ... [dry little chuckle] obviously they liked the
article, and he did a good job, so that's the Mr. Conroy story, and those are
his perspectives on his experience." (2) From Frank Conroy (with the small
sigh that precedes a certain kind of weary candor): "I prostituted myself."
(15) This is related to the phenomenon of the Professional Smile, a pandemic
in the service industry, and no place in my experience have I been on the
receiving end of as many Professional Smiles as I was on the Nadir: maitre
d's, chief stewards, hotel managers' minions, cruise director--their P.S.'s
all come on like switches at my approach. But also back on land: at banks,
restaurants, airline ticket counters, and on and on. You know this smile--the
one that doesn't quite reach the smiler's eyes and signifies nothing more than
a calculated attempt to advance the smiler's own interests by pretending to
like the smilee. Why do employers and supervisors force professional service
people to broadcast the Professional Smile? Am I the only person who's sure
that the growing number of cases in which normal-looking people open up with
automatic weapons in shopping malls and insurance offices and medical
complexes is somehow causally related to the fact that these venues are
well-known dissemination-loci of the Professional Smile? (16) In further
retrospect, I think the only thing I really persuaded this Greek officer of
was that I was very weird, and possibly unstable, which impression I'm sure
was shared with Mr. Dermatitis and combined with that same first night's
au-jus-as-shark-bait request to destroy my credibility with Dermatitis before
I even got in to see him. (17) Table 64's waiter is Tibor, a Hungarian and a
truly exceptional person, about whom if there's any editorial justice you will
learn a lot more someplace below. (18) Not until Tuesday's Lobster Night at
the 5* C.R. did I really empathetically understand the Roman phenomenon of the
vomitorium. (19) The many things on the Nadir that were wood-grain but not
real wood were such wonderful and painstaking imitations of wood that a lot of
times it seemed like it would have been simpler and less expensive simply to
have used real wood. (20) This is counting die Midnight Buffet, which tends to
be a kind of lamely lavish costume-partyish thing with theme-related
foods--Oriental, Caribbean, Tex-Mex--and which I plan to mostly skip except to
say that Tex-Mex Night out by the pools featured what must have been a
seven-foot-high ice sculpture of Pancho Villa that spent the whole party
dripping steadily onto the mammoth sombrero of Tibor, whose waiter's contract
forces him on Tex-Mex Night to wear a serape and a straw sombrero widi a
17-inch radius (he let me measure it when the reptilian maitre d' wasn't
looking) and to dispense four-alarm chili from a steam table placed right
undemeath an ice sculpture, and whose face on occasions like this expresses a
combination of motrification and dignity that seem somehow to sum up die whole
plight of postwar Eastern Europe. (21) The answer to why I don't just ask
Petra how she does it is that Petra's English is extremely limited and
primitive, and in sad fact I'm afraid my whole deep feeling of attraction
Petra the Slavonian Steward has been erected on the flimsy foundation of the
only two English clauses she seems to know, one or the other of which she uses
in response to every question, joke, or protestation of undying love: "Is no
problem" and "You are a funny thing. " (22) "1009" indicates that it's the
ninth cabin on Deck 10, "Port" refers to the side of the ship it's on, and
"Exterior" means that I have a window. There are also "Interior" cabins off
the inner sides of the decks' halls, but I hereby advise any prospective 7NC
passenger with claustrophobic tendencies to make sure and specify "Exterior"
when making cabin reservations. (23) 1009's bathroom always smells of a
strange but not unnice Norwegian disinfectant. The cabin itself, on the other
hand, after it's been cleaned, has no odor. None. Not in the carpets, the
bedding, the insides of the desk drawers, the wood of the Wondercloset's
doors: nothing. This, too, eventually starts giving me the creeps. (24) This
detachable and concussive showerhead can allegedly also be employed for
non-hygienic and even prurient purposes. I overheard guys from a small
University of Texas vacation contingent (the only collegeage group on the
whole Nadir) regale one another with tales of their ingenuity with the
showerhead. One guy in particular was fixated on the idea that somehow the
shower's technology could be rigged to administer fellatio if he could just
get access to a metric ratchet set. " Your guess here is as good as mine. (25)
The Nadir's Vacuum Sewage System begins after a while to hold such a
fascination for me that I end up going hat in hand back to Hotel Manager
Dermatitis w ask once again for access to the ship's nether parts. But once
again I pull a boner with Dermatitis: I innocently mention my specific
fascination with the ship's Vacuum Sewage System--which boner is consequent to
another and prior boner by which I'd failed to discover in my pre-boarding
research that there'd been, just a few months before this, a tremendous
scandal in which a Megaship had been discovered dumping waste over the side in
mid-voyage, in violation of numerous national and maritimew codes, and had
been videotaped doing this by a couple of passengers who subsequently
apparently sold the videotape to some network newsmagazine, and so the whole
Megacruise industry was in a state of almost Nixonian paranoia about
unscrupulous jounalists trying to manufacture scandals about Megaships'
handling of waste. Even behind his mirrored sunglasses I can tell that Mr.
Dermatitis is severely upset about my interest in sewage, and he denies my
request to eyeballh the V.S.S. with a complex defensiveness that I can't even
begin to chart out here. It is only later that night at supper, at good old
Table 64 in the 5* C.R:,that my cruise-savvy tablemates fill me in on the
waste scandal, and they scream with mirth at the clayfooted naivete with which
I'd gone to Dermatitis with what was in fact an innocent if puerile
fascination with hermetically evacuated waste; and such is my own
embarrassment and hatred of Mr.

 Dermatitis by this time that I begin to feel that if the Hotel Manager reall
does think I'm some kind of investigative journalist with a hard-on for shark
dangers and sewage scandals, then he might think it would be worth the risk to
have me harmed in some way. And, through a set of neurotic connections I won't
even try to defend, I, for about a day and a half, begin to fear that the
Nadir's Greek episcopate will somehow contrive to use the incredibly potent
and forceful 1009 toilet itself for the assassination--that they'll, I don't
know, like somehow lubricate the bowl and up the suction to where not just my
waste but I myself will be sucked down through the seat's opening and hurled
into some kind of abstract septic exile. (26) Other eccentrics include: the
bloated and dead-eyed guy who sits in the same chair at the same 21 table in
the casino every day from noon to 3:00 A.M., drinking Long Island iced tha and
playing 21 at a narcotized underwater pace; the hairy-stomached guy of maybe
fifty who sleeps by the pool every minute, even in the rain, a copy of
Megatrends open on his chest; and the two old couples who sit in upright
chairs just inside the clear plastic walls that enclose Deck 11, never moving,
watching the ocean and ports like they're something on TV. (27) The Nadir
itself is navy trim on a white field. All the Megalines have their own
trademark color schemes--lime green on white, aqua on white, robin's egg on
white, barn red on white, white being an invariable constant. (28) It might
well be The Big One, come to think of it. (29) Something else I've learned on
this Luxury Cruise is that no man can ever look any better than he looks in
the white full-dress uniform of a naval officer. Women of all ages and
estrogen levels swooned, sighed, wobbled, lash-batted, growled, and hubba'd
when one of these navally resplendent Greek officers went by, a phenomenon
that I don't imagine helped the Greeks' humility one bit. (30) This helps
explain why Nadir Captain G. Panagiotakis usually seems so phenomenally
unbusy, why his real job seems to be to stand in various parts of the Nadir
and try to look vaguely presidential, which he would except for his habit of
wearing sunglasses inside, which makes him look more like a Third world
strongman. (31) ! (32) Not, one would presume, at the same time. (33) I, who
know from hard experience that I am hypnotizable, think about sports
statistics and deliberately flunk a couple of the tests to avoid getting up
there.

    Title:  The string theory. (the world of men's professional tennis)
   Author:  David Foster Wallace

 Abstract:  An in-depth view of the men's professional tennis tour is
presented through the trials and tribulations of one player in particular,
Michael Joyce. The tennis tour consists of hundreds of players who must
constantly undergo qualification matches in order to play in the many
lucrative tournaments.

What happens when all of a man's intelligence and athleticism is focused on
placing a fuzzy yellow ball where his opponent is not? An obsessive inquiry
(1) into the physic and metaphysics of tennis.

When Michael T. Joyce of Los Angeles serves, when he tosses the ball and his
face rises to track it, it looks like he's smiling, but he's not really
smiling--his face's circumoral muscles are straining with the rest of his body
to reach the ball at the top of the toss's rise. He wants to hit it fully
extended and slightly out in front of him--he wants to be able to hit
emphatically down on the ball, to generate enough pace to avoid an ambitious
return from his opponent. Right now, it's 1:00, Saturday, July 22, 1995, on
the Stadium Court of the Stade Jarry tennis complex in Montreal. It's the
first of the qualifying rounds for the Canadian Open, one of the major stops
on the ATP's "hard-court circuit," (1) which starts right after Wimbledon and
climaxes at N.Y.C.'s U.S. Open. The tossed ball rises and seems for a second
to hang, waiting, cooperating, as balls always seem to do for great players.
The opponent, a Canadian college star named Dan Brakus, is a very good tennis
player. Michael Joyce, on the other hand, is a world-class tennis player. In
1991, he was the top-ranked junior in the United States and a finalist at
Junior Wimbledon, (2) is now in his fourth year on the ATP Tour, and is as of
this day the seventy-ninth-best tennis player on planet earth.

A tacit rhetorical assumption here is that you have very probably never heard
of Michael Joyce of Brentwood, L.A. Nor of Tommy Ho of Florida. Nor of Vince
Spadea nor Jonathan Stark nor Robbie Weiss nor Steve Bryan--all American men
in their twenties, all ranked in the world's top one hundred at one point in
1995. Nor of Jeff Tarango, sixty-eighth in the world, unless you remember his
unfortunate psychotic breakdown in full public view during last year's
Wimbledon.(3)

You are invited to try to imagine what it would be like to be among the
hundred best in the world at something. At anything. I have tried to imagine;
it's hard.

Stade Jarry's Center Court, known as the Stadium Court, can hold slightly more
than ten thousand souls. Right now, for Michael Joyce's qualifying match,
there are ninety-three people in the crowd, ninety-one of whom appear to be
friends and relatives of Dan Brakus's. Michael Joyce doesn't seem to notice
whether there's a crowd or not. He has a way of staring intently at the air in
front of his face between points. During points, he looks only at the ball.

The acoustics in the near-empty stadium are amazing--you can hear every
breath, every sneaker's squeak, the authoritative pang of the ball against
very tight strings.

PROFESSIONAL TENNIS TOURNAMENTS LIKE PROFESSIONAL sports teams, have
distinctive traditional colors. Wimbledon's is green, the Volvo
International's is light blue. The Canadian Open's is--emphatically--red. The
tournament's "title sponsor," du Maurier cigarettes, has ads and logos all
over the place in red and black. The Stadium Court is surrounded by a red tarp
festooned with corporate names in black capital letters, and the tarp composes
the base of a grandstand that is itself decked out in red-and-black bunting,
so that from any kind of distance, the place looks like either a Kremlin
funeral or a really elaborate brothel. The match's umpire and linesmen and
ball boys all wear black shorts and red shirts emblazoned with the name of a
Quebec clothier.(4)

Stade Jarry's Stadium Court is adjoined on the north by Court One, or the
Grandstand Court, a slightly smaller venue with seats on only one side and a
capacity of forty-eight hundred. A five-story scoreboard lies just west of the
Grandstand, and by late afternoon both courts are rectangularly shadowed.
There are also eight nonstadium courts in canvas-fenced enclosures scattered
across the grounds. There are very few paying customers on the grounds on
Saturday, but there are close to a hundred world-class players: big spidery
French guys with gelled hair, American kids with peeling noses and Pac-10
sweats, lugubrious Germans, bored-looking Italians. There are blank-eyed
Swedes and pockmarked Colombians and cyberpunkish Brits. Malevolent Slavs with
scary haircuts Mexican players who spend their spare time playing two-on-two
soccer in the gravel outside the players' tent. With few exceptions, all the
players have similar builds--big muscular legs, shallow chests, skinny necks,
and one normal-size arm and one monstrously huge and hypertrophic arm. Many of
these players in the quakes, or qualifying rounds, have girlfriends in tow,
sloppily beautiful European girls with sandals and patched jeans and leather
backpacks, girlfriends who set up cloth lawn chairs and sun themselves next to
their players' practice courts.(5) At the Radisson des Gouverneurs, the
players tend to congregate in the lobby, where there's a drawsheet for the
qualifying tournament up on a cork bulletin board and a multilingual
tournament official behind a long desk, and the players stand around in the
air-conditioning in wet hair and sandals and employ about forty languages and
wait for results of matches to go up on the board and for their own next
matches' schedules to get posted. Some of them listen to headphones; none seem
to read. They all have the unhappy and self-enclosed look of people who spend
huge amounts of time on planes and in hotel lobbies, waiting around--the look
of people who must create an envelope of privacy around themselves with just
their expressions. A lot of the players seem extremely young--new guys trying
to break into the tour--or conspicuously older--like over thirty--with tans
that look permanent and faces lined from years in the trenches of tennis's
minor leagues.

THE CANADIAN OPEN ONE OF THE ATP TOUR'S "SUPER 9" tournaments, which weigh
most heavily in the calculations of world ranking, officially starts on
Monday, July 24. What's going on for the two days right before it is the
quakes. This is essentially a competition to determine who will occupy the
seven slots in the Canadian Open's main draw designated for "qualifiers." A
qualifying tourney precedes just about every big-money ATP event, and money
and prestige and lucrative careers are often at stake in quake matches, and
often they feature the best matches of the whole tournament, and it's a good
bet you've never heard of quakes.

The realities of the men's professional-tennis tour bear about as much
resemblance to the lush finals you see on TV as a slaughterhouse does to a
well-presented cut of restaurant sirloin. For every Sampras-Agassi final we
watch, there's been a weeklong tournament, a pyramidical single-elimination
battle between 32 64, or 128 players, of whom the finalists are the last men
standing. But a player has to be eligible to enter that tournament in the
first place. Eligibility is determined by ATP computer ranking. Each
tournament has a cutoff, a minimum ranking required to be entered
automatically in the main draw. Players below that ranking who want to get in
have to compete in a kind of pretournament tournament. That's the easiest way
to describe quakes. In actual practice, the whole thing's quite a bit messier,
and I'll try to describe the logistics of the Canadian Open's quakes in just
enough detail to communicate the complexity without boring you mindless.

The du Maurier Omnium Ltee has a draw of sixty-four. The sixteen entrants with
the highest ATP rankings get "seeded," which means their names are
strategically dispersed in the draw so that, barring upsets, they won't have
to meet one another until the latter rounds. Of the seeds, the top
eight--here, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang, the Russian Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic, South Africa's Wayne Ferreira,
Germany's Michael Stich, and Switzerland's Marc Rosset, respectively--get
"byes," or automatic passes, into the tournament's second round. This means
that there is actually room for fifty-six players in the main draw. The cutoff
for the 1995 Canadian Open isn't fifty-six, however, because not all of the
top fifty-six players in the world are here.(6) Here, the cutoff is
eighty-five. You'd think that this would mean that anybody with an ATP ranking
of eighty-six or lower would have to play the quakes, but here, too, there are
exceptions. The du Maurier Omnium Ltee, like most other big tournaments, has
five "wild card" entries into the main draw. These are special places given
either to high-ranked players who entered after the six-week deadline but are
desirable to l have in the tournament because they're big stars (like
Ivanisevic, number six in the world but a notorious flakeroo who supposedly
"forgot" to enter till a week ago) or to players ranked lower than
eighty-fifth whom the tournament wants I because they are judged "uniquely
deserving."

BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, THE ATP TOUR up-dates and publishes its
world rankings weekly, and the rankings constitute a nomological orgy that
makes for truly first-rate bathroom reading. As of this writing, Mahesh
Bhupathi is 284th, Luis Lobo 411th. There's Martin Sinner and Guy Forget.
There's Adolf Musil and Jonathan Venison and Javier Frana and Leander Paes.
There's -- no kidding--Cyril Suk. Rodolfo Ramos-Paganini is 337th, Alex
Lopez-Moron is 174th. Gilad Bloom is 228th and Zoltan Nagy is 414th. Names out
of some postmodern Dickens: Udo Riglewski and Louis Gloria and Francisco Roig
and Alexander Mronz. The twenty-ninth-best player in the world is named Slava
Dosedel. There's Claude N'Goran and Han-Cheol Shin (276th but falling fast)
and Horacio de la Pena and Marcus Barbosa and Amos Mansdorf and Mariano Hood.
Andres Zingman is currently ranked two places above Sander Groen. Horst Skoff
and Kris Goossens and Thomas Hogstedt are all ranked higher than Martin
Zumpft. One reason the industry sort of hates upsets is that the ATP press
liaisons have to go around teaching journalists how to spell and pronounce new
names.

The CANADIAN QUALIES THEMSELVES HAVE A DRAW OF fifty-six world-class players;
the cutoff for qualifying for the quakes is an ATP ranking of 350th.(7) The
quakes won't go all the way through to the finals, only to the quarterfinals:
The seven quarterfinalists of the quakes will receive first-round slots in the
Canadian Open.(8) This means that a player in the quakes will need to win
three rounds--round of fifty-six, round of twenty-eight, round of fourteen--in
two days to get into the first round of the main draw.(9)

The eight seeds in the quakes are the eight players whom the Canadian Open
officials consider most likely to make the quarters and thus get into the main
draw. The top seed this weekend is Richard Krajicek,(10) a six-foot-five-inch
Dutchman who wears a tiny white billed hat in the sun and rushes the net like
it owes him money and in general plays like a rabid crane. Both his knees are
bandaged. He's in the top twenty and hasn't had to play quakes for years, but
for this tournament he missed the entry deadline, found all the wild cards
already given to uniquely deserving Canadians, and with phlegmatic Low Country
cheer decided to go ahead and play the weekend quakes for the match practice.
The quakes' eighth seed is Jamie Morgan, an Australian journeyman, around one
hundredth in the world, whom Michael Joyce beat in straight sets last week in
the second round of the main draw at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in
Washington, D. C. Michael Joyce is seeded third.

If you're wondering why Joyce, who's ranked above the number-eighty-five
cutoff, is having to play the Canadian Open quakes, gird yourself for one more
smidgen of complication. The fact is that six weeks before, Joyce's ranking
was not above the cutoff, and that's when the Canadian entry deadline was, and
that's the ranking the tournament used when it made up the main draw. Joyce's
ranking jumped from 119th to 88th after Wimbledon 1995, where he beat Marc
Rosset (ranked 11th in the world) and reached the round of sixteen.

The qualie circuit is to professional tennis sort of what AAA baseball is to
the major leagues: Somebody playing the quakes in Montreal is an undeniably
world-class tennis player, but he's not quite at the level where the serious
TV and money are. In the main draw of the du Maurier Omnium Ltee, a
first-round loser will earn $5,400, and a second-round loser $10,300. In the
Montreal quakes, a player will receive $560 for losing in the second round and
an even $0.00 for losing in the first. This might not be so bad if a lot of
the entrants for the quakes hadn't flown thousands of miles to get here. Plus,
there's the matter of supporting themselves in Montreal. The tournament pays
the hotel and meal expenses of players in the main draw but not of those in
the quakes. The seven survivors of the quakes, however, will get their hotel
expenses retroactively picked up by the tournament. So there's rather a lot at
stake--some of the players in the quakes are literally playing for their
supper or for the money to make airfare home or to the site of the next quake.

You could think of Michael Joyce's career as now kind of on the cusp between
the majors and AAA ball. He still has to qualify for some tournaments, but
more and more often he gets straight into the main draw. The move from
qualifier to main-draw player is a huge boost, both financially and
psychically, but it's still a couple of plateaus away from true fame and
fortune. The main draw's 64 or 128 players are still mostly the supporting
cast for the stars we see in televised finals. But they are also the pool from
which superstars are drawn. McEnroe, Sampras, and even Agassi had to play
quakes at the start of their careers, and Sampras spent a couple of years
losing in the early rounds of main draws before he suddenly erupted in the
early nineties and started beating everybody.

Still, even most main-draw players are obscure and unknown. An example is
Jakob Hlasek,(11) a Czech who is working out with Marc Rosset on one of the
practice courts this morning when I first arrive at Stade Jarry. I notice them
and go over to watch only because Hlasek and Rosset are so beautiful to
see--at this point, I have no idea who they are. They are practicing ground
strokes down the line--Rosset's forehand and Hlasek's backhand--each ball
plumb-line straight and within centimeters of the corner, the players moving
with the compact nonchalance I've since come to recognize in pros when they're
working out: The suggestion is of a very powerful engine in low gear. Jakob
Hlasek is six foot two and built like a halfback, his blond hair in a short
square Eastern European cut, with icy eyes and cheekbones out to here: He
looks like either a Nazi male model or a lifeguard in hell and seems in
general just way too scary ever to try to talk to. His backhand is a
one-hander, rather like Ivan Lendl's, and watching him practice it is like
watching a great artist casually sketch something. I keep having to remember
to blink There are a million little ways you can tell that somebody's a great
player--details in his posture, in the way he bounces the ball with his racket
head to pick it up, in the way he twirls the racket casually while waiting for
the ball. Hlasek wears a plain gray T-shirt and some kind of very white
European shoes. it's midmorning and already at least go degrees, and he isn't
sweating. Hlasek turned pro in 1983, six years later had one year in the top
ten, and for the last few years has been ranked in the sixties and seventies,
getting straight into the main draw of all the tournaments and usually losing
in the first couple of rounds. Watching Hlasek practice is probably the first
time it really strikes me how good these professionals are, because even just
fucking around, Hlasek is the most impressive tennis player I've ever
seen.(12) I'd be surprised if anybody reading this article has ever heard of
Jakob Hlasek. By the distorted standards of TV's obsession with Grand Slam
finals and the world's top five, Hlasek is merely an also-ran. But last year,
he made $300,000 on the tour (that's just in prize money, not counting
exhibitions and endorsement contracts), and his career winnings are more than
$4 million, and it turns out his home base was for a time Monte Carlo, where
lots of European players with tax issues end up living.

MICHAEL JOYCE TWENTY-TWO IS LISTED IN THE ATP Tour Player Guide as five eleven
and 165 pounds, but in person he's more like five nine. On the Stadium Court,
he looks compact and stocky. The quickest way to describe him would be to say
that he looks like a young and slightly buff David Caruso. He is fair-skinned
and has reddish hair and the kind of patchy, vaguely pubic goatee of somebody
who isn't quite old enough yet to grow real facial hair. When he plays in the
heat, he wears a hat.(13) He wears Fila clothes and uses Yonex rackets and is
paid to do so. His face is childishly full, and though it isn't freckled, it
somehow looks like it ought to be freckled. A lot of professional tennis
players look like lifeguards--with that kind of extreme tan that looks like
it's penetrated to the subdermal layer and will be retained to the grave--but
Joyce's fair skin doesn't tan or even burn, though he does get red in the face
when he plays, from effort.(14) His on-court expression is grim without being
unpleasant; it communicates the sense that Joyce's attentions on-court have
become very narrow and focused and intense--it's the same pleasantly grim
expression you see on, say, working surgeons or jewelers. On the Stadium
Court, Joyce seems boyish and extremely adult at the same time. And in
contrast to his Canadian opponent, who has the varnished good looks and
Pepsodent smile of the stereotypical tennis player, Joyce looks terribly real
out there playing: He sweats through his shirt,(15) gets flushed, whoops for
breath after a long point. He wears little elastic braces on both ankles, but
it turns out they're mostly prophylactic.

It's 1:30 P.M. Joyce has broken Brakus's serve once and is up 3-1 in the first
set and is receiving. Brakus is in the multibrand clothes of somebody without
an endorsement contract. He's well over six feet tall, and, as with many large
male college stars, his game is built around his serve.(16) With the score at
0-15, his first serve is flat and 118 miles per hour and way out to Joyce's
backhand, which is a two-harder and hard to lunge effectively with, but Joyce
lunges plenty effectively and sends the ball back down the line to the
Canadian's forehand, deep in the court and with such flat pace that Brakus has
to stutter-step a little and backpedal to get set up--clearly, he's used to
playing guys for whom 118 mumps out wide would be an outright ace or at least
produce such a weak return that he could move up easily and put the ball
away--and Brakus now sends the ball back up the line, high over the net, loopy
with topspin--not all that bad a shot, considering the fierceness of the
return, and a topspin shot that'd back most tennis players up and put them on
the defensive, but Michael Joyce, whose level of tennis is such that he moves
in on balls hit with topspin and hits them on the rise,(17) moves in and takes
the ball on the rise and hits a backhand cross so tightly angled that nobody
alive could get to it. This is kind of a typical Joyce-Brakus point. The match
is carnage of a particularly high-level sort: It's like watching an extremely
large and powerful predator get torn to pieces by an even larger and more
powerful predator. Brakus looks pissed off after Joyce's winner and makes some
berating-himself-type noises, but the anger seems kind of pro forma--it's not
like there's anything Brakus could have done much better, not given what he
and the seventy-ninth-best player in the world have in their respective
arsenals.

Michael Joyce will later say that Brakus "had a big serve, but the guy didn't
belong on a pro court." Joyce didn't mean this in an unkind way. Nor did he
mean it in a kind way. It turns out that what Michael Joyce says rarely has
any kind of spin or slant on it; he mostly just reports what he sees, rather
like a camera. You couldn't even call him sincere, because it's not like it
seems ever to occur to him to try to be sincere or nonsincere. For a while, I
thought that Joyce's rather bland candor was a function of his not being very
bright. This judgment was partly informed by the fact that Joyce didn't go to
college and was only marginally involved in his high school academics (stuff I
know because he told me it right away)(18) What I discovered as the tournament
wore on was that I can be kind of a snob and an asshole and that Michael
Joyce's affectless openness is not a sign of stupidity but of something else.

ADVANCES IN RACKET TECHNOLOGY AND CONDITIONING methods over the last decade
have dramatically altered men's professional tennis. For much of the twentieth
century, there were two basic styles of top-level tennis. The
''offensive''(19) style is based on the serve and the net game and is ideally
suited to slick, or "fast," surfaces like grass and cement. The "defensive,"
or "baseline," style is bulk around foot speed, consistency, and ground
strokes accurate enough to hit effective passing shots against a
serve-and-volleyer; this style is most effective on "slow" surfaces like clay
and Har-Tru composite. John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg are probably the modern
era's greatest exponents of the offensive and defensive styles, respectively.

There is now a third way to play, and it tends to be called the "power
baseline" style. As far as I can determine, Jimmy Connors(20) more or less
invented the power-baseline game back in the seventies, and in the eighties
Ivan Lendl raised it to a kind of brutal art. In the nineties, the majority of
young players on the ATP Tour have a power-baseline-type game. This game's
cornerstone is ground strokes, but ground strokes hit with incredible pace,
such that winners from the baseline are not unusual.(21) A power-baseliner's
net game tends to be solid but uninspired--a PBer is more apt to hit a winner
on the approach shot and not need to volley at all. His serve is usually
competent and reasonably forceful, but the really inspired part of a PBer's
game is usually his return of serve.(22) He often has incredible reflexes and
can hit winners right off the return. The PBer's game requires both the power
and aggression of an offensive style and the speed and calculated patience of
a defensive style. It is adjustable both to slick grass and to slow clay, but
its most congenial surface is DecoTurf II,(23) the type of abrasive hard-court
surface now used at the U. S. Open and at all the broiling North American
tune-ups for it, including the Canadian Open.

Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg are contemporary examples of the classic
offensive style. Serve-and-volleyers are often tall,(24) and tall Americans
like Pete Sampras and Todd Martin and David Wheaton are also offensive
players. Michael Chang is a pure exponent of the defensive style, as are Mats
Wilander, Carlos Costa, and a lot of the tour's Western Europeans and South
Americans, many of whom grew up exclusively on clay and now stick primarily to
the overseas clay-court circuits. Americans Jimmy Arias, Aaron Krickstein, and
Jim Courier all play a power-baseline game. So does just about every new young
male player on the tour. But its most famous and effective post-Lendl avatar
is Andre Agassi, who on 1995'S hard-court circuit was simply kicking
everyone's ass.(25)

Michael Joyce's style is power baseline in the Agassi mold: Joyce is short and
right-handed and has a two-handed backhand, a serve that's just good enough to
set up a baseline attack, and a great return of serve that is the linchpin of
his game. Like Agassi, Joyce takes the ball early, on the rise, so he always
looks like he's moving forward in the court even though he rarely comes to
net. Joyce's first serve usually comes in around ninety-five miles per
hour,(26) and his second serve is in the low eighties but has so much spin on
it that the ball turns topological shapes in the air and bounces high and wide
to the first-round Canadian's backhand. Brakus has to stretch to float a slice
return, the sort of weak return that a serve-and-volleyer would be rushing up
to the net to put away on the fly. Joyce does move up, but only halfway, right
around his own service line, where he lets the floater land and bounce up all
ripe, and he winds up his forehand and hits a winner crosscourt into the deuce
corner, very flat and hard, so that the ball makes an emphatic sound as it
hits the scarlet tarp behind Brakus's side of the court. Ball boys move for
the ball and reconfigure complexly as Joyce walks back to serve another point.
The applause of a tiny crowd is so small and sad and tattered-sounding that
it'd almost be better if people didn't clap at all.

Like those of Lendl and Agassi and Courier and many PBers, Joyce's strongest
shot is his forehand, a weapon of near-Wagnerian aggression and power. Joyce's
forehand is particularly lovely to watch. It's sparer and more textbook than
Lendl's whip-crack forehand or Borg's great swooping loop; by way of
decoration, there's only a small loop of flourish(27) on the backswing. The
stroke itself is completely horizontal, so Joyce can hit through the ball
while it's still well out in front of him. As with all great players, Joyce's
side is so emphatically to the net as the ball approaches that his posture is
a classic contrapposto.

As Joyce on the forehand makes contact with the tennis ball, his left hand
behind him opens up, as if he were releasing something, a decorative gesture
that has nothing to do with the mechanics of the stroke. Michael Joyce doesn't
know that his left hand opens up at impact on forehands: It is unconscious,
some aesthetic tic that started when he was a child and is now inextricably
hardwired into a stroke that is itself, now, unconscious for Joyce, after
years of his hitting more forehands over and over and over than anyone could
ever count.(28)

Agassi, who is twenty-five, is kind of Michael Joyce's hero. Just the week
before this match, at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, in
wet-mitten heat that had players vomiting on-court and defaulting all over the
place, Agassi beat Joyce in the third round of the main draw, 6-2 6-2. Every
once in a while now, Joyce will look over at his coach next to me in the
player-guest section of the Grandstand and grin and say something like,
"Agassi'd have killed me on that shot." Joyce's coach will adjust the set of
his sunglasses and not say anything--coaches are forbidden to say anything to
their players during a match. Joyce's coach, Sam Aparicio,(29) a protege of
Pancho Gonzalez's, is based in Las Vegas, which is also Agassi's hometown, and
Joyce has several times been flown to Las Vegas at Agassi's request to
practice with him and is apparently regarded by Agassi as a friend and
peer--these are facts Michael Joyce will mention with as much pride as he
evinces in speaking of victories and world ranking.

There are differences between Agassi's and Joyce's games, however. Though
Joyce and Agassi both use the western forehand grip and two-handed backhand
that are distinctive of topspinners, Joyce's ground strokes are very
flat--i.e., spinless, passing low over the net, driven rather than
brushed--because the actual motion of his strokes is so levelly horizontal.
Joyce's balls actually look more like Jimmy Connors's balls than like
Agassi's.(30) Some of Joyce's ground strokes look like knuckleballs going over
the net and you can actually see the ball's seams just hanging there not
spinning. Joyce also has a slight hitch in his backhand that makes it look
stiff and slightly awkward, though his pace and placement are lethal; Agassi's
own backhand is flowing and hitchless.(31) And while Joyce is far from slow,
he lacks Agassi's otherworldly foot speed. Agassi is every bit as fast as
Michael Chang.(32) Watch him on TV sometime as he's walking between points: He
takes the tiny, violently pigeon-toed steps of a man whose feet weigh
basically nothing.

Michael Joyce--also in his own coach's opinion--doesn't "see" the ball in the
same magical way that Andre Agassi does, and so Joyce can't take the ball
quite so early or generate quite the same amount of pace off his ground
strokes. The business of"seeing" is important enough to explain. Except for
the serve, power in tennis is not a matter of strength but of timing. This is
one reason why so few top tennis players look muscular.(33) Any normal adult
male can hit a tennis ball with pro pace; the trick is being able to hit the
ball both hard and accurately. If you can get your body in just the right
position and time your stroke so you hit the ball in just the right
spot--waist-level, just slightly out in front of you, with your own weight
moving from your back leg to your front leg as you make contact--you can both
cream the ball and direct it. Since ". . . just the right . . ." is a matter
of millimeters and microseconds, a certain kind of vision is crucial.(34)
Agassi's vision is literally one in a billion, and it allows him to hit his
ground strokes as hard as he can just about every time. Joyce, whose hand-eye
coordination is superlative, in the top 1 percent of all athletes everywhere
(he's been exhaustively tested), still has to take some incremental bit of
steam off most of his ground strokes if he wants to direct them. I submit that
tennis is the most beautiful sport there is,35 and also the most demanding. It
requires body control, hand-eye coordination, quickness, flat-out speed,
endurance, and that weird mix of caution and abandon we call courage. It also
requires smarts. Just one single shot in one exchange in one point of a
high-level match is a nightmare of mechanical variables. Given a net that's
three feet high (at the center) and two players in (unrealistically) fixed
positions, the efficacy of one single shot is determined by its angle, depth,
pace, and spin. And each of these determinants is itself determined by still
other variables -- i.e., a shot's depth is determined by the height at which
the ball passes over the net combined with some integrated function of pace
and spin, with the ball's height over the net itself determined by the
player's body position, grip on the racket, height of backswing, and angle of
racket face, as well as the 3-D coordinates through which the racket face
moves during that interval in which the ball is actually on the strings. The
tree of variables and determinants branches out and out, on and on, and then
on much further when the opponent's own position and predilections and the
ballistic features of the ball he's sent you to hit are factored in.(36) No
silicon-based RAM yet existent could compute the expansion of variables for
even a single exchange; smoke would come out of the mainframe. The sort of
thinking involved is the sort that can be done only by a living and highly
conscious entity, and then it can really be done only unconsciously, i.e., by
fusing talent with repetition to such an extent that the variables are
combined and controlled without conscious thought. In other words, serious
tennis is a kind of art.

If you've played tennis at least a little, you probably have some idea how
hard a game it is to play really well. I submit to you that you really have no
idea at all. I know I didn't. And television doesn't really allow you to
appreciate what real top-level players can do -- how hard they're actually
hitting the ball, and with what control and tactical imagination and artistry.
I got to watch Michael Joyce practice several times, right up close, like six
feet and a chain-link fence away. This is a man who, at full run, can hit a
fast-moving tennis ball into a one-foot-square area seventy-eight feet away
over a net, hard. He can do this something like more than go percent of the
time. And this is the world's seventy-ninth-best player, one who has to play
the Montreal quakes.

IT'S NOT JUST THE ATHLETIC ARTISTRY THAT COMPELS interest in tennis at the
professional level. It's also what this level requires -- what it's taken for
the one-hundredth-ranked player in the world to get there, what it takes to
stay, what it would take to rise even higher against other men who've paid the
same price number one hundred has paid.

Americans revere athletic excellence, competitive success, and it's more than
lip service we pay, we vote with our wallets. We'll pay large sums to watch a
truly great athlete; we'll reward him with celebrity and adulation and will
even go so far as to buy products and services he endorses.

But it's better for us not to know the kinds of sacrifices the
professional-grade athlete has made to get so very good at one particular
thing. Oh, we'll invoke lush cliches about the lonely heroism of Olympic
athletes, the pain and analgesia of football, the early rising and hours of
practice and restricted diets, the prefight celibacy, et cetera. But the
actual facts of the sacrifices repel us when we see them: basketball geniuses
who cannot read, sprinters who dope themselves, defensive tackles who shoot up
with bovine hormones until they collapse or explode. We prefer not to consider
closely the shockingly vapid and primitive comments uttered by athletes in
postcontest interviews or to consider what impoverishments in one's mental
life would allow people actually to think the way great athletes seem to
think. Note the way "up close and personal" profiles of professional athletes
strain so hard to find evidence of a rounded human life -- outside interests
and activities, values beyond the sport. We ignore what's obvious, that most
of this straining is farce. It's farce because the realities of top-level
athletics today require an early and total commitment to one area of
excellence. An ascetic focus.(37) A subsumption of almost all other features
of human life to one chosen talent and pursuit. A consent to live in a world
that, like a child's world, is very small.

PLAYING TWO PROFESSIONAL SINGLES MATCHES ON THE same day is almost unheard of,
except in quakes. Michael Joyce's second qualifying round is at 7:30 on
Saturday night. He's playing an Austrian named Julian Knowle, a tall and
cadaverous guy with pointy Kafkan ears. Knowle uses two hands off both
sides(38) and throws his racket when he's mad. The match takes place on Stade
Jarry's Grandstand Court. The smaller Grandstand is more intimate: The box
seats start just a few yards from the court surface, and you're close enough
to see a wen on Joyce's cheek or the abacus of sweat on Herr Knowle's
forehead. The Grandstand could hold maybe forty-eight hundred people, and
tonight there are exactly four human beings in the audience as Michael Joyce
basically beats the ever-living shit out of Julian Knowle, who will be at the
Montreal airport tonight at 1:30 to board a red-eye for a minor-league day
tournament in Poznan, Poland.

During this afternoon's match, Joyce wore a white Fila shirt with
different-colored sleeves. Onto his sleeve is sewn a patch that says POWERBAR;
Joyce is paid $1,000 each time he appears in the media wearing this patch. For
tonight's match, Joyce wears a pinstripe Jim Courier-model Fila shirt with one
red sleeve and one blue sleeve. He has a red bandanna around his head, and as
he begins to perspire in the humidity, his face turns the same color as the
bandanna. It is hard not to find this endearing. Julian Knowle has on an
abstract pastel shirt whose brand is unrecognizable. He has very tall hair,
Knowle does, that towers over his head at near-Beavis altitude and doesn't
diminish or lose its gelled integrity as he perspires.(39) Knowle's shirt,
too, has sleeves of different colors. This seems to be the fashion constant
this year among the qualifiers: sleeve-color asymmetry.

The Joyce-Knowle match takes only slightly more than an hour. This is
including delays caused when Knowle throws his racket and has to go retrieve
it or when Knowle walks around in aimless circles, muttering blackly to
himself in some High German dialect. Knowle's tantrums seem a little contrived
and insincere to me, though, because he rarely loses a point as a result of
doing anything particularly wrong. Here's a typical point in this match: It's
1-4 and 15-30 in the sixth game. Knowle hits a respectable 110-mile-an-hour
slice serve to Joyce's forehand. Joyce returns a very flat, penetrating drive
crosscourt so that Knowle has to stretch and hit his forehand on the run,
something that's not particularly easy to do with a two-handed forehand.
Knowle gets to the forehand and hits a thoroughly respectable shot, heavy with
topspin and landing maybe only a little bit short a few feet behind the
service line, whereupon he reverses direction and starts scrambling back to
get in the middle of the baseline to get ready for his next shot. Joyce, as is
SOP, has moved in on the slightly short ball and takes it on the rise just
after it's bounced, driving a backhand even flatter and harder in the exact
same place he hit his last shot, the spot Knowle is scrambling away from.
Knowle is now forced to reverse direction and get back to where he was. This
he does, and he gets his racket on the ball, but only barely, sending back a
weak little USDA Prime loblet that Joyce, now in the vicinity of the net, has
little trouble blocking into the open court for a winner. The four people
clap, Knowle's racket goes spinning into the blood-colored tarp, and Joyce
walks expressionlessly back to the deuce court to receive again whenever
Knowle gets around to serving. Knowle has slightly more firepower than the
first round's Brakus: His ground strokes are formidable, probably even lethal
if he has sufficient time to get to the ball and get set up. Joyce simply
denies him that time. Joyce will later admit that he wasn't working all that
hard in this match, and he doesn't need to. He hits few spectacular winners,
but he also makes very few unforced errors, and his shots are designed to make
the somewhat clumsy Knowle move a lot and to deny him the time and the peace
ever to set up his game. This strategy is one that Knowle cannot solve or
interdict: He has the firepower but not the speed to do so. This may be one
reason why Joyce is unaffronted by having to play the quakes for Montreal.
Barring some kind of major injury or neurological seizure, he's not going to
lose to somebody like Austria's Julian Knowle -- Joyce is simply on a
different plane than the mass of these quake players.

The idea that there can be wholly distinct levels to competitive tennis --
levels so distinct that what's being played is in essence a whole different
game -- might seem to you weird and hyperbolic. I have played probably just
enough tennis to understand that it's true. I have played against men who were
on a whole different, higher plateau than I, and I have understood on the
deepest and most humbling level the impossibility of beating them, of "solving
their game." Knowle is technically entitled to be called a professional, but
he is playing a fundamentally different grade of tennis from Michael Joyce's,
one constrained by limitations Joyce does not have. I feel like I could get on
a tennis court with Julian Knowle. He would beat me, perhaps handily, but I
don't feel like it would be absurd for me to occupy the same
seventy-eight-by-twenty-seven-foot rectangle as he. The idea of me playing
Joyce -- or even hitting around with him, which was one of the ideas I was
entertaining on the flight to Montreal -- is now revealed to me to be in a
certain way obscene, and I resolve not even to let Joyce(40) know that I used
to play competitive tennis, and (I'd presumed) rather well. This makes me sad.

THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT MICHAEL JOYCE AND THE REalities of the tour, not me. But
since a big part of my experience of the Canadian Open and its players was one
of sadness, it might be worthwhile to spend a little time letting you know
where I'm coming from vis-a-vis these players. As a young person, I played
competitive junior tennis, traveling to tournaments all over the Midwest, the
region that the United States Tennis Association has in its East Coast wisdom
designated the "western" region. Most of my best friends were also tennis
players, and on a regional level we were successful, and we thought of
ourselves as extremely good players. Tennis and our proficiency at it were
tremendously important to us -- a serious junior gives up a lot of his time
and freedom to develop his game,(41) and it can very easily come to constitute
a big part of his identity and self-worth. The other fourteen-year-old Midwest
hotshots and I knew that our fishpond was somehow limited; we knew that there
was a national level of play and that there were hotshots and champions at
that level. But levels and plateaus beyond our own seemed abstract, somehow
unreal -- those of us who were the best in our region literally could not
imagine players our own age who were substantially better than we.

A child's world tends to be very small. If I'd been just a little bit better,
an actual regional champion, I would have gotten to see that there were
fourteen-year-olds in the United States playing a level of tennis unlike
anything I knew about.

My own game as a junior was a particular type of the classic defensive style,
a strategy Martin Amis once described as "craven retrieval." I didn't hit the
ball all that hard, but I rarely made unforced errors, and I was fast, and my
general approach was simply to keep hitting the ball back to my opponent until
my opponent fucked up and either made an unforced error or hit a ball so short
and juicy that even I could hit a winner off it. It doesn't look like a very
glorious or even interesting way to play, now that I see it here in bald
retrospective print, but it was interesting to me, and you'd be surprised how
effective it was (on the level at which I was competing, at least). At age
twelve, a good competitive player will still generally miss after four or five
balls (mostly because he'll get impatient or grandiose). At age sixteen, a
good player will generally keep the ball in play for more like seven or eight
shots before he misses. At the collegiate level, too, opponents were stronger
than junior players but not markedly more consistent, and if I could keep a
rally going to seven or eight shots, I could usually win the point on the
other guy's mistake.(42)

I still play -- not competitively, but seriously -- and I should confess that
deep down inside, I still consider myself an extremely good tennis player,
very hard to beat. Before coming to Montreal to watch Michael Joyce, I'd seen
professional tennis only on television, which, as has been noted, does not
give the viewer a very accurate picture of how good pros are. I thus further
confess that I arrived in Montreal with some dim unconscious expectation that
these professionals -- at least the obscure ones, the nonstars -- wouldn't be
all that much better than I. I don't mean to imply that I'm insane: I was
ready to concede that age, a nasty ankle injury in 1988, and a penchant for
nicotine (and worse) meant that I wouldn't be able to compete physically with
a young unhurt professional, but on TV (while eating junk and smoking), I'd
seen pros whacking balls at each other that didn't look to be moving
substantially faster than the balls I'd hit. In other words, I arrived at my
first professional tournament with the pathetic deluded pride that attends
ignorance. And I have been brought up sharply. I do not play and never have
played even the same game as these qualifiers.

The craven game I'd spent so much of my youth perfecting would not work
against these guys. For one thing, pros simply do not make unforced errors --
or, at any rate they make them so rarely that there's no way they are going to
make the four unforced errors in seven points necessary for me to win a game.
For another thing, they will take any ball that doesn't have simply ferocious
depth and pace on it and -- given even a fractional moment to line up a shot
-- hit a winner off it. For yet another thing, their own shots have such
ferocious depth and pace that there's no way I'd be able to hit more than a
couple of them back at any one time. I could not meaningfully exist on the
same court with these obscure, hungry players. Nor could you. And it's not
just a matter of talent or practice. There's something else.

ONCE THE MAIN DRAW STARTS, YOU GET TO LOOK UP close and live at name tennis
players you're used to seeing only as arrays of pixels. One of the highlights
of Tuesday's second round of the main draw is getting to watch Agassi play
MaliVai Washington. Washington, the most successful U. S. black man on the
tour since Arthur Ashe, is unseeded at the Canadian Open but has been ranked
as high as number eleven in the world and is dangerous, and since I loathe
Agassi with a passion, it's an exciting match. Agassi looks scrawny and faggy
and, with his shaved skull and beret-ish hat and black shoes and socks and
patchy goatee, like somebody just released from reform school (a look you can
tell he's carefully decided on with the help of various paid image
consultants). Washington, who's in dark-green shorts and a shirt with
dark-green sleeves, was a couple of years ago voted by People magazine one of
the Fifty Prettiest Human Beings or something, and on TV is real pretty but in
person is awesome. From twenty yards away, he looks less like a human being
than like a Michelangelo anatomy sketch: his upper body the V of serious
weight lifting, his leg muscles standing out even in repose, his biceps little
cannonballs of fierce-looking veins. He's beautiful and doomed, because the
slowness of the Stadium Court makes it impractical for anybody but a
worldclass net man to rush the net against Agassi, and Washington is not a net
man but a power-baseliner. He stays back and trades ground strokes with
Agassi, and even though the first set goes to a tiebreaker, you can tell it's
a mismatch. Agassi has less mass and flat-out speed than Washington, but he
has timing and vision that give his ground strokes way more pace. He can stay
back and hit nuclear ground strokes and force Washington until Washington
eventually makes a fatal error. There are two ways to make an error against
Agassi: The first is the standard way, hitting it out or into the net; the
second is to hit anything shorter than a couple of feet inside the baseline,
because anything that Agassi can move up on, he can hit for a winner. Agassi's
facial expression is the slightly smug self-aware one of somebody who's used
to being looked at and who automatically assumes the minute he shows up
anywhere that everybody's looking at him. He's incredible to see play in
person, but his domination of Washington doesn't make me like him any better;
it's more like it chills me, as if I'm watching the devil play.

Television tends to level everybody out and make everyone seem kind of blandly
good-looking, but at Montreal it turns out that a lot of the pros and stars
are interesting- or even downright funny-looking. Jim Courier, former number
one but now waning and seeded tenth here,43 looks like Howdy Doody in a hat on
TV but here turns out to be a very big boy -- the "Guide Media" lists him at
175 pounds, but he's way more than that, with big smooth muscles and the gait
and expression of a Mafia enforcer. Michael Chang, twenty-three and number
five in the world, sort of looks like two different people stitched crudely
together: a normal upper body perched atop hugely muscular and totally
hairless legs. He has a mushroom-shaped head, inky-black hair, and an
expression of deep and intractable unhappiness, as unhappy a face as I've seen
outside a graduate creative-writing program.(44) Pete Sampras is mostly teeth
and eyebrows in person and has unbelievably hairy legs and forearms -- hair in
the sort of abundance that allows me confidently to bet that he has hair on
his back and is thus at least not 100 percent blessed and graced by the
universe. Goran Ivanisevic is large and tan and surprisingly good-looking, at
least for a Croat; I always imagine Croats looking ravaged and emaciated, like
somebody out of a Munch lithograph -- except for an incongruous and wholly
absurd bowl haircut that makes him look like somebody in a Beatles tribute
band. It's Ivanisevic who will beat Joyce in three sets in the main draw's
second round. Czech former top-ten Petr Korda is another clastic-looking
mismatch: At six three and 160, he has the body of an upright greyhound and
the face of -- eerily, uncannily -- a freshly hatched chicken (plus soulless
eyes that reflect no light and seem to see only in the way that fishes' and
birds' eyes see).

And Wilander is here -- Mats Wilander, Borg's heir and top-ten at eighteen,
number one at twenty-four, now thirty and basically unranked and trying to
come back after years off the tour, here cast in the role of the wily mariner,
winning on smarts. Tuesday's best big-name match is between Wilander and
Stefan Edberg, twenty-eight and Wilander's own heir(45) and now married to
Annette Olsen, Wilander's SO during his glory days, which adds a delicious
personal cast to the match, which Wilander wins 6-4 in the third. Wilander
ends up getting all the way to the semifinals before Agassi beats him as badly
as I have ever seen one professional beat another professional, the score
being 6-2, 6-0, and the match not nearly as close as the score would indicate.

Even more illuminating than watching pro tennis live is watching it with Sam
Aparicio. Watching tennis with him is like watching a movie with somebody who
knows a lot about the technical aspects of film: He helps you see things you
can't see alone. It turns out, for example, that there are whole geometric
sublevels of strategy in a power-baseline game, all dictated by various PBers'
strengths and weaknesses. A PBer depends on being able to hit winners from the
baseline. But, as Sam teaches me to see, Michael Chang can hit winners only at
an acute angle from either corner. An "inside-out" player like Jim Courier,
though, can hit winners only at obtuse angles from the center out. Hence, wily
and well-coached players tend to play Chang "down the middle" and Courier "out
wide." One of the things that make Agassi so good is that he's capable of
hitting winners from anywhere on the court -- he has no geometric restriction.
Joyce, too, according to Sam, can hit a winner at any angle. He just doesn't
do it quite as well as Agassi, or as often.

Michael Joyce in close-up, viewed eating supper or riding in a courtesy car,
looks slighter and younger than he does on-court. Close-up, he looks his age,
which to me is basically that of a fetus. Michael Joyce's interests outside
tennis consist mostly of big-budget movies and genre novels of the
commercial-paperback sort that one reads on airplanes. He has a tight and
long-standing group of friends back home in L. A., but one senses that most of
his personal connections have been made via tennis. He's dated some. It's
impossible to tell whether he's a virgin. It seems staggering and impossible,
but my sense is that he might be. Then again, I tend to idealize and distort
him, I know, because of how I feel about what he can do on a tennis court. His
most revealing sexual comment was made in the context of explaining the odd
type of confidence that keeps him from freezing up in a match in front of
large crowds or choking on a point when there's lots of money at stake.(46)
Joyce, who usually needs to pause about five beats to think before he answers
a question, thinks the confidence is partly a matter of temperament and partly
a function of hard work and practice.

"If I'm in like a bar, and there's a really good-looking girl, I might be kind
of nervous. But if there's like a thousand gorgeous girls in the stands when
I'm playing, it's a different story. I'm not nervous then, when I play,
because I know what I'm doing. I know what to do out there." Maybe it's good
to let these be his last quoted words.

Whether or not he ends up in the top ten and a name anybody will know, Michael
Joyce will remain a paradox. The restrictions on his life have been, in my
opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the
radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to
become a transcendent practitioner of an art -- something few of us get to be.
They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us
do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not
choking, et cetera).

Joyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way.
But he wants more. He 'wants to be the best, to have his name known, to hold
professional trophies over his head as he patiently turns in all four
directions for the media. He wants this and will pay to have it -- to pursue
it, let it define him -- and will pay up with the regretless cheer of a man
for whom issues of choice became irrelevant a long time ago. Already, for
Joyce, at twenty-two, it's too late for anything else; he's invested too much,
is in too deep. I think he's both lucky and unlucky. He will say he is happy
and mean it. Wish him well. (1) With footnotes. (1) Comprising Washington, D.
C., Montreal, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, New Haven, and Long
Island, this possibly the most grueling part of the yearly ATP Tour (as the
erstwhile Association of Tennis Professionals Tour is now officially known),
with three digit temperatures and the cement courts shimmering like Moroccan
horizons and everyone wearing a hat and even the spectators carrying sweat
towels. (2) Joyce lost that final to Thomas Enqvist, now ranked in the ATP's
top twenty and a potential superstar and in high-profile attendance here in
Montreal. (3) Tarango, twenty-seven, who completed three years at Stanford is
regarded as something of a scholar by Joyce and the other young Americans on
tour. His little bio in the 1995 ATP Tour Player Guide lists his interests as
including "philosophy, creative writing, and bridge," and his slight build and
receding hairline do in fact make him look more like an academic or a tax
attorney than a world-class tennis player Also a native Californian, he's a
friend and something of a mentor to Michael Joyce, whom he practices with
regularly and addresses as "Grasshopper." Joyce--who seems to like pretty much
everybody--likes Jeff Tarango and won't comment on his on-court explosion at
Wimbledon except to say that Tarango is "a very intense guy, very
intellectual, that gets kind of paranoid sometimes." (4) An economical way to
be a tournament sponsor: supply free stuff to the tournament and put your name
on it in really big letters. All the courts' tall umpire chairs have signs
that say TROPICANA; all the bins for fresh and unfresh towels say WAMSUTTA;
the dunk coolers at courtside (the size of trash barrels, with clear plastic
lids) say TROPICANA and EVIAN. Those players who don't individually endorse a
certain brand of drink tend, as a rule, to drink Evian, orange juice being a
bit heavy for on-court rehydration. (5) Most of the girlfriends have something
indefinable about them that suggests extremely wealthy parents whom the girls
are pissing off by hooking up with an obscure professional tennis player. (6)
Except for the four in the Grand Slam--Wimbledon and the U. S., French, and
Australian opens--no tournament draws all the top players, although every
tournament would obviously like to, since the more top players are entered,
the better the paid attendance and the more media exposure the tournament gets
for itself and its sponsors. Players in the top twenty or so, though, tend to
play a comparatively light schedule of tournaments, taking time off not only
for rest and training but to compete in wildly lucrative exhibitions that
don't affect ATP ranking. (We're talking wildly lucrative, like millions of
dollars per annum for the top stars.) Given the sharp divergence of interests
between tournaments and players, it's not surprising that there are Kafkanly
complex rules for how many ATP tournaments a player must enter each year to
avoid financial or ranking-related penalties, and commensurately complex and
crafty ways players have for getting around these rules and doing pretty much
what they want. These will be passed over. The thing to realize is that
players of Michael Joyce's station tend to take way less time off; they play
just about every tournament they can squeeze in and get L to unless they're
forced by injury or exhaustion to sit out a couple of weeks. This is because
they need to, not just financially but because under the ATP's (very complex)
set of algorithms for determining ranking, most players fare better the more
tournaments they enter. (7) There is here no qualifying tournament for the
quakes themselves, though some particularly huge tournaments have metaqualies.
The quakes also have a number of wild-card berths, most of which here are
given to Canadian players, like the collegiate legend whom Michael Joyce is
beating the shit out of right now in the first round. (8) These places are
usually right near the top seeds, which is the reason why in the televised
first rounds of major tournaments you usually see Agassi or Sampras beating
the shit out of some totally obscure guy--that guy's usually a qualifier. It's
also part of why it's so hard for somebody low-ranked enough to have to play
the quakes to move up in the rankings enough that he doesn't have to play
quakes anymore--he usually meets a high-ranked player in the very first round
and gets smeared. (9) Another reason qualifiers usually get smeared by the top
players they face in the early rounds is that the qualifier is playing his
fourth or fifth match in three days, while the top player usually has had a
couple of days with his masseur or creative-visualization consultant to get
ready for the first round. Michael Joyce details all these asymmetries and
stacked odds the way a farmer speaks of weather, with an absence of emotion
that seems deep instead of blank. (10) Pronounced kry-chek. (11) Pronounced
ya-kob hla-sick, if that helps. (12) Joyce is even more impressive, but I
hadn't seen Joyce yet. And Enqvist is even more impressive than Joyce, and
Agassi is even more impressive than Enqvist. After the week was over, I truly
understood why Charlton Heston looks gray and ravaged on his descent from
Sinai: Past a certain point, impressiveness is corrosive to the psyche. (13)
During his two daily one-hour practice sessions, he wears the hat backward and
also wears boxy plaid shorts that look for all the world like swim trunks. His
favorite practice T-shirt has FEAR: THE ENEMY OF DREAMS on the chest. He
laughs a lot when he practices. You can tell just by looking at him out there
that he's totally likable and cool. (14) If you've played only casually, it is
probably hard to understand how physically demanding really serious tennis is.
Realizing that these pros can move one another from one end of the
twenty-seven-foot baseline to the other pretty much at will and that they
hardly ever end a point early by making an unforced error might help your
imagination. A close best-of three-set match is probably equivalent in its
demands to a couple of hours of full-court basketball, but we're talking
serious basketball. (15) Something else you don't get a good sense of on
television: Tennis is a very sweaty game. On ESPN or whatever, when you see a
player walk over to the ball boy after a point and request a towel and quickly
wipe his arm and hand off and toss the wet towel back to the (rather luckless)
ball boy, most of the time the towel thing isn't a stall or a meditative
pause--it's done because sweat is running down the inside of the player's arm
in such volume that it's getting all over his hand and making the racket
slippery. Especially on the sizzling North American summer junket, players
sweat through their shirts early on and sometimes also their shorts. And they
drink enormous amounts of water--staggering amounts. I thought I was seeing
things at first, watching matches, as players seemed to go through one of
those skinny half-lifer Evian bottles every second side change, but Michael
Joyce confirmed it. Pro-grade tennis players seem to have evolved a metabolic
system that allows rapid absorption of water and its transformation into
sweat. (Most players I spoke with confirmed, by the way, that Gatorade and
All-Sport and Boost and all those pricey sports drinks are mostly bullshit,
that salt and cartes at table and small lakes of daily [H.sub.

2]O are the way to go. The players who didn't confirm this turned out to be
players who had endorsement deals with some pricey-sports-drink manufacturer,
but I personally saw at least one such player dumping out his bottled pricey
electrolytic contents and replacing them with good old water for his match.)
(16) The taller you are, the harder you can serve (get a protractor and figure
it out), but the less able to bend and reverse direction you are. Tall guys
tend to be serve-and-volleyers, and they live and die by their serves. Bill
Tilden, Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Roscoe Tanner, and Goran Ivanisevic were/are
all tall guys with serve-dependent games. And so on. (17) This is
mind-bogglingly hard to do when the ball's hit hard. If we can assume you've
played Little League or sandlot ball or something, imagine the hardest-hit
grounder of all time coming at you at shortstop, and you not standing and
waiting to try to knock it down but actually of your own free will running
forward toward the grounder, then trying not just to catch it in a big glove
but to strike it hard and reverse its direction and send it someplace
frightfully specific and very far away--this comes close. (18) Joyce could
have gone to college, but if he'd gone to college, it would have been
primarily to play tennis. Coaches at major universities apparently offered
Joyce inducements to come play for them so literally outrageous and incredible
that I wouldn't repeat them here even if Joyce hadn't asked me not to.

The reason Michael Joyce would have gone to college primarily to play tennis
'is that the academic and social aspects of collegiate life interest him about
as much as hitting twenty-five hundred crosscourt forehands while a coach
yells at you in foreign languages would interest you. Tennis is what Michael
Joyce loves and lives for and is. He sees little point in telling anybody
anything different It's the only thing he's devoted himself to, and he's
devoted massive amounts of himself to it, and, as far as he understands it,
it's all he wants to do or be involved in. Because he started playing at age
two and playing competitively at age seven and had the first half-dozen years
of his career directed rather, shall we say, forcefully and enthusiastically
by his father (who Joyce estimates spent probably around $250,000 on lessons
and court time and equipment and travel during Michael's junior career), it's
perhaps reasonable to ask Joyce to what extent he chose to devote himself to
tennis. Can you choose something when you are forcefully and enthusiastically
immersed in it at an age when the resources and information necessary for
choosing are not yet yours?

Joyce's response to this line of inquiry strikes me as both unsatisfactory and
totally satisfactory. Because of course the question is unanswerable, or at
least it's unanswerable by a person who's already--as far as he understands
it--chosen. Joyce's answer is that it doesn't really matter much to him
whether he originally "chose" serious tennis or not; all he knows is that he
loves it. He tries to explain the U. S. juniors, which he won in 1991: "You
get there and look at the draw; it's a 128 draw--there's so many guys you have
to beat. And then it's all over and you've won, you're the national
champion--there's nothing like it. I get chills even talking about it." Or
just the previous week in Washington: "I'm playing Agassi, and it's great
tennis, and there's like thousands of fans going nuts. I can't describe the
feeling. Where else could I get that?

What he says is understandable, but it's not the satisfactory part of the
answer The satisfactory part is the way Joyce's face looks when he talks about
what tennis means to him. He loves it--you can see this in his face when he
talks about it: His eyes normally have a kind of Asiatic cast because of the
slight epicanthic fold common to ethnic Irishmen, but when he speaks of tennis
and his career, the eyes get round and the pupils dilate and the look in them
is one of love. The love is not the love one feels for a job or a lover or any
of the loci of intensity that most of us choose to call the things we love.
It's the sort of love you see in the eyes of really old people who've been
married for an incredibly long time or in religious people who are so
religious, they've devoted their whole lives to religious stuff It's the sort
of love whose measure is what it's cost, what one's given up for it. Whether
there's "choice" involved is, at a certain point, of no interest . . . since
it's the surrender of choice and self that informs the love in the first
place. (19) Aka serve-and-volley; see immediately supra. (20) I don't know
whether you know this, but Connors had one of the most eccentric games in the
history of tennis--he was an aggressive "power" player who rarely came to net,
had the serve of an ectomorphic girl, and hit everything totally spinless and
flat (which is inadvisable on ground strokes because the absence of spin makes
the ball so hard to control). His game was all the more strange because the
racket he generated all his firepower from the baseline with was a Wilson
T200O, a ward steel thing chat's one of the single shittiest tennis rackets
ever made and is regarded by most serious players as useful only for home
defense or prying large rocks out of your backyard or something. Connors was
addicted to this racket and kept using it long after Wilson stopped even
making it, and he forfeited millions in potential endorsement money by doing
so. Connors was also eccentric (and kind of repulsive) in lots of other ways,
too, none of which are germane to this article. (21) In the yore days before
wide-body ceramic rackets and scientific strength mining, the only two venues
for hitting winners used to be the volley--where your decreased distance from
the net allowed for greatly increased angle (get that protractor out)--and the
defensive passing shot, i.e., in the tactical language of boxing, "punch"
versus "counterpunch." The new power-baseline game allows a player, in effect,
to punch his opponent all the way from his stool in the corner; it changes
absolutely everything, and the analytic geometry of these changes would look
like the worst calculus final you ever had in your life. (22) This is one
reason why the phenomenon of "breaking serve" in a set is so much less
important when a match involves power-baseliners. It is one reason why so many
older players and fans no longer like to watch pro tennis as much: The
structural tactics of the game are now ineluctably different from when they
played. (23) A trademark of the Wichita, Kans., Koch Materials Company, "a
leader in asphalt-emulsions technology." (24) John McEnroe wasn't all that
tall, and he was arguably the best serve-and-volley man of all time, but then
McEnroe was an exception to pretty much every predictive norm there was. At
his peak (say 1980 to 1984), he was the greatest tennis player who ever
lived--the most talented, the most beautiful, the most tormented: a genius.
For me, watching McEnroe don a blue polyester blazer and do stiff lame
truistic color commentary for TV is like watching Faulkner do a Gap ad. (25)
One answer to why public interest in men's tennis has been on the wane in
recent years is an essential and unpretty thugishness about the power-baseline
style that's become dominant on the tour Watch Agassi closely sometime for so
small a man and so great a player, he's amazingly absent of finesse, with
movements that look more like a heavy-metal musician's than an athlete's.

The power-baseline game itself has been compared to metal or grunge. But what
a top PBer really resembles is film of the old Soviet Union putting down a
rebellion. It's awesome, but brutally so, with a grinding, faceless quality
about its power that renders that power curiously dull and empty. (26) Compare
Ivanisevic's at 136 miles per hour or Sampras's at 132 or even this Brakus
kid's at 118. (27) The loop in a pro's backswing is kind of the trademark
flourish of excellence and consciousness of same, not unlike the five-star
chef's quick kiss of his own fingertips as he presents a piece or the
magician's hand making a French curl in the air as he directs our attention to
his vanished assistant. (28) All serious players have these little extraneous
tics, stylistic fingerprints, and the pros even more so because of years of
repetition and ingraining. Pros'tics have always been fun to note and chart,
even just e.g. on the serve. Watch the way Sampras's lead foot rises from the
heel on his toss, as if his left foot's toes got suddenly hot. The odd
Tourettic way Gerulaitis used to whip his head from side to side while
bouncing the ball before his toss, as if he were having a small seizure.
McEnroe's weird splayed stiff-armed service stance, both feet parallel to the
baseline and his side so severely to the net that he looked like a figure on
an Egyptian frieze. The odd sudden shrug Lendl gives before releasing his
toss. The way Agassi shies his weight several times from foot to foot as he
bounces before the toss like he needs desperately to pee. Or, here at the
Canadian Open, the way the young star Thomas Enqvist's body bends queerly back
as he tosses, limboing away from the toss, as if for a moment the ball smelled
very bad. This tic derives from Enqvist's predecessor Edberg's own weird
spinal arch and twist on the toss. Edberg also has this strange sudden way of
switching his hold on the racket in mid-toss, changing from an eastern
forehand to an extreme backhand grip, as if the racket were a skillet. (29)
Who looks a bit like a Hispanic Dustin Hoffman and is an almost unbelievably
nice guy, with the sort of inward self-suffficiency of truly great teachers
and coaches everywhere, with the Zen-like blend of focus and calm developed by
people who have to spend enormous amounts of time sitting in one place
watching closely while somebody else does something. Sam gets m percent of
Joyce's gross revenues and spends his time in airports reading gigantic tomes
on Mayan architecture and is one of the coolest people I've ever met either
inside the tennis world or outside it (so cool I'm kind of scared of him and
haven't called him once since the assignment ended, if that makes sense). In
return, Sam travels with Joyce, rooms with him, coaches him, supervises his
training, analyzes matches with him, and attends him in practice, even to the
extent of picking up errant balls so that Joyce doesn't have to spend part of
his tightly organized practice time picking up errant balls. The stress and
weird loneliness of pro tennis, where everybody's in the same community and
sees one another every week but is constantly on the diasporic move and is one
another's rival, with enormous amounts of money at stake and life essentially
a montage of airports and bland hotels and non-home-cooked food and courtesy
cars and nagging injuries and staggering long-distance bills, and with
people's families back home tending to be wackos, since only wackos would make
the financial and temporal sacrifices necessary to let their offspring become
good enough at something to turn pro at it--all this means that most players
lean heavily on their coaches for emotional support and friendship as well as
technical counsel. Sam's role with Joyce looks to me to approximate what in
the latter century was called that of "companion," those older ladies who
traveled with nubile women when they traveled abroad. (30) Agassi's balls look
more like Borg's balls would have looked if Borg had been on a yearlong
regimen of both steroids and methamphetamines and was hitting every single
fucking ball just as hard as he could. Agassi hits his ground strokes as hard
as anybody who's ever played tennis--so hard you almost can't believe it in
person. (31) But Agassi does have this exaggerated follow-through in which he
keeps both hands on the racket and follows through almost like a hitter in
baseball, which causes his shirtfront to lift and his hairy tummy to be
exposed to public view--in Montreal I find this repellent, though the females
in the stands around me seem ready to live and die for a glimpse of Agassi's
tummy Agassi's significant other, Brooke Shields, is in Montreal, by the way,
and will end up highly visible in the player-guest box for all Agassi's
matches, wearing big sunglasses and what look to be multiple hats. This may be
the place to insert that Brooke Shields is rather a lot taller than Agassi and
considerably less hairy, and that seeing them standing together in person is
rather like seeing Sigourney Weaver on the arm of Danny DeVito. The effect is
especially surreal when Brooke is wearing one of the plain, classy sundresses
that make her look like a deb summering in the Hamptons and Agassi's wearing
his new Nike on-court ensemble, a blue-black horizontally striped outfit that
together with his black sneakers makes him look like somebody's idea of a
French Resistance fighter (Since we all enjoy celeb stuff, this might also be
the place to insert an unkind but true observation. Up close in person, Brooke
Shields is in fact extremely pretty, but she is not at all sexy. Her eyebrows
are actually not nearly as thick bushy as Groucho's or Brezhnev's, but she's
incredibly tall, and her posture's not all that great, and her prettiness is
that sort of computer-enhanced-looking prettiness that is resoundingly unsexy.
To find somebody sexy, I think you actually have to be able to imagine having
sex with them, and something intrinsically remote and artificial about Brooke
Shields makes it possible to imagine jacking off to a picture of her but not
to imagine actually having sex with her.) (32) Some tennis writer somewhere
observed of Michael Chang that whereas all pros up at net will run back to
retrieve a lob placed over their heads, Chang is the only pro known sometimes
to run back and retrieve passing shots. (33) Though note that very few of them
wear eyeglasses, either (34) A whole other kind of vision--the kind attributed
to Larry Bird in basketball, sometimes, when he's made those incredible
surgical passes to people who nobody else could even see were open--is
required when you're hitting: This involves seeing the other side of the
court--where your opponent is and which direction he's moving in and what
possible angles are open to you in consequence of where he's going. The
schizoid thing about tennis is that you have to use both kinds of vision--ball
and court--at the same time. (35) Basketball comes close, but it's a team
sport and lacks tennis's primal mano a mano intensity Boxing might come close
at least at the lighter weight divisions -- but the actual physical damage the
fighters inflict on each other makes it too concretely brutal to be really
beautiful -- a level of abstraction and formality (i.e., "play") is necessary
for a sport to possess true metaphysical beauty (in my opinion). (36) For
those of you into business stats, the calculus of a shot in tennis would be
rather like establishing a running compound-interest expansion in a case in
which not only is the rate of interest itself variable and not only are the
determinants of that rate variable and not only is the amount of time during
which the determinants influence the interest rate variable, but the principal
itself is variable. (37) Sex and substance issues notwithstanding,
professional athletes are our culture's holy men: They give themselves over to
a pursuit, endure great privation and pain to actualize themselves at it, and
enjoy a relationship to "excellence" and "perfection" that we admire

and reward (the monk's begging bowl, the RBI guru's eight-figure contract) and
like to watch, even though we have no inclination to walk that road ourselves
In other words, they do it for us, sacrifice themselves for our redemption.
(38) Meaning a two-handed forehand, whose pioneer was a South African named
Frew McMillan and whose most famous practitioner today is Monica Seles. (39)
The idea of what it would be like to perspire heavily with huge amounts of gel
in your hair is sufficiently horrific to me that I approached Knowle after the
match to ask him about it, only to discover that neither he nor his coach
spoke enough English -- or even French -- to be able to determine who I was,
and the whole sweat-and-gel issue will, I'm afraid, remain a matter for your
own imagination. (40) Who is clearly such a fundamentally nice guy that he
would probably hit around with me for a little while just out of politeness,
since for him it would be at worst a little bit dull. For me, though, it would
be, as I said, a lithe obscene. (41) The example of Michael Joyce's childhood,
though, shows me that we were comparative sluggards, dilettantes. He described
his daily schedule: "I'd be in school till 2:00. Then, after, I'd go [driven
by father] to the [West End Racquet] Club [in Torrance, California] and have a
lesson with [legendary, wildly expensive and unbelievably hard-ass Robert]
Lansdorp [former childhood coach of, among others, Tracy Austin] from 3:00 to
4:00. Then I'd have drills from 4:00 to 6:00, then we'd drive all the way home
-- it's like half an hour -- and I'm like, `Thank God, I can finally watch TV
or go up and talk with [my friends] on the phone or something,' but Dad is
like, 'You didn't practice your serve yes.' At twelve or thirteen [years old],
you're not going to want to do it. [No lie, since two hours of serious dulls
alone were enough to put me in a fetal position for the rest of the day] You
need somebody to make you do it. But then, after like a hundred or so serves,
I start to get into it [standing by himself out in the Joyces' tennis court in
their backyard with a huge bucket of balls and hitting serve after serve to no
one in the gathering twilight], I like it -- I'm glad I'm doing it." (42) An
important variable I'm skipping is that children are (not surprisingly)
immature and tend to get angry with themselves when they fuck up, and so a key
part of my strategy involved putting the opponent in a position where he made
a lot of unforced errors and got madder and madder at himself, which would
ruin his game: Feelings of self disgust at his errors or (even better for me)
bitter grievance at the universe for making him have "bad luck" or an "off
day" would mount until, usually by sometime in the second set, he'd sink into
a kind of enraged torpor and expect to miss or occasionally even have a kind
of grand Learesque tantrum, complete with racket hurling and screamed
obscenities and sometimes tears. This happened less and less as I got older
and opponents got more mature, and by the time I was in college, only genuine
head cases could be counted on to get so mad that they'd basically make
themselves lose to an inferior player It's something of a shock, then, to
watch Joyce do to his third-round opponent what I used to do to
twelve-year-old rich kids, which is essentially to retrieve and avoid errors
and wait for this opponent to have a temper tantrum. Because Sunday was a
rain-out, Joyce's third round is played Monday at 10:00 A.M., at the same time
that some of the main draw's first rounds are beginning Joyce's opponent is a
guy named Mark Knowles, twenty-three, a 1986 U. S. junior indoor champion, a
native of the Bahamas, now known primarily as a doubles player but still a
serious opponent, ranked in the world's top two hundred, somebody on Joyce's
plateau.

Knowles is tall and thin -- muscular in the corded way tall thin people are
muscular -- and has an amazing tan and tight blond curls and from a distance
is an impressive-looking guy, though up close he has a kind of squished buggy
face and the slightly bulging eyes of a player who is spring-loaded on a
tantrum. There's a chance to see Knowles up close because he and Joyce play
their match on one of the minor courts, where spectators stand and lean over a
low fence only a few yards from the court. I and Joyce's coach and Knowles's
coach and beautiful girlfriend are the only people really seriously standing
and watching, though a lot of spectators on their way to more high-profile
matches pass by and stop and watch a few points before moving on. The constant
movement of civilians past the court aggrieves Knowles no end, and sometimes
he shouts caustic things to people who've started walking away while a point
is still in progress.

"Don't worry about it!" is one thing Knowles shouted at somebody who moved.
"We're only playing for money! We're only professionals! Don't give it a
second thought!' Joyce, preparing to serve, will stare affectlessly straight
ahead while he waits for Knowles to finish yelling, his expression sort of the
one Vegas dealers have when a player they're cleaning out is rude or abusive:
a patient and unjudging look whose expression is informed by the fact that
they're being extremely well compensated for being patient and unjudging.

Joyce's coach describes Knowles as brilliant but kind of erratic," and I think
the coach is being kind, because Knowles seems to me to belong on a locked
ward for people with serious emotional and personality disorders. He rants and
throws and screams scatological curses I haven't heard since junior high. If
one of his shots hits the top of the net cord and bounces back, Knowles will
scream, ''I must be the luckiest guy in the world!"-his eyes protruding and
mouth twisted. For me, he's an eerie echo of all the rich and well-instructed
Midwest kids I used to play and beat because they d be unable to eat the
frustration when things didn't go their way He seems not to notice that Joyce
gets as many bad breaks and weird bounces as he, or that passing spectators
are equally distracting to both players. I have a hard time believing that
someone this off-in-the-wall could rise to a serious pro plateau though it's
true that when Knowles isn't letting his attention get scattered, he's a
gorgeous player, with fluid strokes and marvelous touch and control over spin
and pace. His read on Joyce is that Joyce is a slugger (which is true), and
his tactic is to try to junk him up -- change pace, vary spins, hit drop shots
to draw Joyce in, deny Joyce pace or routine -- and because he's Joyce's equal
in firepower, the tactic is sound. Joyce wins the first set in a tiebreaker
But three times in the tiebreaker, Knowles yells at migratory spectators:
"Don't worry! It's only a tiebreaker in a professional match!" and is
basically a wreck by the time the first set is over, and the second set is
perfunctory, a formality that Joyce concludes as fast as possible before he
hurries back to the prayers' tent to pack carbohydrates and find out whether
he has to play his first round in the main draw later this same day. (43) He
will lose badly to Michael Stich in the round of sixteen here, the same Stich
Michael Joyce beat at the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne four months
before; in fact, Joyce will himself beat Courier in straight sets the next
week, at the Infiniti Open in Los Angeles, in front of family and friends, for
one (44) Chang's mother is here one of the most infamous of the dreaded Tennis
Parents of the men's and women's tours, a woman who's reliably rumored to have
reached down her child's shorts in public to check his underwear -- and her
attendance (she's seated hierophantically in the player-guest boxes courtside)
may have something to do with the staggering woe of Chang's mien and play
Thomas Enqvist ends up beating him badly in the quarterfinals on Friday
(Enqvist, by the way, looks eerily like a young Richard Chamberlain -- the
Richard Chamberlain of the Towering Inferno, say, with that narrow, sort of
rodentially patrician quality. The best thing about him is his girlfriend, who
wears glasses and, when applauding a good point, sort of hops up and down in
her seat with refreshing uncoolness.) (45) As Enqvist appears to be Edberg's .
. . Swedish tennis tends to be like monarchic succession: The Swedes tend to
have only one really great player at a time, and this player is always male.
and he almost always ends up best in the world for a while This is one reason
marketers and endorsement consultants are circling Enqvist like sharks all
through the summer. (46) Nerves and choking are a huge issue in a
precision-and-timing sport like tennis, and a "bad head" washes more juniors
and collegians out of the competitive life than any sort of deficit in talent
or drive of the biggest wins of his career.

CHIVALRY

On a White Flag Group speaking commitment to the Tough Shit But You Still Can't Drink Group down in Braintree this past July, Don G., up at the podium, revealed publicly about how he was ashamed that he still as yet had no real solid understanding of a Higher Power. It's suggested in the third of the Boston AA's 12 Steps that you turn your Diseased will over to the direction and love of "God as you understand Him." It's supposed to be one of AA's major selling points that you get to choose your own God. You get to make up your own understanding of God or a Higher Power or Whom-/Whatever. But Gately, at like ten months clean, at the TSBYSCD podium in Braintree, opines that at this juncture he's so totally clueless and lost he's thinking that he'd maybe rather have the White Flag Crocodiles just grab him by the lapels and just tell him what AA God to have an understanding of, and then give him totally blunt and dogmatic orders about how to turn over his Diseased will to whatever this Higher Power is. He notes how he's observed already that some Catholics and Fundamentalists now in AA had a childhood understanding of a Stern and Punishing-type God, and Gately's heard them express incredible Gratitude that AA let them at long last let go and change over to an understanding of a Loving, Forgiving, Nurturing-type God. But at least these folks started out with some idea of Him/Her/It, whether fucked up or no. You might think it'd be easier if you came in with 0 in the way of denominational background or preconceptions, you might think it'd be easier to sort of invent a Higher-Powerish God from scratch and then like erect an understanding, but Don Gately complains that this has not been his experience thus far. His sole experience so far is that he takes one of AA's very rare specific suggestions and hits the knees in the AM and asks for Help and then hits the knees again at bedtime and says Thank You, whether he believes he's talking to Anything/-body or not, and he somehow gets through that day clean. This, after ten months of ear-smoking concentration and reflection, is still all he feels like he "understands" about the "God angle." Publicly, in front of a very tough and hard-ass-looking AA crowd, he sort of simultaneously confesses and complains that he sort of feels like a rat that's learned one route in the maze to the cheese and travels that route in a ratty-type fashion and whatnot. W/the God thing being the cheese in the metaphor. Gately still feels like he has no access to the Big Spiritual Picture. He feels about the ritualistic daily Please and Thank You prayers rather like a hitter who's on a hitting streak and doesn't change his jock or socks or pre-game routine for as long as he's on the streak. W/sobriety being the hitting streak and whatnot, he explains. The whole church basement is literally blue with smoke. Gately says he feels like this is a pretty limp and lame understanding of a Higher Power: a cheek-easement or unwashed athletic supporter. He says but when he tries to go beyond the very basic rote automatic get-me-through-this-day-please stuff, when he kneels at other times and prays or meditates or tries to achieve a Big-Picture understanding of a God as he can understand Him, he feels nothing-not nothing but Nothing, an edgeless blankness that somehow feels worse than the sort of unconsidered atheism he Came In with. He says he doesn't know if any of this is coming through or making any sense or if it's all just still symptomatic of a thoroughgoingly Diseased will and quote "spirit." He finds himself telling the Tough Shit But You Still Can't Drink audience dark doubtful thoughts he wouldn't have fucking ever dared to tell even Ferocious Francis G., his sponsor over at the White Flag Group in Allston. He confesses publicly that at this point the God-understanding stuff kind of makes him want to puke from fear. Something you can't see or hear or touch or smell: OK; all right. But something you can't even feel? Because that's what he feels when he tries to understand something to really sincerely pray to. Nothingness. He says when he tries to pray he gets this like image in his mind's eye of the brainwaves or whatever of his prayers going out and out, with nothing to stop them, going, going, radiating out into like space and outliving him and still going and never hitting Anything out there, much less Something with an ear. Much much less Something with an ear that could then possibly give a rat's ass. He says he's both pissed off and ashamed to be talking about this stuff instead of how just completely good it is to just be getting through the day without ingesting a Substance, but there it is. This is what's going on. He's no closer to carrying out the suggestion of the 3rd Step than the day the PO drove him over to his halfway house from Peabody Holding. And he is afraid.

And now the same fucking thing happens again. The tough, chain-smoking TSBYSCD Group all stands and applauds and the men give two-finger whistles and people come up at the Raffle break to pump Gately's big hand and even sometimes try and hug on him. It seems like every time he forgets himself and publicizes how he's fucking up in sobriety Boston AA's fall all over themselves to tell him how good it was to hear him and to for God's sake Keep Coming, for them if not for himself, whatever the fuck that means.

The Tough Shit But You Still Can't Drink Group seems to be over 50% bikers and biker-chicks, meaning your standard leather vests and 10 cm bootheels, belt buckles with little spade-shaped knives that come out of a slot in the slide, tattoos that are more like murals, serious tits in cotton halters, big beards, Harleywear, wooden matches in mouth-corners and so forth. After the Our Father, as Gately and the other White Flag speakers are clustered smoking outside the door to the church basement, the sound of high-cc Hawgs being kick-started is enough to rattle your fillings. Gately can't even start to guess what it would be like to be a sober and drug-free biker. It's like what would be the point? He imagines these people polishing the hell out of their leather and like playing a lot of really precise pool.

This one sober biker that can't be much older than Gately and is nearly Gately's size--though with a really small head and a tapered jaw that makes him look kind of like a handsome mantis--as they're massed around the door he brings a car-length chopper up alongside Gately. Says it was good to hear him. Shakes his hand in the complex way of blacks and Harleyheads. He introduces his name as Robert F., though on the lapel of his leather vest it says BOB DEATH. A biker-chick's got her arms around his waist from behind, as is SOP. He tells Gately it was good to hear somebody new share from the heart about his struggles with the God-component. It's weird to hear a biker use the Boston-AA word share, much less component or heart.

The other White Flaggers have stopped talking and are watching the two men sort of just awkwardly stand there, the biker embraced from behind and straddling his throbbing Hawg. The guy's got on leather spats and a leather vest with no shirt, and Gately notices the guy's got a jailhouse tatt of AA's weird little insignia of a triangle inside a circle on one big shoulder.

Robert F./Bob Death asks Gately if by any chance he's heard the one about the fish. White Flag's Glenn K. overhears and of course he's got to put his own fucking oar in, and he breaks in and asks them all if they've heard the one about What did the blind man say as he passed by the Quincy Market fish-stall, and without waiting he says He goes, "Evening, ladies." A couple male White Flaggers fall about, and Tamara N. slaps at the back of Glenn K.'s pointy head, but without real heat, as in like What are we going to do with this sick fuck.

Bob Death smiles coolly (South-Shore bikers are required to be extremely cool in everything they do) and manipulates his wooden match with his lip and says No, not that one about the fish. He has to assume a kind of bar-shout to clear the noise of his idling Hawg. He leans in more toward Gately and shouts that the one he was talking about was: This wise old whiskery fish swims up to three young fish and goes, "Morning, boys, how's the water?" and swims away; and the three young fish watch him swim away and look at each other and go, "what the fuck is water?" and then they also swim away. The young biker leans back and smiles at Gately and gives an affable shrug and blatts away, a haltertop's tits mashed against his back.

Gately's forehead was wrinkled in emotional pain all the way up Rte. 3 home. They were in the back of Ferocious Francis's old car. Glenn K. was trying to ask what was the difference between a bottle of 5-year-old Hennessy and a human female vagina. The old-timer Dicky N., up riding shotgun, told Glenn to try to fucking remember there was ladies present. Ferocious Francis kept moving the toothpick around in his mouth and looking at Gately in the rearview. Gately wanted to both cry and hit somebody. Glenn's cheap down jacket had the faint rank oily smell of a dishtowel. There was no smoking in the car: Ferocious Francis had a little oxygen tank he had to carry around and a little thin pale-blue plastic like tube thing that lay under his nose and was taped there and sent oxygen up his nose. All he'd ever say about the tank and the tube is that they were not his personal will but that he'd submitted to medical advice and now here he was, still sucking air and staying rabidly active with his Home Group, speaking.

Something they seem to omit to mention in Boston AA when you're new and out of your skull with desperation and ready to eliminate your map and they tell you how it'll all get better and better as you abstain and recover: they omit to mention that the way it gets better and you get better is through pain. Not around pain or in spite of it. They leave this out, talking instead about Gratitude and Release from Compulsion. There's serious pain in being sober, though, you find out, after time. Then now that you're clean and don't even much want substances and feel like you want to both cry and stomp somebody into goo with pain, these Boston AA's start in on telling you You're Right Where You're Supposed to Be and telling you to remember the pointless pain of active addiction and telling you that at least this sober pain now has a purpose. At least this pain means you're going somewhere, they say, instead of the contrast of the repetitive, pointless gerbil-wheel of addictive pain.

They neglect to tell you that after the urge to get high magically vanishes and you've been substanceless for maybe six or eight months, you'll begin to start "to get in touch" with why it was that you used substances in the first place. You'll start to feel why it was you got dependent on what was, when you get right down to it, an anesthetic. "Getting In Touch With Your Feelings" is another quilted-sampler-type cliche that ends up masking something ghastly deep and real, it turns out. It starts to turn out that the vapider the AA cliche, the sharper the canines of the real truth it covers.

Near the end of his residency at Ennet House, at like eight months clean and more or less free of any chemical compulsion, going to work at the Shattuck Shelter every AM and working the Steps and getting Active and pounding out meetings like a madman, Don Gately suddenly started to remember things he would just as soon not have. Actually remember's probably not the best word. It was more like he started to sort of reexperience things that he'd barely even been there to experience, in emotional terms, in the first place. A lot of it was undramatic little shit, but still somehow painful. E.g. like when he was maybe 11 pretending to watch TV with his mother and pretending to listen to her PM nightly monologue, a litany of complaint and regret whose consonants got mushier and mushier. To the extent it's Gately's place to diagnose anybody else as an alcoholic, his Mom was pretty definitely an alcoholic. She drank Stolichnaya vodka in front of the TV. They weren't Cable Ready, for reasons of $. She drank little thin glasses with cut-up bits of carrot and pepper that she'd drop into the vodka. Her maiden name was Gately. Don's like organic father had been an Estonian immigrant, a wrought-iron worker, which is like sort of a welder with ambition. He'd broken Gately's mother's jaw and left Boston when Gately was still in his mother's stomach. Gately had no brothers or sisters. His Morn was subsequently involved with a live-in lover, a former Navy MP who used to beat her up on a regular schedule, hitting her in the vicinities between groin and breast so nothing showed. A skill he'd picked up as a brig guard and Shore Patrol. At about 8-10 Heinekens, the MP used to all of a sudden throw his Reader's Digest against the wall and get her down and beat her with measured blows, she'd go down on the floor of the apartment and he'd hit her in the hidden vicinity, timing the blows between her arms' little waves--Gately remembered she tried to ward off the blows with a fluttering downward motion of her arms and hands, as if she were beating out flames. Gately still hasn't ever quite gotten over to look at her in State Care in the Long-Term-Care Medicaid place. The MP's tongue was in the corner of his mouth and his little-eyed face wore a look of great concentration, as if he were taking something delicate apart or putting it together. He'd be on one knee knelt over her with his look of sober problem-solving, timing his shots, the blows abrupt and darting, her writhing and trying to kind of shoo them away. The darting blows. Out of the psychic blue, very detailed memories of these fights all of a sudden surfaced one afternoon as he was getting ready to mow the Ennet House lawn. It's like a lot of memories of his youth sank without bubbles when he quit school and then later only in sobriety. bubbled back up to where he could get in touch with them. His mother used to call the MP a bastuhd and sometimes go oof when he landed one in the vicinity. She drank vodka with vegetables suspended in it, a habit she'd picked up from the missing Estonian, whose first name, Gately read on a torn and then fucked-upedly Scotch-taped paper out of her jewelry box after his mother's cirrhotic hemorrhage, was Bulat. The Medicaid Long-Term place was way the fuck out the Yirrell Beach bridge in Point Shirley, right across the water from the Airport. The former MP delivered cheese and then later worked in a chowder factory and kept weights in their Beverly house's garage and drank Heiineken beer. The MP carefully logged each beer he drank in a little spiral notebook he used to monitor his intake of alcohol.

Gately's Mom's special couch for TV was nubby red chintz, and when she shifted from seated upright to lying on her side with her arm between her head and the little protective doily on the couch's armrest and held the glass tilting on the little space her breasts left at the cushion's edge, it was a sign she was going under. Gately at like 10 or 11 used to pretend to listen and watch TV on the floor but would really be dividing his attention between how close his Morn was to unconsciousness and how much Stolichnaya was left in the bottle. She would only drink Stolichnaya, which she called her Comrade in Arms and said Nothing But The Comrade Would Do. After she went under for the evening and he'd carefully taken the tilted glass out of her hand, Don'd take the bottle and mix the first couple vodkas with Diet Coke and drink a couple of those until it lost its fire, then drink The Comrade straight. This was like a routine. Then he'd put the near-empty bottle back next to her glass with its vegetables darkening in the undrunk vodka; she'd wake up on the couch in the morning with no idea she hadn't drunk the whole thing. Gately was careful to always leave her enough for a wake-up swallow. But this gesture of leaving some, Gately now realized, wasn't just filial kindness on his part: if she didn't have the wake-up swallow she wouldn't get off the red couch all day, and then there would be no new bottle that night.

This was at age 10 or maybe 11, as he now recalls. Most of the furniture was wrapped in plastic. The carpet was burnt-orange shag that the landlord kept saying he was going to take up and go to wood floors. The MP worked nights or else most nights went out, and then she'd take the plastic off the couch.

Why the couch had little protective doilies on the arms when it usually had a plastic cover on it Gately cannot recall or explain. For a while in Beverly they had Nimitz the kitty.

This all came burpling greasily up into memory in the space of two or three weeks in May, and now more stuff steadily like dribbles up, for Gately to Touch.

Sober, she'd called him Bimmy or Bim because that's what she heard his little friends call him. She didn't know the neighborhood cognomen came from an acronym for "Big Indestructible Moron." His head had been huge, as a child. Out of all proportion, though with nothing especially Estonian about it, that he could see. He'd been very sensitive about it--the head--but never told her not to call him Bim. When she was drunk and conscious she called him her Doshka or Dochka or something like that. Sometimes, well in the bag himself, when he turned off the uncabled set and covered her with the afghan, easing the mostly empty Stoli bottle back onto the little TV Guide table by the bowl of darkening chopped peppers, his unconscious Mom would groan and titter and call him her Doshka and Good Sir Knight and last and only love, and ask him not to hit her anymore.

In June he got in touch with memories that their front steps in Beverly were a pocked cement painted red even in the pocks. Their mailbox was part of a whole tract-housing complex's honeycomb of mailboxes on a like small pole, brushed-steel and gray with a Postal eagle on it. You needed a little key to get your mail out, and for a long time he thought the sign on it said "US MAIL," as in us instead of U.S. His Mom's hair had been dry blond-white with dark roots that never lengthened or went away. No one tells you when they tell you you have cirrhosis that eventually you'll all of a sudden start choking on your own blood. This is called a cirrhotic hemorrhage. Your liver won't process any more of your blood and it quote "shunts" the blood and it goes up your throat in a high-pressure jet, is what they told him, is why he'd first thought the MP'd come back and cut his Mom or stabbed her, when he first came in, after football his last season, at age 17. She'd been diagnosed for years. She'd go to Meetings for a few weeks, then drink on the couch, silent, telling him if the phone rang she wasn't home. After a few weeks of this she'd spend a whole day weeping, beating at herself as if on fire. Then she'd go back to Meetings for a while. It was like a routine, a gerbil wheel. Her face eventually began to swell and make her eyes piggy and her big breasts pointed at the floor and she turned the deep yellow of quality squash. This had all been part of the diagnosis of cirrhosis. At first Gately just couldn't go, couldn't see her out there. Couldn't deal. Then after some time passed he couldn't go because he couldn't face her and try and explain why he hadn't come before now. Now ten years have gone like that. Gately hadn't probably consciously thought of her once for three years, before getting straight.

Right after their neighbor Mrs. Waite's body got found by the meter-guy, so he must have been 9, when his Morn was first diagnosed, Gately had gotten the diagnosis mixed up in his head with King Arthur. He'd ride a mop-handle horse and brandish a trashcan lid and a batteryless plastic Star Wars Light Saber and tell the neighborhood kids he was Sir Osis of Thuliver, most fearsomely loyal and fierce of Arthur's vessels. Since the summer now, when he mops Shattuck Shelter floors, he hears the clopaclopaclop he used to make with his big square tongue as Sir Osis then, riding.

And his dreams late that night, after the Braintree/Bob Death commitment, seem to set him under a sort of sea, at terrific depths, the water all around him silent and dim and the same temperature he is.

AUGUST 5, 1993, INTERSTATE 55, WESTBOUND, 8:00 A.M.

Today is Press Day at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, and I'm supposed
to be at the fairgrounds by 9:00 A.M. to get my credentials. I imagine
credentials to be a small white card in the band of a fedora. I've never been
considered press before. My real interest in credentials is getting into rides
and shows for free. I'm fresh in from the East Coast, for an East Coast
magazine. Why exactly they're interested in the Illinois State Fair remains
unclear to me. I suspect that every so often editors at East Coast magazines
slap their foreheads and remember that about 90 percent of the United States
lies between the coasts, and figure they'll engage somebody to do
pith-helmeted anthropological reporting on something rural and heartlandish. I
think they asked me to do this because I grew up here, just a couple hours'
drive from downstate Springfield. I never did go to the state fair, though--I
pretty much topped out at the countyfair level. Actually, I haven't been back
to Illinois for a long time, and can't say I've missed it.

The heat is all too familiar. In August it takes hours for the dawn fog to bum
off. The air is like wet wool. Eight A.M. is too early to justify turning on
the car's AC. The sun is a blotch in a sky that isn't so much cloudy as
opaque. The corn Starts just past the breakdown lanes and goes tight to the
sky's hem. August corn in Illinois is as tall as a tall man. With all the
advances in fertilization, it's now knee-high by June 1. Locusts chirr in
every field, a brassy electric sound that Dopplers oddly inside the speeding
car. Corn, corn, soybeans, corn, exit ramp, corn, and every few miles an
outpost way off on a reach in the distance--house, tree with tire swing, barn,
satellite dish. Grain silos are the only skyline. A fog hangs just over the
fields. It is over eighty degrees and climbing with the sun. It'll be over
ninety degrees by 10:00 A.M. There's that tightening quality to the air, like
it's drawing itself in and down for a siege. The interstate is dull and pale.
Occasional other cars look ghostly, their drivers' faces humidity-stunned.

9:00 A.M.

It's still a week before the fair, and there's something surreal about the
emptiness of parking facilities so huge and cornplex that they have their own
map. The parts of the fairgrounds that I can see are half-permanent structures
and half tents and displays in various stages of erection, giving the whole
thing the look of somebody half-dressed for a really important date.

9:05 A.M.

The man processing print-press credentials has a mustache and short-sleeve
knit shirt. In line before me are newshounds from Today's Agriculture, the
Decatur Herald & Review, Illinois Crafts Newsletter, 4-H News, and Livestock
Weekly. Credentials are just a laminated mug shot with a gator clip for your
pocket. Not a fedora in the house. Two older ladies behind me from a local
horticulture organ engage me in shoptalk. One lady is the unofficial historian
of the Illinois State Fair: she gives slide shows on the fair at nursing homes
and Rotary lunches. She begins to emit historical data at a great rate--the
fair started in 1853; there was a fair during the Civil War but not during
WWII, and not in 1893, because Chicago was hosting the World's Columbian
Exposition; the governor has failed to cut the ribbon personally on opening
day only twice; etc. It occurs to me that I ought to have brought a notebook.
I'm also the only person in the room in a T-shirt. It is a fluorescent-lit
cafeteria in something called the Illinois Building Senior Center, uncooled.
The local TV crews have their equipment spread out on tables and are lounging
against walls. They all have mustaches and short-sleeve knit shirts. In fact,
the only other males in the room without mustaches and golf shirts are the
local TV reporters, four of them, all in suits. They are sleek, sweatless,
deeply blue-eyed. They stand together up by the dais, which has a podium and a
flag and a banner reading "Give Us a Whirl"--this year's theme.
Middle-management types enter. A squelch of feedback on a loudspeaker brings
the official Press Welcome & Briefing to order. It's dull. The words
"excited," "proud," and "opportunity" are used repeatedly. Ms. Illinois County
Fairs, tiara bolted to the tallest coiffure I've ever seen (bun atop bun,
multiple layers, a ziggurat of hair), is proudly excited to have the
opportunity to present two corporate guys, sweating freely in suits, who
report the excited pride of McDonald's and Wal-Mart to have the opportunity to
be this year's corporate sponsors.

9:50 A.M.

Under way at 4 mph on the Press Tour, on a kind of flatboat with wheels and a
lengthwise bench so queerly high that everybody's feet dangle. The tractor
pulling us has signs that say "ethanol" and "agripowered." I'm particularly
keen to see the carnies setting up the rides in the fairgrounds' "Happy
Hollow," but we head first to the corporate and political tents. Most every
tent is still setting up. Workmen crawl over structural frames. We wave at
them; they wave back; it's absurd: we're only going 4 mph. One tent says
"Corn: Touching Our Lives Every Day." There are massive many-hued tents
courtesy of McDonald's, Miller Genuine Draft, Morton Commercial Structures
Corp., the Land of Lincoln Soybean Association ("Look Where Soybeans Go!"),
Pekin Energy Corp. ("Proud of Our Sophisticated Computer-Controlled Processing
Technology"), Illinois Pork Producers, the John Birch Society. Two tents that
say "Republican" and "Democrat." Other, smaller tents for various Illinois
officeholders. It is well up in the nineties and the sky is the color of old
jeans.

We go over a system of crests to Farm Expo--twelve, acres of wicked-looking
needle,toothed harrows, tractors, seeders, harvesters. Then back around the
rear of the big permanent Artisans' Building, Illinois Building Senior Center,
Expo Center, passing tantalizingly close to Happy Hollow, where half-assembled
rides stand in giant arcs and rays and shirtless guys with tattoos and
wrenches slouch around them, fairly oozing menace and human interest, but on
at a crawl up a blacktop path to the livestock buildings. By this time, most
of the press is off the tram and walking in order to escape the tour's PA
speaker, which is tinny and brutal. Horse Complex. Cattle Complex. Swine Barn.
Sheep Barn. Poultry Building and Goat Barn. These are all long brick barracks
open down both sides of their length. Some contain stalls; others have pens
divided into squares with aluminum rails. Inside, they're gray cement, dim and
yeasty, huge fans overhead, workers in overalls and waders hosing everything
down. No animals yet, but the smells still hang from last year--horses' odors
sharp, cows' rich, sheep's oily, swine's unspeakable. No idea what the Poultry
Building smelled like, because I couldn't bring myself to go in. Traumatically
pecked once, as a child, at the Champaign County Fair, I have a long-standing
phobic thing about poultry.

The ethanol tractor's exhaust is literally flatulent-smelling as we crawl out
past the Grandstand, where later there will be evening concerts and harness
and auto racing--"World's Fastest One-Mile Dirt Track"--and head for something
called the Help Me Grow tent, to interface with the state's First Lady, Brenda
Edgar. The first sign of the Help Me Grow area is the nauseous bright red of
Ronald McDonald's hair. He's capering around a small plastic playground area
under candy-stripe tenting. Though the fair is ostensibly closed, troupes of
kids mysteriously appear and engage in rather rehearsed-looking play as we
approach. Two of the kids are black, the first black people I've seen anywhere
on the grounds. No parents in view. The governor's wife stands surrounded by
flinty-eyed aides. Ronald pretends to fall down. The press forms into a ring.
There are several state troopers in khaki and tan, streaming sweat under their
Nelson Eddy hats. Mrs. Edgar is cool and groomed and pretty in a lacquered
way. She's of the female age that's always suffixed with "-ish." Her tragic
flaw is her voice, which sounds almost heliated. The Help Me Grow prograim,
when you decoct the rhetoric, is basically a statewide crisis line for
over-the-edge parents to call and get talked out of beating up their kids. The
number of calls Mrs. Edgar says the line has fielded just this year is both
de- and impressive. Shiny pamphlets are distributed. Ronald McDonald, voice
slurry and makeup cottage-cheesish in the heat, cues the kids to come over for
some low-rent sleight of hand and Socratic banter. Lacking a real journalist's
killer instinct, I've been jostled way to the back, and my view is obscured by
the towering hair of Ms. Illinois County Fairs, whose function here is
unclear. I don't want to asperse, but Ronald McDonald sounds like he's under
the influence of something more than fresh country air. I drift away under the
tent. All the toys and plastic playground equipment have signs that say
"Courtesy of" and then a corporate name. A lot of the photographers in the
ring have dusty green safari vests, and they sit cross-legged in the sun,
getting low-angle shots of Mrs. Edgar. There are no tough questions from the
media. The tram's tractor is putting out a steady sweatsock shape of
blue-green exhaust. I notice that the grass under the Help Me Grow tent is
different--pine-green and prickly-looking. Solid investigative bent-over
journalism reveals that it is artificial. A huge mat of plastic artificial
grass has been spread over the knoll's real grass, under the tent. I have my
first moment of complete East Coast cynicism: a quick look under the edge of
the fake-grass mat reveals the real grass underneath, flattened and already
yellowing.

AUGUST 13, 9:26 A.M.

Official opening. Ceremony, introductions, verbiage. Big brass shears, for
cutting the ribbon across the main gate. It is cloudless and dry, but
forehead-tighteningly hot. Noon will be a kiln. No anthropologist worth his
pith helmet would be without the shrewd counsel of a colorful local, and I've
lured a Native Companion here for the day with the promise of free admission,
unlimited corn dogs, and various shiny trinkets. Knit-shirt press and rabid
early fairgoers are massed from the gate all the way out to Springfield's
Sangamon Avenue, where homeowners with plastic flags invite you to park on
their front lawn for five dollars. We stand near the back. I gather that
"Little Jim" Edgar, the governor, isn't much respected by the press. Governor
Edgar is maybe fifty and greyhound-thin, with steel glasses and hair that
looks carved out of feldspar. He radiates sincerity, though. After the hacks
introduce him, he speaks sanely and, I think, well. He invites everybody to
get in there and have a really good time and to revel in watching everybody
else -also having a good time--a kind of reflexive exercise in civics. The
press corps seems unmoved.

But this fair, the idea and now the reality of it, does seem to have something
uniquely to do with state-as-community, a grand-scale togetherness. And it is
not just the claustrophobic mash of people waiting to get inside. The fair
occupies space, and there's no shortage of empty space in downstate Illinois.
The fairgrounds take up 300-plus acres on the north side of Springfield, a
depressed capital of 109,000 where you can't spit without hitting a
Lincoln-site plaque. The fair spreads itself out, and visually so. The main
gate is on a rise, and through the two sagged halves of ribbon you get a
specular vantage on the whole thing--virgin and sun-glittered, even the tents
looking freshly painted. It seems garish and endless and aggressively special.
Kids are having little epileptic fits all around us, frenzied with a need to
take in everything at once. I suspect that part of the self-conscious
community thing here has to do with space. Rural Midwesterners live surrounded
by unpopulated land, marooned in a space whose emptiness is both physical and
spiritual. It is not just people you get lonely for. You're alienated from the
very space around you, for here the land is not an environment but a
commodity. The land is basically a factory. You live in the same factory you
work in. You spend an enormous amount of time with the land, but you're still
alienated from it in some way. I theorize to Native Companion (who worked
detasseling summer corn with me in high school) that the state fair's
animating thesis involves some kind of structured, decorated interval of
communion with both neighbor and space--the sheer fact, of the land is to be
celebrated here, its yields ogled and its stock groomed and paraded. A special
vacation from alienation, a chance, for a moment, to love what real life out
here can't let you love. Native Companion gives me a look, then rummages for
her cigarette lighter, quite a bit more interested in that.

10:40 A.M.

The livestock venues are at full occupancy animalwise, but we seem to be the
only fairgoing tourists from the ceremony who've dashed right over to tour
them. You can tell which barns are for which animals with your eyes closed.
The horses are in their own individual stalls, with half-height doors and
owners and grooms on stools by the doors, a lot of them dozing. The horses
stand in hay. Billy Ray Cyrus plays loudly on some stableboy's boom box. The
horses have tight hides and apple-sized eyes that are set on the sides of
their heads, like fish. I've rarely been this close to fine livestock. The
horses' faces are long and somehow suggestive of coffins. The racers are
lanky, velvet over bone. The draft and show horses are mammoth and spotlessly
groomed, and more or less odorless: the acrid smell in here is just the
horses' pee. All their muscles are beautiful; the hides enhance them. They
make farty noises when they sigh, heads hanging over the short doors. They're
not for petting, though. When you come close they flatten their ears and show
big teeth. The grooms laugh to themselves as we jump back. These are special
competitive horses, with intricately bred high-strung artistic temperaments. I
wish I'd brought carrots. Animals can be bought, emotionally. Stall after
stall of horses. Standard horse-type colors. They eat the same hay they stand
in. Occasional feedbags look like gas masks. A sudden clattering spray-sound
like somebody hosing down siding turns out to be a glossy dun stallion peeing.
He's at the back of his stall getting combed, and the door is wide open. The
stream of pee is an inch in diameter and throws up dust and hay and it looks
like even chips of wood from the floor. A stallion is a male horse. We hunker
down and have a look upward, and suddenly for the first time I understand a
certain expression describing certain human males, an expression I'd heard but
never quite understood till now.

You can hear the cows all the way from the Horse Complex. The cow stalls are
all doorless and open to view. I don't guess a cow presents much of an escape
risk. They are white-spotted dun or black, or else white with big continents
of dun or black. They have no lips and their tongues are wide. Their eyes roll
and they have huge nostrils, gaping and wet and pink or black. Cow manure
smells wonderful--warm and herbal and blameless--but cows themselves stink in
a rich biotic way, rather like a wet boot. Some of the owners are scrubbing
down their entries for the upcoming beef show over at the Coliseum (so says my
detailed media guide). These cows stand immobilized in webs of canvas straps
inside a steel frame while ag-professionals scrub them down with a
hose-and-brush thing that also oozes soap. The cows do not like this one bit.
One cow, whose face is eerily reminiscent of Winston Churchill's, trembles and
shudders and makes the frame clank, lowing, its eyes rolling up almost to the
whites. Native Companion and I cringe and make soft appalled noises. The cow's
lowing starts other cows lowing, or maybe they just see what they're in for.
The cow's legs keep half-buckling, and the owner kicks at them. White mucus
hangs from its snout. Other ominous drippings and gushings from elsewhere. The
cow almost tips the frame over, and the owner punches her in the ribs. Swine
Barn.

Swine have fur! I never thought of swine as having fur. I've actually never
been up very close to swine, for olfactory reasons. A lot of the swine in here
are show hogs, a breed called Poland China, their thin fur a kind of white
crewcut over pink skin. A lot of the swine are down on their sides, stuporous
and throbbing in the barn's heat. The awake ones grunt. They stand and lie on
very clean large-curd sawdust in low-fenced pens. A couple of barrows are
eating both the sawdust and their own excrement. Again, we're the only
tourists here. A bullhorn on a wall announces that the Junior Pygmy Goat
judging is under way over at the Goat Barn. A lot of these swine are frankly
huge--say a third the size of a Volkswagen. Every once in a while you hear
about farmers getting mauled or killed by swine. No teeth in view here, though
their hoofs are cloven and pink and obscene. I'm not sure whether they're
called hoofs or feet on swine. Rural Midwesterners learn in second grade that
there's no such word as "hooves." Some of the swine have large fans blowing in
front of their pens, and twelve ceiling fans roar, but it is still hellish in
here. Pig smell is both vomity and excremental, like some hideous digestive
disorder on a grand scale. Maybe a cholera ward would come close. The
swineherds and owners have 6n rubber boots nothing like the L.L. Bean boots
worn on the East Coast. Some of the standing swine commune through the bars of
their pens, snouts almost touching. The sleeping swine thrash in dreams, their
legs working. Unless they're in distress, swine grunt at a low constant pitch.
It is a pleasant sound.

But now one butterscotch-colored swine is screaming. Distressed swine scream.
The sound is both human and inhuman enough to make your hair stand. The
professional swinemen ignore the pig, but we fuss on over, Native Companion
making concerned baby-talk sounds until I shush her. The distressed pig's
sides are heaving; it is sitting up with its front legs quivering, screaming
horribly. This pig's keeper is nowhere in sight. A small sign on its pen says
it is a Hampshire. It is having respiratory trouble, clearly: I'm guessing it
inhaled either sawdust or excrement. Its front legs now buckle, so it is on
its side, spasming. Whenever it can get enough breath it screams. It's
unendurable, but none of the ag-professionals comes vaulting over the pens to
administer aid. Native Companion and I wring our hands with sympathy. We both
make plangent little noises at the pig. Native Companion tells me to go get
somebody instead of standing there with my thumb up my butt. I feel enormous
stress--the nauseous smell, impotent sympathy, plus we're behind schedule. We
are currently missing the Junior Pygmy Goats, Philatelic Judging at the Expo
Building, a 4-H Dog Show at Club Mickey D's, the semifinals of the Midwest
Arm-Wrestling Championships, a Ladies Camping Seminar, and the opening rounds
of the Speed Casting Tournament. A swineherd kicks her Poland China sow awake
so she can add more sawdust to its pen; Native Companion utters a pained
sound. There are clearly only two animal-rights advocates in this Swine Barn.
We both can observe a kind of sullen, callous expertise in the demeanor of the
ag-pros. Prime example of spiritual-alienation-from-land-as-commodity, I
posit. Except why take all the trouble to breed and care for and train a
special animal and bring it to the Illinois State Fair if you don't care
anything about it?

Then it occurs to me that I had bacon yesterday and am even now looking
forward to my first corn dog of the fair. I'm standing here wringing my hands
over a distressed swine and then I'm going to go pound down a corn dog. This
is connected to my reluctance to charge over to a swine pro and demand
emergency resuscitative care for this agonized Hampshire. I can sort of
picture the look the farmer would give me.

Not that it's profound, but I'm struck, amid the pig's screams and wheezes, by
the fact that these agricultural pros do not see their stock as pets or
friends. They are just in the agribuginess of weight and meat. They are
unconnected, even at the fair's self-consciously special occasion of
connection. And why not?--even at the fair their products continue to drool
and smell and scream, and the work goes on. I can imagine what they think of
us, cooing at the swine: we fairgoers don't have to deal with the business of
breeding and feeding our meat; our meat simply materializes at the corn-dog
stand, allowing us to separate our healthy appetites from fur and screams and
rolling eyes. We tourists get to indulge our tender animal-rights feelings
with our tummies full of bacon. I don't know how keen these sullen farmers'
sense of irony is, but mine's been honed East Coast keen, and I feel like a
bit of an ass in the Swine Barn.

11:60 A.M.

Since Native Companion was lured here for the day by the promise of free
access to high-velocity rides, we make a quick descent into Happy Hollow. Most
of the rides aren't even twirling hellishly yet. Guys with ratchet wrenches
are still cranking away, assembling the Ring of Fire. The Giant Gondola Wheel
is only half-built, and its seat-draped lower half resembles a hideous molary
grin. It is over 100 degrees in the sun, easy.

Happy Hollow's dirt midway is flanked by carnival-game booths and ticket
booths and rides. There's a merry-go-round and a couple of tame kiddie rides,
but most of the rides look like genuine Near-Death Experiences. The Hollow
seems to be open only technically, and the ticket booths are unmanned, though
little heartbreaking jets of AC air are blowing out through the money slots in
the booths' glass. Attendance is sparse, and I notice that none of the ag-pro
or farm people are anywhere in sight down here. A lot of the carnies slouch
and slump in the shade of awnings. Every one of them seems to chain-smoke. The
Tilt-a-Whirl operator has got his boots up on his control panel reading a
motorcycle-and-naked-girl magazine while guys attach enormous rubber hoses to
the ride's guts. We sidle over for a chat. The operator is twenty-four and
from Bee Branch, Arkansas, and has an earring and a huge tattoo of a flaming
skull on his triceps. He's far more interested in chatting with Native
Companion than with me. He's been at this gig five years, touring with this
one here same company here. Couldn't rightly say if he liked it or not. Broke
in on the Toss-a-Quarter-Onto-the-Plates game and got, like, transferred over
to the Tilt-a-Whirl in '91. He smokes Marlboro 100's but wears a cap that says
"Winston."

All the carny game barkers have headset microphones; some are saying "Testing"
and reciting their pitch lines in tentative warm-up ways. A lot of the pitches
seem frankly sexual: You got to get it up to get it in. Take it out and lay
'er down, only a dollar. Make it stand up. Two dollars, five chances. Make it
stand up. Rows of stuffed animals hang by their feet in the booths like game
put out to cure. It smells like machine grease and hair tonic down here, and
there's already a spoiled, garbagy smell. The media guide says Happy Hollow is
contracted to "one of the largest: owners of amusement attractions in the
country," one Blomsness-Thebault Enterprises, of Crystal Lake, Illinois, near
Chicago. But the carnies are all from the middle South--Tennessee, Arkansas,
Oklahoma. They are visibly unimpressed by the press credentials clipped to my
shirt. They tend to look at Native Companion like she's food, which she
ignores. I lose four dollars trying to "get it up and in," tossing miniature
basketballs into angled baskets in such a way that they don't bounce out. The
game's barker can toss them behind his back and get them to stay, but he's
right up next to the baskets. My shots carom out from eight feet away; the
straw baskets look soft, but their bottoms make a suspicious steely sound when
hit.

It's so hot that we move in quick vectors between areas of shade. I'm
reluctant to go shirtless because there'd be no way to display my credentials.
We zigzag gradually westward. One of the fully assembled rides near the
Hollow's west end is something called the Zipper. It's riderless as we
approach, but in furious motion, a kind of Ferris wheel on amphetamines.
Individual caged cars are hinged to spin on their own axes as they go around
in a tight vertical ellipse. The machine looks less like a Zipper than the
head of a chain saw. It sounds like a shimmying V-12 engine, and it is
something I'd run a mile in tight shoes to avoid riding.

Native Companion starts clapping and hopping, though. The operator at the
controls sees her and shouts down to git on over and git some, if she's a
mind. He claims they want to test it somehow. He's elbowing a colleague next
to him in a way I don't much care for. We have no tickets, I point out, and
none of the cash-for-ticket booths are manned. "Ain't no sweat off my balls,"
the operator says without looking at me. The operator's colleague conducts
Native Companion up the waffled-steel steps and straps her into a cage, upping
a thumb at the operator, who pulls a lever. She starts to ascend. Pathetic
little fingers appear in the cage's mesh. The Zipper's operator is ageless and
burnt-brown and has a mustache waxed to wicked points like a steer's horns,
rolling a Drum cigarette with one hand as he nudges levers upward and the
ellipse of cars speeds up and the individual cars themselves start to spin on
their hinges. Native Companion is a blur of color inside her cage, but
operator and colleague (whose jeans have worked down his hips to the point
that the top of his butt-crack is visible) watch studiously as Native
Companion's spinning car and the clanking empty cars circle the ellipse once a
second. I can barely watch. The Zipper is the color of unbrushed teeth, with
big scabs of rust. The operator and colleague sit on a little steel deck
before a panel of black-knobbed levers. The colleague spits Skoal into a can
he holds and tells the operator, "Well then take her up to eight then you
pussy." The Zipper begins to whine and the thing to spin so fast that a
detached car would surely be hurled into orbit. The colleague has a small
American flag folded into a bandanna around his head. The empty cars shudder
and clank as they whirl and spin. One long scream, wobbled by changes in
vector, is coming from Native Companion's cage, which is going around and
around on its hinges while a shape inside tumbles like stuff in a clothes
dryer. My neurological makeup (extremely sensitive: carsick, airsick,
heightsick) makes just watching this an act of great person, al courage. The
scream goes on and on; it is nothing like a swine's. Then the operator stops
the ride abruptly with her car at the top, so she's hanging upside down inside
the cage. I call up--is she okay? The response is a strange high-pitched
noise. I see the two carnies gazing upward very intently, shading their eyes.
The operator is stroking his mustache contemplatively. The cage's inversion
has made Native Companion's dress fall up. They're ogling her nethers,
obviously.

Now the operator is joggling the choke lever so the Zipper stutters back and
forth, forward and backward, making Native Companion's top car spin around and
around on its hinges. His colleague's T-shirt has a stoned Ninja Turtle on it,
toking on a joint. There's a distended A-sharp scream from the whirling car,
as if Native Companion is being slow-roasted. I summon saliva to step in and
really say something stem, but at this point they start bringing her down. The
operator is deft at his panel; the car's descent is almost fluffy. His hands
on the levers are a kind of parody of tender care. The descent takes
forever--ominous silence from Native Companion's car. The two carnies are
laughing and slapping their knee. I clear my throat twice. Native Companion's
car descends, stops. jiggles of movement in the car, then the door's latch
slowly turns. I expect whatever husk of a person emerges from the car to be
hunched and sheet-white, dribbling fluids.

Instead she bounds out. "That was fucking great! Joo see that? Son of a bitch
spun that car sixteen times, did you see?" This woman is native Midwestern,
from my hometown. My prom date a dozen years ago. Her color is high. Her dress
looks like the world's worst case of static cling. She's still got her chewing
gum in, for God's sake. She turns to the carnies: "You sons bitches, that was
fucking great." The colleague is half-draped over the operator; they're
roaring with laughter. Native Companion has her hands on her hips, but she's
grinning. Am I the only one who's in touch with the sexual-harassment element
in this whole episode? She takes the steel stairs several at a time and starts
up, the hillside toward the food booths. Behind us the operator calls out,
"They don't call me King of the Zipper for nuthin', sweet thang!"

She snorts and calls back over her shoulder, "Oh, you."

I'm having a hard time keeping up. "Did you hear that?" I ask her.

"Jesus I thought I bought it for sure, that was so great. Assholes. But did
you see that one spin up top at the end, though?"

"Did you hear that Zipper King comment?" I protest. She has her hand around my
elbow and is helping me up the hillside's slick grass. "Did you sense
something kind of sexual-harassmentish going on through that whole sick little
exercise?"

"Oh for fuck's sake, it was fun--son of a bitch spun that car sixteen times."

"They were looking up your dress. You couldn't see them, maybe. They hung you
upside down at a great height and made your dress fall up and ogled you. They
shaded their eyes and commented to each other."

"Oh for Christ's sake."

I slip a bit and she catches my arm. "So this doesn't bother you? As a
Midwesterner, you're unbothered? Or did you just not have a sense of what was
going on?"

"So if I noticed or didn't, why does it have to be my deal? What, because
there's assholes in the world I don't get to ride the Zipper?"

"This is potentially key," I say. "This may be just the sort of regional
eroto-political contrast the East Coast magazine is keen for. The core value
informing a kind of eroto-willed political stoicism on your part is your
prototypically Midwestern appreciation of fun--"

"Buy me some pork skins, you dip-shit."

"--whereas on the East Coast, eroto-political indignation is the fun. In New
York a woman who'd been hung upside down and ogled would get a whole lot of
other women together and there'd be this frenzy of eroto-political
indignation. They'd confront the guy. File an injunction. The management would
find themselves litigating-violation of a woman's right to non-harassed fun.
I'm telling you. Personal and political fun merge somewhere just east of
Cleveland, for women."

Native Companion kills a mosquito without looking. "And they all take Prozac
and stick their finger down their throat too out there. They ought to try just
climbing on and spinning and saying, |Fuck 'em.' That's pretty much all you
can do with assholes."

12:35 P.M.

Lunchtime. The fairgrounds are a Saint Vitus' dance of blacktop footpaths, the
axons and dendrites of mass spectation, connecting buildings and barns and
corporate tents. Each path is flanked, pretty much along its whole length, by
booths hawking food, and I realize that there's a sort of digestive subtheme
running all through the fair. In a way, we're all here to be swallowed up. The
main gate's maw admits us, and tightly packed slow masses move peristaltically
along complex systems of branching paths, engage in complex cash-and-energy
transfers at the villi alongside the paths, and are finally, both filled and
depleted, expelled out of exits designed for heavy-flow expulsion. And then,
of course, the food itself. There are tall Kaopectate-colored shacks that sell
Illinois Dairy Council milk shakes for an off-the-scale $2.50--though they're
mind-bendingly good milk shakes, silky and so thick they don't even insult
your intelligence with a straw or spoon, giving you instead a kind of plastic
trowel. There are uncountable pork options--Paulie's Pork Out, The Pork Patio,
Freshfried Pork Skins, The Pork Avenue Cafe. The Pork Avenue Cafe is a "100
Percent All-Pork Establishment," says its loudspeaker. No way I'm eating any
pork after this morning's swine stress, anyway. And it is at least ninety-five
degrees in the shade, and due east of Livestock the breeze is, shall we say,
fragrant. But food is being bought and ingested at an incredible clip all up
and down the path. Everyone's packed in, eating and walking, moving slowly,
twenty abreast, sweating, shoulders rubbing, the air spicy with armpits and
Coppertone, cheek to jowl, a peripatetic feeding frenzy. Fifteen percent of
the female fairgoers here have their hair in curlers. Forty percent are
clinically fat. By the way, Midwestern fat people have no compunction about
wearing shorts or halter tops. The food booths are ubiquitous, and each one
has a line before it. Zipper or no, Native Companion is "storved," she says,
"to daith." She puts on a parodic hick accent whenever I use a term like
"peripatetic."

There are Lemon Shake-Ups, Ice Cold Melon Man booths, Citrus Push-Ups, and
Hawaiian Shaved Ice you can suck the syrup out of and then crunch the ice. But
a lot of what's getting bought and gobbled is not hot-weather food at all:
bright-yellow popcorn that stinks of salt; onion rings as big as leis; Poco
Penos Stuffed Jalapeno Peppers; Zorba's Gyros; shiny fried chicken; Bert's
Burritos--"Big As You're [sic] Head"; hot Italian beef, hot New York City
beef, Jojo's Quick Fried Doughnuts; pizza by the shingle-sized slice; and
chitlins and crab Rangoon and Polish sausage. There are towering plates of
"Curl Fries," which are pubic-hair-shaped and make people's fingers shine in
the sun. Cheez-Dip hot dogs. Pony pups. Hot fritters. Philly steak. Ribeye BBQ
Corral. Joanie's Original 1/2-lb. Burgers booth's sign says "2 Choices--Rare
or Mooin'." I can't believe people eat this stuff in this kind of heat.
There's the green reek of fried tomatoes. The sky is cloudless and galvanized,
and the sun fairly pulses. The noise of deep fryers forms a grisly
sound-carpet all up and down the paths. The crowd moves at one slow pace,
eating, densely packed between the rows of booths. The Original 1-1b.
Butterfly Pork Chop booth has a sign: "Pork: The Other White Meat"--the only
discernible arm wave to the health-conscious. This is the Midwest: no nachos,
no chili, no Evian, nothing Cajun. But holy mackerel, are there sweets: fried
dough, black walnut taffy, fiddlesticks, hot Crackerjack. Caramel apples for a
felonious $1.50. Angel's Breath, known also as Dentist's Delight. There's
All-Butter Fudge, Rice Krispie--squarish things called Krakkles. Angel Hair
cotton candy. There are funnel cakes: cake batter quick-fried to a tornadic
spiral and rolled in sugared butter. Another artery clogger. elephant ears, an
album-sized expanse of oil-fried dough slathered with butter and
cinnamon-sugar--cinnamon toast from hell. No one is in line for ears except
the morbidly obese.

1:10 P.M.

"Here we've got as balanced in dimension a heifer as any you'll see today. A
high-volume heifer, but also solid on mass. Good to look at in terms of rib
length to depth. Depth of forerib. Notice the depth of flank on the front
quarter, We'd like to see maybe perhaps a little more muscle mass on the rear
flank. Still, an outstanding heifer."

We're in the Jr. Livestock Center. The ring of cows moves around the perimeter
of the dirt circle, each led by an ag-family kid. The "Jr." apparently refers
to the owners, not the animals. Each cow's kid holds a long poker with a
right-angled tooth at its end and prods the cow into the center of the ring to
move in a tighter circle. The beef-show official is dressed just like the kids
in the ring--dark new stiff jeans, check shirt, bandanna around neck. On him
it doesn't look goofy. Plus he's got a stunning white cowboy hat. While Ms.
Illinois Beef Queen presides from a dais decked with flowers sent over from
the horticulture show, the official stands in the arena itself, his legs apart
and his thumbs in his belt, 100 percent man, radiating livestock savvy. "Okay
this next heifer, a lot of depth of rib but a little tighter in the fore Hank.
A bit tighter-flanked, if you will, from the standpoint of capacity."

The owners--farm kids, deep-rural kids from back-of-beyond counties like
Piatt, Moultrie, Vermilion, all here because they're county-fair winners--are
earnest, nervous, pride-puffed. Dressed rurally up. Straw-colored crewcuts.
High number of freckles per capita. Kids remarkable for a kind of classic
Rockwellian USA averageness, the products of balanced diets, vigorous daily
exertion, and solid GOP upbringings. The Jr. Livestock Center bleachers are
half-full, and it is all ag-people, parents mostly, many with video cameras.
Cowhide vests and ornate dress-boots and simply amazing hats. Illinois farmers
are rural and inarticulate, but they are not poor. Just the amount of
revolving credit you need to capitalize a hundred-acre operation--seed and
herbicides, heavy equipment and crop insurance--makes a lot of them
millionaires on paper. Media dirges notwithstanding, banks are no more keen to
foreclose on Midwestern farms than they are on Third World nations; they're in
that deeply. Nobody here wears sunglasses; everyone's in long pants and tanned
in an earth-tone, all-business way. And if the fair's ag-pros are also stout,
it is in a harder, squarer, somehow more earned way than the tourists on the
paths outside. The fathers in the bleachers have bushy brows and simply
enormous thumbs, I notice. Native Companion keeps making growly throat noises
about the beef official. The Jr. Livestock Center is cool and dim and spicy
with livestock. The atmosphere is good-natured but serious. Nobody's eating
any booth-food, and nobody's carrying the fair's complimentary "Governor
Edgar" shopping bags.

"An excellent heifer from a profile standpoint."

"Here we have a low-volume heifer, but with exceptional mass in the rear
quarter."

I can't tell whose cow is winning.

"Certainly the most extreme heifer out here in terms of frame to depth."

Some of the cows look drugged. Maybe they're just superbly trained. You can
imagine these farm kids getting up so early they can see their breath and
leading their cows in practice circles under the cold stars, then having to do
their chores. I feel good in here. The cows all have colored ribbons on their
tails. They are shampooed and mild-eyed and lovely, incontinence
notwithstanding. They're also assets. The ag-lady beside us says her family's
operation will "realize" perhaps $2,500 for the Hereford in the Winners
Auction coming up. Illinois farmers call their farms "operations," rarely
"farms" and never "spreads." The lady says $2,500 is "maybe about around half"
what the ag-family has spent on the heifer's breeding and care. "We do this
for pride," she says. This is more like it--pride, care, selfless expense. The
little boy's chest puffs out as the official tips his blinding hat. Farm
spirit. Oneness with crop and stock. The ag-lady says that the official is a
beef buyer for a major Peoria packing plant and that the bidders in the
upcoming auction (five brown suits and three string ties on the dais) are from
McDonald's, Burger King, White Castle, etc. Meaning that the mild-eyed winners
have been sedulously judged as meat. The ag-lady has a particular bone to pick
with McDonald's, "'cause they always come tn and overbid high on the champions
and don't care about nothing else. Mess up the pricing." Her husband confirms
they got "screwed back to front" on last year's bidding.

3:00 P.M.

We hurtle here and there. Paid attendance today is 100,000-plus. A scum of
clouds cuts the heat, but I'm on my third shirt. Society horse show at
Coliseum. Wheat-weaving demonstration in Hobbies, Arts & Crafts Building.
Peonies like supernovas in the horticulture' tent. I have no time. I'm getting
a sort of visual-overload headache. Native Companion is also stressed. And
we're not the only tourists with this pinched glazed hurry-up look--there are
just too damn many things to experience. Arm. wrestling finals where bald men
fart audibly with effort. Drum and bugle competition in Miller Beer tent.
Corn-fed girls in overalls cut off at the pockets. Everyone's very excited at
everything. Tottery Ronald McD. is working the crowd at Club Mickey D's 3-on-3
Hoops. Three of the six basketball players are black, the first I've seen
since Mrs. Edgar's hired kids. Pygmy Goat Show at Goat Barn. Native Companion
has zinc oxide on her nose. I'm sure we'll miss something.

4:05 P.M.

We're about 100 yards shy of the Poultry Building when I break down. I've been
a rock about the prospect of poultry all day, but now my nerve goes. I can't
go in there. Listen to the thousands of sharp squawking beaks in there, I say.
Native Companion not unkindly offers to hold my hand, talk me through it. It
is 100 degrees and I have pygmy-goat shit on my shoe and am almost crying with
fear and embarrassment. I have to sit down on a green bench to collect myself.
The noise of the Poultry Building is horrifying. I think this is what insanity
must sound like. No wonder madmen clutch their heads. There's a thin stink.
Bits of feather float. I hunch on the bench. We're high on a ridge overlooking
the carnival rides. When I was eight, at the Champaign County Fair, I was
pecked without provocation, flown at and pecked by a renegade fowl, savagely,
just under the right eye.

Sitting on the bench, I watch the carnies way below. They mix with no one,
never seem to leave Happy Hollow. Late tonight, I'll watch them drop flaps to
turn their booths into tents. They'll smoke cheap dope and drink peppermint
schnapps and pee out onto the midway's dirt. I guess they're the gypsies of
the rural United States--itinerant, insular, swarthy, unclean, not to be
trusted. You are in no way drawn to them. They all have the same blank hard
eyes as people in the bathrooms of East Coast bus terminals. They want your
money and maybe to look up your skirt; beyond that you're just blocking the
view. Next week they'll dismantle and pack and haul up to the Wisconsin State
Fair, where they'll never set foot off the midway they pee on.

While I'm watching from the bench, an old withered man in an Illinois Poultry
Association cap careers past on one of those weird three-wheeled carts, like a
turbo-charged wheelchair, and runs neatly over my, sneaker. This ends up being
my one unassisted interview of the day, and it's brief The man keeps revving
his cart's engine like a biker. "Traish," he calls the carnies. "Lowlifes." He
gestures down at the twirling rides. "Wouldn't let my own kids go off down
there on a goddamn bet." He raises pullets down near Olney. He has something
in his cheek. "Steal you blind. Drug-addicted and such. Swindle you nekked
them games. Traish. Me, I ever year we drive up, I carry my wallet like this
here." He points to his hip. His wallet's on a big steel clip attached to a
wire on his belt; the whole thing looks vaguely electrified. Q: "But do they
want to? Your kids? Hit the Hollow?" He spits brownly. "Hail no. We all come
for the shows." He means the livestock competitions. "See some folks, talk
stock. Drink a beer. Work all year round raising 'em for show birds. It's for
pride. And to see folks. Shows're over Tuesday, why, we go on home." He looks
like a bird himself. His face is mostly nose, his skin loose and pebbly like
poultry's. His eyes are the color of denim. "Rest of this here's for city
people." Spits. He means Springfield, Decatur, Normal. "Walk around, stand in
line, eat junk, buy soovneers. Give their wallet to the traish. Don't even
know there's folks come here to work up here." He gestures up at the barns,
then spits again, leaning way out over the cart to do it. "We come up to work,
see some folks. Drink a beer. Bring our own goddamn food. Mother packs a
hamper. Hail, what we'd want to go on down there for? No folks we know down
there." He laughs. Asks my name. "It is good to see folks," he says before
leaving me and peeling out in his chair, heading for the chicken din. "We all
stayin' up to the motel. Watch your wallet, boy."

AUGUST 14, 6:00 A.M.

The dawn is foggy. The sky looks like soap. It rained in brutal sheets last
night, damaged tents, tore up corn near my motel. Midwestern thunderstorms are
real Old Testament temple clutchers: Richter-scale thunder, big zigzags of
cartoon lightning. Happy Hollow is a bog as I walk along the midway, passing
an enfilade of snores from the booths and tents. Native Companion went home
last night. My sneakers are already soaked. Someone behind the flaps of the
Shoot-2D-Ducks-With-An-Air-Rifle booth is having a wicked coughing fit,
punctuated with obscenities. Distant sounds of garbage Dumpsters being
emptied. The Blomsness-Thebault management trailer has a blinky electric
burglar alarm on it. The goddamn roosters in the Poultry Building are at it
already. Thunder-mutters way off east over Indiana. The trees shudder and shed
drops in the breeze. The paths are empty, eerie, shiny with rain.

6:20 A.M.

Sheep Barn, I am looking at legions of sleeping sheep. I am the only waking
human in here. It is cool and quiet. Sheep excrement has an evil vomity edge
to it, but olfactorily it is not too bad in here. One or two sheep are upright
but silent. No fewer than four ag-pros are also in the pens, sleeping right up
next to their sheep, about which the less speculation the better as far as I'm
concerned. The roof in here is leaky and most of the straw is sopping. In here
are yearling ewes, brood ewes, ewe lambs, fall lambs. There are. signs on
every pen. We've got Corriedales, Hampshires, Dorset Horns, Columbias. You
could get a Ph.D. just in sheep, from the looks of it. Rambouillets, Oxfords,
Suffolks, Shropshires, Cheviots, Southdowns. Outside again, undulating ghosts
of fog on the fairground paths. Everything set up but no one about. A creepy
air of hasty abandonment.

8:20 A.M.

Press room, fourth floor, Illinois Building. I'm the only credentialed member
of the press without a little plywood cubbyhole for mail and press releases.
Two guys from an ag-newspaper are trying to hook a fax machine up to a rotary
phone jack. A state-fair PR guy arrives for the daily press briefing. We have
coffee and unidentifiable muffinish things, compliments of Wal-Mart. This
afternoon's highlights: Midwest Truck and Tractor Pull, the "Bill Oldani 100"
U.S.A.C. auto race. Tonight's Grandstand show is to be the poor old doddering
Beach Boys, who I suspect now must make their entire living from state fairs.
The special guest is America, another poor old doddering group. The PR guy
cannot give away all his free press passes to the concert. I learn that I
missed some law-and-order dramatics yesterday: two Zipper-riding minors were
detained last night when a vial of crack fell from the pocket of one of them
and direct-hit a state trooper alertly eating a Lemon Push-Up on the midway
below. Also reported: a rape or date rape in Parking Lot 6, assorted buncos
and D&D's. Two reporters also vomited on from great heights in two separate
incidents under two separate Near-Death-Experience rides, trying to cover the
Hollow.

8:40 A.M.

A Macy's-float-sized inflatable Ronald, seated and eerily Buddha-like,
presides over the Club Mickey D's tent. A family is having their picture taken
in front of the inflatable Ronald, arranging their little kids in a careful
pose.

8:42 A.M.

Fourth trip to the bathroom in three hours. Elimination can be a dicey
undertaking here. The fair has scores of Midwest Pottyhouse-brand portable
toilets--man-sized plastic huts, somewhat reminiscent of Parisian pissoirs,
each with its own undulating shroud of flies, and your standard heavy-use
no-flush outhouse smell--and I for one would rather succumb to a rupture than
use a Pottyhouse, though the lines for them are long and cheery. The only real
rest rooms are in the big exhibit buildings. The Coliseum's is like a
grade-school boys' room, especially the long communal urinal, a kind of huge
porcelain trough. Performance anxieties and other fears abound here, with
upwards of twenty guys flanking and facing one another, each with his unit
out. The highlight is watching Midwestern ag-guys struggle with suspenders and
overall straps as they exit the stalls.

9:30 A.M.

I'm once again at the capacious McDonald's tent, at the edge, the titanic
inflatable clown presiding. There's a fair-sized crowd in the basketball
bleachers at one side and rows of folding chairs on another. It's the Illinois
State Jr. Baton-Twirling Finals. A metal loudspeaker begins to emit disco, and
little girls pour into the tent from all directions, gamboling and twirling in
vivid costumes. In the stands, video cameras come out by the score, and I can
tell it's pretty much just me and a thousand parents.

The baroque classes and divisions, both team and solo, go from age three(!) to
sixteen, with epithetic signifiers--the four-year-olds compose the Sugar 'N'
Spice division, and so on. I'm in a chair up front behind the competition's
judges, introduced as "varsity twirlers" from (oddly) the University of
Kansas. They are four frosted blondes who smile a lot and blow huge grape
bubbles.

The twirler squads are all from different towns. Mount Vernon and Kankakee
seem especially rich in twirlers. The twirlers' spandex costumes, differently
colored for each team, are paint-tight and brief in the legs. The coaches are
grim, tan, lithe-looking women, clearly twirlers once, on the far side of
their glory now and very serious-looking, each with a clipboard and whistle.
The teams go into choreographed routines, each routine with a title and a
designated disco or show tune, full of compulsory baton-twirling maneuvers
with highly technical names. A mother next to me is tracking scores on what
looks almost like an astrology chart, and is in no mood to explain anything to
a novice baton watcher.

The routines are wildly complex, and the loudspeaker's play-by-play is mostly
in code. All I can determine for sure is that I've bumbled into what has to be
the most spectator-hazardous event at the fair. Missed batons go all over,
whistling wickedly. The three-, four, and five-year-olds aren't that
dangerous, though they do spend most of their time picking up dropped batons
and trying to hustle back into place--the parents of especially fumble-prone
twirlers howl in fury from the stands while the coaches chew gum grimly. But
the smaller girls don't really have the arm strength to endanger anybody,
although one judge takes a Sugar 'N' Spice's baton across the bridge of the
nose and has to be helped from the tent.

But when the sevens and eights hit the floor for a series of "Armed Service
medleys" (spandex with epaulets and officers' caps and batons over shoulders
like M16s), errant batons start pin-wheeling into the ceiling, tent's sides,
and crowd, all with real force. I myself duck several times. A man just down
the row takes one in the solar plexus and falls out of his metal chair with a
horrid crash. The batons are embossed "Regulation Length" on the shaft and
have white rubber stoppers on each end, but it is that hard dry kind of
rubber, and the batons themselves aren't light. I don't think it's an accident
that police nightsticks are also called service batons.

Physically, even within same-age teams, there are marked incongruities in size
and development. One nine-year-old is several heads taller than another, and
they're trying to do a complex back-and-forth duet thing with just one baton,
which ends up taking out a bulb in one of the tent's steel hanging lamps,
showering part of the stands with glass. A lot of the younger twirlers look
either anorexic or gravely ill. There are no fat baton twirlers.

A team of ten-year-olds in the Gingersnap class have little cotton bunny tails
on their costume bottoms and rigid papier-mache ears, and they can do some
serious twirling. A squad of eleven-year-olds from Towanda does an involved
routine in tribute to Operation Desert Storm. To most of the acts there's
either a cutesy ultrafeminine aspect or a stem butch military one, with little
in between. Starting with the twelve-year-olds--one team in black spandex that
looks like cheesecake leotards--there is, I'm afraid, a frank sexuality that
begins to get uncomfortable. Oddly, it's the cutesy feminine performances that
result in the serious audience casualties. A dad standing up near the top of
the stands with a Toshiba video camera to his eye takes a tomahawking baton
directly in the groin and falls over on somebody eating a funnel cake, and
they take out good bits of several rows below them, and there's an extended
halt to the action, during which I decamp. As I clear the last row of chairs
yet another baton comes wharp-wharping cruelly right over my shoulder,
caroming viciously off big Ronald's inflated thigh.

11:05 A.M.

The Expo Building, a huge enclosed mall-like thing, AC'd down to eighty
degrees, with a gray cement floor and a hardwood mezzanine overhead. Every
interior inch is given over to commerce of a special and lurid sort. Just
inside the big east entrance, a man with a headset mike is slicing up a block
of wood and then a tomato, standing on a box in a booth that says "SharpKut,"
hawking these spin-offs of Ginsu knives, "As Seen on TV." Next door is a booth
offering personalized pet-ID tags. Another for the, infamous
mail-order-advertised Clapper, which turns on appliances automatically at the
sound of two hands clapping (but also at the sound of a cough, sneeze, or
sniff, I discover; caveat emptor). There's booth after booth, each with an
audience whose credulity seems sincere. A large percentage of booths show
signs of hasty assembly and say "As Seen on TV" in bright brave colors. The
salesmen all stand on raised platforms; all have headset mikes and rich
neutral media voices.

The Copper Kettle All-Butter Fudge booth does a brisk air-conditioned
business. There's something called a Full Immersion Body Fat Analysis for
$8.50. A certain CompuVac, Inc., offers a $1.50 Computerized Personality
Analysis. Its booth's computer panel is tall and full of blinking lights and
reel-to-reel tapes, like an old bad sci-fi-film computer. My own Personality
Analysis, a slip of paper that protrudes like a tongue from a red-lit slot,
says, "Your Boldness of Nature Is Ofset [sic] with the Fear of Taking Risk."
There's a booth that offers clock faces superimposed on varnished photorealist
paintings of Christ, John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe. There's a Computerized
Posture Evaluation booth. A lot of the headsetted vendors are about my age or
younger. Something overscrubbed about them suggests a Bible-college
background. It is just cool enough in here for a sweat-soaked shirt to get
clammy. One vendor recites a pitch for Ms. Suzanne Somers's Thighmaster while
a woman in a leotard demonstrates the product, lying on her side on the
fiberboard counter. I'm in the Expo Building almost two hours, and every time
I look up the poor woman's still at it with the Thighmaster. Most of the
vendors won't answer questions and give me beady looks when I stand there
making notes. But the Thighmaster lady, cheerful, friendly, violently
cross-eyed, informs me she gets an hour off for lunch at 2:00 p.m., then goes
another eight hours to closing at 11:00 p.m. I say her thighs must be pretty
dam well Mastered by now, and her leg sounds like a banister when she raps her
knuckle against it. We both have a laugh, until her vendor asks me to scram.

Booth after booth. A Xanadu of chintzola. Obscure non-stick cookware. "Eye
Glasses Cleaned Free." A booth with anti-cellulite sponges. Dippin' Dots
futuristic ice cream. A woman with Velcro straps on her sneakers gets
fountain-pen ink out of a linen tablecloth with a Chapsticky-looking spot
remover whose banner says "As Seen on TV's |Amazing Discoveries,'" a
late-night infomercial I'm kind of a fan of. A booth that for $9.95 will take
a photo and superimpose your face on either an FBI Wanted poster or a
Penthouse cover. An "MIA--Bring Them Home!" booth staffed by women playing Go
Fish. An anti-abortion booth called Lifesavers that lures you over with little
candies. Sand art. Shredded-ribbon art. A booth for "Latest Advance! Rotary
Nose Hair Clippers" whose other sign reads (I kid you not), "Do Not Pull Hair
From Nose, May Cause Fatal Infection." Two different booths for collectible
sports-star cards, "Top Ranked Investment of the Nineties." And tucked way
back on one curve of the mezzanine's ellipse--yes--black-velvet paintings,
including--yes--several of Elvis in pensive poses.

Also on display is the expo's second economy--the populist evangelism of the
rural Midwest. It is not your cash they want but to "Make a Difference in Your
Life." And they make no bones about it. A Church of God booth offers a
Computerized Bible Quiz. Its computer is CompuVacish in appearance. I go
eighteen for twenty on the quiz and am invited behind a chamois curtain for a
"person-to-person faith exploration," which no thanks. The conventional
vendors get along fine with the Baptists and Jews for Jesus who operate booths
right near them. They all laugh and banter back and forth. The SharpKut guy
sends all the vegetables he's microsliced over to the Lifesavers booth, where
they put them out with the candy. The scariest spiritual booth is right up
near the west exit, where something called Covenant Faith Triumphant Church
has a big hanging banner that asks, "What Is the ONE Man Made Thing Now in
Heaven?" and I stop to ponder, which with charismatics is death, because a
heavy-browed woman is out around the booth's counter like a shot and into my
personal space. She says, "Give up? Give up do you?" She's looking at me very
intensely, but there's something about her gaze: it is like she's looking at
my eyes rather than in them. "What one man-made thing?" I ask. She puts a
finger to her palm and makes screwing motions. Signifying coitus? I don't say
"coitus" out loud, though. "Not but one thing," she says. "The holes in
Christ's palms," screwing her finger in. Except isn't it pretty well known
that Roman crucifees were nailed at the wrists, since paim-flesh won't support
weight? But now I've been drawn into the dialogue, going so far as to let her
take my arm and pull me toward the booth's counter. "Lookee here for a second
now," she says. She has both hands around my arm. A Midwestern child of
humanist academics gets trained early on to avoid these weird-eyed eager rural
Christians who accost your space, to say "Not interested" at the front door
and "No thanks" to mimeoed pamphlets, to look right through streetcorner
missionaries like they were stemming for change. But the woman drags me toward
the Covenant Faith counter, where a fine oak box rests, a sign propped on it:
"Where Will YOU Be When YOU Look Like THIS?" "Take a look-see in here," the
woman says. The box has a hole in its top. I peek. Inside the box is a human
skull. I'm pretty sure it's plastic. The interior lighting is tricky, but I'm
pretty sure the skull isn't genuine. I haven't inhaled for several minutes.
The woman is looking at the side of my face. "Are you sure? is the question,"
she says. I manage to make my straightening-up motion lead right into a
backing-away motion. "Are you a hunderd percent sure?" Overhead, on the
mezzanine, the Thighmaster lady is still at it, smiling cross-eyed into space.

1:36 P.M.

I'm on a teetery stool watching the Illinois Prairie Cloggers competition in a
structure called the Twilight Ballroom that's packed with ag-folks and well
over 100 degrees. I'd nipped in here only to get a bottle of soda pop on my
way to the Truck and Tractor Pull. By now the pull's got to be nearly over,
and in half an hour the big U.S.A.C. dirt-track auto race starts. But I cannot
tear myself away from the scene in here. I'd imagined goony Jed Clampett types
in tattered hats and hobnail boots, a-stompin' and a-whoopin', etc. I guess
clogging, Scotch-Irish in origin and the dance of choice in Appalachia, did
used to involve actual clogs and boots and slow stomps. But clogging has now
miscegenated with square dancing and honky-tonk boogie to become a kind of
intricately synchronized, absolutely kick-ass country tap dance.

There are teams from Pekin, Le Roy, Rantoul, Cairol Morton. They each do three
numbers. The music is up-tempo country or dance-pop. Each team has anywhere
from four to ten dancers. Few of the women are under thirty-five, fewer still
under 175 pounds. They're country mothers, red-cheeked gals with bad dye jobs
and big pretty legs. They wear western-wear tops and midiskirts with multiple
ruffled slips underneath; and every once in a while they grab handfuls of
cloth and flip the skirts up like cancan dancers. When they do this they
either yip or whoop, as the spirit moves them. The men all have thinning hair
and cheesy rural faces, and their skinny legs are rubberized blurs. The men's
western shirts have piping on the chest and shoulders. The teams are all
color-coordinated--blue and white, black and red. The white shoes all the
dancers wear look like golf shoes with metal taps clamped on.

Their numbers are to everything from Waylon and Tammy to Aretha, Miami Sound
Machine, Neil Diamond's "America." The routines have some standard tap-dance
moves--sweep, flare, chorus-line kicking. But it is fast and sustained and
choreographed down to the last wrist-flick. And square dancing's genes can be
seen in, the upright, square-shouldered postures on the floor, and there's a
kind of florally enfolding tendency to the choreography, some of which uses
high-speed promenades. But it is methedrine-paced and exhausting to watch
because your own feet move; and it is erotic in a way that makes MTV look
lame. The cloggers' feet are too fast to be seen, really, but they all tap out
the exact same rhythm. A typical routine is something like:
tatatatatatatatatatata. The variations around the basic rhythm are baroque.
When they kick or spin, the two-beat absence of tap complexifies the pattern.

The audience is packed in right to the edge of the portable hardwood flooring.
The teams are mostly married couples. The men are either rail-thin or have big
hanging guts. A couple of the men on a blue-and-white team are great fluid
Astaire-like dancers, but mostly it is the women who compel. The men have
constant smiles, but the women look orgasmic; they're the really serious ones,
transported. Their yips and whoops are involuntary, pure exclamation. They are
arousing. The audience claps savvily on the backbeat and whoops when the women
do. It is almost all folks from the ag and livestock shows--the flannel
shirts, khaki pants, seed caps and freckles. The spectators are soaked in
sweat and extremely happy. I think this is the ag-community's special treat, a
chance here to cut loose a little while their animals sleep in the heat. The
transactions between cloggers and crowd seem synecdochic of the fair as a
whole: a culture talking to itself, presenting credentials for its own
inspection, bean farmers and herbicide brokers and 4-H sponsors and people who
drive pickup trucks because they really need them. They eat non-fair food from
insulated hampers and drink beer and pop and stomp in perfect time and put
their hands on neighbors' shoulders to shout in their ears while the cloggers
whirl and fling sweat on the crowd.

There are no black people in the Twilight Ball-room, the awakened looks on the
younger ag-kids' faces have this astonished aspect, like they didn't realize
their race could dance like this. Three married couples from Rantoul, wearing
full western bodysuits the color of raw coal, weave an incredible filigree of
high-speed tap around Aretha's "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," and there's no hint of racial
irony in the room; the song has been made this people's own, emphatically.
This Nineties version of clogging does have something sort of pugnaciously
white about it, a kind of performative nose-thumbing at M.C. Hammer. There's
an atmosphere in the room--not racist, but aggressively white. It's hard to
describe--the atmosphere is the same at a lot of rural Midwest events. It is
not like a black person who came in would be ill treated; it's more like it
would just never occur to a black person to come here.

I can barely hold the tablet still to scribble journalistic impressions, the
floor is rumbling under so many boots and sneakers. The record player is
old-fashioned, the loudspeakers are shitty, and it sounds fantastic. Two of
the dancing Rantoul wives are fat, but with great legs. Who could practice
this kind of tapping as much as they must and stay fat? I think maybe rural
Midwestern women are just congenitally big. But these people clogging get
down. And they do it as a troupe, a collective, with none of the narcissistic
look-at-me grandstanding of great dancers in rock clubs. They hold hands and
whirl each other around and in and out, tapping like mad, their torsos upright
and almost formal, as if only incidentally attached to the blur of legs below.
It goes on and on. I'm rooted to my stool. Each team seems the best yet. In
the crowd's other side across the floor I can see the old poultry farmer, he
of the carny hatred and electrified wallet. He's still got his poultry cap on,
making a megaphone of his hands to whoop with the women, leaning way forward
in his geriatric scooter, body bobbing like he's stomping in time, while his
little cowboy boots stay clamped in their stays.

4:36 P.M.

Trying to hurry to the Grandstand, eating a corn dog cooked in 100 percent
soybean oil. I can hear the hornety engines of the U.S.A.C. 100 race. A huge
plume of track dust hangs over the Grandstand. Tinny burble of excited PA
announcer. The corn dog tastes strongly of soybean oil, which itself tastes
like corn oil that's been strained through an old gym towel. Tickets for the
race are an obscene $13.50. Baton twirling is still under way in Club Mickey
D's tent. A band called Captain Rat & the Blind Rivets is playing at Lincoln
Stage, and as I pass I can see dancers in there. They look jagged and
arrhythmic and blank, bored in that hip young East Coast way, facing in
instead of out, not touching their partners. The people not dancing don't even
look at them, and after the clogging the whole thing looks unspeakably numb
and lonely.

4:45 P.M.

The official name of the race is the William "Wild Bill" Oldani Memorial 100
Sprint Car Race of the Valvoline-U.S.A.C. Silver Crown Series. The Grandstand
seats 9,800 and is packed. The noise is beyond belief. The race is nearly
over: the electric sign on the infield says "LAP 92." The leader is number 26,
except his black-and-green Skoal car is in the middle of the pack. Apparently
he's lapped people. The crowd is mostly men, very tan, smoking, 70 percent,
with mustaches and billed caps with automotive associations. Most of them wear
earplugs; the ones in the real know wear thick airline-worker noise-filter
headsets. The seventeen-page program is almost impenetrable. There are either
forty-nine or fifty cars, called either Pro Dirt or Silver Crown, and they're
basically go-carts from hell, with a soapbox-derby chassis and huge dragster
tires, gleaming tangles of pipes and spoilers jutting out all over, and
unabashedly phallic bulges up front. The program says these models are what
they used to race at Indy in the 1950s. The cars' cockpits are open and webbed
in straps and roll bars; the drivers wear helmets the same color as their
cars, with white masks on their face to keep out the choking dust. The cars
come in all hues. Most look to be sponsored by either Skoal or Marlboro. Pit
crews in surgical white lean out into the track and flash obscure commands
written on little chalk-boards. The infield is clotted with trailers and tow
trucks and officials' stands and electric signs. Women in skimpy tops stand on
some of the trailers, seeming very partisan.

I can barely take my hands off my ears long enough to turn the program's
pages. The cars sound almost like jen--that insectile scream--but with a
diesely, lawn-mowerish component you can feet in your skull. The seating is on
just one side of the Grandstand, on the straightaway, and when the mass of
cars passes it's unendurable: your very skeleton hurts from the noise, and
your ears are still belling when they come around again. The cars go like mad
bats on the straight-aways and then shift down for the tight turns, their rear
tires wobbling in the dirt. Certain cars pass other cars, and some people
cheer when they d6. Down at the bottom of the section a little boy held up by
his father is rigid, facing away from the track, his hands clamped over his
ears so hard his elbows stick way out, and his face is a rictus of pain when
they pass. The little boy and I sort of rictus at each other. A fine dirty
dust hangs in the air and coats everything, including tongues. Then all of a
sudden binoculars come out and everyone stands as there's some sort of
screeching slide and crash on a far turn, all the way across the infield; and
firemen in slickers and hats go racing out there in full-sized fire trucks,
and the PA voice's pitch goes way up but is still incomprehensible, and a man
with those airline earmuffs in the officials' stand leans out and flails at
the air with a bright-yellow flag, and the go-carts throttle down to autobahn
speed, and the pace car, a Trans Am, comes out and leads them around, and
everybody stands, and I stand too. It is impossible to see anything but a
swizzle stick of smoke above the far turn, and the engine noise is endurable
and the PA silent, and the relative quiet hangs there while we all wait for
news; and I look around at all the faces below the raised binoculars, but it's
not at all clear what we're hoping for.

5:30 P.M.

Ten-minute line for a chocolate milk shake. Oily blacktop stink on heated
paths. I ask a little boy to describe the taste of his funnel cake, and he
runs away. My ears are still mossily ringing--everything sounds car-phonish.
Display of a 17.6-lb. zucchini squash outside the Agri-Industries Pavilion.
One big zucchini, all right. In the Coliseum, the only historical evidence of
the tractor pulls is huge ideograms of tire tracks, mounds of scored dirt,
dark patches of tobacco juice, smells of burnt rubber and oil. Nearby is a bus
on display from the city of Peoria's All-Ethanol Bus System; it is painted to
resemble a huge ear of corn.

6:00 P.M.

Back again at the seemingly inescapable club Mickey D's. The tent is now set
up for Illinois Golden Gloves Boxing. Out on the floor is a square of four
boxing rings. The rings are made out of clothesline and poles anchored by
cement-filled tires, one ring per age division: Sixteens, Fourteens, Twelves,
Tens(!). Here's another unhyped but rivetihg spectacle. If you want to see
genuine violence, go check out a Golden Gloves tourney. None of your adult
pros' silky footwork or Rope, a-Dope defenses here. Here human asses are
thoroughly kicked in what are essentially playground brawls with white-tipped
gloves and brain-shaped head guards. The combatants' tank tops say things like
"Peoria' Jr. Boxing" and "Elgin Fight Club." The rings corners have stools for
the kids to sit on and get worked over by their teams' coaches. The coaches
are clearly dads: florid, blue-jawed, bull-necked, flinty-eyed men who oversee
sanctioned brawls. Now a fighter's mouth guard goes flying out of the
Fourteens' ring, end over end, trailing strings of spit, and the crowd around
that ring howls. In the Sixteens' ring is a local Springfield kid, Darrell
Hall, against a slim fluid Latino, Sullivano, from Joliet. Hall outweighs
Sullivano by a good twenty pounds. Hall also looks like every kid who ever
beat me up in high school, right down to the wispy mustache and upper lip's
cruel twist. The crowd around the Sixteens' ring is all his friends--guys with
muscle shirts and gym shorts and gelled hair, girls in cutoff overalls and
complex systems of barrettes. There are repeated shouts of "Kick his ass,
Darrell!" The Latino sticks and moves. Somebody in this tent is smoking a
joint, I can smell. The Sixteens can actually box. The ceiling's lights are
bare bulbs in steel cones, hanging cockeyed from a day of batons. Everybody
here pours sweat. The reincarnation of every high-school cheerleader I ever
pined for is in the Sixteens' crowd. The girls cry out and frame their faces
with their hands when Darrell gets hit. I do not know why cut-off overall
shorts have evaded the East Coast's fashion ken; they are devastating. The
fight in Fourteens is stopped for a moment to let the ref wipe a gout of blood
from one kid's glove. Sullivano glides and jabs, orbiting Hall. Hall is
implacable, a hunched and feral fighter, boring in. Air explodes through his
nose when he lands a blow. He keeps trying to back the Latino against the
clothesline. People cool themselves with wood-handled fans from the Democratic
Party. Big hairy mosquitoes work the crowd. The refs keep slapping at their
necks. The rain has been heavy, and the mosquitoes are the bad kind,
field-bred and rapacious. I can also see the Tens from this vantage, a vicious
free-for-all between two tiny kids whose head guards make their skulls look
too big for their bodies. Neither ten-year-old has any interest in defense.
Their shoes' toes touch as they windmill at each other, scoring at will. Scary
dads chew gum in their comers. One kid's mouth guard keeps falling out. Now
the Sixteens' crowd explodes as their loutish Hall catches Sullivano with an
uppercut that puts him on his bottom. Sullivano gamely rises, but his knees
wobble and he won't face the ref. Hall raises both arms and faces the crowd,
disclosing a missing incisor. The girls betray their cheerleading backgrounds
by clapping and jumping up and down at the same time. Hall shakes his gloves
at the ceiling as several girls call his name, and you can feel it in the
air's very ions: Darrell Hall is going to get laid before the night's over.

The digital thermometer in the Ronald-Buddha's left hand reads ninety-three
degrees at 6:30 P.M. Behind him, big ominous scoop-of-coffee-ice-cream clouds
are massing at the western horizon, but the sun's still above them and very
much a force. People's shadows on the paths are getting pointy. It's the part
of the day when little kids cry from what their parents naively call
exhaustion. Cicadas chirr in the grass by the tent. The ten-year-olds stand
toe to toe and whale the living shit out of each other. It is the sort of
savage mutual beating you see in black-and-white films of old-time fights.
Their ring now has the largest crowd. The fight will be all but impossible to
score. But then it is over in an instant at the second intermission, when one
of the little boys, sitting on his stool, being whispered to by a dad with
tattooed forearms, suddenly throws up. Prodigiously. For no apparent reason.
Maybe a stomach punch recollected in tranquillity. It is kind of surreal.
Vomit flies all over. Kids in the crowd go "Eeeyuuu." The sick fighter starts
to cry. His scary coach and the ref wipe him down and help him from the ring,
not ungently. His opponent, watching, tentatively puts up his arms.

7:30 P.M.

So the old heave-ho is the last thing I see at golden Gloves Boxing and then
the first thing I see at Happy Hollow, right at sunset. Standing on the midway
looking up at the Ring of Fire--a set of flame-colored train cars sent around
and around the inside of a 100-foot neon hoop, the operator stalling the train
at the top and hanging the patrons upside down, jackknifed over their seat
belts, with loose change and eyeglasses raining down--looking up, I witness a
thick coil of vomit arc from a car; it describes a 100-foot spiral and lands
with a meaty splat between two young girls, who took from the ground to each
other with, expressions of slapstick horror. And when the flame train finally
brakes at the ramp, a mortified-looking little kid wobbles off, damp and pale,
staggering over toward a Lemon Shake-Up stand.

This is my last day at the fair, and I've put off a real survey of the
Near-Death Experiences until my last hour. I want to get everything catalogued
before the sun sets. I've already had some distant looks at the nighttime
Hollow and have an idea that being down here in the dark, amid all this
rotating neon and the mechanical clowns and plunging machinery's roar and
jagged screams and barkers' pitches and high-volume rock, would be like the
depiction of a bum acid trip in a bad Sixties movie. It strikes me hardest in
the Hollow that I'm not spiritually Midwestern anymore, and no longer young. I
do not like crowds, screams, amplified noise, or heat. I'll endure them if I
have to, but they're sure not my idea of a magic community-interval. The
crowds in the Hollow, though--mostly high-school couples, local toughs, and
kids in single-sex packs, as the demographics of the fair shift to prime
time--seem radically happy, vivid, somehow awakened, sponges for sensuous
data, not bombarded by the stimuli but feeding on it. It is the first time
I've felt really lonely at the fair.

Nor do I understand why some people will pay money to be careened and
suspended and dropped and whipped back and forth at high speeds and hung
upside down until somebody vomits. It seems to me like paying to be in a
traffic accident. I do not get it; never have. It's not a regional or cultural
thing. I think it's a matter of neurological makeup. The world divides into
those who like the managed induction of terror and those who don't. I do not
find terror exciting. I find it terrifying.

And Happy Hollow, I discover, offers nothing if not managed terror. And not
one but two Tilt-a-Whirls. An experience called Wipe Out straps riders into
fixed seats on a big lit disc that spins with a wobble like a coin that won't
lie down. The Pirate Ship puts forty folks in a plastic galley and swings it
in a pendulous arc until they're facing straight up and then down. The carny
operating the Pirate Ship is made to wear an eye patch and parrot and hook, on
the tip of which hook bums an impaled Marlboro. The operator of the Fun-house
is slumped in a plastic control booth that reeks of sinsemilla.

The 104-foot Giant Gondola Wheel is a staid old Ferris wheel that puts you
facing your seatmate in a kind of steel teacup. Its rotation is stately, but
the cars at the top look like little lit thimbles, and you can hear thin
female screams from up there as their dates grab the teacups' sides and
joggle.

The lines are the longest for the really serious Near-Death Experiences: Ring
of Fire, the Zipper, Hi Roller--which runs a high-speed train around the
inside of an ellipse that is itself spinning at right angles to the train's
motion. The crowds are dense and reek of bug repellent. Boys in Chicago Cubs
shirts clutch their dates as they walk. There's something intensely public
about young Midwestern couples. The girls have tall hair and bee-stung lips,
and their eye makeup runs in the heat and gives them a vampirish aspect. The
overt sexuality of high-school girls is not just a coastal thing. The Amour
Express sends another little train at 60-plus mph around a topologically
wobbled ring, half of which is enclosed in a fiberglass tunnel with neon
hearts and arrows. A fallen packet of Trojans lies near the row of Lucite
cubes in which slack-jawed cranes try to pick up jewelry.

It seems journalistically irresponsible to try to describe the Hollow's rides
without experiencing at least one firsthand. The Kiddie Kopter is a carousel
of miniature Sikorsky prototypes rotating at a sane and dignified clip. The
propellers on each helicopter rotate as well. My copter is a bit snug,
admittedly, even with my knees drawn up to my chest. I get kicked off the
ride, though, when the whole machine's tilt reveals that I weigh quite a bit
more than the maximum 100 pounds; and I have to say that both the little kids
on the ride and the carny in charge were unnecessarily snide about the whole
thing. Each ride has its own PA speaker with its own discharge of adrenalizing
rock; the Kiddie Kopter's speaker is playing George Michael's "I Want Your
Sex." The late-day Hollow itself is an enormous sonic mash from which
different sounds take turns protruding--mostly whistles, sirens, calliopes,
heavy-metal tunes, human screams hard to distinguish from recorded screams.

Both the Thunderboltz and the Octopus hurl free-spinning modular cars around a
topologically complex plane; the Thunderboltz's sides reveal further evidence
of gastric distress. Then there's the Gravitron, basically a centrifuge--an
enclosed, top-shaped structure inside which is a rubberized chamber that spins
so fast you're mashed against the wall like a fly on a windshield. A small boy
stands on one foot tugging the Gravitron operator's khaki sleeve, crying that
he lost a shoe in there. The best description of the carnies' tan is that
they're somehow sinisterly tanned. I notice that many of them have the low
brow and prognathous jaw one associates with fetal alcohol syndrome. The carny
operating the Scooter--bumper cars that are fast, savage, underinsulated, a
sure trip to the chiropractor--has been slumped in the same position in the
same chair every time I've seen him, staring past the frantic cars and tearing
up used ride-tickets with the vacant intensity of someone on a locked ward. I
lean casually against his platform's railing so that my credentials dangle and
ask him in a neighborly way how he keeps from going out of his freaking mind
with the boredom of his job. He turns his head very slowly, revealing a severe
facial tic: "The fuck you talkin' 'bout?"

The same two carnies as before are at the Zipper's controls, in the exact same
clothes, looking up into the full cars and elbowing each other. The midway
smells of machine oil and fried food, smoke and Cutter repellent and
mall-bought adolescent perfume and ripe trash in the beeswarmed cans. The very
Nearest-to-Death ride looks to be the Kamikaze, way down at the west, em end
by the Zyklon roller coaster. Its neon sign has a skull with a headband and
says "Kamikaze." It is a 70-foot pillar of white-painted iron with two 50-foot
hammer-shaped arms hanging down, one on either side. The cars are at the ends
of the arms, twelve-seaters enclosed in clear plastic. The two arms swing
ferociously around, as in 360 degrees, vertically, and in opposite directions,
so that twice on every rotation it looks like your car is going to get smashed
up against the other car, and you can see faces in the other car hurtling
toward you, gray with fear and squishy with G's. An eight-ticket, four-dollar
waking nightmare,

Then I find the worst one. It wasn't even here yesterday. The Sky Coaster
stands regally aloof at the Hollow's far western edge, just past the
Uphill-Bowlin'-for-Dinnerware game, in a kind of grotto formed by trailers and
dismantled machinery. It is a 175-foot construction crane, one of the really
big mothers, with a tank's traction belts instead of wheels, a canary-yellow
cab, and a long proboscis of black steel, towering, canted upward at maybe 70
degrees. This is half the Sky Coaster. The other half is a 100-foot tower
assembly of cross-hatched iron that's been erected about two football fields
to the north of the crane. There's a folding table in front of the clothesline
cordoning off the crane, and a line of people at the table. The woman taking
their money is fiftyish and a compelling advertisement for sunscreen. Behind
her on a vivid blue tarp are two meaty blond guys in Sky Coaster T-shirts
helping the next customer strap himself into what looks like a combination
straitjacket and utility belt, bristling with hooks and clips. From here the
noise of the Hollow behind is both deafening and muffled. My media guide,
sweated into the shape of my butt pocket, says, "If you thought bungee jumping
was a thrill, wait until you soar high above the Fairgrounds on Sky Coaster.
The rider is fastened securely into a full-body harness that hoists them [sic]
onto a tower and releases them to swing in a pendulum-like motion while taking
in a spectacular view of the Fairgrounds below." The signs at the folding
table are more telling: "$40.00. AMEX Visa MC. No Refunds. No Stopping Half
Way Up." The two guys are leading the customer up the stairs of a rolling
platform maybe ten feet high. One guy is at each elbow, and I realize they're
helping hold the customer up. Who would pay $40 for an experience requiring
you to be held up as you walk toward it? There's also something off about the
customer, odd. He's wearing tinted aviator glasses. No one in the rural
Midwest wears aviator glasses, tinted or otherwise. Then I see what it really
is. He's wearing $400 Banfi loafers. Without socks. This guy, now lying prone
on the platform below the crane, is from the East Coast. He's a ringer. I
almost want to shout it. A woman is on the blue tarp, already in harness,
wobbly kneed, waiting her turn. A steel cable descends from the tip of the
crane's proboscis, on its end a fist-sized clip. Another cable leads from the
crane's cab to the tower, up through ring-tipped pitons all up the tower's
side, and over a pulley at its top, another big clip on the end. One of the
guys waves the tower's cable down and brings it over to the platform. The
clips of both cables are attached to the back of the East Coast guy's harness,
fastened and locked. The guy is trying to look around behind him to see
what-all's attached as the two big blonds leave the platform. Another blond
man in the yellow cab throws a lever, and the tower's cable pulls tight in the
grass and up the tower's side and down. The crane's cable stays slack as the
guy is lifted into the air by the tower's cable. The harness covers his shorts
and top, so he looks babe-naked as he rises. The one cable sings with tension
as the East Coaster is pulled slowly to the top of the tower. He's still
stomach-down, limbs wriggling. At a certain height he starts to look like
livestock in a sling. You can tell he's trying to swallow until his face gets
too small to see. Finally he's all the way up at the top of the tower, his ass
against the pulley, trying not to writhe.

I can barely take notes. They cruelly leave him up there a while, slung, a
smile of slack cable between him and the crane's tip. I am constructing a
mental list of the personal violations I would undergo before I'd let anyone
haul me ass-first to a great height and swing me like high-altitude beef. One
of the blond guys has a bullhorn and he's playing to the crowd's suspense,
calling up to the slung East Coaster: "Are. You. Ready." The East Coaster's
response noises are more bovine than human. His tinted aviator glasses hang
askew from just one ear; he doesn't bother to fix them. I can see what's going
to happen. They're going to throw a lever and detach the tower-cable's clip,
and the man in sockless Banfis will free-fall for what will seem forever,
until the slack of the crane's cable is taken up and the line goes taut behind
him and swings him way out over the grounds to the south, his upward arc
almost as high as the crane's tip, and then back, and then forth, the man
prone at the arc's bottom and seeming to stand on either side, swinging back
and forth against a rare-meat sunset. And just as the cab man reaches for his
lever and everyone inhales, I lose my nerve and disappear into the crowd.

9:15 P.M.

Walking aimlessly. Seas of fairgoing flesh, plodding, elbowing, looking, still
eating. They stand placidly in long lines. No East Coast games of Beat the
Crowd. Midwesterners lack a certain public cunning. No one gets impatient.
Don't the fairgoers mind the crowds, lines, noise? But the state fair is
deliberately about the crowds and jostle, the noise and overload of sight and
event. At last an overarching theory blooms inside my head: megalopolitan East
Coasters' summer treats and breaks are literally "getaways,"
flights-from--from crowds, noise, heat, dirt, the stress of too many sensory
choices. Hence the ecstatic escapes to glassy lakes, mountains, cabins, hikes
in silent woods. Getting away from it all. They see more than enough
stimulating people and sights Monday through Friday, thank you, stand in
enough lines, elbow enough crowds. Neon skylines. Grotesques on public
transport. Spectacles at every urban corner practically grab you by the
lapels, commanding attention. The East Coast existential treat is escape from
confines and stimuli--quiet rustic vistas that hold still, turn inward, turn
away. Not so in the rural Midwest. Here you're pretty much away all the time.
The land is big here--board-game flat, horizons in every direction. See how
much farther apart the homes are, how broad the yards: compare with New York
or Boston or Philly. Here a seat to yourself on all public transport, parks
the size of airports, rush hour a three-beat pause at a stop sign. And the
farms themselves are huge, silent, vacant: you can't see your neighbor. Thus
the urge physically to commune, melt, become part of a crowd. To see something
besides land and grass and corn and cable TV and your wife's face. Hence the
sacredness out here of spectacle, public event: high-school football, Little
League, parades, bingo, market day, fair. All very big deals, very deep down.
Something in a Midwesterner sort of actuates, deep down, at a public event.
The faces in the sea of faces are like the faces of children released from
their rooms. Governor Edgar's state-spirit rhetoric at the ribbon-cutting
rings true. The real spectacle that draws us here is us.

Title:  E unibus pluram: television and U.S. fiction.
Author:  David Foster Wallace

Abstract:  Television is more like literature than people care to admit.
Literature became self-reflexive in the 1960s as postmodernist authors
questioned the abilities and merits of fiction within their texts, doubting
authoritative literary voices and eventually eschewing plot altogether.
Television also pokes fun at its own limitations, often in sarcastic tones
that acknowledge the lack of moral fiber in programming. Contemporary fiction
makes fun of the television generation, but no more so than television itself
does.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

Act Natural

Fiction writers as a species tend to be oglers. They tend to lurk and to
stare. The minute fiction writers stop moving, they start lurking, and stare.
They are born watchers. They are viewers. They are the ones on the subway
about whose nonchalant stare there is something creepy, somehow. Almost
predatory. This is because human situations are writers' food. Fiction writers
watch other humans sort of the way gapers slow down for car wrecks: they covet
a vision of themselves as witnesses.

But fiction writers as a species also tend to be terribly self-conscious. Even
by U.S. standards. Devoting lots of productive time to studying closely how
people come across to them, fiction writers also spend lots of less productive
time wondering nervously how they come across to other people. How they
appear, how they seem, whether their shirttail might be hanging out their fly,
whether there's maybe lipstick on their teeth, whether the people they're
ogling can maybe size them up as somehow creepy, lurkers and starers.

The result is that a surprising majority of fiction writers, born watchers,
tend to dislike being objects of people's attention. Being watched. The
exceptions to this rule - Mailer, McInerney, Janowitz - create the misleading
impression that lots of belles-lettres types like people's attention. Most
don't. The few who like attention just naturally get more attention. The rest
of us get less, and ogle.

Most of the fiction writers I know are Americans under forty. I don't know
whether fiction writers under forty watch more television than other American
species. Statisticians report that television is watched over six hours a day
in the average American household. I don't know any fiction writers who live
in average American households. I suspect Louise Erdrich might. Actually I
have never seen an average American household. Except on TV.

So right away you can see a couple of things that look potentially great, for
U.S. fiction writers, about U.S. television. First, television does a lot of
our predatory human research for us. American human beings are a slippery and
protean bunch, in real life, as hard to get any kind of univocal handle on as
a literary territory that's gone from Darwinianly naturalistic to
cybernetically post-postmodern in eighty years. But television comes equipped
with just such a syncretic handle. If we want to know what American normality
is - what Americans want to regard as normal - we can trust television. For
television's whole raison is reflecting what people want to see. It's a
mirror. Not the Stendhalian mirror reflecting the blue sky and mud puddle.
More like the overlit bathroom mirror before which the teenager monitors his
biceps and determines his better profile. This kind of window on nervous
American self-perception is just invaluable, fictionwise. And writers can have
faith in television. There is a lot of money at stake, after all; and
television retains the best demographers applied social science has to offer,
and these researchers can determine precisely what Americans in 1990 are,
want, see: what we as Audience want to see ourselves as. Television, from the
surface on down, is about desire. Fictionally speaking, desire is the sugar in
human food.

The second great thing is that television looks to be an absolute godsend for
a human subspecies that loves to watch people but hates to be watched itself.
For the television screen affords access only one way. A psychic ball-check
valve. We can see Them; They can't see Us. We can relax, unobserved, as we
ogle. I happen to believe this is why television also appeals so much to
lonely people. To voluntary shut-ins. Every lonely human I know watches way
more than the average U.S. six hours a day. The lonely, like the fictional,
love one-way watching. For lonely people are usually lonely not because of
hideous deformity or odor or obnoxiousness - in fact there exist today social
and support groups for persons with precisely these features. Lonely people
tend rather to be lonely because they decline to bear the emotional costs
associated with being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People
affect them too strongly. Let's call the average U.S. lonely person Joe
Briefcase. Joe Briefcase just loathes the strain of the self-consciousness
which so oddly seems to appear only when other real human beings are around,
staring, their human sense-antennae abristle. Joe B. fears how he might appear
to watchers. He sits out the stressful U.S. game of appearance poker.

But lonely people, home, alone, still crave sights and scenes. Hence
television. Joe can stare at Them, on the screen; They remain blind to Joe.
It's almost like voyeurism. I happen to know lonely people who regard
television as a veritable deus ex machina for voyeurs. And a lot of the
criticism, the really rabid criticism less leveled than sprayed at networks,
advertisers, and audiences alike, has to do with the charge that television
has turned us into a nation of sweaty, slack-jawed voyeurs. This charge turns
out to be untrue, but for weird reasons.

What classic voyeurism is is espial: watching people who don't know you're
there as they go about the mundane but erotically charged little businesses of
private life. It's interesting that so much classic voyeurism involves media
of framed glass-windows, telescopes, etc. Maybe the framed glass is why the
analogy to television is so tempting. But TV-watching is a different animal
from Peeping Tourism. Because the people we're watching through TV's
framed-glass screen are not really ignorant of the fact that somebody is
watching them. In fact a whole lot of somebodies. In fact the people on
television know that it is in virtue of this truly huge crowd of ogling
somebodies that they are on the screen, engaging in broad non-mundane
gestures, at all. Television does not afford true espial because television is
performance, spectacle, which by definition requires watchers. We're not
voyeurs here at all. We're just viewers. We are the Audience, megametrically
many, though most often we watch alone. E unibus pluram.(1)

One reason fiction writers seem creepy in person is that by vocation they
really are voyeurs. They need that straightforward visual theft of watching
somebody without his getting to prepare a speciable watchable self. The only
real illusion in espial is suffered by the voyee, who doesn't know he's giving
off images and impressions. A problem with so many of us fiction writers under
forty using television as a substitute for true espial, however, is that TV
"voyeurism" involves a whole gorgeous orgy of illusions for the pseudo-spy,
when we watch. Illusion (1) is that we're voyeurs here at all: the voyees
behind the screen's glass are only pretending ignorance. They know perfectly
well we're out there. And that we're there is also very much on the minds of
those behind the second layer of glass, the lenses and monitors via which
technicians and arrangers apply no small ingenuity to hurl the visible images
at us. What we see is far from stolen; it's proffered - illusion (2). And,
illusion (3), what we're seeing through the framed pane isn't people in real
situations that do or even could go on without consciousness of Audience. What
young writers are scanning for data on some reality to fictionalize is already
composed of fictional characters in highly ritualized narratives. Plus, (4),
we're not really even seeing "characters" at all: it's not Major Frank Burns,
pathetic self-important putz from Fort Wayne, Indiana; it's Larry Linville of
Ojai, California, actor stoic enough to endure thousands of letters (still
coming in, even in syndication) from pseudo-voyeurs mistakenly berating him
for being a putz. And, if (5) isn't too out-there for you, it's ultimately of
course not even actors we're espying, not even people: it's EM-propelled
analog waves and ionized streams and rear-screen chemical reactions throwing
off phosphenes in grids of dots not much more lifelike than Seurat's own
impressionistic "statements" on perceptual illusion. Good lord and (6) the
dots are coming out of our furniture, all we're spying on is our own
furniture; and our very own chairs and lamps and bookspines sit visible but
unseen at our gaze's frame as we contemplate "Korea" or are "taken live to
Amman, Jordan," or regard the plusher chairs and classier spines of the
Huxtable "home" as illusory cues that this is some domestic interior whose
membrane we have, slyly, unnoticed, violated. (7) and (8) and illusions ad
inf.

Not that realities about actors and phosphenes and furniture are unknown to
us. We simply choose to ignore them. For six hours a day. They are part of the

belief we suspend. But we're asked to hoist such a heavy load aloft. Illusions
of voyeurism and privileged access require real complicity from viewers. How
can we be made so willingly to acquiesce for hours daily to the illusion that
the people on the TV don't know they're being looked at, to the fantasy that
we're transcending privacy and feeding on unself-conscious human activity?
There might be lots of reasons why these unrealities are so swallowable, but a
big one is that the performers behind the two layers of glass are - varying
degrees of Thespian talent aside - absolute geniuses at seeming unwatched.
Now, seeming unwatched in front of a TV camera is a genuine art. Take a look
at how civilians act when a TV camera is pointed at them: they simply spaz
out, or else go all rigor mortis. Even PR people and politicians are,
camera-wise, civilians. And we love to laugh at how stiff and false
non-professionals appear, on television. How unnatural But if you've ever once
been the object of that terrible blank round glass stare, you know all too
well how self-conscious it makes you. A harried guy with earphones and a
clipboard tells you to "act natural" as your face begins to leap around on
your skull, struggling for a seemingly unwatched expression that feels
impossible because "seeming unwatched" is, like the "act natural" which
fathered it, oxymoronic. Try driving a golf ball as someone asks you whether
you in- or exhale on your backswing, or getting promised lavish rewards if you
can avoid thinking of a rhinoceros for ten seconds, and you'll get some idea
of the truly heroic contortions of body and mind that must be required for Don
Johnson to act unwatched as he's watched by a lens that's an overwhelming
emblem of what Emerson, years before TV, called "the gaze of millions."

Only a certain very rare species of person, for Emerson, is "fit to stand the
gaze of millions." It is not your normal, hard-working, quietly desperate
species of American. The man who can stand the megagaze is a walking imago, a
certain type of transcendent freak who, for Emerson, "carries the holiday in
his eye."(2) The Emersonian holiday television actors' eyes carry is the
potent illusion of a vacation from self-consciousness. Not worrying about how
you come across. A total unallergy to gazes. It is contemporarily heroic. It
is frightening and strong. It is also, of course, an act, a counterfeit
impression - for you have to be just abnormally self-conscious and
self-controlling to appear unwatched before lenses. The self-conscious
appearance of unself-consciousness is the grand illusion behind TV's
mirror-hall of illusions; and for us, the Audience, it is both medicine and
poison.

For we gaze at these rare, highly trained, seemingly unwatched people for six
hours daily. And we love these people. In terms of attributing to them true
supernatural assets and desiring to emulate them, we sort of worship them. In
a real Joe Briefcase-type world that shifts ever more starkly from some
community of relationships to networks of strangers connected by self-interest
and contest and image, the people we espy on TV offer us familiarity,
community. Intimate friendship. But we split what we see. The characters are
our "close friends"; but the performers are beyond strangers, they're images,
demigods, and they move in a different sphere, hang out with and marry only
each other, seem even as actors accessible to Audience only via the mediation
of tabloids, talk show, EM signal. And yet both actors and characters, so
terribly removed and filtered, seem so natural, when we watch.

Given how much we watch and what watching means, it's inevitable - but toxic -
for those of us fictionists or Joe Briefcases who wish to be voyeurs to get
the idea that these persons behind the glass, persons who are often the most
colorful, attractive, animated, alive people in our daily experience, are also
people who are oblivious to the fact that they are watched. It's toxic for
allergic people because it sets up an alienating cycle, and also for writers
because it replaces fiction research with a weird kind of fiction consumption.
We self-conscious Americans' oversensitivity to real humans fixes us before
the television and its ball-check valve in an attitude of rapt, relaxed
reception. We watch various actors play various characters, etc. For 360
minutes per diem, we receive unconscious reinforcement of the deep thesis that
the most significant feature of truly alive persons is watchableness, and that
genuine human worth is not just identical with but rooted in the phenomenon of
watching. And that the single biggest part of real watchableness is seeming to
be unaware that there's any watching going on. Acting natural. The persons we
young fiction writers and assorted shut-ins most study, feel for, feel through
are, by virtue of a genius for feigned unself-consciousness, fit to stand
gazes. And we, trying desperately to be nonchalant, perspire creepily, on the
subway.

The Finger

Weighty existential predicaments aside, there's no denying that people in the
U.S.A. watch so much television because it's fun. I know I watch for fun, most
of the time, and that at least 51 percent of the time I do have fun when I
watch. This doesn't mean I do not take television seriously. One claim of this
essay is that the most dangerous thing about television for U.S. fiction
writers is that we yield to the temptation not to take television seriously as
both a disseminator and a definer of the cultural atmosphere we breathe and
process, that many of us are so blinded by constant exposure that we regard TV
the way Reagan's lame FCC chairman Mark Fowler professed to in 1981, as "just
another appliance, a toaster with pictures."(3)

Television nevertheless is just plain pleasurable, though it may seem odd that
so much of the pleasure my generation gets from television lies in making fun
of it. But you have to remember that younger Americans grew up as much with
people's disdain for TV as we did with TV itself I knew it was a "vast
wasteland" way before I knew who Newton Minow or Mark Fowler were. And it's
just fun to laugh cynically at television - at the way the laughter from
sitcoms' "live studio audience" is always suspiciously constant in pitch and
duration, or at the way travel is depicted on The Flintstones by having the
exact same cut-rate cartoon tree, rock, and house go by four times. It's fun,
when a withered June Allyson comes on-screen for Depend Adult Undergarments
and says "If you have a bladder-control problem, you're not alone," to hoot
and shout back "Well, chances are you're alone quite a bit, June!"

Most scholars and critics who write about U.S. popular culture, though, seem
both to take TV seriously and to suffer real pain over what they see. There's
this well-known critical litany about television's vapidity, shallowness, and
irrealism. The litany is often far cruder and triter than what the critics
complain about, which I think is why most younger viewers find pro criticism
of television far less interesting than pro television itself. I found solid
examples of what I'm talking about on the first day I even looked. The New
York Times Arts & Leisure section for Sunday, 8/05/90, simply bulged with
bitter critical derision for TV, and some of the most unhappy articles weren't
about just low-quality programming so much as about how TV's become this
despicable instrument of cultural decay. In a summary review of all 1990's
"crash and burn" summer box-office hits in which "realism ... seems to have
gone almost entirely out of fashion," Janet Maslin locates her true
anti-reality culprit: "We may be hearing about |real life' on television shows
made up of 15-second sound bites (in which |real people' not only speak in
brief, neat truisms but actually seem to think that way, perhaps as a result
of having watched too much reality-molding television themselves)."(4) And one
Stephen Holden, in what starts out as a mean pop music article, knows
perfectly well what's behind what he hates: "Pop music is no longer a world
unto itself but an adjunct of television, whose stream of commercial images
projects a culture in which everything is for sale and the only things that
count are fame, power, and the body beautiful."(5) This stuff just goes on and
on, in the Times. The only Arts & Leisure piece I could find with anything
upbeat to say about TV that morning was a breathless article on how lots of
Ivy League graduates are now flying straight from school to New York and Los
Angeles to become television writers and are clearing well over $200,000 to
start and enjoying rapid advancement to harried clip-boarded production
status. In this regard, 8/05's Times is a good example of a strange mix that's
been around for a few years now: weary contempt for television as a creative
product and cultural force, combined with beady-eyed fascination about the
actual behind-the-glass mechanics of making that product and projecting that
force.

Surely we all have friends we just hate to hear talk about TV because they so
clearly loathe it - they sneer relentlessly at the hackneyed plots, the
unlikely dialogue, the Cheez-Whiz resolutions, the bland condescension of the
news anchors, the shrill wheedling of commercials - and yet are just as
clearly obsessed with it, somehow need to hate their six hours a day, day in
and out. Junior advertising executives, aspiring filmakers, and graduate-
school poets are in my experience especially prone to this condition where
they simultaneously hate, fear, and need television, and try to disinfect
themselves of whatever so much viewing might do to them by watching TV with
weary irony instead of the rapt credulity most of us grew up with. (Note that
most fiction writers still tend to go for the rapt credulity.)

But, since the wearily disgusted Times has its own demographic thumb on the
pulse of news-readerly taste, it's safe to conclude that most educated,
Times-buying Americans are wearily disgusted by television, have this weird
hate-need-fear-6-hrs.-daily gestalt about it. Published TV scholarship sure
reflects this mood. And the numbingly dull quality to most "literary"
television analyses is due less to the turgid abstraction scholars employ to
make television seem an OK object of "aesthetic" inquiry - cf. an '86
treatise: "The form of my Tuesday evening's prime-time pleasure is structured
by a dialectic of elision and rift among various windows through which ...
|flow' is more of a circumstance than a product. The real output is the
quantum, the smallest maneuverable broadcast bit"(6) - than to the tired,
jaded cynicism of television experts who mock and revile the very phenomenon
they've chosen as scholarly vocation. It's like people who despise - I mean
big-time, long-term despise - their spouses or jobs, but won't split up or
quit. Critical complaint degenerates quickly into plain whining. The fecund
question about U.S. television is no longer whether there are some truly nasty
problems here but rather what on earth's to be done about them. On this
question pop critics are mute.

In fact it's in the U.S. arts, particularly in certain strands of contemporary
American fiction, that the really interesting questions about
end-of-the-century TV - What is it about televisual culture that we so hate?
Why are we so immersed in it if we hate it so? What implications are there in
our sustained voluntary immersion in stuff we hate? - are being addressed. But
they are also, weirdly, being asked and answered by television itself. This is
another reason why most TV criticism seems so empty. Television's managed to
become its own most profitable critic.

A.M., 8/05/90, as I was scanning and sneering at the sneering tone of the
prenominate Times articles, a syndicated episode of St. Elsewhere was on the
TV, cleaning up in a Sunday-morning Boston market otherwise occupied by
televangelists, infomercials, and the steroid- and polyurethane-ridden
American Gladiators, itself not charmless but definitely a low-dose show.
Syndication is another new area of public fascination, not only because huge
cable stations like Chicago's WGN and Atlanta's WTBS have upped the stakes
from local to national, but because syndication is changing the whole creative
philosophy of network television. Since it is in syndication deals (where the
disuibutor gets both an up-front fee for a program and a percentage of the
ad-slots for his own commercials) that the creators of successful television
series realize truly gross profits, many new programs are designed and pitched
with both immediate prime-time and down-the-road syndication audiences in
mind, and are now informed less by dreams of the
ten-year-beloved-TV-institution-type run - Gunsmoke, M*A*S*H - than of a
modest three-year run that yields the seventy-eight in-can episodes required
for an attractive-syndication package. I, like millions of other Americans,
know this stuff only because I saw a special three-part report about
syndication on Entertainment Tonight, itself the first nationally syndicated
"news" program and the first infomercial so popular that TV stations were
willing to pay for it.

Sunday syndication is also intriguing because it makes for juxtapositions as
eerily apposite as anything French surrealists could contrive. Lovable
warlocks on Bewitched and commercially Satanic heavy-metal videos on America's
Top 40 run opposite airbrushed preachers decrying demonism in U.S. culture.
Or, better, 8/05's St. Elsewhere episode 94, originally broadcast in 1988,
aired on Boston's Channel 38 immediately following two back-to-back episodes
of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, that icon of seventies pathos. The plots of the
two Mary Tyler Moore Shows are unimportant here. But the St. Elsewhere episode
that followed them partly concerned a cameo-role mental patient afflicted with
the delusional belief that he was Mary Richards from The Mary Tyler Moore
Show. He further believed that a fellow cameo-role mental patient was Rhoda,
that Dr. Westphal was Mr. Grant, and that Dr. Auschlander was Murray. This
psychiatric subplot was a one-shot; it was resolved by episode's end. The
pseudo-Mary (a sad lumpy-looking guy who used to play one of Dr. Hartley's
neurotic clients on the old Bob Newhart Show) rescues the other cameo-role
mental patient, whom he believes to be Rhoda and who has been furious in his
denials that he is female, much less fictional (and who is himself played by
the guy who used to play Mr. Carlin, Dr. Hartley's most intractable client)
from assault by a bit-part hebephrene. In gratitude, Rhoda/Mr. Carlin/mental
patient declares that he'll consent to be Rhoda if that's what Mary/neurotic
client/mental patient wants. At this too-real generosity, the pseudo-Mary's
psychotic break breaks. The sad guy admits to Dr. Auschlander that he's not
Mary Richards. He's actually just a plain old amnesiac, minus a self,
existentially adrift. He has no idea who he is. He's lonely. He watches a lot
of television. He figured it was "better to believe I was a TV character than
not to believe I was anybody." Dr. Auschlander takes the penitent patient for
a walk in the wintery Boston air and promises that he, the identityless guy,
can someday find out who he really is, provided he can dispense with "the
distraction of television." At this cheery prognosis, the patient removes his
own fuzzy winter beret and throws it into the air. The episode ends with a
freeze of the aloft hat, leaving at least one viewer credulously rapt.

This would have been just another clever low-concept eighties TV story, where
the final cap-tossing and closing credits coyly undercut Dr. Auschlander's
put-down of television, were it not for the countless layers of ironic,
involuted TV imagery and data that whirl around this high-concept installment.
Because another of this episode's cameo stars, drifting through a different
subplot, is one Betty White, Sue Ann Nivens of the old Mary Tyler Moore Show,
here playing a tortured NASA surgeon (don't ask). It is with almost tragic
inevitability, then", that Ms. White, at thirty-two minutes into the episode,
meets up with the TV-deluded pseudo-Mary in their respective tortured
wanderings through the hospital's corridors, and that she considers the mental
patient's inevitable joyful cries of "Sue Ann!" with a too-straight face and
says he must have her confused with someone else. Of the convolved levels of
fantasy and reality and identity here - e.g., patient simultaneously does,
does not, and does have Betty White "confused" with Sue Ann Nivens - we
needn't speak in detail: doubtless a Yale Contemporary Culture dissertation is
underway on R. D. Laing and just this episode. But the most interesting levels
of meaning here lie, and point, behind the lens. For NBC's St. Elsewhere, like
The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show before it, was created,
produced, and guided into syndication by MTM Studios, owned by Mary Tyler
Moore and overseen by her husband, later NBC Chair Grant Tinker; and St.
Elsewhere's scripts and subplots are story-edited by Mark Tinker, Mary's
step-, Grant's heir. The deluded mental patient, an exiled, drifting veteran
of one MTM program, reaches piteously out to the exiled, drifting (literally -
NASA, for God's sake) veteran of another MTM production, and her ironic rebuff
is scripted by KM personnel, who accomplish the parodic undercut of MTM's Dr.
Auschlander with the copyrighted MTM hat-gesture of one MTM veteran who's
"deluded" he's another. Dr. A.'s Fowleresque dismissal of TV as just a
"distraction" is less absurd than incoherent. Therd is nothing but television
on this episode; every joke and dramatic surge depends on involution,
metatelevision. It is in joke within in-joke.

So then why do I get it? Because I, the viewer, outside the glass with the
rest of the Audience, am nevertheless in on the in-joke. I've seen Mary Tyler
Moore's "real" toss of that fuzzy beret so often it's moved past cliche into
nostalgia. I know the mental patient from Bob Newhart, Betty White from
everywhere, and I know all sorts of intriguing irrelevant stuff about MTM
Studios and syndication from Entertainment Tonight. I, the pseudovoyeur, am
indeed "behind the scenes," for in-joke purposes. But it is not I the spy who
have crept inside television's boundaries. It is vice versa. Television, even
the mundane little businesses of its production, have become Our interior. And
we seem a jaded, jeering, but willing and knowledgeable Audience. This St.
Elsewhere episode was nominated for an Emmy. For best original teleplay.

The best TV of the last five years has been about ironic self-reference like
no previous species of postmodern art could have dreamed of. The colors of MTV
videos, blue-black and lambently flickered, are the colors of television.
Moonlighting's Bruce and Bueller's Ferris throw asides to the viewer every bit
as bald as the old melodrama villain's monologued gloat. Segments of the new
late-night glitz-news After Hours end with a tease that features harried
headphoned guys in the production booth ordering the tease. MTV's
television-trivia game show, the dry-titled Remote Control, got so popular it
busted its own MTV-membrane and is in 1990 now syndicated band-wide. The
hippest commercials, with stark computerized settings and blank beauties in
mirrored shades and plastic slacks genuflecting before various forms of
velocity, force, and adrenaline, seem like little more than TV's vision of how
TV offers rescue to those lonely Joe Briefcases passively trapped into
watching too much TV.

What explains the pointlessness of most published TV criticism is that
television has become immune to charges that it lacks any meaningful
connection to the world outside it. It's not that charges of nonconnection
have become untrue. It's that any such connection has become otiose.
Television used to point beyond itself. Those of us born in like the sixties
were trained to look where it pointed, usually at versions of "real life" made
prettier, sweeter, better by succumbing to a product or temptation. Today's
Audience is way better trained, and TV has discarded what's not needed. A dog,
if you point at something, will look only at your finger.

Metawatching

It's not like self-reference is new to mass entertainment. How many old radio
shows - Jack Benny, Martin and Lewis, Abbott and Costello - were mostly about
themselves as shows? "So, Jerry, and you said I couldn't get a big star like
Miss Lucille Ball to be a guest on our show, you little twerp." Etc. But once
television introduces the element of watching, and once it informs an economy
and culture like radio never did, the referential stakes go way up. Six hours
a day is more time than most people (consciously) do any one thing. How people
who absorb such doses understand themselves changes, becomes spectatorial,
self-conscious. Because the practice of watching is expansive. Exponential. We
spend enough time watching, pretty soon we start watching ourselves watching.
We start to "feel" ourselves feeling, yearn to experience "experiences." And
that American subspecies into writing starts writing more and more about....

The emergence of something called metafiction in the American sixties was and
is hailed by academic critics as a radical aesthetic, a whole new literary
form unshackled from the canonical cinctures of narrative and mimesis and free
to plunge into reflexivity and self-conscious meditations on aboutness.
Radical it may have been, but thinking that postmodern metafiction evolved
unconscious of prior changes in readerly taste is about as innocent as
thinking that all those students we saw on television protesting the war in
southeast Asia were protesting only because they hated the war. They may have
hated the war, but they also wanted to be seen protesting on television. TV
was where they'd seen this war, after all. Why wouldn't they go about hating
it on the very medium that made their hate possible? Metafictionists may have
had aesthetic theories out the bazoo, but they were also sentient citizens of
a community that was exchanging an old idea of itself as a nation of do-ers
and be-ers for a new vision of the U.S.A. as an atomized mass of
self-conscious watchers and appearers. Metafiction, for its time, was nothing
more than a poignant hybrid of its theoretical foe, realism: if realism called
it like it saw it, metafiction simply called it as it saw itself seeing itself
see it. This high-cultural postmodern genre, in other words, was deeply
informed by the emergence of television. And American fiction remains informed
by TV ... especially those strains of fiction with roots in postmodernism,
which even at its rebellious zenith was less a "response to" televisual
culture than a kind of abiding-in-TV. Even back then, the borders were
starting to come down.

It's strange that it took television itself so long to wake up to watching's
potent reflexivity. Television shows about television shows were rare for a
long time. The Dick Van Dyke Show was prescient, and Mary Moore carried its
insight into her own decade-long study in local-market angst. Now, of course,
there's been everything from Murphy Brown to Max Headroom to Entertainment
Tonight. And with Letterman, Arsenio, and Leno's battery of hip, sardonic,
this-is-just-TV shticks, the circle back to the days of "So glad to get Miss
Ball on our show" has closed and come spiral, television's power to jettison
connection and castrate protest fueled by the same ironic postmodern
self-consciousness it first helped fashion.

It's going to take a while, but I'm going to prove to you that the nexus where
television and fiction converse and consort is self-conscious irony. Irony is,
of course, a turf fictionists have long worked with zeal. And irony is
important for understanding TV because "T.V.," now that it's gotten powerful
enough to move from acronym to way of life, revolves off just the sorts of
absurd contradictions irony's all about exposing. It is ironic that television
is a syncresis that celebrates diversity. That an extremely unattractive
self-consciousness is necessary to create TV performers' illusion of
unconscious appeal. That products presented as helping you express
individuality can afford to be advertised on television only because they sell
to huge hordes. And so on.

Television regards irony the way the educated lonely regard television.
Television both fears irony's capacity to expose, and needs it. It needs irony
because television was practically made for irony. For TV is a bisensuous
medium. Its displacement of radio wasn't picture displacing sound; it was
picture added. Since the tension between what's said and what's seen is
irony's whole sales territory, classic televisual irony works not via the
juxtaposition of conflicting pictures or conflicting sounds, but with sights
that undercut what's said. A scholarly article on network news describes a
famous interview with a corporate guy from United Fruit on a CBS special about
Guatemala: "I sure don't know of anybody being so-called |oppressed,'" the guy
in a seventies leisure suit with a tie that looks like an omelette tells Ed
Rabel. "I think this is just something that some reporters have thought
up."(7) The whole interview is intercut with commentless pictures of
big-bellied kids in Guatemalan slums and union organizers lying there with cut
throats.

Television's classic irony-function came into its own in the summer of 1974,
as remorseless lenses opened to view the fertile "credibility gap" between the
image of official disclaimer and the reality of high-level shenanigans. A
nation was changed, as Audience. If even the president lies to you, whom are
you supposed to trust to deliver the real? Television, that summer, presented
itself as the earnest, worried eye on the reality behind all images. The irony
that television is itself a river of image, however, was apparent even to a
twelve-year-old, sitting there, rapt. There seemed to be no way out. Images
and ironies all over the place. It's not a coincidence that Saturday Night
Live, that Athens of irreverent cynicism, specializing in parodies of (1)
politics and (2) television, premiered the next fall. On television.

I'm worried when I say things like "television fears" and "television presents
itself" because, even though it's an abstraction necessary to discourse,
talking about television as if it were an entity can easily slip into the
worst sort of anti-TV paranoia, treating of TV as some autonomous diabolical
corrupter of personal agency and community gumption. I am anxious to avoid
anti-TV paranoia here. Though I'm convinced that television lies, with a
potency somewhere between symptom and synecdoche, behind a genuine crisis for
U.S. culture and lit today, I don't share reactionary adults' vision of TV as
some malignancy visited on an innocent populace, sapping IQs and compromising
SAT scores while we all sit there on ever fatter bottoms with little
mesmerized spirals revolving in our eyes. Because conservative critics like
Samuel Huntington and Barbara Tuchman who try to claim that TV's lowering of
our aesthetic standards is responsible for a "contemporary culture taken over
by commercialism directed to the mass market and necessarily to mass taste"(8)
can be refuted by observing that their propter hoc isn't even post hoc: by
1830 de Tocqueville had already diagnosed American culture as peculiarly
devoted to easy sensation and mass-marketed entertainment, "spectacles
vehement and untutored and rude" that aimed "to stir the passions more than to
gratify the taste."(9)

It's undeniable that television is an example of "low" art, the sort of art
that tries too hard to please. Because of the economics of nationally
broadcast, advertiser-subsidized entertainment, television's one goal - never
denied by anybody in or around TV since RCA first authorized field tests in
1936 - is to ensure as much watching as possible. TV is the epitome of low art
in its desire to appeal to and enjoy the attention of unprecedented numbers of
people. But TV is not low because it is vulgar or prurient or stupid. It is
often all these things, but this is a logical function of its need to please
Audience. And I'm not saying that television is vulgar and dumb because the
people who compose Audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is
simply because people tend to be really similar in their vulgar and prurient
and stupid interests and wildly different in their refined and moral and
intelligent interests. It's all about syncretic diversity: neither medium nor
viewers are responsible for quality.

Still, for the fact that American humans consume vulgar, prurient, stupid
stuff at the sobering clip of six hours a day, for this both TV and we need to
answer. We are responsible basically because nobody is holding any weapons on
us forcing us to spend amounts of time second only to sleep doing something
that is, when you come right down to it, not good for us. Sorry to sound
judgmental, but there it is: six hours a day is not good.

Television's biggest minute-by-minute appeal is that it engages without
demanding. One can rest while undergoing stimulation. Receive without giving.
In this respect, television resembles other things mothers call "special
treats" - e.g., candy, or liquor - treats that are basically fine and fun in
small amounts but bad for us in large amounts and really bad for us if
consumed as any kind of nutritive staple. One can only guess what volume of
gin or poundage of Toblerone six hours of special treat a day would convert
to.

On the surface of the problem, television is responsible for our rate of its
consumption only in that it's become so terribly successful at its
acknowledged job of ensuring prodigious amounts of watching. Its social
accountability seems sort of like that of designers of military weapons:
unculpable right up until they get a little too good at their job.

But the analogy between television and liquor is best, I think. Because I'm
afraid Joe Briefcase is a teleholic. Watching TV can become malignantly
addictive. TV may become malignantly addictive only once a certain threshold
of quantity is habitually passed, but then the same is true of whiskey. And by
"malignant" and "addictive" I again do not mean evil or coercive. An activity
is addictive if one's relationship to it lies on that downward-sloping
continuum between liking it a little too much and downright needing it. Many
addictions, from exercise to letter-writing, are pretty benign. But something
is malignantly addictive if (1) it causes real problems for the addict, and
(2) it offers itself as relief from the very problems it causes. A malignant
addiction is also distinguished for spreading the problems of the addiction
out and in in interference patterns, creating difficulties for relationships,
communities, and the addict's very sense of self and soul. The hyperbole might
strain the analogy for you, but concrete illustrations of malignant
TV-watching cycles aren't hard to come by. If it's true that many Americans
are lonely, and if it's true that many lonely people are prodigious
TV-watchers, and if it's true that lonely people find in television's 2D
images relief from the pain of their reluctance to be around real humans, then
it's also obvious that the more time spent watching TV, the less time spent in
the real human world, and the less time spent in the real human world, the
harder it becomes not to feel alienated from real humans, solipsistic, lonely.
It's also true that to the extent one begins to view pseudo-relationships with
Bud Bundy or Jane Pauley as acceptable alternatives to relationships with real
humans, one has commensurately less conscious incentive even to try to connect
with real 3D persons, connections that are pretty important to mental health.
For Joe Briefcase, as for many addicts, the "special treat" of TV, begins to
substitute for something nourishing and needed, and the original hunger
subsides to a strange objectless unease.

TV-watching as a malignant cycle doesn't even require special preconditions
like writerly self-consciousness or loneliness. Let's for a second imagine Joe
Briefcase as now just average, relatively unlonely, adjusted, married, blessed
with 2.5 apple-cheeked issue, normal, home from hard work at 5:30, starting
his average six-hour stint. Since Joe B. is average, he'll shrug at pollsters'
questions and say he most often watches television to "unwind" from those
elements of his day and life he finds stressful. It's tempting to suppose that
TV enables this "unwinding" simply because it offers an Auschlanderian
distraction, something to divert the mind from quotidian troubles. But would
mere distraction ensure continual massive watching? Television offers more
than distraction. In lots of ways, television purveys and enables dreams, and
most of these dreams involve some sort of transcendence of average daily life.
The modes of presentation that work best for TV - stuff like "action," with
shoot-outs and car wrecks, or the rapid-fire "collage" of commercials, news,
and music videos, or the "hysteria" of prime-time soap and sitcom with broad
gestures, high voices, too much laughter - are unsubtle in their whispers
that, somewhere, life is quicker, denser, more interesting, more ... well,
lively than contemporary life as Joe Briefcase knows and moves through it.
This might seem benign until we consider that what average Joe Briefcase does
more than almost anything else in contemporary life is watch television, an
activity which anyone with an average brain can see does not make for a very
dense and lively life. Since television must seek to compel attention by
offering a dreamy promise of escape from daily life, and since stats confirm
that so grossly much of ordinary U.S. life is watching TV, TV's whispered
promises must somehow undercut television-watching in theory ("Joe, Joe,
there's a world where life is lively, where nobody spends six hours a day
unwinding before a piece of furniture") while reinforcing television-watching
in practice ("Joe, Joe, your best and only access to this world is TV").

Well, Joe Briefcase has an average, workable brain, and deep inside he knows,
as we do, that there's some kind of psychic three-card monte going on in this
system of conflicting whispers. But if it's so bald a delusion, why do we keep
watching such doses? Part of the answer - a part which requires discretion
lest it slip into anti-TV paranoia - is that the phenomenon of television
somehow trains or conditions our viewership. Television has become able not
only to ensure that we watch, but to inform our deepest responses to what's
watched. Take jaded TV critics, or our acquaintances who sneer at the numbing
sameness of all the television they sit still for. I always want to grab these
unhappy guys by the lapels and shake them until their teeth rattle and point
to the absence of guns to their heads and ask why the heck they keep watching,
then. But the truth is that there's some complex high-dose psychic transaction
between TV and Audience whereby Audience gets trained to respond to and then
like and then expect trite, hackneyed, numbing television shows, and to expect
them to such an extent that when networks do occasionally abandon time-tested
formulas we usually punish them for it by not watching novel forms in
sufficient numbers to let them get off the ground. Hence the networks' bland
response to its critics that in the majority of cases - and until the rise of
hip metatelevision you could count the exceptions on one hand - "different" or
"high-concept" programming simply didn't get ratings. Quality television
cannot stand the gaze of millions, somehow.

Now, it is true that certain PR techniques - e.g., shock, grotesquerie, or
irreverence - can ease novel sorts of shows' rise to demographic viability.
Examples here might be the shocking A Current Affair, the grotesque Real
People, the irreverent Married, with Children. But these programs, like most
of those touted by the industry as "fresh" or "outrageous," turn out to be
just tiny transparent variations on old formulas.

But it's still not fair to blame television's shortage of originality on any
lack of creativity among network talent. The truth is that we seldom get a
chance to know whether anybody behind any TV show is creative, or more
accurately that they seldom get a chance to show us. Despite the unquestioned
assumption on the part of pop-culture critics that television's poor Audience,
deep down, craves novelty, all available evidence suggests rather that the
Audience really craves sameness but thinks, deep down, that it ought to crave
novelty. Hence the mixture of devotion and sneer on viewerly faces. Hence also
the weird viewer-complicity behind TV's sham "breakthrough programs": Joe
Briefcase needs that PR-patina of "freshness" and "outrageousness" to quiet
his conscience while he goes about getting from television what we've all been
trained to want from it: some strangely American, profoundly shallow
reassurance.

Particularly in the last decade, this tension in the Audience between what we
do want and what we think we ought to want has been television's breath and
bread. TV's self-mocking invitation to itself as indulgence, transgression, a
glorious "giving in" (again not foreign to addictive cycles) is one of two
ingenious ways it's consolidated its six-hour hold on my generation's cajones.
The other is postmodern irony. The commercials for Alf's Boston debut in
syndicated package feature the fat, cynical, gloriously decadent puppet (so
much like Snoopy, like Garfield, like Bart) advising me to "Eat a whole lot of
food and stare at the TV!" His pitch is an ironic permission slip to do what I
do best whenever I feel confused and guilty: assume, inside, a sort of fetal
position; a pose of passive reception to escape, comfort, reassurance. The
cycle is self-nourishing.

Guilty Fictions

Not, again, that this cycle's root conflict is new. You can, trace the
opposition between what persons do and ought to desire at least as far back as
Plato's chariot or the Prodigal's return. But the way entertainments appeal to
and work within this conflict has been transformed in a televisual culture.
This culture-of-watching's relation to the cycle of indulgence, guilt, and
reassurance has important consequences for U.S. art, and though the parallels
are easiest to see w/r/t Warhol's pop or Elvis's rock, the most interesting
intercourse is between television and American lit.

One of the most recognizable things about this century's postmodern fiction
was the movement's strategic deployment of pop-cultural references - brand
names, celebrities, television programs - in even its loftiest high-art
projects. Think of just about any example of avant-garde U.S. fiction in the
last twenty-five years, from Slothrop's passion for Slippery Elm throat
lozenges and his weird encounter with Mickey Rooney in Gravity's Rainbow to
"You"'s fetish for the New York Post's COMA BABY feature in Bright Lights, to
Don Delillo's pop-hip characters saying stuff to each other like "Elvis
fulfilled the terms of the contract. Excess, deterioration,
self-destructiveness, grotesque behavior, a physical bloating and a series of
insults to the brain, self-delivered."[10]

The apotheosis of the pop in postwar art marked a whole new marriage between
high and low culture. For the artistic viability of postmodernism is a direct
consequence, again, not of any new facts about art, but of facts about the new
importance of mass commercial culture. Americans seemed no longer united so
much by common feelings as by common images: what binds us became what we
stood witness to. No one did or does see this as a good change. In fact,
pop-cultural references have become such potent metaphors in U.S. fiction not
only because of how united Americans are in our exposure to mass images but
also because of our guilty indulgent psychology with respect to that exposure.
Put simply, the pop reference works so well in contemporary fiction because
(1) we all recognize such a reference, and (2) we're all a little uneasy about
how we all recognize such a reference.

The status of low-cultural images in postmodern and contemporary fiction is
very different from their place in postmodernism's artistic ancestors, the
"dirty realism" of a Joyce or the Ur-Dadaism of a Duchamp toilet sculpture.
Duchamp's display of that vulgarest of appliances served an exclusively
theoretical end: it was making statements like "The Museum is the Mausoleum is
the Men's Room," etc. It was an example of what Octavio Paz calls
"meta-irony,"[11] an attempt to reveal that categories we divide into
superior/arty and inferior/vulgar are in fact so interdependent as to be
coextensive. The use of "low" references in today's literary fiction, on the
other hand, serves a less abstract agenda. It is meant (1) to help create a
mood of irony and irreverence, (2) to make us uneasy and so "comment" on the
vapidity of U.S. culture, and (3) most important, these days, to be just plain
realistic.

Pynchon and DeLillo were ahead of their time. Today, the belief that pop
images are basically just mimetic devices is one of the attitudes that
separates most U.S. fiction writers under forty from the writerly generation
that precedes us, reviews us, and designs our grad-school curricula. This
generation-gap in conceptions of realism is, again, TV-dependent. The U.S.
generation born after 1950 is the first for whom television was something to
be lived with instead of just looked at. Our elders regard the set rather as
the Flapper did the automobile: a curiosity turned treat turned seduction. For
younger writers, TV's as much a part of reality as Toyotas and gridlock. We
literally cannot imagine life without it. We're not different from our fathers
insofar as television presents and defines the contemporary world. But we are
different in that we have no memory of a world without such electric
definition. This is why the derision so many older fictionists heap on a "Brat
Pack" generation they see as insufficiently critical of mass culture is
simultaneously apt and misguided. It's true that there's something sad about
the fact that young lion David Leavitt's sole descriptions of certain story
characters is that their T-shirts have certain brand names on them. But the
fact is that, for most of the educated young readership for whom Leavitt
writes, members of a generation raised and nourished on messages equating what
one consumes with who one is, Leavitt's descriptions do the job. In our
post-'50, inseparable-from-TV association pool, brand loyalty is synecdochic
of identity, character.

For those U.S. writers whose ganglia were formed pre-TV, who are big on
neither Duchamp nor Paz and lack the oracular foresight of a Pynchon, the
mimetic deployment of pop-culture icons seems at best an annoying tic and at
worst a dangerous vapidity that compromises fiction's seriousness by dating it
out of the Platonic Always where it ought to reside. In one of the graduate
workshops I suffered through, an earnest gray eminence kept trying to convince
our class that a literary story or novel always eschews "any feature which
serves to date it," because "serious fiction must be timeless." When we
finally protested that, in his own well-known work, characters moved about in
electrically lit rooms, drove cars, spoke not Anglo-Saxon but postwar English,
inhabited a North America already separated from Africa by continental drift,
he impatiently amended his proscription to those explicit references that
would date a story in the frivolous "Now." When pressed for just what stuff
evoked this f.N., he said of course he meant the "trendy mass-popular-media"
reference. And here, at just this point, transgenerational discourse broke
down. We looked at him blankly. We scratched our little heads. We didn't get
it. This guy and his students just didn't imagine the "serious" world the same
way. His automobiled timeless and our FCC'd own were different.

If you read the big literary supplements, you've doubtless seen the
intergenerational squabble the prenominate scene explains. The plain fact is
that certain key things having to do with fiction production are different for
young U.S. writers now. And television is at the vortex of much of the flux.
Because younger writers are not only Artists probing for the nobler
interstices in what Stanley Cavell calls the reader's "willingness to be
pleased"; we are also, now, self-defined parts of the great U.S. Audience, and
have our own aesthetic pleasure-centers; and television has formed and trained
us. It won't do, then, for the literary establishment simply to complain that,
for instance, young-written characters don't have very interesting dialogues
with each other, that young writers' ears seem tinny. Tinny they may be, but
the truth is that in younger Americans' experience, people in the same room
don't do all that much direct conversing with each other. What most of the
people I know do is they all sit and face the same direction and stare at the
same thing and then structure commercial-length conversations around the sorts
of questions myopic car-crash witnesses might ask each other - "Did you just
see what I just saw?" And, realism-wise, the paucity of profound conversation
in Brat-esque fiction seems to be mimetic of more than just our own
generation. Six hours a day, in average households young and old, just how
much interfacing can really be going on? So now whose literary aesthetic seems
"dated"?

In terms of lit history, it's important to recognize the distinction between
pop and televisual references, on the one hand, and the mere use of TV-like
techniques, on the other. The latter have been around in fiction forever. The
Voltaire of Candide, for instance, uses a bisensuous irony that would do Ed
Rabel proud, having Candide and Pangloss run around smiling and saying "All
for the best, the best of all worlds" amid war-dead, pogroms, rampant
nastiness. Even the stream-of-consciousness guys who fathered modernism were,
on a very high level, constructing the same sorts of illusions about
privacy-puncturing and espial on the forbidden that television has found so
fecund. And let's not even talk about Balzac.

It was in post-atomic America that pop influences on lit became-something more
than technical. About the time television first gasped and sucked air, mass
popular U.S. culture became high-art viable as a collection of symbols and
myth. The episcopate of this pop-reference movement were the post-Nabokovian
black humorists, the metafictionists and assorted franc- and latinophiles only
later comprised by "postmodern." The erudite, sardonic fictions of the black
humorists introduced a generation of new fiction writers who saw themselves as
avant-avant-garde, not only cosmopolitan and polyglot but also technologically
literate, products of more than just one region, heritage, and theory, and
citizens of a culture that said its most important stuff about itself via mass
media. In this regard I think particularly of the Barth of The End of the Road
and The Sot-Weed Factor, the Gaddis of The Recognitions, and the Pynchon of
The Crying of Lot 49; but the movement toward treating of the pop as its own
reservoir of mythopeia fast metastasized and has transcended both school and
genre. Plucking from my bookshelves almost at random, I find poet James
Cummin's 1986 The Whole Truth, a cycle of sestinas deconstructing Perry Mason.
Here's Robert Coover's 1977 A Public Burning, in which Eisenhower buggers
Nixon on-air, and his 1980 A Political Fable, in which the Cat in the Hat runs
for president. I find Max Apple's 1986 The Propheteers, a novel-length
imagining of Walt Disney's travails. Or part of poet Bill Knott's 1974 "And
Other Travels":

. . . in my hand a cat o'nine tails on every tip of which was Clearasil I was
worried because Dick Clark had told the cameraman not to put the camera on me
during the dance parts of the show because my skirts were too tight[12]

which serves as a lovely example because, even though this stanza appears in
the poem without anything we'd normally call context or support, it is in fact
self-supported by a reference we all, each of us, immediately get, conjuring
as it does with Bandstand ritualized vanity, teenage insecurity, the
management of spontaneous moments. It is the perfect pop image: at once slight
and universal, soothing and discomfiting.

Recall that the phenomena of watching and consciousness of watching are by
nature expansive. What distinguishes another, later wave of postmodern lit is
a further shift, from television images as valid objects of literary allusion,
to TV and metawatching as themselves valid subjects. By this I mean certain
lit beginning to locate its raison in its commentary on, response to, a U.S.
culture more and more of and for watching, illusion, and the video image. This
involution of attention was first observable in academic poetry. See for
instance Stephen Dobyns's 1980 "Arrested Saturday Night":

This is how it happened: Peg and Bob had invited Jack and Roxanne over to
their house to watch the TV, and on the big screen they saw Peg and Bob, Jack
and Roxanne watching themselves watch themselves on progressively smaller
TVs....[13]

or Knott's 1983 "Crash Course":

I strap a TV monitor on my chest so that all who approach can see themselves
and respond appropriately."

The true prophet of this shift in U.S. fiction, though, was the prenominate
Don DeLillo, a long-neglected conceptual novelist who has made signal and
image his unifying topoi the way Barth and Pynchon had sculpted in paralysis
and paranoia a decade earlier. DeLillo's 1985 White Noise sounded to fledgling
fictionists a kind of televisual clarion-call. Scenelets like the following
seemed especially important:

Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the
most photographed barn in America. We drove twenty-two miles into the country
around Farmington. There were meadows and apple orchards. White fences trailed
through the rolling fields. Soon the signs started appearing. THE MOST
PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA. We counted five signs before we reached the
site. . . . We walked along a cow-path to the slightly elevated spot set aside
for viewing and photographing. All the people had cameras; some had tripods,
telephoto lenses, filter kits. A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -
pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot. We stood near a grove of
trees and watched the photographers. Murray maintained a prolonged silence,
occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book.

"No one sees the barn," he said finally.

A long silence followed.

"Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the
barn."

He fell silent once more. People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced
at once by others.

"We're not here to capture an image. We're here to maintain one. Can you feel
it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies."

There was an extended silence. The man in the booth sold postcards and slides.

"Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender. We see only what the others see.
The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.
We've agreed to be part of a collective perception. This literally colors our
vision. A religious experience in a way, like all tourism."

Another silence ensued.

"They are taking pictures of taking pictures," he said. (12-13)

I quote this at such length not only because it's too darn good to ablate, but
to draw your attention to two relevant features. The less interesting is the
Dobyns-esque message here about the metastasis of watching. For not only are
people watching a barn whose only claim to fame is as an object of watching,
but the pop-culture scholar Murray is watching people watch a barn, and his
friend Jack is watching Murray watch the watching, and we readers are pretty
obviously watching Jack the narrator watch Murray watching, etc. If you leave
out the reader, there's a similar regress of recordings of barn and
barn-watching.

But more important are the complicated ironies at work in the scene. The scene
itself is obviously absurd and absurdist. But most of the writing's parodic
force is directed at Murray, the would-be transcender of spectation. Murray,
by watching and analyzing, would try to figure out the how and whys of giving
in to collective visions of mass images that have themselves become mass
images only because they've been made the objects of collective vision. The
narrator's "extended silence" in response to Murray's blather speaks volumes.
But it's not to be mistaken for a silence of sympathy with the sheeplike
photograph-hungry crowd. These poor Joe Briefcases are no less objects of
ridicule for their "scientific" critic himself being ridiculed. The authorial
tone throughout is a kind of deadpan sneer. Jack himself is utterly mute -
since to speak out loud in the scene would render the narrator part of the
farce (instead of a detached, transcendent "observer and recorder") and so
vulnerable to ridicule himself. With his silence, DeLillo's alter ego Jack
eloquently diagnoses the very disease from which he, Murray, barn-watchers,
and readers all suffer.

I Do Have a Thesis

I want to convince you that irony, poker-faced silence, and fear of ridicule
are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture (of which
cutting-edge fiction is a part) that enjoy any significant relation to the
television whose weird pretty hand has my generation by the throat. I'm going
to argue that irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that at
the same time they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture,
and that for aspiring fictionists they pose terrifically vexing problems.

My two big premises are that, on the one hand, a certain subgenre of
pop-conscious postmodern fiction, written mostly by young Americans, has
lately arisen and made a real attempt to transfigure a world of and for
appearance, mass appeal, and television; and that, on the other hand,
televisual culture has somehow evolved to a point where it seems invulnerable
to any such transfiguring assault. TV, in other words, has become able to
capture and neutralize any attempt to change or even protest the attitudes of
passive unease and cynicism TV requires of Audience in order to be
commercially and psychologically viable at doses of several hours per day.

Image-Fiction

The particular fictional subgenre I have in mind has been called by some
editors "post-postmodernism" and by some critics "hyperrealism." Most of the
younger readers and writers I know call it the "fiction of image."
Image-fiction is basically a further involution of the relations between lit
and pop that blossomed with the sixties postmodernists. If the postmodern
church fathers found pop images valid referents and symbols in fiction, and if
in the seventies and early eighties this appeal to the features of mass
culture shifted from use to mention, certain avant-gardists starting to treat
of pop and TV and watching as themselves fertile subjects, the new fiction of
image uses the transient received myths of popular culture as a world in which
to imagine fictions about "real," albeit pop-mediated, public characters.
Early uses of imagist tactics can be seen in the DeLillo of Great Jones
Street, the Coover of Burning, and in Max Apple, whose seventies short story
"The Oranging of America" projected an interior life onto the figure of Howard
Johnson.

But in the late eighties, despite publisher unease over the legalities of
imagining private lives for public figures, a real bumper crop of this
behind-the-glass stuff started appearing, authored largely by writers who
didn't know or cross-fertilize one another. Apple's Propheteers, Jay Cantor's
Krazy Kat, Coover's A Night at the Movies, or You Must Remember This, William
T. Vollmann's You Bright and Risen Angels, Stephen Dixon's Movies: Seventeen
Stories, and DeLillo's own fictional hologram of Oswald in Libra are all
notable post-'85 instances. (Observe too that, in another eighties medium, the
arty Zelig, Purple Rose of Cairo, and Sex, Lies, and Video-tape, plus the
low-budget Scanners and Videodrome and Shockers, all began to treat screens as
permeable.)

It's in the last couple of years that the image-fiction scene has really taken
off. A. M. Homes's 1990 The Safely of Objects features a stormy love affair
between a boy and a Barbie doll. Vollmann's 1989 The Rainbow Stories has Sonys
as characters in Heideggerian parables. Michael Martone's 1990 Fort Wayne Is
Seventh on Hitler's List is a tight cycle of stories about the Midwest's
pop-culture giants - James Dean, Colonel Sanders, Dillinger - the whole
project of which, spelled out in a preface about image-fiction's legal woes,
involves "questioning the border between fact and fiction when in the presence
of fame."[15] And Mark Leyner's 1990 campus smash My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist, less a novel than what the book's jacket-copy describes as
"a fiction analogue of the best drug you ever took," features everything from
meditations on the color of Carefree Panty Shields wrappers to "Big Squirrel,
the TV kiddie-show host and kung fu mercenary," to NFL instant replays in an
"X-ray vision which shows leaping skeletons in a bluish void surrounded by
75,000 roaring skulls."[16]

One thing I have to insist you realize about this new subgenre is that it's
distinguished, not just by a certain neo-postmodern technique, but by a
genuine socio-artistic agenda. The fiction of image is not just a use or
mention of televisual culture but a response to it, an effort to impose some
sort of accountability on a state of affairs in which more Americans get their
news from television than from newspapers and in which more Americans every
evening watch Wheel of Fortune than all three network news programs combined.

And please see that image-fiction, far from being a trendy avant-garde
novelty, is almost atavistic. It's a natural adaptation of the hoary
techniques of literary realism to a nineties world whose defining boundaries
have been deformed by electric signal. For realistic fiction's big job used to
be to afford easements across borders, to help readers leap over the walls of
self and locale and show us unseen or -dreamed-of people and cultures and ways
to be. Realism made the strange familiar. Today, when we can eat Tex-Mex with
chopsticks while listening to reggae and watching a Soviet-satellite newscast
of the Berlin Wall's fall - i.e., when darn near everything presents itself as
familiar - it's not a surprise that some of today's most ambitious "realistic"
fiction is going about trying to make the familiar strange. In so doing, in
demanding fictional access behind lenses and screens and headlines and
re-imagining what human life might truly be like over there across the chasms
of illusion, mediation, demographics, marketing, image, and appearance,
image-fiction is paradoxically trying to restore what's (mis)taken for "real"
to three whole dimensions, to reconstruct a univocally round world out of
disparate streams of flat sights.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that, almost without exception, image-fiction doesn't satisfy
its own agenda. Instead, it most often degenerates into a kind of jeering,
surfacy look "behind the scenes" of the very televisual front people already
jeer at, and can already get behind the scenes of via Entertainment Tonight
and Remote Control.

The reason why today's imagist fiction isn't the rescue from a passive,
addictive TV-psychology that it tries so hard to be is that most imagist
writers render their material with the same tone of irony and
self-consciousness that their ancestors, the literary insurgents of Beat and
postmodernism, used so effectively to rebel against their own world and
context. And the reason why this irreverent postmodern approach fails to help
the imagists transfigure TV is simply that TV has beaten the imagists to the
punch. The fact is that for at least ten years now television has been
ingeniously absorbing, homogenizing, and re-presenting the very cynical
postmodern aesthetic that was once the best alternative to the appeal of low,
over-easy, mass-marketed narrative. How TV's done this is blackly fascinating
to see.

A quick intermission contra paranoia. By saying that the fiction of image aims
to "rescue" us from TV, I again am not suggesting that television has diabolic
designs, or wants souls. I'm just referring again to the kind of
Audience-conditioning consequent to high doses, a conditioning so subtle it
can be observed best obliquely, through examples. If a term like
"conditioning" still seems either hyperbolic or empty to you, I'll ask you to
consider for a moment the exemplary issue of prettiness. One of the things
that makes the people on TV fit to stand the mega-gaze is that they are, by
human standards, really pretty. I suspect that this, like most television
conventions, is set up with no motive more sinister than to appeal to the
largest possible Audience. Pretty people tend to be more pleasing to look at
than non-pretty people. But when we're talking about television, the
combination of sheer Audience size and quiet psychic intercourse between
images and oglers starts a cycle that both enhances pretty images' appeal and
erodes us viewers' own security in the face of gazes. Because of the way human
beings relate to narrative, we tend to identify with those characters we find
appealing. We try to see ourselves in them. The same I.D.-relation, however,
also means that we try to see them in ourselves. When everybody we seek to
identify with for six hours a day is pretty, it naturally becomes more
important to us to be pretty, to be viewed as pretty. Because prettiness
becomes a priority for us, the pretty people on TV become all the more
attractive, a cycle which is obviously great for TV. But it's less great for
us civilians, who tend to own mirrors, and who also tend not to be anywhere
near as pretty as the images we try to identify with. Not only does this cause
some angst personally, but the angst increases because, nationally, everybody
else is absorbing six-hour doses and identifying with pretty people and
valuing prettiness more, too. This very personal anxiety about our prettiness
has become a national phenomenon with national consequences. The whole U.S.A.
gets different about things it values and fears. The boom in diet aids, health
and fitness clubs, neighborhood tanning parlors, cosmetic surgery, anorexia,
bulimia, steroid use among boys, girls throwing acid at each other because one
girl's hair looks more like Farrah Fawcett's than another's . . . are these
supposed to be unrelated to each other? to the apotheosis of prettiness in a
televisual culture?

It's not paranoid or hysterical to acknowledge that television in large doses
affects people's values and self-esteem in deep ways. That televisual
conditioning influences the whole psychology of one's relation to himself, his
mirror, his loved ones, and a world of real people and real gazes. No one's
going to claim that a culture all about watching and appearing is fatally
compromised by unreal standards of beauty and fitness. But other facets of
TV-training reveal themselves as more rapacious, more serious, than any
irreverent fiction writer would want to take seriously.

Irony's Aura

It's widely recognized that television, with its horn-rimmed battery of
statisticians and pollsters, is awfully good at discerning patterns in the
flux of popular ideologies, absorbing them, processing them, and then
re-presenting them as persuasions to watch and to buy. Commercials targeted at
the eighties' upscale boomers, for example, are notorious for using processed
versions of tunes from the rock culture of the sixties and seventies both to
elicit the yearning that accompanies nostalgia and to yoke purchases of
products with what for yuppies is a lost era of genuine conviction. Ford sport
vans are advertised with "This is the dawning of the age of the Aerostar";
Ford recently litigates with Bette Midler over the theft of her old vocals on
"Do You Wanna Dance"; claymation raisins dance to "Heard It Through the
Grapevine"; etc. If the commercial reuse of songs and the ideals they used to
symbolize seems distasteful, it's not like pop musicians are paragons of
noncommercialism themselves, and anyway nobody ever said selling was pretty.
The effects of any instance of TV absorbing and pablumizing cultural tokens
seem innocuous. But the recycling of whole cultural trends, and the ideologies
that inform them, are a different story.

U.S. pop culture is just like U.S. serious culture in that its central tension
has always set the nobility of individualism on one side against the warmth of
communal belonging on the other. For its first twenty or so years, it seemed
as though television sought to appeal mostly to the group side of the
equation. Communities and bonding were extolled on early TV, even though TV
itself, and especially its advertising, has from the outset projected itself
at the lone viewer, Joe Briefcase, alone. Television commercials always make
their appeals to individuals, not groups, a fact that seems curious in light
of the unprecedented size of TV's Audience, until one hears gifted salesmen
explain how people are always most vulnerable, hence frightened, hence needy,
hence persuadable, when they are approached solo.

Classic television commercials were all about the group. They took the
vulnerability of Joe Briefcase, sitting there, watching, lonely, and
capitalized on it by linking purchase of a given product with Joe B.'s
inclusion in some attractive community. This is why those of us over
twenty-one can remember all those interchangeable old commercials featuring
groups of pretty people in some ecstatic context having just way more fun than
anybody has a license to have, and all united as Happy Group by the
conspicuous fact that they're holding a certain bottle of pop or brand of
snack - and the blatant appeal here is that the relevant product can help Joe
Briefcase belong. "We're the Pepsi Generation...."

But since, at latest, the eighties, the individualist side of the great U.S.
conversation has held sway in TV advertising. I'm not sure just why or how
this happened. There are probably great connections to be traced - with
Vietnam, youth cultures, Watergate and recession and the New Right's rise -
but the relevant datum is that a lot of the most effective TV commercials now
make their appeal to the lone viewer in a terribly different way. Products are
now most often pitched as helping the viewer "express himself," assert his
individuality, "stand out from the crowd." The first instance I ever saw was a
perfume vividly billed in the early eighties as reacting specially with each
woman's "unique body chemistry" and creating "her own individual scent," the
ad depicting a cattle line of languid models waiting cramped and
expressionless to get their wrists squirted one at a time, each smelling her
moist individual wrist with a kind of biochemical revelation, and then moving
off in what a back-pan reveals to be different directions from the squirter
(we can ignore the obvious sexual connotations, squirting and all that; some
tactics are changeless). Or think of that recent series of over-dreary
black-and-white Cherry 7-Up ads where the only characters who get to have
color and stand out from their surroundings are the pink people who become
pink at the exact moment they imbibe. Examples of stand-apart ads are
ubiquitous nightly, now.

Except for being sillier - products billed as distinguishing individuals from
crowds sell to huge crowds of individuals - these ads aren't really any more
complicated or subtle than the old join-the-fulfilling-crowd ads that now seem
so quaint. But the new stand-out ads' relation to their chiaroscuro mass of
lone viewers is both complex and ingenious. Today's best ads are still about
the group, but they now present the group as something fearsome, something
that can swallow you up, erase you, keep you from "being noticed." But noticed
by whom? Crowds are still vitally important in the stand-apart ads' thesis on
identity, but now a given ad's crowd, far from being more appealing, secure,
and alive than the individual, functions as a mass of identical featureless
eyes. The crowd is now, paradoxically, both the "herd" in contrast to which
the viewer's distinctive identity is to be defined, and the impassive
witnesses whose sight alone can confer distinctive identity. The lone viewer's
isolation in front of his furniture is implicitly applauded - it's better,
realer, these solipsistic ads imply, to fly solo - and yet also implicated as
threatening, confusing, since after all Joe Briefcase is not an idiot, sitting
here, and knows himself as a viewer to be guilty of the two big sins the ads
decry: being a passive watcher (of TV) and being part of a great herd (of
TV-watchers and stand-apart-product-buyers). How odd.

The surface of stand-apart ads still presents a relatively unalloyed Buy This
Thing, but the deep message of television w/r/t these ads looks to be that Joe
Briefcase's ontological status as just one in a reactive watching mass is in a
deep way false, and that true actualization of self would ultimately consist
in Joe's becoming one of the images that are the objects of this great
herdlike watching. That is, TV's real pitch in these commercials is that it's
better to be inside the TV than to be outside, watching.

The lonely grandeur of stand-apart advertising not only sells companies'
products, then. It manages brilliantly to ensure - even in commercials that
television gets paid to run - that ultimately TV, and not any specific product
or service, will be regarded by Joe B. as the ultimate arbiter of human worth.
An oracle, to be consulted a lot. Advertising scholar Mark C. Miller puts it
succinctly: "TV has gone beyond the explicit celebration of commodities to the
implicit reinforcement of that spectatorial posture which TV requires of
us."[17] Solipsistic ads are another way television ends up pointing at
itself, keeping the viewer's relation to his furniture at once alienated and
anaclitic.

Maybe, though, the relation of contemporary viewer to contemporary TV is less
a paradigm of infantilism and addiction than it is of the U.S.A.'s familiar
relation to all the technology we equate at once with freedom and power and
slavery and chaos. For, as with TV, whether we happen personally to love
technology, hate it, fear it, or all three, we still look relentlessly to
technology for solutions to the very problems technology seems to cause -
catalysis for smog, S.D.I. for missiles, transplants for assorted rot.

And as with tech, so the gestalt of TV expands to absorb all problems
associated with it. The pseudo-communities of prime-time soaps like Knots
Landing and thirtysomething are viewer-soothing products of the very medium
whose ambivalence about groups helps erode people's sense of connection. The
staccato editing, sound bites, and summary treatment of knotty issues is
network news' accommodation of an Audience whose attention-span and appetite
for complexity have atrophied a bit after years of high-dose spectation. Etc.

But TV has tech-bred problems of its own. The advent of cable, often with
packages of over forty channels, threatens networks and local affiliates
alike. This is particularly true when the viewer is armed with a
remote-control gizmo: Joe B. is still getting his six total hours of daily TV,
but the amount of his retinal time devoted to any one option shrinks as he
remote-scans a much wider band. Worse, the VCR, with its dreaded fast-forward
and ZAP functions, threatens the very viability of commercials. Television
advertisers' sensible solution? Make the ads as appealing as the shows. Or at
any rate try to keep Joe from disliking the commercials enough so that he's
willing to move his thumb to check out two and a half minutes of Hazel on the
Superstation while NBC sells lip balm. Make the ads prettier, livelier, full
of enough rapidly juxtaposed visual quanta that Joe's attention just doesn't
get to wander, even if he remote-kills the volume. As one ad executive
underputs it, "Commercials are becoming more like entertaining films."[18]

There's an obverse way to make commercials resemble programs: have programs
start to resemble commercials. That way the ads seem less like interruptions
than like pace-setters, metronomes, commentaries on the shows' theory. Invent
a Miami Vice, where there's little annoying plot to interrupt an unprecedented
emphasis on appearances, visuals, attitude, a certain "look."[19] Make music
videos with the same amphetaminic pace and dreamy archetypal associations as
ads - it doesn't hurt that videos are basically long record commercials
anyway. Or introduce the sponsor-supplied "infomercial" that poses, in a
light-hearted way, as a soft-news show, like Amazing Discoveries or those
Robert Vaughn-hosted hair-loss "reports" that haunt TV's wee cheap hours.

Still, television and its commercial sponsors had a bigger long-term worry,
and that was their shaky detente with the individual viewer's psyche. Given
that television must revolve off antinomies about being and watching, about
escape from daily life, the averagely intelligent viewer can't be all that
happy about his daily life of high-dose watching. Joe Briefcase might be happy
enough when watching, but it was hard to think he could be too terribly happy
about watching so much. Surely, deep down, Joe was uncomfortable with being
one part of the biggest crowd in human history watching images that suggest
that life's meaning consists in standing visibly apart from the crowd. TV's
guilt/indulgence/reassurance cycle addresses these concerns on one level. But
might there not be some deeper way to keep Joe Briefcase firmly in the crowd
of watchers by somehow associating his very viewership with transcendence of
watching crowds? But that would be absurd.

Enter irony.

I've said, so far without support, that what makes television's hegemony so
resistant to critique by the new fiction of image is that TV has co-opted the
distinctive forms of the same cynical, irreverent, ironic, absurdist post-WWII
literature that the imagists use as touchstones. TV's own reuse of postmodern
cool has actually evolved as a grimly inspired solution to the
keep-Joe-at-once-alienated-from-and-part-of-the-million-eyed-crowd problem.
The solution entailed a gradual shift from oversincerity to a kind of bad-boy
irreverence in the big face TV shows us. This in turn reflected a wider shift
in U.S. perceptions of how art was supposed to work, a transition from art's
being a creative instantiation of real values to art's being a creative
instantiation of deviance from bogus values. And this wider shift in its turn
paralleled both the development of the postmodern aesthetic and some deep
philosophic change in how Americans chose to view concepts like authority,
sincerity, and passion in terms of our willingness to be pleased. Not only are
sincerity and passion now "out," TV-wise, but the very idea of pleasure has
been undercut. As Mark C. Miller puts it, contemporary television "no longer
solicits our rapt absorption or hearty agreement, but - like the ads that
subsidize it - actually flatters us for the very boredom and distrust it
inspires in us."[20]

Miller's 1986 "Deride and Conquer," the best essay ever written on network
advertising, details vividly an example of bow TV's contemporary appeal to the
lone viewer works. It concerns a 1985-86 ad that won Clios and still
occasionally runs. It's that Pepsi commercial where a Pepsi sound van pulls up
to a packed sweltering beach and the impish young guy in the van activates a
lavish PA system and opens up a Pepsi and pours it into a cup up next to the
microphone. And the dense glittered sound of much carbonation goes out over
the beach's heat-wrinkled air, and heads turn vanward as if pulled with
strings as his gulp and refreshed, spiranty sounds are broadcast; and the
final shot reveals that the sound van is also a concession truck, and the
whole beach's pretty population has collapsed to a clamoring mass around the
truck, everybody hopping up and down and pleading to be served first, as the
camera's view retreats to overhead and the slogan is flatly intoned: "Pepsi:
the Choice of a New Generation." Really a stunning commercial. But need one
point out, as Miller does at length, that the final slogan is here
tongue-in-cheek? There's about as much "choice" at work in this commercial as
there was in Pavlov's bell kennel. In fact the whole thirty-second spot is
tongue-in-cheek, ironic, self-mocking. As Miller argues, it's not really
choice that the commercial is "selling" Joe Briefcase on, "but the total
negation. of choices. Indeed, the product itself is finally incidental to the
pitch. The ad does not so much extol Pepsi per se as recommend it by implying
that a lot of people have been fooled into buying it. In other words, the
point of this successful bit of advertising is that Pepsi has been advertised
successfully."[12]

There are important things to realize here. First, this ad is deeply informed
by a fear of remote gizmos, ZAPping, and viewer disdain. An ad about ads, it
uses self-reference to seem too hip to hate. It protects itself from the scorn
today's viewing cognoscente feels for both the fast-talking hard-sell ads Dan
Akroyd parodied into oblivion on Saturday Night Live and the quixotic
associative ads that linked soda-drinking with romance, prettiness, and group
inclusion - ads today's jaded viewer finds old-fashioned and "manipulative."
In contrast to a blatant Buy This Thing, this Pepsi commercial pitches parody.
The ad's utterly up-front about what TV ads are popularly despised for doing:
using primal, flim-flam appeals to sell sugary crud to people whose identity
is nothing but mass consumption. This ad manages simultaneously to make fun of
itself, Pepsi, advertising, advertisers, and the great U.S. watching/consuming
crowd. In fact the ad's uxorious in its flattery of only one person: the lone
viewer, Joe B., who even with an average brain can't help but discern the
ironic contradiction between the "choice" slogan (sound) and the Pavlovian
orgy (sight). The commercial invites Joe to "see through" the manipulation the
beach's horde is rabidly buying. The commercial invites complicity between its
own witty irony and veteran-viewer Joe's cynical, nobody's-fool appreciation
of that irony. It invites Joe into an in-joke the Audience is the butt of. It
congratulates Joe Briefcase, in other words, on transcending the very crowd
that defines him, here. This ad boosted Pepsi's market share through three
sales quarters.

Pepsi's campaign is not unique. Isuzu Inc. hit pay dirt with its series of
"Joe Isuzu" spots, featuring an oily, Satanic-looking salesman who told
whoppers about Isuzus' genuine llama-skin upholstery and ability to run on tap
water. Though the ads rarely said much of anything about why Isuzus are in
fact good cars, sales and awards accrued. The ads succeeded as parodies of how
oily and Satanic car commercials are. They invited viewers to congratulate
Isuzu ads for being ironic, to congratulate themselves for getting the joke,
and to congratulate Isuzu Inc. for being "fearless" and "irreverent" enough to
acknowledge that car ads are ridiculous and that the Audience is dumb to
believe them. The ads invite the lone viewer to drive an Isuzu as some sort of
anti-advertising statement. The ads successfully associate Isuzu-purchase with
fearlessness and irreverence and the capacity to see through deception. You
can find successful television ads that mock TV-ad conventions almost anywhere
you look, from Settlemeyer's Federal Express and Wendy's spots, with their
wizened, sped-up burlesques of commercial characters, to those hip Doritos
splices of commercial spokesmen and campy old clips of Beaver and Mr. Ed.

Plus you can see this tactic of heaping scorn on pretensions to those old
commercial virtues of authority and sincerity - thus (1) shielding the heaper
of scorn from scorn and (2) congratulating the patron of scorn for rising
above the mass of people who still fall for outmoded pretensions - employed to
serious advantage on many of the television programs the commercials support.
Show after show, for years now, has been either a self-acknowledged blank,
visual, postmodern allusion- and attitude-fest, or, even more common, an
uneven battle of wits between some ineffectual spokesman for hollow authority
and his precocious children, mordant spouse, or sardonic colleagues. Compare
television's treatment of earnest authority figures on pre-ironic shows - the
FBI's Erskine, Star Trek's Kirk, Beaver's Ward, Partridge Family's Shirley,
Five-O's McGarrett - to TV's depiction of Al Bundy on Married, with Children,
Mr. Owens on Mr. Belvedere, Homer on The Simpsons, Daniels and Hunter on Hill
Street Blues, Jason Seaver on Growing Pains, Dr. Craig on St. Elsewhere.

The modern Sitcom,[22] in particular, is almost wholly dependent for laughs
and tone on the M*A*S*H-inspired savaging of some buffoonish spokesman for
hypocritical, pre-hip values at the hands of bitingly witty insurgents. As
Hawkeye savaged Frank and later Charles, so Herb is savaged by Jennifer and
Carlson by J. Fever on WKRP, Mr. Keaton by Alex on Family Ties, boss by typing
pool on Nine to Five, Seaver by whole family on Pains, Bundy by entire planet
on Married, w/ (the ultimate sitcom parody of sitcoms). In fact, just about
the only authority figures who retain any credibility on post-eighties shows
(besides those like Hill Street's Furillo and Elsewhere's Westphal, who are
surrounded by such relentless squalor that simply hanging in there week after
week makes them heroic) are those upholders of values who can communicate some
irony about themselves,[23] make fun of themselves before any merciless group
around them can move in for the kill - see Huxtable on Cosby, Belvedere on
Belvedere, Twin Peaks' Special Agent Cooper, Fox TV's Gary Shandling (the
theme to whose show goes "This is the theme to Gary's show"), and the ironic
eighties' true Angel of Death, D. Letterman.

Its promulgation of cynicism about all authority works to the general
advantage of television on a number of levels. First, to the extent that TV
can ridicule old-fashioned conventions right off the map, it can create an
authority vacuum. And then guess what fills it. The real authority on a world
we now view as constructed and not depicted becomes the medium that constructs
our worldview. Second, to the extent that TV can refer exclusively to itself
and debunk conventional standards as hollow, it is invulnerable to critics'
charges that what's on is shallow or crass or bad, since any such judgments
appeal to conventional, extratelevisual standards about depth, taste, and
quality. Too, the ironic tone of TV's self-reference means that no one can
accuse TV of trying to put anything over on anybody: as essayist Lewis Hyde
points out, all self-mocking irony is "Sincerity, with a motive."[24]

And, more to the original point, if television can invite Joe Briefcase into
itself via in-gags and irony, it can ease that painful tension between Joe's
need to transcend the crowd and his status as Audience member. For to the
extent that TV can flatter Joe about "seeing through" the pretentiousness and
hypocrisy of outdated values, it can induce in him precisely the feeling of
canny superiority it's taught him to crave, and can keep him dependent on the
cynical TV-watching that alone affords this feeling. And to the extent that it
can train viewers to laugh at characters' unending put-downs of one another,
to view ridicule as both the mode of social intercourse and the ultimate art
form, television can reinforce its own queer ontology of appearance: the most
frightening prospect, for the well-conditioned viewer, becomes leaving oneself
open to others' ridicule by betraying passe expressions of value, emotion, or
vulnerability. Other people become judges; the crime is naivete. The
well-trained lonely viewer becomes even more allergic to people. Lonelier. Joe
B.'s exhaustive TV-training in how to worry about how he might come across,
seem to other eyes, makes riskily genuine human encounters seem even scarier.
But televisual irony has the solution (to the problem it's aggravated):
further viewing begins to seem almost like required research, lessons in the
blank, bored, too-wise expression that Joe must learn how to wear for
tomorrow's excruciating ride on the brightly lit subway, where crowds of
blank, bored-looking people have little to look at but each other.

What does TV's institutionalization of hip irony have to do with U.S. fiction?
Well, for one thing, American literary fiction tends to be about U.S. culture
and the people who inhabit it. Culture-wise, shall I spend much of your time
pointing out the degree to which televisual values influence the contemporary
mood of jaded weltschmerz, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and
the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive? Can we deny
connections between an unprecedentedly powerful consensual medium that
suggests no real difference between image and substance and the rise of Teflon
presidencies, the establishment of nationwide tanning and liposuction
industries, the popularity of "vogueing" to a bad Marilyn-imitator's
synthesized command to "strike a pose"? Or, in serious contemporary art, that
televisual disdain for "hypocritical" retrovalues like originality, depth, and
integrity has no truck with those recombinant "appropriation" styles of art
and architecture in which past becomes pastiche,[25] or with the tuneless
solmization of a Glass or a Reich, or with the self-conscious catatonia of a
platoon of Raymond Carver wannabes?

In fact the numb blank bored demeanor - what my best friend calls the
"girl-who's-dancing-with-you-but-would-obviously-rather-be-dancing-with-somebo
dy -else" expression - that has become my generation's version of cool is all
about TV. "Television," after all, literally means "seeing far"; and our 6
hrs. daily not only helps us feel up-close and personal at like the Pan Am
Games or Operation Desert Shield but, obversely, trains us to see real-life
personal up-close stuff the same way we relate to the distant and exotic, as
if separated from us by physics and glass, extant only as performance,
awaiting our cool review. Indifference is actually just the contemporary
version of frugality, for U.S. young people: wooed several gorgeous hours a
day for nothing but our attention, we regard that attention as our chief
commodity, our social capital, and we are loath to fritter it. In the same
regard, see that in 1990, flatness, numbness, and cynicism in one's demeanor
are clear ways to transmit the televisual attitude of stand-out transcendence
- flatness is a transcendence of melodrama, numbness transcends
sentimentality, and cynicism announces that one knows the score, was last
naive about something at maybe like age four.

Whether or not 1990s youth culture seems as grim to you as it does to me,
surely we can agree that the culture's TV-defined pop ethic has pulled a
marvelous touche on the postmodern aesthetic that originally sought to co-opt
and redeem the pop. Television has pulled the old dynamics of reference and
redemption inside-out: it is now television that takes elements of the
postmodern - the involution, the absurdity, the sardonic fatigue, the
iconoclasm and rebellion - and bends them to the ends of spectation and
consumption. As early as '84, critics of capitalism were warning that "What
began as a mood of the avant-garde has surged into mass culture."[26]

But postmodernism didn't just all of a sudden "surge" into television in 1984.
Nor have the vectors of influence between the postmodern and the televisual
been one-way. The chief connection between today's television and today's
fiction is historical. The two share roots. For postmodern fiction - written
almost exclusively by young white males-clearly evolved as an intellectual
expression of the "rebellious youth culture" of the sixties and early
seventies. And since the whole gestalt of youthful U.S. rebellion was made
possible by a national medium that erased communicative boundaries between
regions and replaced a society segmented by location and ethnicity with what
rock music critics have called "a national self-consciousness stratified by
generation,"[27] the phenomenon of TV had as much to do with postmodernism's
rebellious irony as it did with peaceniks' protest rallies.

In fact, by offering young, overeducated fiction writers a comprehensive view
of how hypocritically the U.S.A. saw itself circa 1960, early television
helped legitimize absurdism and irony as not just literary devices but
sensible responses to an unrealistic world. For irony - exploiting gaps
between what's said and what's meant, between how things try to appear and how
they really are - is the time-honored way artists seek to illuminate and
explode hypocrisy. And the television of lone-gunman Westerns, paternalistic
sitcoms, and jut-jawed law enforcement circa 1960 celebrated a deeply
hypocritical American self-image. Miller describes nicely how the 1960s
sitcom, like the Westerns that preceded them, "negated the increasing
powerlessness of white-collar males with images of paternal strength and manly
individualism. Yet by the time these sit-coms were produced, the world of
small business [whose virtues were the Hugh Beaumontish ones of
'self-possession, probity, and sound judgment'] had long since been . . .
superseded by what C. Wright Mills called 'the managerial demiurge,' and the
virtues personified by . . . Dad were in fact passe."[28]

In other words, early U.S. TV was a hypocritical apologist for values whose
reality had become attenuated in a period of corporate ascendancy,
bureaucratic entrenchment, foreign adventurism, racial conflict, secret
bombing, assassination, wiretaps, etc. It's not one bit accidental that
postmodern fiction aimed its ironic cross hairs at the banal, the naive, the
sentimental and simplistic and conservative, for these qualities were just
what sixties TV seemed to celebrate as "American."

And the rebellious irony in the best postmodern fiction wasn't only credible
as art; it seemed downright socially useful in its capacity for what
counterculture critics call "a critical negation that would make it
self-evident to everyone that the world is not as it seems."[29] Kesey's dark
parody of asylums suggested that our arbiters of sanity were maybe crazier
than their patients; Pynchon reoriented our view of paranoia from deviant
psychic fringe to central thread in the corporo-bureaucratic weave; DeLillo
exposed image, signal, data, and tech as agents of spiritual chaos and not
social order. Burroughs's icky explorations of American narcosis exploded
hypocrisy; Gaddis's exposure of abstract capital as dehumanizing exploded
hypocrisy; Coover's repulsive political farces exploded hypocrisy. Irony in
sixties art and culture started out the same way youthful rebellion did. It
was difficult and painful, and productive - a grim diagnosis of a long-denied
disease. The assumptions behind this early postmodern irony, on the other
hand, were still frankly idealistic: that etiology and diagnosis pointed
toward cure; that revelation of imprisonment yielded freedom.

So then how have irony, irreverence, and rebellion come to be not liberating
but enfeebling in the culture today's avant-garde tries to write about? One
clue's to be found in the fact that irony is still around, bigger than ever
after thirty long years as the dominant mode of hip expression. It's not a
mode that wears especially well. As Hyde puts it, "Irony has only emergency
use. Carried over time, it is the voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy
their cage." This is because irony, entertaining as it is, serves an
exclusively negative function. It's critical and destructive, a
ground-clearing. Surely this is the way our postmodern fathers saw it. But
irony's singularly unuseful when it comes to constructing anything to replace
the hypocrisies it debunks. This is why Hyde seems right about persistent
irony being tiresome. It is unmeaty. Even gifted ironists work best in sound
bites. I find them sort of wickedly fun to listen to at parties, but I always
walk away feeling like I've had several radical surgical procedures. And as
for actually driving cross-country with a gifted ironist, or sitting through a
300-page novel full of nothing but trendy sardonic exhaustion, one ends up
feeling not only empty but somehow ... oppressed.

Think, if you will for a moment, of Third World rebels and coups. Rebels are
great at exposing and overthrowing corrupt hypocritical regimes, but seem
noticeably less great at the mundane, non-negative tasks of then establishing
a superior governing alternative. Victorious rebels, in fact, seem best at
using their tough cynical rebel skills to avoid being rebelled against
themselves - in other words they just become better tyrants.

And make no mistake: irony tyrannizes us. The reason why our pervasive
cultural irony is at once so powerful and so unsatisfying is that an ironist
is impossible to pin down. All irony is a variation on a sort of existential
poker-face. All U.S. irony is based on an implicit "I don't really mean what I
say." So what does irony as a cultural norm mean to say? That it's impossible
to mean what you say? That maybe it's too bad it's impossible, but wake up and
smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today's irony ends up saying:
"How very banal to ask what I mean." Anyone with the heretical gall to ask an
ironist what he actually stands for ends up looking like a hysteric or a prig.
And herein lies the oppressiveness of institutionalized irony, the
too-successful rebel: the ability to interdict the question without attending
to its content is tyranny. It is the new junta, using the very tool that
exposed its enemy to insulate itself.

This is why our educated teleholic friends' use of weary cynicism to try to
seem superior to TV is so pathetic. And this is why the fiction-writing
citizen of our televisual culture is in such deep doo. What do you do when
postmodern rebellion becomes a pop-cultural institution? For this of course is
the second clue to why avant-garde irony and rebellion have become dilute and
malign. They have been absorbed, emptied, and redeployed by the very
televisual establishment they had originally set themselves athwart.

Not that television is culpable for true evil, here. Just for immoderate
success. This is, after all, what TV does: it discerns, decocts, and
represents what it thinks U.S. culture wants to see and hear about itself. No
one and everyone is at fault for the fact that television started gleaning
rebellion and cynicism as the hip, upscale, baby-boomer imago populi. But the
harvest has been dark: the forms of our best rebellious art have become mere
gestures, shticks, not only sterile but perversely enslaving. How can, even
the idea of rebellion against corporate culture stay meaningful when Chrysler
Inc. advertises trucks by invoking "The Dodge Rebellion"? How is one to be a
bona fide iconoclast when Burger King sells onion rings with "Sometimes You
Gotta Break the Rules"? How can a new image-fiction writer hope to make people
more critical of televisual culture by parodying television as a self-serving
commercial enterprise when Pepsi and Isuzu and Fed Ex parodies of self-serving
commercials are already big business? It's almost a history lesson: I'm
starting to see just why turn-of-the-century America's biggest fear was of
anarchists and anarchy. For if anarchy actually wins, if rulelessness becomes
the rule, then protest and change become not just impossible but incoherent.
It'd be like casting ballots for Stalin: how do you vote for no more voting?

So here's the stumper for the 1990 U.S. fictionist who both breathes our
cultural atmosphere and sees himself heir to whatever was neat and valuable in
postmodern lit. How to rebel against TV's aesthetic of rebellion? How to snap
readers awake to the fact that our TV-culture has become a cynical,
narcissistic, essentially empty phenomenon, when television regularly
celebrates just these features in itself and its viewers? These are the very
questions DeLillo's poor schmuck of a popologist was asking back in '85 about
America, that most photographed of barns:

"What was the barn like before it was photographed?" he said. "What did it
look like, how was it different from other barns, how was it similar to other
barns? We can't answer these questions because we've lead the signs, seen the
people snapping the pictures. We can't get outside the aura. We're part of the
aura. We're here, we're now."

He seemed immensely pleased by this.[30]

End of the End of the Line

What responses to television's commercialization of the modes of literary
protest seem possible, then, today? One obvious option is for the fiction
writer to become reactionary, fundamentalist. Declare contemporary television
evil and contemporary culture evil and turn one's back on the whole Spandexed
mess and genuflect instead to good old pre-sixties Hugh Beaumontish virtues
and literal readings of the Testaments and be pro-Life, anti-Fluoride,
antediluvian. The problem with this is that Americans who've opted for this
tack seem to have one eyebrow straight across their forebead and knuckles that
drag on the ground and just seem like an excellent crowd to want to transcend.
Besides, the rise of Reagan/Bush showed that hypocritical nostalgia for a
kinder, gentler, more Christian pseudo-past is no less susceptible to
manipulation in the interests of corporate commercialism and PR image. Most of
us will still take nihilism over neanderthalism.

Another option is to adopt a somewhat more enlightened political conservatism
that exempts viewer and networks alike from any complicity in the bitter
stasis of televisual culture, and instead blames all TV-related problems on
certain correctable defects in broadcasting technology. Enter media
futurologist George Gilder, a Hudson Institute Senior Fellow and author of
1990's Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and American
Life. The single most fascinating thing about Life after Television is that
it's a book with commercials. Published in something called "The Larger Agenda
Series" by a "Whittle Direct Books" in Federal Express Inc.'s Knoxville
headquarters, the book sells for only $11.00 hard, including postage, is big
and thin enough to look great on executive coffee tables, and has really
pretty full-page ads for Federal Express on every fifth page. The book's also
largely a work of fiction, plus is a heart-rending dramatization of why
anti-TV conservatives, motivated by simple convictions like "Television is at
heart a totalitarian medium" whose "system is an alien and corrosive force in
democratic capitalism"[31] are going to be of little help with our
ultraradical TV problems, attached as conservative intellectuals still are to
their twin tired remedies for all U.S. ills: the beliefs that (1) the
discerning consumer instincts of the little guy would correct all imbalances
if only big systems would quit stifling his freedom to choose, and that (2)
tech-bred problems can be resolved technologically.

Gilder's basic report and forecast run thus: television as we know and suffer
it is "a technology with supreme powers but deadly flaws." The really fatal
flaw is that the whole structure of television programming, broadcasting, and
reception is still informed by the technological limitations of the old vacuum
tubes that first enabled TV. The "expense and complexity of these tubes used
in television sets meant that most of the processing of signals would have to
be done at the" networks, a state of affairs that "dictated that television
would be a top-down system - in electronic terms, a |master-slave'
architecture. A few broadcasting centers would originate programs for millions
of passive receivers, or |dumb terminals.' "By the time the transistor (which
does essentially what vacuum tubes do but in less space at lower cost) found
commercial applications, the top-down TV system was already entrenched and
petrified, dooming viewers to docile reception of programs they were dependent
on a very few networks to provide, and creating a "psychology of the masses"
in which a trio of programming alternatives aimed to appeal to millions and
millions of Joe B.s. The passive plight of the viewer was aggravated by the
fact that the EM pulses used to broadcast TV signals are analog waves. Analogs
were once the required medium, since "with little storage or processing
available at the set, the signals ... would have to be directly displayable
waves," and "analog waves directly simulate sound, brightness, and color." But
analog waves can't be saved or edited by their recipient. They're too much
like life: there in gorgeous toto one instant and then gone. What the poor TV
viewer gets is only what he sees. With cultural consequences Gilder describes
in apocalyptic detail. Even High Definition Television (HDTV), touted by the
industry as the next big advance in entertainment-furniture, will, according
to Gilder, be just the same vacuuous emperor in a snazzier suit.

But in 1990, TV, still clinging to the crowd-binding and hierarchical
technologies of yesterdecade, is for Gilder now doomed by the advances in
microchip and fiber-optic technology of the last couple years. The
user-friendly microchip, which consolidates the activities of millions of
transistors on one 49 [cents] wafer, and whose capacities will get even more
attractive as controlled-electron conduction approaches the geodesic paradigm
of efficiency, will allow receivers - TV sets - to do much of the
image-processing that has hitherto been done "for" the viewer by the
broadcaster. In another happy development, transporting images through glass
fibers rather than the EM spectrum will allow people's TV sets to be hooked up
with each other in a kind of interactive net instead of all feeding passively
at the transmitting teat of a single broadcaster. And fiber-optic
transmissions have the further advantage that they conduct characters of
information digitally. Since "digital signals have an advantage over analog
signals in that they can be stored and manipulated without deterioration," as
well as being crisp and interferenceless as quality CDs, they'll allow the
microchip'd television receiver (and thus the TV viewer) to enjoy much of the
discretion over selection, manipulation, and recombination of video images
that is now restricted to the director's booth.

For Gilder, the new piece of furniture that will free Joe Briefcase from
passive dependence on his furniture will be "the telecomputer, a personal
computer adapted for video processing and connected by fiber-optic threads to
other telecomputers around the world." The fibrous TC "will forever break the
broadcast bottleneck" of television's one-active-many-passive structure of
image-propagation. Now everybody'll get to be his own harried guy with
headphones and clipboard. In the new millennium, U.S. television will finally
become ideally, GOPishly democratic: egalitarian, interactive, and "profitable
without being exploitative."

Boy, does Gilder know his "Larger Agenda" audience. You can just see saliva
overflowing lower lips in boardrooms as Gilder forecasts that the consumer's
whole complicated fuzzy inconveniently transient world will become
broadcastable, manipulable, storable, and viewable in the comfort of his own
condo. "With artful programming of telecomputers, you could spend a day
interacting on the screen with Henry Kissinger, Kim Basinger, or Billy
Graham." Rather ghastly interactions to contemplate, but then in Gilderland to
each his own: "Celebrities could produce and sell their own software. You
could view the Super Bowl from any point in the stadium you choose, or soar
above the basket with Michael Jordan. Visit your family on the other side of
the world with moving pictures hardly distinguishable from real-life images.
Give a birthday party for Grandma in her nursing home in Florida, bringing her
descendents from all over the country to the foot of her bed in living color."

And not just warm 2D images of family: any experience will be transferrable to
image and marketable, manipulable, consumable. People will be able to "go
comfortably sight-seeing from their living room through high-resolution
screens, visiting Third-World countries without having to worry about air
fares or exchange rates ... you could fly an airplane over the Alps or climb
Mount Everest - all on a powerful high-resolution display."

We will, in short, be able to engineer our own dreams.

In sum, then, a conservative tech writer offers a really attractive way of
looking at viewer passivity and TV's institutionalization of irony,
narcissism, nihilism, stasis. It's not our fault! It's outmoded technology's
fault! If TV-dissemination were up to date, it would be impossible for it to
"institutionalize" anything through its demonic "mass psychology"! Let's let
Joe B., the little lonely guy, be his own manipulator of video-bits! Once all
experience is finally reduced to marketable image, once the receiving user of
user-friendly receivers can choose freely, Americanly, from an Americanly
infinite variety of moving images hardly distinguishable from real-life
images, and can then choose further just how he wishes to store, enhance,
edit, recombine, and present those images to himself, in the privacy of his
very own home and skull, TV's ironic, totalitarian grip on the American
psychic cajones will be broken!

Note that Gilder's semiconducted vision of a free, orderly video future is way
more upbeat than postmodernism's old view of image and data. The seminal
novels of Pynchon and DeLillo revolve metaphorically off the concept of
interference: the more connections, the more chaos, and the harder it is to
cull any meaning from the seas of signed. Gilder would call their gloom
outmoded, their metaphor infected with the deficiencies of the transistor: "In
all networks of wires and switches, except for those on the microchip,
complexity tends to grow exponentially as the number of interconnections
rises, [but] in the silicon maze of microchip technology . . . efficiency, not
complexity, grows as the square of the number of interconnections to be
organized." Rather than a vacuous TV-culture smothering in cruddy images,
Gilder foresees a TC-culture redeemed by a whole lot more to choose from and a
whole lot more control over what you choose to . . . umm . . . see?
pseudo-experience? dream?

It'd be unrealistic to think that expanded choices alone could resolve our
televisual bind. The advent of cable upped choices from four or five to
forty-plus synchronic alternatives, with little apparent loosening of
television's grip on mass attitudes and aesthetics. It seems rather that
Gilder sees the nineties' impending breakthrough as U.S. viewers' graduation
from passive reception of facsimiles of experience to active manipulation of
facsimiles of experience.

It's worth questioning Gilder's definition of televisual "passivity," though.
His new tech would indeed end "the passivity of mere reception." But the
passivity of Audience, the acquiescence inherent in a whole culture of and
about watching, looks unaffected by TCs.

The appeal of watching television has always involved fantasy. Contemporary
TV, I've claimed, has gotten vastly better at enabling the viewer's fantasy
that he can transcend the limitations of individual human experience, that he
can be inside the set, imago'd, "anyone, anywhere."[32] Since the limitations
of being one human being involve certain restrictions on the number of
different experiences possible to us in a given period of time, it's arguable
that the biggest TV-tech "advances" of recent years have done little but abet
this fantasy of escape from the defining limits of being human. Cable expands
our choices of evening realities; hand-held gizmos let us leap instantly from
one to another; VCRs let us commit experiences to an eidetic memory that
permits re-experience at any time without loss or alteration. These advances
sold briskly and upped average viewing-doses, but they sure haven't made U.S.
televisual culture any less passive or cynical.

The downside of TV's big fantasy is that it's just a fantasy. As a special
treat, my escape from the limits of genuine experience is neato. As my steady
diet, though, it can't help but render my own reality less attractive (because
in it I'm just one Dave, with limits and restrictions all over the place),
render me less fit to make the most of it (because I spend all my time
pretending I'm not in it), and render me dependent on the device that affords
escape from just what my escapism makes unpleasant.

It's tough to see how Gilder's soteriological vision of having more "control"
over the arrangement of high-quality fantasy-bits is going to ease either the
dependency that is part of my relation to TV or the impotent irony I must use
to pretend I'm not dependent. Whether passive or active as viewer, I must
still cynically pretend, because I'm still dependent, because my real
dependency here is not on the single show or few networks any more than the
hophead's is on the Turkish florist or the Marseilles refiner. My real
dependency is on the fantasies and the images that enable them, and thus on
any technology that can make images fantastic. Make no mistake. We are
dependent on image-technology; and the better the tech, the harder we're
hooked.

The paradox in Gilder's rosy forecast is the same as in all forms of
artificial enhancement. The more enhancing the mediation - see for instance
binoculars, amplifiers, graphic equalizers, or "high-resolution pictures
hardly distinguishable from real-life images" - the more direct, vivid, and
real the experience seems, which is to say the more direct, vivid, and real
the fantasy and dependence are.

An exponential surge in the mass of televisual images, and a commensurate
increase in my ability to cut, paste, magnify, and combine them to suit my own
fancy, can do nothing but render my interactive TC a more powerful enhancer
and enabler of fantasy, my attraction to that fantasy stronger, the real
experiences of which my TC offers more engaging and controllable simulacra
paler and more frustrating to deal with, and me just a whole lot more
dependent on my furniture. Jacking the number of choices and options up with
better tech will remedy exactly nothing, so long as no sources of insight on
comparative worth, no guides to why and how to choose among experiences,
fantasies, beliefs, and predilections, are permitted serious consideration in
U.S. culture. Insights and guides to human value used to be among literature's
jobs, didn't they? But then who's going to want to take such stuff seriously
in ecstatic post-TV life, with Kim Basinger waiting to be interacted with?

My God, I've just reread my heartfelt criticisms of Gilder. That he is naive.
That he is an apologist for cynical corporate self-interest. That his book has
commercials. That under its futuristic novelty is just the same old American
same-old that got us into this televisual mess. That Gilder vastly
underestimates the intractability of the mess. Its hopelessness. Our fatigue.
My attitude, reading Gilder, is sardonic, aloof, jaded. My reading of Gilder
is televisual. I am in the aura.

Well, but at least Gilder is unironic. In this respect he's like a cool summer
breeze compared to Mark Leyner, the young New Jersey writer whose 1990 My
Cousin, My Gastroenterologist is the biggest thing for campus hipsters since
The Dharma Bums. Leyner's ironic cyberpunk novel exemplifies a third kind of
literary response to our problem. For of course young U.S. writers can
"resolve" the problem of being trapped in the televisual aura the same way
French poststructuralists "resolve" their being enmeshed in the logos. We can
solve the problem by celebrating it. Transcend feelings of mass-defined angst
by genuflecting to them. We can be reverently ironic.

My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist is new not so much in kind as in degree. It
is a methedrine compound of pop pastiche, offhand high tech, and dazzling
televisual parody, formed with surreal juxtapositions and grammarless
monologues and flash-cut editing, and framed with a relentless irony designed
to make its frantic tone seem irreverent instead of repulsive. You want
sendups of commercial culture?

I had just been fired from McDonald's for refusing to wear a kilt during
production launch week for their new McHaggis sandwich. (18)

(144)

You want mordant sendups of television?

Muriel got the TV Guide, flipped to Tuesday 8 p.m., and read aloud: . . .
There's a show called "A Tumult of Pubic Hair and Bobbing Flaccid Penises as
Sweaty Naked Chubby Men Run From the Sauna Screaming Snake! Snake! . . . It
also stars Brian Keith, Buddy Ebsen, Nipsey Russell, and Lesley Ann Warren.
(98-99)

You like mocking self-reference? The novel's whole last chapter is a parody of
its own "About the Author" page. Or maybe you're into hip identitylessness?

Grandma rolled up a magazine and hit Buzz on the side of the head. . . .
Buzz's mask was knocked loose. There was no skin beneath that mask. There were
two white eyeballs protruding on stems from a mass of oozing blood-red
musculature. (98)

I can't tell if she's human or a fifth-generation gynemorphic android and I
don't care. (6)

Parodic meditations on the boundaryless flux of televisual monoculture?

I'm stirring a pitcher of Tanqueray martinis with one hand and sliding a tray
of frozen clams oreganata into the oven with my foot. God, these methedrine
suppositories that Yogi Vithaldas gave me are good! As I iron a pair of tennis
shorts I dictate a haiku into the tape recorder and then . . . do three
minutes on the speedbag before making an origami praying mantis and then
reading an article in High Fidelity magazine as I stir the coq au vin. (49)

The decay of both the limits and the integrity of the single human self?

There was a woman with the shrunken, wrinkled face of an eighty- or
ninety-year-old. And this withered hag, this apparent octogenarian, had the
body of a male Olympic swimmer. The long lean sinewy arms, the powerful
V-shaped upper torso, without a single ounce of fat. . . . (120)

insert guide pins through mounting holes . . . if, after installing new head,
you are unable to discern the contradictions in capitalist modes of
production, you have either installed your head improperly or head is
defective (142-43)

In fact, one of My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist's unifying obsessions is this
latter juxtaposition of parts of selves, people and machines, human subjects
and discrete objects. Leyner's fiction is, in this regard, an eloquent reply
to Gilder's prediction that our TV-culture problems can be resolved by the
dismantling of images into discrete chunks we can recombine as we fancy.
Leyner's world is a Gilder-esque dystopia. The passivity and schizoid decay
still endure for Leyner in his characters' reception of images and waves of
data. The ability to combine them only adds a layer of disorientation: when
all experience can be deconstructed and reconfigured, there become simply too
many choices. And in the absence of any credible, noncommercial guides for
living, the freedom to choose is about as "liberating" as a bad acid trip:
each quantum is as good as the next, and the only standard of an assembly's
quality is its weirdness, incongruity, its ability to stand out from a crowd
of other image-constructs and wow some Audience.

Leyner's novel, in its amphetaminic eagerness to wow the reader, marks the far
dark frontier of the fiction of image - literature's absorption of not just
the icons, techniques, and phenomena of television, but of television's whole
objective. My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist's sole aim is, finally, to wow, to
ensure that the reader is pleased and continues to read. The book does this by
(1) flattering the reader with appeals to his erudite postmodern weltschmerz,
and (2) relentlessly reminding the reader that the author is smart and funny.
The book itself is extremely funny, but it's not funny the way funny stories
are funny. It's not that funny things happen here; it's that funny things are
self-consciously imagined and pointed out, like the comedian's stock "You ever
notice how. . . ?" or "Ever wonder what would happen if. . . ?"

Actually, Leyner's whole high-imagist style most often resembles a kind of
lapidary stand-up comedy:

Suddenly Bob couldn't speak properly. He had suffered some form of spontaneous
aphasia. But it wasn't total aphasia. He could speak, but only in a staccato
telegraphic style. Here's how he described driving through the Midwest on
Interstate 80: "Corn corn corn corn Stuckeys. Corn corn corn corn Stuckeys."
(20)

there's a bar on the highway which caters almost exclusively to authority
figures and the only drink it serves is lite beer and the only food it serves
is surf and turf and the place is filled with cops and state troopers and gym
teachers and green berets and toll attendants and game wardens and crossing
guards and umpires. (89-90)

Leyner's fictional response to television is less a novel than a piece of
witty, erudite, extremely high-quality prose television. Velocity and
vividness - the wow - replace the literary hmm of actual development. People
flicker in and out; events are garishly there and then gone and never referred
to. There's a brashly irreverent rejection of "outmoded" concepts like
integrated plot or enduring character. Instead there's a series of dazzlingly
creative parodic vignettes, designed to appeal to the forty-five seconds of
near-Zen concentration we call the TV attention span. Unifying the vignettes
in the absence of plot are moods - antic anxiety, the over-stimulated stasis
of too many choices and no chooser's manual, irreverent brashness toward
televisual reality - and, after the manner of pop films, music videos, dreams,
and television programs, recurring "key images" - here exotic drugs, exotic
technology, exotic food, exotic bowel dysfunctions. It's no accident that My
Cousin, My Gastroenterologist's central preoccupation is with digestion and
elimination. Its mocking challenge to the reader is the same as television's
flood of realities and choices: ABSORB ME - PROVE YOU'RE CONSUMER ENOUGH.

Leyner's work, the best image-fiction yet, is both amazing and forgettable,
wonderful and oddly hollow. I'm finishing up by talking about it at length
because, in its masterful reabsorption of the very features TV had absorbed
from postmodern lit, it seems as of now the ultimate union of U.S. television
and fiction. It seems also to limn the qualities of image-fiction itself in
stark relief: the best stuff the subgenre's produced to date is hilarious,
upsetting, sophisticated, and extremely shallow - and just plain doomed by its
desire to ridicule a TV-culture whose ironic mockery of itself and all
"outdated" value absorbs all ridicule. Leyner's attempt to "respond" to
television via ironic genuflection is all too easily subsumed into the tired
televisual ritual of mock worship.

Entirely possible that my plangent cries about the impossibility of rebelling
against an aura that promotes and attenuates all rebellion says more about my
residency inside that aura, my own lack of vision, than it does about any
exhaustion of U.S. fiction's possibilities. The next real literary "rebels" in
this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of "anti-rebels," born
oglers who dare to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall
actually to endorse single-entendre values. Who treat old untrendy human
troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew
self-consciousness and fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of
course, before they even started. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward,
quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that'll be the point, why they'll be the
next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk things. Risk
disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock,
disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism.
The new rebels might be the ones willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes,
the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the "How
banal." Accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Credulity. Willingness to be
suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above
imprisonment without law. Who knows. Today's most engaged young fiction does
seem like some kind of line's end's end. I guess that means we all get to draw
our own conclusions. Have to. Are you immensely pleased.

Full Text COPYRIGHT 1993 Review of Contemporary Fiction

The night after the depressing and awkward joint Interdependence Day party for
Enfield's Ennet House Recovery Home, Somerville's Phoenix House, and
Dorchester's grim New Choices juvenile rehab, Ennet House staffer Johnette
Foltz took Ken Erdedy and Kate Gompert along with her to this one NA
beginners' discussion meeting where the topic was always marijuana: how every
addict at the meeting had gotten in terrible addictive trouble with it right
from the first Dubois, or else how they'd been strung out on harder drugs and
had tried switching to grass to get off the original drugs and but then had
gotten in even terribler trouble with grass than they'd been in with the
original hard stuff. This was supposedly the only NA meeting in metro Boston
explicitly devoted to marijuana. Johnette Foltz said she wanted Erdedy and
Gompert to see how completely ununique they were in terms of the substance
that had brought them down.

There were about maybe two dozen new recovering addicts there in the anechoic
vestry of an upscale church in what Erdedy figured had to be either west
Belmont or east Waltham. The chairs were arranged in NA's traditional huge
circle, with no tables to sit at and everybody balancing ashtrays on their
knees and accidentally kicking over their cups of coffee. Everybody who raised
their hand to share concurred on the insidious ways marijuana had ravaged
their bodies and minds and spirits: grass destroys slowly but thoroughly, was
the consensus. Ken Erdedy's joggling foot knocked over his coffee not once but
twice as the NAs took turns concurring on the hideous psychic fallout they'd
all endured both in active marijuana-dependency and then in marijuana-detox -
the social withdrawal and anxious lassitude, the hyperself-consciousness that
then reinforced the withdrawal and anxiety, the increasing cognitive
abstraction, poverty of affect, and then total emotional catalepsy, the
obsessive analyzing, finally the paralytic stasis that results from obsessive
analysis of all possible implications of both getting up from the couch and
not getting up from the couch - and then the endless symptomatic gauntlet of
withdrawal from delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol: grass-detox: the loss of
appetite, the mania and insomnia, the chronic fatigue and nightmares, the
impotence and cessation of menses and lactation, the circadian arrhythmia, the
sudden sauna-type sweats and mental confusion and fine-motor tremors, the
particularly nasty excess production of saliva - several beginners still
holding institutional drool cups just under their chins - the generalized
angst and dread, and the shame of neither MDs nor har-drug NAs showing much
compassion for the "addict" brought down by what was supposed to be one of
nature's humbler buzzes, the benignest narcotic around.

Ken Erdedy noticed that nobody came right out and used the term "depression"
or "melancholy," much less "clinical depression," but this worst of symptoms,
this logarithm of all other suffering, seemed, though unmentioned, to hang
foglike just over the room's heads, to drift between the peristyle columns and
over the decorative astrolabes and medieval knock-offs and framed Knights of
Columbus charters, a gassy plasm so dreaded no beginner could bear to look up
and name it. Kate Gompert kept staring at the floor and making a revolver of
her forefinger and thumb and shooting herself in the temple and then blowing
pretend-cordite off the barrel's lip until Johnette Foltz told her to knock it
off.

As was his custom at meetings, Ken Erdedy said nothing and observed everybody
else very closely, cracking his knuckles and joggling his foot. Since an-NA
beginner is technically anybody with under a year clean, there there were
wildly varying degrees of denial and distress and general cluelessness in this
plush vestry. Though in an upscale suburb, the meeting had NA's broad
demographic cross-section, but the bulk of these grass-ravaged people looked
urban and tough and busted-up and dressed without any color-sense at all,
people you could easily imagine smacking their kid in a supermarket or lurking
with a homemade sap in the dark of a downtown alley. Same as AA. Motley
disrespectability was like the room norm, along with glazed eyes and excess
spittle. A couple of the beginners still had the milky plastic ID bracelets
from psych wards they'd forgotten to cut off, or else hadn't yet gotten up the
motivation to do it.

Boston NA has no mid-meeting break and goes for just an hour. At the end of
the beginners' meeting everybody got up and held hands in a circle and recited
the NA-Conference-Approved "Just For Today," then they all recited the Our
Father, not exactly in unison. Kate Gompert later swore she distinctly heard
the wen-studded man beside her say "And lead us not into Penn Station" during
the Our Father. Then, just as in AA, the NA meeting closed with everybody
shouting to everybody to Keep Coming Back because It Works.

But then everybody here in the room started milling around wildly and hugging
each other. It was like somebody'd thrown a switch. There wasn't even very
much conversation. It was just hugging, as far as Erdedy could see. Rampant,
indiscriminate hugging, where the point seemed to be to hug as many people as
possible, totally irregardless of whether you'd ever seen them before. People
went from person to person, arms out and leaning in. Big people stooped and
short people got up on tiptoe. Jowls ground into other jowls. Both genders
hugged both genders. And the male-to-male hugs were straight embraces, hugs
minus the vigorous little thumps on the back that Erdedy'd always seen as
somehow requisite for male-to-male hugs. Johnette Foltz was almost a blur. She
went from person to person. She was racking up serious numbers of hugs. Kate
Gompert had her usual stern starchy expression of embarrassed distaste, but
even she gave and got some hugs. But Erdedy - who'd never particularly liked
hugging - moved way back from the throng, over up next to the
NA-Conference-Approved-Literature table, and stood there by himself with his
hands in his pockets, pretending to study the coffee urn with great interest.

But then a tall heavy Afro-American fellow with a gold incisor and perfect
vertical cylinder of Afro-American hairstyle peeled away from a sort of
group-hug nearby, he'd spotted Erdedy, and the fellow came over and
established himself right in front of Erdedy, spreading the arms of his
fatigue jacket for a hug, stooping slightly and leaning in toward Erdedy's
Fersonal trunk region.

Erdedy raised his hands in a benign no-thanks and backed up further so that
his bottom was squashed up against the edge of the
Conference-Approved-Litemture table.

"Thanks, but I don't particularly like to hug," he said.

The fellow had to sort of pull up out of his pre-hug lean, and stood there
awkwardly frozen with his big arms still out, which Erdedy could see must have
been awkward and embarrassing for the fellow. Erdedy found himself trying to
calculate just what remote sub-Asian locale would be the maximum possible
number of km away from this exact spot and moment as the fellow just stood
there, his arms out and the smile draining from his face.

"Say what?" the fellow said.

Erdedy proffered a hand. "Ken Erdedy, Viney and Veals Advertising, 210
Exchange Place, downtown. How do you do. You are?"

The fellow slowly let his arms down but just looked at Erdedy's proffered
hand. A single styptic blink. "Roy Tony," he said.

"Roy, how do you do."

"What it is," Roy said. The big fellow now had his handshake-hand behind his
neck and was pretending to feel the back of his neck, which Erdedy didn't know
was a blatant dis.

"Well Roy, if I may call you Roy, or Mr. Tony, if you prefer, unless it's a
compound first name, hyphenated, |Roy-Tony,' and then a last name, but well
with respect to this hugging thing, Roy, it's nothing personal, rest assured."

"Rest assured?"

Erdedy's best helpless smile and an apologetic shrug of the Goretex anorak.
"I'm afraid I just don't particularly like to hug. Just not a hugger. Never
have been. It was something of a joke among my fam - "

Now the ominous finger-pointing of street aggression, this Roy fellow pointing
first at Erdedy's chest and then at his own: "So man what you say you saying
I'm a hugger? You say you think I go around like to hug?"

Both Erdedy's hands were now up palms-out and waggling in the white-collar
gesture of heading off all possible misunderstanding: "No no no but see the
whole point is that I wouldn't presume to call you either a hugger or a
non-hugger, because I don't know you. I only meant to say it's nothing
personal having to do with you as an individual, and I'd be more than happy to
shake hands, even one of those complex multiple-handed Afro-American
handshakes if you'll bear with my inexperience with that sort of handshake,
but I'm simply uncomfortable with the whole idea of hugging."

By the time Johnette Foltz could break away and get over to them, the fellow
had Erdedy by his anorak's insulated lapels and was leaning him way back over
the edge of the literature table so that Erdedy's waterproof lodge boots were
off the ground, and the fellow's face was right up in Erdedy's face in a show
of naked blue-collar aggression:

"You think I fucking like to go around hug on folks? You think any of us like
this shit? We fucking do what they tell us. They tell us Hugs Not Drugs in
here. We done fucking surrendered our wills in here. You addled little
faggot," he said. Pointing at himself meant he was now holding Erdedy off the
ground with just one hand, which fact was not lost on Erdedy's nervous system.
Roy Tony wedged his hand between them to point at himself "I done had to give
four hugs my first night here and then I gone ran in the fucking can and
fucking puked. Puked," he said. "Not comfortable? Who the fuck are you? Don't
even try and tell me I'm coming over feeling comfortable about trying to hug
on your James-River-Traders-wearing-Calvin-Klein-aftershave-smelling-goofy-ass
ass."

One of the Afro-American women who was looking on clapped her hands and
shouted "Talk about it!"

"And now you go and disrespect me in front of my whole clean and sober set
just when I gone risk sharing my vulnerability and uncomfort with you?"

Johnette Foltz was sort of pawing at the back of Roy Tony's fatigue jacket,
shuddering mentally at how the report of an Ennet House resident assaulted at
an NA meeting she'd personally brought him to would look written up in the
staff log.

"Now," Roy said, extracting his free hand and pointing to the vestry floor
with a stabbing gesture. "Now," he said, "you gone risk vulnerability and
uncomfort and hug my ass, or do I fucking rip your head off and shit down your
neck?"

Johnette Folu had hold of the Roy fellow's coat now with both hands and was
trying to pull the fellow off, her Keds scrabbling for purchase on the smooth
parquet, saying "Yo Roy T. man, easy there dude, man, esse, posse, crew,
homes, "brother, he's just too new is all"; but by this time Erdedy had both
his arms around the guy's neck and was hugging him with such vigor Kate
Gompert later said it looked like Erdedy was trying to climb him.

In the winter of 1963 I remember I was eating lunch and reading something dull
on temperature reactivity coefficients when my father came into the kitchen
and made himself a tomato-juice beverage and said that as soon as I was
finished he and my mother needed my help in their bedroom. My father had spent
the morning at the commercial studio and was still all in white, with his wig
with its rigid white parted hair, and hadn't yet removed the television makeup
that gave his face an orange cast in daylight. I hurried up and rinsed my
dishes in the sink and proceeded down the hall to the master bedroom. My
mother and father were both in there. The master bedroom's drapes and the
heavy lightproof curtain behind them were pulled back and the venetian blinds
were up, and the daylight was very bright in the room, the decor of which was
white and blue and powder blue.

My father was bent over my parents' large bed, which was stripped of bedding
all the way down to the mattress protector. He was bent over, pushing down on
the bed's mattress with the heels of his hands. The bed's sheets and pillows
and powder-blue coverlet were all in a pile on the carpet next to the bed.
Then my father handed me his tumbler of tomato juice to hold for him and got
all the way on top of the bed and knelt on it, pressing down vigorously on the
mattress with his hands, putting all his weight into it. He bore down hard on
one area of the mattress and then let up and pivoted slightly on his knees and
bore down with equal vigor on a different area of the mattress. He did this
all over the bed, sometimes actually walking around on his knees to get at
different areas of the mattress, then bearing down on them. I remember
thinking the bearing-down action looked very much like the emergency
compression of a heart patient's chest. I remember my father's tomato juice
had grains of pepperish material floating on the surface. My another was
standing at the bedroom window, smoking a long cigarette and looking at the
lawn, which I had watered before I ate lunch. The uncovered window faced
south. The room blazed with sunlight.

"Eureka," my father said, pressing down several times on one particular spot.
There was a squeaking sound from the mattress.

I asked whether I could ask what was going on.

"Goddamn bed squeaks," my father said. He stayed on his knees over the one
particular spot, bearing down on it repeatedly. He looked up and over at my
mother next to the bedroom window. "Do you or do you not hear that?" he said,
bearing down and letting up. My mother tapped her long cigarette into a
shallow ashtray she held in her other hand. She watched my father press down
on the squeaking spot.

Sweat was running in dark orange lines down my father's face from under his
rigid white professional wig. My father served from 1963 to 1964 as the Man
from Glad, representing what was then the Glad Flaccid Plastic Receptacle Co.
of Zanesville, Ohio, via a California-based advertising agency. The tunic,
tight trousers, and boots the agency made him wear were also white.

My father pivoted on his knees and swung his body around and got off the
mattress and put his hand at the small of his back and straightened up,
continuing to look at the mattress.

"This miserable cock-sucking bed your mother felt she needed to hang on to and
bring with us out here for quote sentimental value has started squeaking," my
father said. His saying "your mother" indicated that he was addressing himself
to me. He held his hand out for his tumbler of tomato juice without having to
look at me. He stared darkly down at the bed. "It's driving us fucking nuts."

My mother balanced her cigarette in her shallow ashtray and laid the ashtray
on the windowsill and bent over the foot of the bed, bearing down on the spot
my father had isolated, and it squeaked again.

"And at night this one spot here we've isolated and identified seems to spread
and metastisate until the whole goddamn bed's replete with squeaks." He drank
some of his tomato juice. "Areas that gibber and squeak," my father said,
"until we both feel as if we're being eaten by rats." He felt along the line
of his jaw. "Boiling hordes of gibbering squeaking ravenous rats," he said,
almost trembling with irritation.

I looked down at the mattress, at my mother's hands, which tended to flake in
dry climates. She carried a small bottle of moisturizing lotion at all times.

My father said, "And I have personally had it with the aggravation." He
blotted his forehead on his white sleeve.

I reminded my father that he'd mentioned needing my help with something. At
that age I was already taller than both my parents. My mother was taller than
my father, even in his boots, but much of her height was in her legs. My
father's body was denser and more substantial.

My mother came around to my father's side of the bed and picked bedding up off
the floor. She started folding the sheets very precisely, using both her arms
and her chin. She stacked the folded bedding neatly on top of her dresser,
which I remember was white lacquer.

My father looked at me. "What we need to do here, Jim, is take the mattress
and box spring off the bed frame, under here," my father said, "and expose the
frame." He took time out to explain that the bed's bottom mattress was
hard-framed and known uniformly as a box spring. I was looking down at my
sneakers and making my feet alternately pigeon-toed and then penguin-toed on
the bedroom's blue carpet. My father drank some of his tomato juice and looked
down at the edge of the bed's metal frame and felt along the outline of his
jaw, where his commercial studio makeup ended abruptly at the turtleneck
collar of his professional white tunic.

"The frame on this bed is old," he told me. "It's probably older than you are.
Right now I'm thinking the thing's bolts have maybe started coming loose, and
that's what's gibbering and squeaking at night." He finished his tomato juice
and held the glass out for me to take and put somewhere. "So we want to move
all this top crap out of the way, entirely"--he gestured with one
arm--"entirely out of the way, get it out of the room, and expose the frame,
and see if we don't maybe just need to tighten up the bolts."

I wasn't sure where to put my father's empty glass, which had juice residue
and grains of pepper along the interior sides. I poked at the mattress and box
spring a little bit with my foot. "Are you sure it isn't just the mattress?" I
said. The bed frame's bolts struck me as a rather exotic first-order
explanation for the squeaking.

My father gestured broadly. "Synchronicity surrounds me. Concord" he said.
"Because that's what your mother thinks it is, also." My mother was using both
hands to take the blue pillowcases off all five of their pillows, again using
her chin as a clamp. The pillows were all the over-plump polyester fiberfill
kind, because of my father's allergies.

"Great minds think alike," my father said.

Neither of my parents had any interest in hard science, though a great uncle
had accidentally electrocuted himself with a field series generator he was
seeking to patent.

My mother stacked the pillows on top of the neatly folded bedding on her
dresser. She had to get up on her tiptoes to put the folded pillowcases on top
of the pillows. I had started to move to help her, but I couldn't decide where
to put the empty tomato-juice glass.

"But you just want to hope it isn't the mattress," my father said. "Or the box
spring."

My mother sat down on the foot of the bed and got out another long cigarette
and lit it. She carried a little leatherette snap-case for both her cigarettes
and her lighter.

My father said, "Because a new frame, even if we can't get the bolts squared
away on this one and I have to go get a new one. A new frame. It wouldn't be
too bad, see. Even top-shelf frames aren't that expensive. But new mattresses
are outrageously expensive." He looked at my mother. "And I mean fucking
outrageous." He was looking down at the back of my mother's head. "And we
bought a new box spring for this sad excuse for a bed not five years ago." He
was looking at the back of my mother's head as if he wanted to confirm that
she was listening. My mother had crossed her legs and was looking with a
certain concentration either at or out the master bedroom window. Our home's
whole subdivision, Sepulveda Heights, consisted of large prefabricated
colonial homes ranged along the crest of a severe hillside, which meant that
the view from my parents' bedroom was of just sky and sun and a foreshortened
declivity of lawn. The lawn sloped at an average angle of fifty-five degrees
and had to be mowed horizontally. None of the subdivision's lawns had trees
yet.

"Of course that was during a seldom-discussed point in time when your mother
had to assume the burden of assuming responsibility for finances in the
household," my father said. He was now perspiring very heavily, but still had
his white professional toupee on, and still looked at my mother.

My father acted, throughout our time in California, as both symbol and
spokesman for the Glad F.P.R. Co.'s Individual Sandwich Bag Division. He was
the first of two actors to portray the Man from Glad. He was inserted several
times a month into a mock-up of a car interior, where he would be filmed in a
tight trans-windshield shot receiving an emergency radio summons to some
household that was having a portable-food-storage problem. He was then placed
opposite an actress in a generic kitchen-interior set, where he would explain
how a particular species of Glad Sandwich Bag was precisely what the doctor
ordered for the particular portable-food-storage problem at issue. In his
vaguely medical uniform of all white, he carried an air of authority and great
evident conviction, and earned what I always gathered was an impressive
salary, and received, for the first time in his career, fan mail, some of
which bordered on the disturbing, and which he sometimes liked to read out
loud at night in the living room, loudly and dramatically, sitting up with
nightcaps and the letters long after my mother and I had gone to bed.

I asked whether I could excuse myself for a moment to take my father's empty
tomato-juice glass out to the kitchen sink. I was worried that the residue
along the interior sides of the tumbler would harden into the kind of
precipitate that would be hard to wash off.

"For Christ's sake Jim just put that thing down," my father said.

I put the tumbler down over next to the base of my mother's dresser, pressing
down hard to create a kind of circular receptacle for it in the carpet. My
mother stood up and went back over by the bedroom window with her ashtray. We
could tell she was getting out of our way.

My father cracked his knuckles and studied the path between the bed and the
bedroom door.

I said I understood my part here to be to help my father move the mattress and
box spring off the suspect bed frame and well out of the way. My father
cracked his knuckles and replied that I was becoming almost frighteningly
quick and perceptive. He went around between the foot of the bed and my mother
at the window. He said, "I want to let's just stack it all out in the hall, to
get it the hell out of here and give us some room to maneuver."

"Right," I said.

My father and I were now on opposite sides of my parents' bed. My father
rubbed his hands together and bent and worked them between the mattress and
box spring and began to lift the mattress up from his side of the bed. When
his side of the mattress had risen to the height of his shoulders, he somehow
inverted his hands and began pushing his side up rather than lifting it. The
top of his wig disappeared behind the rising mattress, his side of which rose
in an arc to almost the height of the white ceiling, exceeded ninety degrees,
toppled over, and began to fall over down toward me. The mattress's overall
movement was like the crest of a breaking wave, I remember. I spread my arms
and took the impact with my chest and face. All I could see was an extreme
close-up of the woodland floral pattern of the mattress protector.

The mattress, a Simmons Beautyrest whose tag said that it could not by law be
removed, now formed the hypotenuse of a right dihedral triangle whose legs
were myself and the bed's box spring. I remember visualizing and considering
this triangle. My legs were trembling under the mattress's canted weight. My
father was exhorting me to hold and support the mattress. The respectively
sharp plastic and meaty human smells of the mattress and protector were very
distinct because my nose was mashed up against them.

My father came around to my side of the bed, and together we pushed the
mattress back up until it stood at ninety degrees again. We edged carefully
apart and each took one end of the upright mattress and began jockeying it off
the bed and out the bedroom door into the uncarpeted hallway.

This was a king-size Simmons Beautyrest mattress. It was massive but had very
little structural integrity. It kept curving and curling and wobbling. My
father exhorted both me and the mattress. It was flaccid and floppy as we
tried to maneuver it. My father had an especially hard time with his half of
the mattress's upright weight because of an old tennis injury.

While we were jockeying it on its side off the bed, part of the mattress on my
father's end slipped and flopped over and down onto a pair of steel reading
lamps, adjustable cubes of brushed steel attached by toggle bolts to the white
wall over the head of the bed. The lamps took a solid hit from the mattress,
and one cube was rotated all the way around on its toggle so that its open
side and bulb now pointed at the ceiling. The joint and toggle made a painful
squeaking sound as the cube was wrenched around upward. This was also when I
became aware that even the reading lamps were on in the daylit room, because a
faint square of direct lamplight, its four sides made slightly concave by the
distortion of projection, appeared on the white ceiling above the skewed cube.
The lamps didn't fall off. They remained attached to the wall.

"Goddamn it to hell," my father said as he regained control of his end of the
mattress.

When the mattress's thickness made it difficult for him to squeeze through the
doorway while holding his end, my father also said, "Fucking son of a . . ."

In time we were able to get my parents' giant mattress out into the narrow
hallway that ran between the master bedroom and the kitchen. I could hear
another terrific squeak from the bedroom as my mother tried to realign the
reading lamp whose cube had been inverted. Drops of sweat were falling from my
father's face onto his side of the mattress, darkening part of the protector's
fabric. My father and I tried to lean the mattress at a slight supporting
angle against one wall of the hallway, but because the floor of the hallway
was uncarpeted and didn't provide sufficient resistance the mattress wouldn't
stay upright. Its bottom edge slid out from the wall all the way across the
width of the hallway until it met the baseboard of the opposite wall, and the
upright mattress's top edge slid down the wall until the whole mattress sagged
at an extremely concave slumped angle, a dry section of the woodland floral
mattress protector stretched drum-tight over the slumped crease and the
springs possibly damaged by the deforming concavity.

My father looked at the canted concave mattress sagging across the width of
the hall and moved one end of it a little with the toe of his boot and looked
at me and said, "Fuck it."

My bow tie was rumpled and at an angle.

My father had to walk unsteadily across the mattress in his white boots to get
back to my side of the mattress and the bedroom behind me. On his way across
he stopped and felt speculatively at his jaw, his boots sunk deep in woodland
floral cotton. He said "Fuck it" again, and I remember not being clear about
what he was referring to. Then my father turned and started unsteadily back
the way he had come across the mattress, one hand against the wall for
support. He instructed me to wait right there in the hallway for one moment
while he darted into the kitchen at the other end of the hall on a very brief
errand. His steadying hand left four faint smeared prints on the wall's white
paint.

My parents' bed's box spring, though also king-size and heavy, had just below
its synthetic covering a wooden frame that gave the box spring structural
integrity, and it didn't flop or alter its shape. After another bit of
difficulty for my father--who was too thick through the middle, even with the
professional girdle beneath his Glad costume, to squeeze easily with his end
of the box spring through the bedroom doorway--we were able to get the thing
into the hall and lean it vertically at something just over seventy degrees
against the wall, where it stayed upright with no problem.

"That's the way she wants doing, Jim," my father said, clapping me on the back
in exactly the ebullient way that had prompted me to have my mother buy an
elastic athletic cranial strap for my glasses. I had told my mother I needed
the strap for competitive sports, and she had not asked any questions.

My father's hand was still on my back as we returned to the master bedroom.
"Right, then!" my father said. His mood was now elevated. There was a brief
second of confusion at the doorway as each of us tried to step back to let the
other through first.

There was now nothing but the suspect frame left where the bed had been. There
was something exoskeletal and frail-looking about the bed frame, a plain
low-ratio rectangle of black steel. At each comer of the rectangle was a
caster. The casters' wheels had sunk into the pile carpet under the weight of
the bed, and my parents and were almost completely submerged in the carpet's
fibers. Each of the frame's sides had a flat steel protrusion welded at ninety
degrees to its interior's base, so that a single rectangular narrow shelf
perpendicular to the frame's rectangle ran all around the frame's interior.
This little shelf was obviously there to support the bed's occupants and
king-size box spring and mattress.

My father seemed frozen in place. I cannot remember what my mother was doing.
There seemed to be a long silent interval of my father looking closely at the
exposed frame. The interval had the silence and stillness of dusty rooms
immersed in sunlight. I briefly imagined every piece of furniture in the
master bedroom covered with sheets and the room unoccupied for years as the
sun rose and crossed and fell outside the window, the room's daylight becoming
staler and staler. I could hear two power lawn mowers of slightly different
pitch from somewhere down our subdivision's street. The direct light through
the master bedroom's window swam with rotating columns of raised dust. I
remember it seemed the ideal moment for a sneeze.

Dust lay thick on the frame and even hung from the frame's interior
support-shelf in tiny gray beards. It was impossible to see any bolts anywhere
on the frame.

My father blotted sweat and wet makeup from his forehead with the back of his
sleeve, which was now dark orange with makeup. "Jesus will you look at that
mess," he said. He looked at my mother. "Jesus."

The carpeting in my parents' bedroom was deep-pile and a darker blue than the
pale blue of the rest of the bedroom's color scheme. I remember the carpet as
more a royal blue, with a saturation level somewhere between moderate and
strong. The rectangular expanse of royal-blue carpet that had been hidden
under the bed was itself carpeted with a thick layer of clotted dust. The
rectangle of dust was gray-white and thick and unevenly layered, and the only
evidence of the room's carpet below was a faint sick bluish cast to the dust
layer. It looked as if dust had not drifted under the bed and settled on the
carpet inside the frame but rather had somehow taken root and grown on it,
upon it, the way a mold will take root and gradually cover an expanse of
spoiled food. The layer of dust itself looked a little like bad cottage
cheese. It was nauseous. Some of the dust layer's uneven topography was caused
by certain lost and litterish objects that had found their way under the
bed--a flyswatter, a roughly Variety-size magazine, some bottle tops, three
wadded Kleenex, and what was probably a sock--and gotten covered and textured
in dust.

There was also a faint odor, sour and fungal, like the smell of an overused
bath mat.

"Jesus, there's even a smell," my father said. He made a show of inhaling
through his nose and screwing up his face. "There's even a smell." He blotted
his forehead and felt his jaw and looked hard at my mother. His mood was no
longer elevated. My father's mood surrounded him like a field and affected any
room he occupied, like an odor or a certain cast to the light.

"When was the last time this got cleaned under here?" my father asked my
mother.

My mother didn't say anything. She looked at my father as he moved the steel
frame around a little with his boot, which raised even more dust into the
window's sunlight. The bed frame seemed very lightweight, moving back and
forth noiselessly on its casters' submerged wheels. My father often moved
lightweight objects around absently with his foot, the way other men doodle or
examine their cuticles. Rugs, magazines, telephone and electrical cords, his
own removed shoe. It was one of my father's ways of gathering his thoughts or
trying to control his mood.

"Under what presidential administration was this room last deep-cleaned, I'm
standing here prompted to fucking muse out loud," my father said.

I looked at my mother to see whether she was going to say anything in reply.

I said to my father, "You know, since we're discussing squeaking beds, my bed
squeaks, too."

My father was trying to squat down to see whether he could locate any bolts on
the frame, saying something to himself under his breath. He put his hands on
the frame for balance and almost fell forward when the frame rolled slightly
under his weight.

"But I don't think I even really noticed it until we began to discuss it," I
said. I looked at my mother. "I don't think it bothers me," I said. "Actually,
I think I kind of like it. I think I've gradually gotten so used to it that
it's become almost comforting. At this juncture," I said.

My mother looked at me.

"I'm not complaining about it," I said. "The discussion just made me think of
it."

"Oh, we hear your bed, don't you worry," my father said. He was still trying
to squat, which drew his corset and the hem of his tunic up and allowed the
top of his bottom's crack to appear above the waist of his white pants. He
shifted slightly to point up at the master bedroom's ceiling. "You so much as
turn over in bed up there? Down here we hear it." He took one steel side of
the rectangle and shook the frame vigorously, sending up a shroud of dust. The
bed frame seemed to weigh next to nothing under his hands. My mother made a
mustache of her finger to hold back a sneeze.

"But it doesn't aggravate us the way this rodential son of a whore right here
does." He shook the frame again.

I remarked that I didn't think I'd ever once heard their bed squeak, from
upstairs. My father twisted his head around to try to look up at me as I stood
there behind him. But I said I'd definitely heard and could confirm the
presence of a squeak when he'd pressed on the mattress, and could verify that
the squeak was no one's imagination.

My father held a hand up to signal me to please stop talking. He remained in a
squat, rocking slightly on the balls of his feet, using the rolling frame to
keep his balance. The flesh of the top of his bottom and crack-area protruded
over the waist of his pants. There were also deep red folds in the back of his
neck, below the blunt cut of the wig, because he was looking up and over at my
mother, who was resting her tailbone on the sill of the window, still holding
her shallow ashtray.

"Maybe you'd like to go get the vacuum," said. My mother put the ashtray down
on the sill and exited the master bedroom, passing between me and the dresser
piled with bedding. "If you can remember where it is!" my father called after
her.

I could hear my mother trying to get past the king-size mattress sagging
diagonally across the hall.

My father was rocking more violently on the balls of his feet, and now the
rocking had the sort of rolling, side-to-side quality of a ship in high seas.
He came very close to losing his balance as he leaned to his right to get a
handkerchief from his hip pocket and began using it to reach out and flick
dust off something at one comer of the bed frame. After a moment he pointed
down next to a caster.

"Bolt," he said, pointing at the side of a caster. "Right there's a bolt." I
leaned in over him. Drops of my father's perspiration made dark coins in the
dust of the frame. There was nothing but smooth lightweight black steel
surface where he was pointing, but just to the left of where he was pointing I
could see what might have been a bolt, a little stalactite of clotted dust
hanging from some slight protrusion. My father's hands were broad and his
finger blunt. Another possible bolt lay several inches to the right of where
he pointed. His finger trembled badly, and I believe the trembling might have
been from the muscular strain on his bad knees, trying to hold so much new
weight in a squat for an extended period. I heard the telephone ring twice.
There had been an extended silence, with my father pointing at neither
protrusion and me trying to lean in over him.

Then, still squatting on the balls of his feet, my father placed both hands on
the side of the frame and leaned out over the side into the rectangle of dust
and had what at first sounded like a bad coughing fit. His hunched back and
rising bottom kept me from watching him cough. I remember deciding that the
reason the frame was not rolling under his hands' pressure was that my father
now had so much of his weight on it, and that maybe my father's nervous
system's response to heavy dust was a cough-signal instead of a sneeze-signal.
It was the wet sound of material hitting the dust inside the rectangle, plus
the rising odor, that signified to me that, rather than coughing, my father
had been taken ill. The spasms involved made his back rise and fall and his
bottom tremble under his white commercial slacks. It was not too uncommon for
my father to be taken ill shortly after coming home from work to relax, but
now he seemed to have been taken really ill. To give him some privacy, I went
around the frame to the side closest to the window, where there was direct
light and less odor, and examined another of the frame's casters. My father
was whispering to himself in brief expletive phrases between the spasms of his
illness. I squatted and rubbed dust from a small area of the frame and wiped
the dust on the carpet by my feet. There was a small carriage-head bolt on
either side of the plating that attached the caster to the bed frame. I knelt
and felt one of the bolts. Its round smooth head made it impossible either to
tighten or loosen. Putting my cheek to the carpet and examining the bottom of
the little horizontal shelf welded to the frame's side, I observed that the
bolt seemed threaded tightly and completely through its hole, and I decided it
was doubtful that any of the casters' platings' bolts were producing the
sounds that reminded my father of rodents.

Just at this time, I remember, there was a loud cracking sound and my area of
the frame jumped violently as my father's sudden illness caused him to faint
and he lost his balance and pitched forward and lay prone and asleep over his
side of the bed frame, which, as I rolled away from the frame and rose to my
knees, I saw was now either broken or very badly bent. My father lay facedown
in a mixture of the rectangle's thick dust and the material he'd brought up
from his upset stomach. The dust his collapse raised was awful, and as the new
dust rose and spread it attenuated the master bedroom's daylight as decisively
as if a cloud had moved over the sun in the window. My father's professional
wig had detached and lay scalp-up in the mixture of dust and stomach material.
The stomach material appeared to be mostly gastric blood until I re-called the
tomato-juice beverages my father had been drinking. He lay face-down, with his
bottom high in the air, over the side of the bed frame, which his weight had
broken almost in half. This was how I accounted for the loud cracking sound.

I stood out of the way of the dust and the window's dusty light, feeling my
jaw and examining my prone father from a distance. I remember that his
breathing was regular and wet, and that the dust mixture bubbled somewhat. It
was then that it occurred to me that when I'd been supporting the bed's raised
mattress with my face and chest preparatory to its removal from the room, the
dihedral triangle I'd imagined the mattress forming with the box spring and my
body had not in fact even been a closed polygon: the box spring and the floor
I had stood on did not constitute a continuous surface.

Then I could hear my mother trying to get the heavy canister vacuum cleaner
past the angled Simmons Beautyrest in the hall, and I went to help her. My
father's legs were stretched out across the clean royal-blue carpet between
his side of the frame and my mother's white dresser. His feet's boots were at
a pigeon-toed angle, and his bottom's crack all the way down to the anus
itself was now visible because the force of his fall had pulled his white
slacks down even farther. I stepped carefully between his legs.

"Excuse me," I said.

I was able to help my mother by telling her to detach the vacuum cleaner's
attachments and hand them one at a time to me over the width of the slumped
mattress, where I held them. The vacuum cleaner was manufactured by Regina,
and its canister, which contained the engine, bag, and evacuating fan, was
very heavy. I reassembled the vacuum and held it while my mother made her way
to me across the mattress, then handed the vacuum cleaner back to her,
flattening myself against the wall to let her pass by on her way into the
master bedroom.

"Thanks," my mother said as she passed.

I stood there by the slumped mattress for several moments of a silence so
complete that I could hear the street's lawn mowers all the way out there in
the hall, then heard the sound of my mother pulling out the vacuum cleaner's
retractable cord and plugging it into the same bedside outlet the steel
reading lamps were attached to.

I made my way over the angled mattress and quickly down the hall, made a sharp
right just before the entrance to the kitchen, crossed the foyer to the
staircase, and ran up to my room, taking several stairs at a time, hurrying to
get some distance between myself and the vacuum cleaner, because the sound of
vacuuming has always troubled me in the same irrational way it seemed a bed's
squeak troubled my father.

I ran upstairs and pivoted left at the upstairs landing and went into my room.
In my room was my bed. It was narrow, a twin bed, with a headboard of wood and
frame and slats of wood. I didn't know where it had come from, originally. The
frame held the narrow box spring and mattress much higher off the floor than
my parents' bed. It was an old-fashioned bed, so high off the floor that you
had to put one knee up on the mattress and clamber up onto it, or else jump.

That is what I did. For the first time since I had become taller than my
parents, I took several running strides in from the doorway, past my shelves'
collection of prisms and lenses and tennis trophies and the scale-model
magneto, past my bookcase and the closet door and my bedside's high-intensity
standing lamp, and jumped, doing a full swan dive up onto my bed. I landed
with my weight on my chest and my arms and legs out from my body on the indigo
comforter on my bed, squashing my tie and bending my glasses' templates
slightly. I was trying to make my bed produce a loud squeak, which in the case
of my bed I knew was caused by any lateral friction between the wooden slats
and the frame's interior's shelflike support.

But in the course of the leap and the dive, my overlong arm hit the heavy iron
pole of the high-intensity standing lamp that stood next to the bed. The lamp
teetered violently and began to fall over sideways, away from the bed. It fell
with a kind of majestic slowness, resembling a felled tree. As the lamp fell,
its heavy iron pole struck the brass knob on the door to my closet, shearing
the knob off completely. The round knob and half its interior hex bolt fell
off and hit my room's wood floor with a loud noise and began to roll around in
a remarkable way, the sheared end of the hex bolt stationary and the round
knob, rolling on its circumference, circling it in a trans-dimensional orbit,
describing two perfectly circular motions on two distinct axes, which put the
figure in a kind of crude n-space, a non-Euclidean figure on a planar surface:

The closest conventional analogue I could derive for this figure was a
cycloid, L'Hospital's solution to Bernoulli's famous brachistochrone problem,
the curve traced by a fixed point on the circumference of a circle rolling
along a straight line. But since here, on my bedroom's floor, a circle was
rolling around what was itself the circumference of a circle, the cycloid's
standard parametric equations were no longer applicable, those equations'
trigonometric expressions here becoming themselves first-order differential
equations.

Because of the lack of resistance or friction against the bare floor, the
shorn knob rolled in its description of this figure for a long time as I
watched over the edges of my comforter and mattress, holding my glasses in
place, completely distracted from the troubling minor-key scream of the vacuum
below. It occurred to me that the hypercycloidic movement of the amputated
knob schematized perfectly what it would look like if someone were for some
reason trying to turn somersaults with one hand nailed to the floor. This, as
I recall, was when I first became interested in the possibilities of
annulation.

David Foster Wallace's last contribution to Harper's Magazine, "Tennis,
Trigonometry, Tornadoes," a memoir, appeared in the December 1991 issue. This
story is excerpted from a longer work in progress.

	Abstract = {THE WEASEL TWELVE MONKEYS AND THE SHRUB Seven days in the life of the late, great John McCain PROLOGUE WHO CARES? Since you're reading "Rolling Stone," the chances are you're an American between say 18 and 35, which demographically makes you a Young Voter. And no generation of Young Voters has ever cared less about politics and politicians than yours. There's hard demographic and voter-pattern data backing this up ... assuming you give a shit about data. In fact, even if you're reading other stuff in RS, it's doubtful you're going to read much of this article -- such is the enormous shuddering yawn that the Political Process evokes in us now, in this post-Watergate-post-Iran-Contra-post-Whitewater-post-Lewinsky era, an era when politicians' statements of principle or vision are understood as self-serving ad copy and judged not for their sincerity or ability to inspire but for their tactical shrewdness, their marketability. And no generation has been marketed and Spun and pitched to as ingeniously and relentlessly as today's demographic Young. So when Senator John McCain says, in Michigan or South Carolina (which is where ROLLING STONE sent the least professional pencil it could find to spend the standard media Week on the Bus with a candidate who'd never ride higher than he is right now), when McCain says "I run for president not to Be Somebody, but to Do Something," it's hard to hear it as anything more than a marketing angle, especially when he says it as he's going around surrounded by cameras and reporters and cheering crowds ... in other words, Being Somebody. And when Senator John McCain also says -- constantly, thumping it at the start and end of every speech and THM -- that his goal as president will be "to inspire young Americans to devote themselves to causes greater than their own self-interest," it's hard not to hear it as just one more piece of the carefully scripted bullshit that presidential candidates hand us as they go about the self-interested business of trying to become the most powerful, important and talked-about human being on earth, which is of course their real "cause," to which they appear to be so deeply devoted that they can swallow and spew whole mountains of noble-sounding bullshit and convince even themselves that they mean it. Cynical as that may sound, polls show it's how most of us feel. And it's beyond not believing the bullshit; mostly we don't even hear it, dismiss it at the same deep level where we also block out billboards and Muzak. But there's something underneath politics in the way you have to hear McCain, something riveting and unSpinnable and true. It has to do with McCain's military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison, mostly in solitary, in a box, getting tortured and starved. And the unbelievable honor and balls he showed there. It's very easy to gloss over the POT thing, partly because we've all heard so much about it and partly because it's so off-the-charts dramatic, like something in a movie instead of a man's life. But it's worth considering for a minute, because it's what makes McCain's "causes greater than self-interest" line easier to hear. You probably already know what happened. In October of '67 McCain was himself still a Young Voter and flying his 23rd Vietnam combat mission and his A-4 Skyhawk plane got shot down over Hanoi and he had to eject, which basically means setting off an explosive charge that blows your seat out of the plane, which ejection broke both McCairis arms and one leg and gave him a concussion and he started falling out of the skies right over Hanoi. Try to imagine for a second how much this would hurt and how scared you'd be, three limbs broken and falling toward the enemy capital you just tried to bomb. His chute opened late and he landed hard in a little lake in a park right in the middle of downtown Hanoi. Imagine treading water with broken arms and trying to pull the lifevest's toggle with your teeth as a crowd of Vietnamese men swim out toward you (there's film of this, somebody had a home-movie camera, and the N.V. government released it, though it's grainy and McCain's face is hard to see). The crowd pulled him out and then just about killed him. U.S. bomber pilots were especially hated, for obvious reasons. McCain got bayoneted in the groin; a soldier broke his shoulder apart with a rifle butt. Plus by this time his right knee was bent 90 degrees to the side with the bone sticking out. Try to imagine this. He finally got tossed on a jeep and taken five blocks to the infamous Hoa Lo prison --a.k.a. the "Hanoi Hilton," of much movie fame -- where they made him beg a week for a doctor and finally set a couple of the fractures without anesthetic and let two other fractures and the groin wound (imagine: groin wound) stay like they were. Then they threw him in a cell. Try for a moment to feel this. All the media profiles talk about how McCain still can't lift his arms over his head to comb his hair, which is true. But try to imagine it at the time, yourself in his place, because it's important. Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self-interest getting knifed in the balls and having fractures set without painkiller would be, and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt, which is what happened. He was delirious with pain for weeks, and his weight dropped to 100 pounds, and the other POTs were sure he would die; and then after a few months like that after his bones mostly knitted and he could sort of stand up they brought him in to the prison commandant's office and offered to let him go. This is true. They said he could just leave. They had found out that McCain's father was one of the top-ranking naval officers in the U.S. Armed Forces (which is true -- both his father and grandfather were admirals), and the North Vietnamese wanted the PR coup of mercifully releasing his son, the baby-killer. McCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused. The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently said that POTs had to be released in the order they were captured, and there were others who'd been in Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the Code. The commandant, not pleased, right there in the office had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POTs. And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo like this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-sized box called a "punishment cell." Maybe you've heard all this before; it's been in umpteen different media profiles of McCain. But try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it was you. Imagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? If so, would you have refused to go? You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less know how you'd react. But, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. Maybe he was nuts. But the point is that with McCain it feels like we know, for a proven fact, that he's capable of devotion to something other, more, than his own self-interest. So that when he says the line in speeches in early February you can feel like maybe it isn't just more candidate bullshit, that with this guy it's maybe the truth. Or maybe both the truth and bullshit: the guy does -- did -- want your vote, after all. But that moment in the Hoa Lo office in '68 -- right before he refused, with all his basic normal human self-interest howling at him -- that moment is hard to blow off. All week, all through MI and SC and all the tedium and cynicism and paradox of the campaign, that moment seems to underlie McCain's "greater than self-interest" line, moor it, give it a weird sort of reverb that's hard to ignore. The fact is that John McCain is a genuine hero of the only kind Vietnam now has to offer, a hero not because of what he did but because of what he suffered voluntarily, for a Code. This gives him the moral authority both to utter lines about causes beyond self-interest and to expect us, even in this age of Spin and lawyerly cunning, to believe he means them. Literally: "moral authority," that old cliche, much like so many other cliches --"service," "honor," "duty," "patriotism" -- that have become just mostly words now, slogans invoked by men in nice suits who want something from us. The John McCain we've seen, though arguing for his doomed campaign-finance bill on the Senate floor in '98, calling his colleagues crooks to their faces on C-SPAN, talking openly about a bought-and-paid-for government on Charlie Rose in July '99, unpretentious and bright as hell in the Iowa debates and New Hampshire Town Hall Meetings something about him made a lot of us feel the guy wanted something different from us, something more than votes or money, something old and maybe corny but with a weird achy pull to it like a whiff of a childhood smell or a name on the tip of your tongue, something that would make us think about what terms like "service" and "sacrifice" and "honor" might really refer to, like whether they actually stood for something, maybe. About whether anything past well-Spun self-interest might be real, was ever real, and if so then what happened? These, for the most part, are not lines of thinking that the culture we've grown up in has encouraged Young Voters to pursue. Why do you suppose that is? GLOSSARY OF RELEVANT CAMPAIGN-TRAIL VOCAB (MOSTLY COURTESY OF JIM C. AND THE NETWORK-NEWS TECHS) 22.5 The press corps' shorthand for McCain's opening remarks at THMs (see THM), which remarks are always the same and always take exactly 22 and a half minutes. BAGGAGE CALL The grotesquely early A.M. time when you've got to have your suitcase back in the bus's bowels and have a seat staked out and be ready to go or else you get left behind and have to try to wheedle a ride to the first THM (see THM) from Fox News, which is a drag in all kinds of ways. BUNDLED MONEY A way to get around the Federal Election Commission's $1,000 limit for individual campaign contributions. A wealthy donor can give $1,000 for himself, and then can say that yet another $1,000 comes from his wife, and another $1,000 from his kid, and another from his Aunt Edna, etc. The Shrub's (see Shrub) favorite trick is to designate CEOs and other top corporate executives as "Pioneers," who each pledge to raise $100,000 for Bush2000 -- $1,000 comes from them individually, and the other 99 one-grand contributions come "voluntarily" from their employees. McCain makes a point of accepting neither bundled money nor soft money (see soft money). DT Drive Time, the slots in the daily schedule set aside for caravaning from one campaign event to another. F&F An hour or two in the afternoon when the campaign provides downtime and an F&F Room for the press corps to File and Feed (see File and Feed). FILE AND FEED What print and broadcast press, respectively, have to do every day, i.e. print reporters have to finish their daily stories and file them via fax or e-mail to their papers, while the techs (see tech) and field producers have to find a satellite or Gunner (see Gunner) and feed their film, standups (see standup), and anything else their bosses might want to the network HQ. GUNNER A portable satellite-uplink rig that the networks use to feed on-scene from some campaign events. Gunner is the company that makes and/or rents out these rigs, which consist of a blinding white van with a boattrailerish thing on which is an eight-foot satellite dish angled upward 40 degrees at the southwest sky and emblazoned in fiery blue caps GUNNER GLOBAL UPLINKS FOR NEWS, NETWORKING, ENTERTAINMENT. HEAD Local or network TV correspondent. ODT Optimistic Drive Time, which refers to the daily schedule's nagging habit of underestimating the amount of time it takes to get from one event to another, causing the Straight Talk Express driver to speed like a maniac and to incur the rabid dislike of the official Bullshit 1 driver, whose name is Jay. OTS Opportunity to Smoke. PENCIL A member of the Trail's print press. PRESS-AVAIL (or -AVAIL) Brief scheduled opportunity for traveling press corps to interface as one body w/McCain or staff High Command, often deployed for Reacts (see React). REACT McCain's or McCain2000 High Command's on-record response to a sudden major development in the campaign, usually some tactical move or allegation from the Shrub (see Shrub). SCRUM (n) The moving 360 degrees ring of techs (see tech) and heads around the candidate as he makes his way from the Straight Talk Express into an event or vice versa: (v) to gather around the candidate in such a ring. THE SHRUB GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush. SOFT MONEY The best-known way to finesse the FEC's limit on campaign contributions. Enormous sums are here given to a certain candidate's political party instead of to the candidate, but the party then by some strange coincidence ends up dispersing those enormous sums to exactly the candidate the donor had wanted to give to in the first place. STANDUP A head giving a remote report from some event McCain's at. STICK A sound tech's (see tech) black telescoping polymer rod (full extension = 9'7") with a boom microphone at the end, used mostly for scrums and always the most distinctive visible feature there if because of the way a fully extended stick wobbles and boings when the sound tech (which, again, see tech) walks with it. TECH A TV news camera or sound technician. THM Town Hall Meeting, McCain2000's signature campaign event, where the 22.5 is followed by an hour-long unscreened Q&A with the audience. THE TWELVE MONKEYS (or 12M) The techs' private code-name for the most elite and least popular pencils in the McCain press corps, who on DTs are almost always allowed into the red-intensive salon at the very back of the Straight Talk Express to interface with McCain and political consultant Mike Murphy. The 12M are a dozen marquee journalists and political-analysis guys from the really important papers and weeklies and news services, and tend to be so totally identical in dress and demeanor as to be almost surreal -- twelve immaculate and wrinkle-free navy-blue blazers, half-Windsored ties, pleated chinos, oxford-cloth shirts that even when the jackets come off stay 100% buttoned at collar and sleeves, Cole Haan loafers, and tortoiseshell specs they love to take off and nibble the arm of, plus always a uniform self-seriousness that reminds you of every overachieving dweeb you ever wanted to kick the ass of in school. The Twelve Monkeys never smoke or drink, and always move in a pack, and always cut to the front of every scrum and Press-Avail and line for Continental Breakfast in the hotel lobby before Baggage Call, and whenever any of them are rotated however briefly back onto Bullshit I they always sit together identically hurry and pigeon-toed with their attache cases in their laps and always end up discussing incredibly esoteric books on political theory and public policy in voices that are all the exact same languid honk. The techs (who all wear old jeans and surplus-store parkas and also all tend to hang in a pack) avoid and try to pretty much ignore the Twelve Monkeys, who in turn treat the techs the way someone in an executive washroom treats the attendant. As you might already have gathered, ROLLING STONE dislikes the 12M intensely, for all the above reasons, plus the fact that they're tighter than a duck's butt when it comes to sharing even very basic general-knowledge political information that might help somebody write a slightly better article, plus the issue of two separate occasions at late-night hotel check-ins when one or more of the Twelve Monkeys just out of nowhere turned and handed ROLLING STONE their suitcases to carry, as if ROLLING STONE were a bellboy or gofer instead of a hard-working journalist just like them even if he didn't have a portable Paul Stuart steamer for his blazer. WEASEL The weird gray fuzzy thing sound techs put over their boom mikes at scrums to keep annoying wind-noise off the audio. It looks like a large floppy mouse-colored version of a certain popular kind of fuzzy bathroom slipper. (N.B.: Weasels, which are also sometimes worn by sound techs as headgear during OTS's when it's really cold, are thus sometimes also known as "tech toupees.") SUBSTANTIALLY FARTHER BEHIND THE SCENES THAN YOU'RE APT TO WANT TO BE It's now precisely 1330h. On Tuesday, 8 February '00, aboard Bullshit 1, proceeding southeast on I-26 toward Charleston SC. There's so much press and staff and techs and stringers and field producers and photographers and heads and pensils and political columnists and hosts of political radio shows and local medal covering John McCain and the McCain2000 phenomenon post-New Hampshire that there's now more than one campaign bus. Here in South Carolina there are three, a veritable convoy of Straight Talk, plus Fox News's green SUV and the MTV crew's sprightly red Corvette and two much-antennae'd local-TV vans (one of which has severe muffler trouble). On DTs like this McCain's always in his personal red recliner next to political consultant Mike Murphy's red recliner in the little press salon he and Murphy have in the back of the lead bus, the well-known Straight Talk Express, which is up ahead and gaining. Bullshit 1 is the caravan's second bus, a luxury Grumman with good current and workable phone jacks, and a lot of the national pencils use it to pound out copy on their laptops and send faxes and e-mail stuff to their editors. The campaign's logistics are dizzyingly complex, and one of the things the staff has to do is rent different buses and decorate the nicest one with STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS and MCCAIN2000.COM in each new state. The two press buses in SC are known as Bullshit 1 and Bullshit 2, names conceived as usual by the extremely cool and laid-back NBC News cameraman Jim C. and -- to their credit -- immediately seized on and used with great glee at every opportunity by McCain's younger Press Liaisons, who are themselves so cool and unpretentious it's tempting to suspect that they are professionally cool and unpretentious. It helps to conceive a campaign week's events in terms of boxes, boxes inside other boxes, etc. The national voting audience is the great huge outer box, then the SC-electorate audience, mediated respectively by the inner layers of national and local press, just inside which lie the insulating boxes of McCain's staff's High Command, who plan and stage events and Spin stuff for the layers of press to interpret for the layers of audience, and the Press Liaisons, who shepherd the pencils and heads and mediate their access to the High Command and control which media get rotated onto the S.T. Express (which is itself a box in motion) to interface with McCain himself, a candidate whose biggest draw of course is that he's an anticandidate, someone who's open and accessible and "thinks outside the box," but is in fact the campaign's Chinese boxes' central and inscrutable core box, and whose own intracranial thoughts on all these boxes and layers and lenses and whether this new kind of enclosure is anything like Hoa Lo's dark box are pretty much anyone in the media's guess, since all he'll talk about is politics. Bullshit 1 is also a box, of course, just as anything you can't exit till somebody tells you becomes, and right now there are 27 members of the national political media on board, halfway to Charleston, where a certain percentage of them will get rotated back off the Trail tonight and be gone tomorrow. That's what these pros call it, the Trail, the same way musicians talk about the Road. The schedule is fascist: Wake-up call and backup alarm at 0600h., Express Checkout, Baggage Call at 0700 to throw bags and techs' gear under the bus, DT to McCain's first THM at 0800, then another, then another, maybe an hour off to F&F someplace if ODTs permit, then usually two big evening events, plus hours of dead Interstate DT between functions, finally getting in to the night's Marriott or Hampton Inn at like 2300 just when Room Service closes so you're begging rides from Fox News to find a restaurant still open, then an hour at the hotel bar to try to shut your head off so you can hit the rack at 0130 and get up at 0600 and do it all again. Usually it's four to six days for the average pencil and then you go off home on a gurney and your editor rotates in fresh meat. The network techs, who are old hands at the Trail, stay on for months at a time. The McCain2000 staff has been doing this full-time since Labor Day, and even the young ones look like the walking dead. Only McCain seems to thrive. He's 63 and practically Rockette-kicks onto the Express every morning. It's either inspiring or frightening. Here's a quick behind-the-scenes tour of everything that's happening on BSI at 1330h. A few of the press are slumped over sleeping, open-mouthed and twitching, using their topcoats for pillows. The CBS and NBC techs are in their usual place on the couches way up front, their cameras and sticks and boom mikes and boxes of tapes and big Duracells piled around them, discussing obscure stand-up comedians of the early '70s and trading Press badges from New Hampshire and Iowa and Delaware. NBC's Jim C., who looks like a chronically sleep-deprived Elliott Gould, is also watching the Press Liaison's leather bookbag swing metronomically by its overshoulder strap as the Liaison leans against the driver's seat and secretly dozes. All the couches and padded chairs face in, perpendicular to BSI's length, instead of a regular bus's forward-facing seats, so everyone's legs are always in the aisle, but there's none of the normal social anxiety about your legs touching somebody else on a bus's leg because nobody can help it and they're too tired to care. About two-thirds of the way down the aisle is a little area that has the bus's refrigerator and the liquor cabinets (totally empty on BSI) and the bathroom with the hazardous door. There's also a little counter area piled with Krispy Kreme doughnut boxes, plus a sink whose water nobody ever uses (for what turn out to be good reasons). Krispy Kremes are sort of the Deep South equivalent of Dunkin' Donuts, ubiquitous and cheap and great in a sort of what-am-I-doing-eating-dessert-for-breakfast way, and are a cornerstone of what Jim C. calls the Campaign Diet. Behind the buses' digestive areas is another couch-intensive section, in which right now Mrs. McCain's personal assistant on the Trail, Wendy --who has electric-blue contact lenses and very complex and rigid blond hair and designer outfits and immaculate makeup and accessories and French nails and can perhaps best be described as a very Republican-looking young lady indeed -- is eating a large styrofoam cup of soup and using her cellphone to try to find someplace in downtown Charleston where Mrs. McCain can get her nails done. Just why Wendy is arranging for her mistress's manicure on a press bus is unclear, but Mrs. McC.'s sedulous attention to her own person's dress and grooming is already a minor legend among the press corps, and some of the techs speculate that stuff like getting her nails and hair done, together with being almost Siametically attached to Ms. Lisa Graham Keegan (who is AZ's Education Superintendent and supposedly traveling with the Senator as his "Adviser on Issues Affecting Education" but is quite obviously really along because she's Cindy McCain's friend and confidante and the only person in whose presence Mrs. McC. doesn't look like a jacklighted deer), are the only things keeping this extremely fragile person together on the Trail, where she's required to stand under hot lights next to McCain at every speech and THM and Press-Avail and stare cheerfully into the middle distance while her husband speaks to crowds and lenses -- in fact some of the cable-network techs have a sort of running debate about what she's really looking at as she stands onstage being scrutinized but never getting to say anything ... and anyway everybody understands and respects the enormous pressure Wendy's under to help Mrs. McC. keep it together, and nobody makes fun of her for things like getting more and more stressed out as it becomes obvious that there's some special Southeast-U.S. idiom for "manicure" that Wendy doesn't know, because nobody she talks to on the cellphone seems to have any idea what she means by "manicure." If this all seems really static and dull, by the way, then understand you're getting a bona fide media-eye look at the reality of life on the Trail, 85% of which consists of wandering around killing time on Bullshit I while you wait for the slight significant look from the Press Liaison which means that after the next stop you're getting rotated up into the big leagues on the Express to sit squished and paralyzed on the crammed red press-couch in back and to listen to John S. McCain and his aide-de-camp Mike Murphy answer the Twelve Monkeys' questions and to look up-close and personal at McCain and the way he puts his legs way out on the salon's floor and crosses them at the ankle and sucks absently at his right bicuspid and twirls the coffee in his MCCAIN2000. COM mug and to try to penetrate the innermost box of this man's thoughts on the enormous hope and enthusiasm he's generating in press and voters alike. ... Which you should be told upfront does not and cannot happen, this penetration, partly for the reason that when you are finally rotated up into the Straight Talk salon you discover that most of the questions the Twelve Monkeys ask back here are too vapid and obvious for McCain to waste time on, and he lets Mike Murphy handle them, and Murphy is so funny and dry and able to make such delicious sport of the 12M. MONKEY: If, say, you win here in South Carolina, what do you do then? MURPHY: Fly to Michigan that night. MONKEY: And what if, hypothetically, you, say, lose here in South Carolina? MURPHY: Fly to Michigan that night win or lose. MONKEY: Can you perhaps talk about why? MURPHY: 'Cause the plane's already paid for. MONKEY' I mean can you explain why specifically Michigan? MURPHY: It's the next primary. MONKEY: I think what we're trying to get you to elaborate on, Mike, is: what will your goal be in Michigan? MURPHY: To get a whole lot of votes. That's part of our secret strategy for winning the nomination. - that it's hard even to notice McCain's there or what his face or feet are doing because it takes almost all your concentration not to start giggling like a maniac at Murphy and the way the 12M all nod somberly at him and take whatever he says down in their absolutely identical steno notebooks. What's hazardous about Bullshit 1's lavatory door is that it opens and closes laterally, sliding with a Star Trekish whoosh at the light touch of the DOOR button just inside -- i.e., you go in, lightly push DOOR to close, attend to business, lightly push DOOR again to open: simple --except that the DOOR button's placement puts it only inches away from the left shoulder of any male journalist standing over the commode attending to business, a commode without rails or handles or anything to (as it were) hold on to, and even the slightest leftward lurch or lean makes said shoulder touch said button -- which remember this is a moving bus -- causing the door to whoosh open while you're right there with business underway, and with the consequences of suddenly whirling to try to stab at the button to recluse the door while you're in medias res being too obviously horrid to detail, with the result that by 9 February the great unspoken rule among the regulars on Bullshit 1 is that when any male gets up and goes two-thirds of the way back into the lavatory anybody who's back there clears the immediate area and makes sure they're not in the door's line of sight; and the way you can tell that a journalist is a local or newly rotated onto the Trail and this is their first time on BS1 is the small strangled scream you always hear when they're in the lavatory and the door unexpectedly whooshes open, and usually the grizzled old Charleston Post and Courier pencil will give a small smile and call out "Welcome to national politics!" as the new guy stabs frantically at the button, and Jay at the helm will hit the horn with the heel of his hand in mirth, taking these long and mostly mindless DTs' fun where he finds it. WHO EVEN CARES WHO CARES? It's hard to get good answers to why Young Voters are so uninterested in politics. This is probably because it's next to impossible to get someone to think hard about why he's not interested in something. The boredom itself preempts inquiry; the fact of the feeling's enough. Surely one reason, though, is that politics is not cool. Or say rather that cool, interesting, alive people do not seem to be the ones who are drawn to the Political Process. Think back to the sort of kids in high school or college who were into running for student office: dweeby, overgroomed, obsequious to authority, ambitious in a sad way. Eager to play the Game. The kind of kids other kids would want to beat up if it didn't seem so pointless and dull. And now consider some of 2000's adult versions of these very same kids: Al Gore, best described by CNN sound tech Mark A. as "amazingly lifelike"; Steve Forbes, with his wet forehead and loony giggle; G.W. Bush's patrician smirk and mangled cant; even Clinton himself with his big red fake-friendly face and "I feel your pain." Men who aren't enough like human beings even to dislike --what one feels when they loom into view is just an overwhelming lack of interest, the sort of deep disengagement that is so often a defense against pain. Against sadness. In fact the likeliest reason why so many of us care so little about politics is that modern politicians make us sad, hurt us in ways that are hard even to name, much less to talk about. It's way easier to roll your eyes and not give a shit. You probably don't want to hear about all this, even. One reason a lot of the media on the Trail like John McCain is simply that he's a cool guy. Nondweeby. In school, Clinton was in Student Government and Band, whereas McCain was a Varsky wrestler and a hellraiser whose talents for partying and getting laid are still spoken of with awe by former classmates. At 63, he's funny, and smart, and he'll make fun of himself and his wife and his staff and other pols and the Trail, and he'll tease the press and give them shit in a way they don't ever mind because it's the sort of shit that makes you feel like here's this very cool, important guy who's noticing you and liking you enough to give you shit. Sometimes he'll wink at you for no reason. If all this doesn't sound like that big a deal, you have to remember that most of these pro reporters have to spend a lot of time around politicians, and most politicians are painful to be around. As one political columnist told ROLLING STONE and another pencil new to the Trail, "If you saw more of how the other candidates conduct themselves, you'd be way more impressed with [McCain]. It's that he acts somewhat in the ballpark of the way a real human being would act." And the grateful press on the Trail transmit maybe even exaggerate -- McCain's humanity to their huge audience, the electorate, which electorate in turn seems so paroxysmically thankful for a presidential candidate somewhat in the ballpark of a real human being that it has to make you stop and think about how starved voters are for just some minimal level of genuineness in the men who want to "lead" and "inspire" them. There are, of course, still some groups of Young Voters way, way into modern politics. There's Rowdy Ralph Reed's far-Right Christians, for one, and then way out at the other end of the spectrum there's ACT UP and the sensitive men and angry womyn of the PC Left. What's interesting is that what gives these small fringe blocs so much power is the basic failure of mainstream Young Voters to get off their ass and vote. It's like we all learned in jr. high social studies: if I vote and you don't, my vote counts double. And it's not just the fringes that benefit -- the fact is that it's to some very powerful Establishments' advantage that most young people hate politics and don't vote. This, too, deserves to be thought about, if you can stand it. There's another thing John McCain always says. He makes sure he concludes every speech and THM with it, so the buses' press hear it about 100 times this week. He always pauses a second for effect and then says: "I'm going to tell you something. I may have said some things here today that maybe you don't agree with, and I might have said some things you hopefully do agree with. But I will always. Tell you. The truth." This is McCain's closer, his last big reverb on the six-string as it were. And the frenzied standing-O it always gets from his audience is something to see. But you have to wonder: why do these crowds from Detroit to Charleston cheer so wildly at a simple promise not to lie? Well it's obvious why. When McCain says it, the people are cheering not for him so much as for how good it feels to believe him. They're cheering the loosening of a weird sort of knot in the electoral turnroy. McCain's resume and candor, in other words, promise not empathy with voters' pain, but relief from it. Because we've been lied to and lied to, and it hurts to be lied to. It's ultimately just about that complicated: it hurts. It denies you respect for yourself, for the liar, for the world. Especially if the lies are chronic, systemic, if hard experience seems to teach that everything you're supposed to believe in's really a game based on lies. Young Voters have been taught well and thoroughly. You may not personally remember Vietnam or Watergate, but it's a good bet you remember "No new taxes" and "Out of the loop" and "No direct knowledge of any impropriety at this time" and "Did not inhale" and "Did not have sex with that woman" and etc. etc. It's depressing and painful to believe that the would-be "public servants" you're forced to choose between are all phonies whose only real concern is their own care and feeding and who will lie so outrageously with such a straight face that you just know they have to believe you're an idiot. So who wouldn't fall all over themselves for a top politician who actually seemed to talk to you like you were a person, an intelligent adult worthy of respect? A politician who all of a sudden out of nowhere comes on TV as this total longshot candidate and says that Washington is paralyzed, that everybody there's been bought off, and that the only way to really "return government to the people" the way all the other candidates claim they want to do is to outlaw huge unreported political contributions from corporations and lobbies and PACs ... all of which are obvious truths that everybody knows but no recent politician's had the stones to say. Who wouldn't cheer, hearing stuff like this, especially from a guy we know chose to sit in a dark box for four years instead of violate a Code? Even in A.D. 2000, who among us is so cynical that he doesn't have some good old corny American hope way down deep in his heart, lying dormant like a spinster's ardor, not dead but just waiting for the Right Guy to give it to? That John S. McCain III opposed making Martin Luther King's birthday a holiday, or that he thinks clear-cut logging is good for America, or that he feels our present gun laws are not clinically insane -- this stuff counts for nothing with these Town Hall crowds, all on their feet, cheering their own ability to finally really fucking cheer. NEGATIVITY 7-13 February is pitched to Rolling Stone as a "down week" on the GO P Trail, an interval almost breathtaking in its political unsexiness. Last week was the NH surprise; next week is the mad dash to SC's 2/19 primary, which the Twelve Monkeys all believe could now make or break both McCain and the Shrub. This week is the trenches: flesh-pressing, fundraising, traveling, poll-taking, strategizing, grinding out eight-event days in Michigan and Georgia and New York and SC. The Daily Press Schedule goes from 12-point type to 10-. Warren MI Town Hail Meeting in Ukrainian Cultural Center. Saginaw County GOP Lincoln Day Dinner. Editorial Meeting w/Detroit News. Press Conference at Weird Meth-Lab-Looking Internet Company in Flint. Redeye to North Savannah on Chartered 707 with Faint Pan Am Still Stenciled on Tail. Spartanburg SC Town Hall Meeting. ClosedCircuit TV Reception for McCain Supporters in Three States Broadcast Out of Charleston. AARP Town Forum. North Augusta THM. Live Town Hall Forum at Clemson U. with Chris Matthews of MSNBC's Hardball. Goose Creek THM. Door-to-Door Campaigning with Congressmen Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford and Senator Fred Thompson (R.-TN) and About 300 Media in Florence SC. NASCAR Tour and Test-Drive at Darlington Raceway. National Guard Armory THM in Fort Mill. Congressman Lindsey Graham Hosts Weird BBQ. for a Lot of FlintyEyed Men in Down Vests and Trucker's Hats in Seneca SC. Taping of Tim Russert show for CNBC. Greer THM. Cyber-Fundraiser in Charleston. Larry King Live with Larry King Looking Even More Like a Giant Bug than Usual. Press-Conference in Greenville. Book Signing at Chapter II Books in Atlanta. On and on. Breakfast a Krispy Kreme, lunch a sandwich in Saran and storebrand chips, supper anyone's guess. Everyone but McCain is grim and stolid. "We're in maybe a little bit of a trough in terms of excitement," a Press Liaison concedes in his orientation for new pencils on Monday morning. ... ... Until that very day's big tactical shift, which catches the McCain press corps unawares and gets all sorts of stuff underway for midweek's dramatic tactical climax, the Chris Duren Incident, all of which is politically sexy and exciting as hell, though not quite in the kind of way you cheer for. The big tactical shift starts in the F&F Room of something called the Riverfront Hotel in the almost unbelievably blighted and depressing Flint MI, where all the buses' media are at 1500h. on 2/7 while McCain is huddled with the staff High Command in a suite upstairs. There is no more definitive behind-scene locale in a primary campaign than the F&F Room, which is usually some hotel's little third-string banquet- or meeting room off the lobby that McCain2000 rents (at the media's expense, precisely divided and tallied, just like each day's seat on the buses and plane and the Continental Breakfasts before Baggage Call and even the F&F Rooms' "catered lunches," which today are weird bright-red ham on Wonder Bread, Fritos, and coffee that tastes like warm water with a brown crayon in it, and the pencils all bitch about the McCain2000 food and wistfully recount rumors that the Bush2000 press lunches are supposedly hot and multi-food-group and served on actual plates by unctuous men with white towels over their arm) so that those media with PM deadlines can finish their stories and File and Feed. By 1515h., each chair is filled by a producer or pencil trying to eat and type and talk on the phone all at once, and the whole F&F Room is up and running and alive with the quadruple ding of Windows booting up, the honk and static of modem connections, the multiphase clicking of forty-plus keyboards, the needly screech of fax machines saying hello to New York and Atlanta and the murmur of people on headset phones doing same. Outside the Riverfront's side doors off the parking lot, where it's so cold and windy you have to smoke with mittens on, an OTS with Jim C. and his longtime friend and partner Frank C. means getting to bitch about the 12 Monkeys, and here Jim and Frank discourse with no small sympathy on the brutality of these campaign reporters' existence -- subsisting on the Campaign Diet, which is basically sugar and caffeine (diabetes is apparently the Black Lung of political journalism), always on the road in some sort of box for weeks at a time, very alone, connected to loved ones only by cellphone and 1-800 answering service. ROLLING STONE mentions being in hotels every night, which a CBS sound guy on BS2 had said was probably the McCain media's number-one stressor. The Shrub apparently stays in five-star places with putting greens and spurting-nymph fountains and a speed-dial number for the in-house masseur. Not McCain2000, which favors Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott, Hampton Inn, Hilton, Signature Inn, Radisson, Holiday Inn, Embassy Suites, etc. ROLLING STONE, who is in no way cut out to be a road journalist, invokes the soul-killing anonymity of chain hotels, the rooms' terrible transient sameness: the ubiquitous floral design of the bedspreads, the multiple low-watt lamps, the pallid artwork bolted to the wall, the whisper of ventilation, the sad shag carpet, the smell of alien cleansers, the Kleenex dispensed from the wall, the automated wake-up call, the light-proof curtains, the windows that do not open -- ever. RS asks whether it could possibly be coincidence that over half of all indoor suicides take place in chain hotels. Jim and Frank say they get the idea. RS references the terrible oxymoron of"hotel guest." Hell could easily be a chain hotel. Is it any accident that McCain's POW prison was known as the Hanoi Hilton? Jim shrugs; Frank says you get used to it, that it's better not to dwell. Monday, the first and only File and Feed in Michigan, is also the day of ROLLING STONE's introduction to the Cellular Waltz, one of the most striking natural formations of the Trail. There's a huge empty lobby-like space you have to pass through to get from the Riverfront's side doors back to the area where the F&F and bathrooms are. It takes a long time to traverse this space, a hundred yards of nothing but flagstone walls and plaques with the sad pretentious names of the Riverfront's banquet halls and conference rooms -- the Oak Room, the Windsor Room --but on return from the OTS now out here are also half a dozen different members of the F&F Room's press, each fifty feet away from any of the others, for privacy, and all walking in idle counterclockwise circles with a cellphone to their ear. These little orbits are the Cellular Waltz, which is probably the digital equivalent of doodling or picking at yourself as you talk on a regular landline. There's something oddly lovely about the Waltz's different circles here, which are of various diameters and stride-lengths and rates of rotation but are all identically counterclockwise and telephonic. We three slow down a bit to watch; you couldn't not. From above, like if there were a mezzanine, the Waltzes would look like the cogs of some strange, diffuse machine. Frank C. says he can tell by their faces something's up. Jim C. says what's interesting is that media south of the equator do the exact same Cellular Waltz but that down there all their circles are reversed. The reason for all the lobby's Waltzing was that during the OTS word apparently started to spread in the F&F Room that Mr. Mike Murphy of the McCain2000 High Command was coming down to do a surprise impromptu --Avail regarding a fresh two-page Press Release (still slightly warm from the Xerox) which two Press Liaisons are passing out even now, and of which part of the first page is reproduced here: Bush Campaign Caught Red-Handed With Negative Ads, Unethical "Push-Polling" Outraged South Carolinians Unite Against False Advertising, Universally Condemned Negative Polling Practice, McCain Volunteer Army Waiting With Tape Recorders to Catch Bush in the Act COLUMBIA, SC--Deceptive TV ads and negative push polls conducted by phone in South Carolina last night by a polling firm employed by Texas Governor George W. Bush's campaign ... This document is unusual not only because McCain2000's Press Releases are normally studies in bland irrelevance "MCCAIN TO CONTINUE CAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN TODAY"; "MCCAIN HAS TWO HELPINGS OF POTATO SALAD AT SOUTH CAROLINA VFW PICNIC" -- but because no less a personage than Mike Murphy has now indeed just come clown to Spin this abrupt change of tone in the campaign's rhetoric. Murphy, who is only 37 but seems a lot older, is the McCain campaign's Senior Strategist, a professional political consultant who's already had eighteen winning Senate and gubernatorial campaigns and is as previously mentioned a constant and acerbic presence in McCain's press salon aboard the Express. Among political pros, Murphy has the reputation of being (1) smart and funny as hell and (2) a real attack-dog, working for clients like Oliver North and Michigan's own John Engler in campaigns that were absolute operas of nastiness, and known for turning out what the NY Times rather delicately called "some of the most rough-edged commercials in the business." He's leaning back against a wall and surrounded in a 180 degrees arc by the Twelve Monkeys, all of whom have notebooks or tiny professional tape recorders out and keep clearing their throats and pushing their glasses up with excitement. Murphy says he's "just swung by" to provide the press corps with "some context" on the strident Press Release and to give the corps advance notice that the McCain campaign is also preparing a special "response ad" which will start airing in South Carolina tomorrow. Murphy uses the words "response" or "response ad" nine times in two minutes, and when one of the Twelve Monkeys interrupts to ask whether it'd be fair to characterize this new ad as Negative Murphy gives him a long styptic look and spells "r-e-s-p-o-n-s-e" out very slowly. He then tells the hemispheric scrum that the Press Release and new ad reflect the McCain2000 campaign's decision, after much agonizing, to respond to what he says is G.W. Bush's welching on the two candidates' public handshake-agreement in January to run a bilaterally positive campaign. For the past five days, mostly in New York and SC, the Shrub has apparently been running ads that characterize McCain's policy proposals in what Murphy terms a "willfully distorting" way. Plus there s the push-polling, a practice that's regarded as the absolute bottom-feeder of sleazy campaign tactics. But the worst, the most obviously unacceptable, Murphy emphasizes, was the Shrub standing up at a podium in SC a couple days ago with a wild-eyed and apparently notorious "fringe veteran" who publicly accused John McCain of"abandoning his fellow veterans" after returning from Vietnam, which, Murphy says, without going into McCain's well-documented personal bio and heroic legislative efforts on behalf of vets for nearly twenty years is just so clearly over the line of even minimal personal decency and honor that it pretty much necessitates some sort of response. The Twelve Monkeys, who are old pros at this sort of exchange, keep trying to steer Murphy away from what the Shrub's done and get him to give a quotable explanation of why McCain himself has decided to run this "response ad," a transcript of which the harried Press Liaisons are now distributing from a fresh copier-box and which features, in part: AUDIO MCCAIN: "I guess it was bound to happen. Governor Bush's campaign is getting desperate with a negative ad about me. The fact is, I will use the surplus money to fix Social Security, cut your taxes, and pay down the debt. ... His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired of that. ... " - of which ad-transcript the 12M point out that in particular the "twists the truth like Clinton" part seems Negative indeed, since in '00 comparing a GOP candidate to Bill Clinton is roughly equivalent to claiming that he wears ladies' underwear under his black robes while presiding over Satanic masses. The network techs, while checking their equipment and starting to gear up for the scrum of McCain's exit at the Riverfront's main doors, listen to ROLLING STONE'S summary of the Press Release and Murphy's comments, confirm that the Shrub has indeed gone Negative (they'd heard about all this long before the Twelve Monkeys et al., because the techs and field producers are in constant touch with their colleagues on the Shrub's buses, whereas the Monkeys' Bush2000 counterparts are as aloof and niggardly about sharing info as the 12M themselves), and kill the last of the time in the Flint F&F by quietly analyzing Bush's Negativity and McCain's response from a tactical point of view. Leaving aside their coolness and esprit de corps, be advised that ROLLING STONE'S single luckiest journalistic accident this week was his bumbling into hanging around with these camera and sound guys. This is because networknews techs -- who all have worked countless campaigns, and who have neither the raging egos of journalists nor the self-interested agenda of the McCain2000 staff to muddy their perspective --turn out to be way more acute and sensible political analysts than anybody you'll read or see on TV, and their assessment of today's Negativity developments is so extraordinarily nuanced and sophisticated that only a small portion of it can be ripped off and summarized here. Going Negative is risky. Countless polls have shown that voters find it distasteful in the extreme, and if a candidate is perceived as going Negative, it usually costs him. So the techs all agree that the first question is why Bush2000 started playing this card. One possible explanation is that the Shrub was so personally shocked and scared by McCain's win in New Hampshire that he's now lashing out like a spoiled child and trying to hurt McCain however he can. The techs reject this, though. Spoiled child or no, G.W. Bush is a creature of his campaign advisers, and these advisers are the best that $70 million and the full faith and credit of the GOP Establishment can buy, and if Bush2000 has gone Negative there must be solid political logic behind the move. This logic turns out to be indeed solid, even brilliant, and the NBC, CBS and CNN techs flesh it out while the ABC cameraman puts several emergency sandwiches in his lens bag for tonight's flight south on a campaign plane whose provisioning is notoriously inconsistent. The Shrub's attack leaves McCain with two options. If he does not retaliate, some SC voters will credit McCain for taking the high road. But it could also come off as wimpy, might compromise McCain's image as a tough, take-no-shit guy with the balls to take on the Washington kleptocracy. So McCain pretty much has to strike back, the techs agree. But this is extremely dangerous, for by retaliating -- which of course (despite all Murphy's artful dodging) means going Negative himself- McCain runs the risk of looking like just another ambitious, win-at-any-cost politician. Worse, the CBS cameraman points out, if Bush then turns around and retaliates against the retaliation, and McCain has to reretaliate against Bush's retaliation, and so on, then the whole GOP race could quickly degenerate into the sort of boring, depressing, cynical charge-and counter-charge contest that turns voters off and keeps them away from the polls. ... Especially Young Voters, RS and an underage local pencil from one of those weekly things that people can pick up free at Detroit supermarkets point out, both scribbling just as furiously with the techs as the 12M did with Murphy. The techs say well OK maybe but that the really important tactical point here is that John S. McCain cannot afford to have voters get turned off, since his whole strategy is based on exciting the people and inspiring them and pulling more voters in, especially those who'd stopped voting because they'd gotten so disgusted and bored with all the Negativity and bullshit of politics. In other words, RS and the Detroit free-weekly kid propose to the techs, it's maybe even in the Shrub's political self-interest to let the GOP race get ugly and Negative and have voters get so bored and cynical and disgusted with the whole thing that they don't even bother to vote. Well no shit Sherlock H., the ABC techs in essence respond, good old Frank C. then patiently explaining that, yes, if there's a low voter turnout, then the majority of the people who get off their ass and do vote will be the Diehard Republicans, meaning the Christian Right and the party faithful, and these are the groups that vote as they're told, the ones controlled by the GOP Establishment, an Establishment that's got $70 million and 100% of its own credibility invested in the Shrub. CNN's Mark A. inserts that this also explains why the amazingly lifelike Al Gore, over in the Democratic race, has been so relentlessly Negative and depressing in his attacks on Bill Bradley: since Gore, like the Shrub, has his party's Establishment behind him, with all its organization and money and the Diehards who'll fall into line and vote as they're told, it's in Big Al's (and his party's bosses') interest to draw as few voters as possible into the Democratic primaries, because the lower the overall turnout, the more the Establishment voters' ballots actually count. Which fact then in turn, the CBS cameraman says, helps explain why, even though our elected representatives are always wringing their hands and making concerned sounds about low voter-turnouts, nothing substantive ever gets done to make politics less ugly or depressing and to actually induce more people to vote: our elected representatives are incumbents, and low turnouts favor incumbents for the same reason soft money does. Let's pause here one second for a quick ROLLING STONE PSA. If you are demographically a Young Voter, it is again worth a moment of your valuable time to consider the implications of the techs' point. If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who are not dumb and are keenly aware that it's in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible psychological reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV Spring Break on Primary Day. By all means stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not voting. In reality, there is no such thing as not voting: you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote. But so the techs' assessment, then, is that Bush's going Negative is both tactically sound and politically near-brilliant, and that it forces McCain's own strategists to walk a very tight wire indeed in formulating a response. What McCain has to try to do, then, is retaliate without losing the inspiring high-road image that won him New Hampshire. This is why Mike Murphy took valuable huddle-with-candidate time to come down to the F&F and spoonfeed the Twelve Monkeys all this stuff about Bush's attacks being so far over the line that they have no choice but to "respond." Because the McCain2000 campaign has got to Spin today's retaliation the same way nations Spin War: McCain has to make it appear that he is not being actually aggressive himself but is merely "repelling aggression." It will require enormous discipline and cunning for McCain2000 to pull this off. And tomorrow's "response ad" - in the tech's opinion as the transcript's passed around - this is not a promising start, discipline-and-cunning-wise, especially the "twists the truth like Clinton" part that the 12M jumped on Murphy for. This line's too mean. McCain2000 could have chosen to put together a much softer and smarter and patiently "correcting" certain "unfortunate errors" in Bush's ads and "respectfully requesting" that the pus-polling cease (with everything in quotes here being Jim C.'s suggested terms) and striking just the right high-road tone. The actual ad's "twists like Clinton" does not sound high-road; it sounds pissed off, aggressive. And it will allow Bush to do a React and now say that it's McCain who's violated the handshake-agreement... which the techs say will of course be bullshit, but that it might be effective bullshit, and that it's McCain's aggressive ad that's giving the Shrub the opening to do it. The tech's basic analysis of the motivation behind "twist the truth like Clinton" is that McCain is genuinely, personally pissed off at the Shrub, and that he has taken Murphy's leash off and let Murphy do what Murphy does best, which is gutter-fight. McCain, after all, is known for having a temper (though he's been extremely controlled in the campaign so far and never shown it in public), and Jim C. thinks that maybe the truly ingenious thing the Shrub's strategists did was to find a way to genuinely piss McCain off and make him want to go Negative even though the staff High Command had to have warned him that his was playing right into Bush's strategists' hands. This analysis suddenly reminds ROLLING STONE of the part in The Godfather where Sonny Corleone's fatal flaw is his temper, which Barzini and Tattaglia exploit by getting Carlo to beat up Connie and make Sonny so insanely angry that he drives off to kill Carlo and gets assassinated in Barzini's ambush at the tollbooth. Jim C., sweating heavily with forty pounds of gear on, says he supposes there are some similarities, and Randy (the taciturn but cinephilic CNN cameraman) speculates that the Shrub's brain-trust may actually have based their whole strategy on Barzini's ingenious ploy in The Godfather, and Frank C. observes that Bush's equivalent to slapping Connie Corleone around was probably his standing up with the wacko vet who claimed McCain dissed his Vietnam comrades, which at first looked stupid and unnecessarily nasty of Bush but from another perspective might have been sheer genius it if made McCain so angry that his desire to retaliate outweighed his political judgment. And events of the next few days bear out the tech's analysis pretty much 100%. On Tuesday morning, on the Radisson's TV in North Savannah SC, both Today and GMA lead with "The GOP campaign takes an ugly turn" and show the part of McCain's new ad where he says "twists the truth like Clinton"; and sure enough by midday the Shrub has put out a React where he accuses John S. McCain of violating the handshake-agreement and going Negative and adds that he is "personally offended and outraged" at being compared to W.J. Clinton; and then at a Press-Avail in Hilton Head the Shrub avers that he knows less than nothing about any so-called push-polling and suggests that the whole thing might have been fabricated as a sleazy political ploy on McCain2000's part; and then on Wednesday A.M. on TV at the Embassy Suites in Charleston there's now an even more aggressive ad that Murphy's gotten McCain to let him run, which shows a nighttime shot of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.'s famous facade with its palisade of blatantly ejaculatory fountains in the foreground and says "Can America afford another politician in the White House that we can't trust?," which grammatically problems aside Frank C. says that shot of the White House is really going low with the knife and that if McCain loses South Carolina it may very well be because of this ad; and sure enough by Wednesday night focus polls are showing that South Carolina voters are finding the new ad Negative and depressing, and the next couple days' polls then have both McCain's support and the primary's projected voter-turnout falling like a rock, and the daily pencils are having to churn out piece after piece about all the endless picayune charges and counter-charges, and everyone on Bullshit 1 and 2 is starting to get severely dispirited and bored, and even the 12M's strides have lost a certain spring... ...And then out of nowhere comes the dramatic tactical climax mentioned supra, which hits the media like a syringe of Narcan and makes all five networks' news that night. It occurs at the Spartanburg SC THM, whose venue is a small steep theater in the Fine Arts Center of a small college nobody could ever find out the name of, and is so packed by the time the press corps gets there that even the aisles are full, so that everybody except the techs and their producers is out in the lobby. To be honest, all the national pencils would probably be out here in the lobby even if the theater weren't full, because after a few days McCain's opening THM 22.5 becomes almost wrist-slittingly dull and repetitive. Journalists who've covered McCain since Christmas report that Mike Murphy and Co. have worked hard on him to become more "Message-Disciplined," which in political speak means reducing everything important to brief, memory-friendly slogans - "the Iron Triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation," "I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum" - and then punching those slogans over and over. In fairness to McCain, he's not an orator and doesn't pretend to be. His metier is conversation, back-and-forth. This is because he's bright in a fast, flexible way that most candidates aren't. He also genuinely seems to find people and questions and arguments energizing - the latter maybe because of all his years debating in Congress - which is why he favors Town Hall Q&A and constant chats with press in his rolling salon. So, while the media marvel at his accessibility because they've been trained to equate it with vulnerability, they often don't seem to realize they're playing totally to McCain's strength when they converse with him instead of listening to his speeches. It's McCain's speeches and 22.5's that are canned and stilted, and also sometimes scary and Right-wingish, and when you listen closely to them it's as if some warm pleasant fog suddenly lifts and it strikes you that you're not at all sure it's John McCain you want choosing the head of the EPA or the at least three new Justices who'll be coming onto the Supreme Court in the next term, and you start wondering all over again what makes him so attractive. But then the doubts again dissolve when McCain starts taking questions at THMs, which by now is what's underway in Spartanburg. The questions always run the great vox populi gamut, from Talmudically bearded guys asking about Chechnya and tort reform to high-school kids reading questions off printed sheets their hands shake as they hold, from moms worried about their kids' future SSI to old vets in Legion caps who call McCain "Lieutenant" and want to trade salutes, plus the obligatory walleyed fundamentalists trying to pin him down on whether Christ considered homosexuality "an abomination," and arcane questions about index-fund regulation and postal privatization, and HMO horror stories, and Internet porn, and tobacco litigation, and people who believe the Second Amendment entitles them to own grenade launchers. The questions are random and unscreened, and the candidate fields them all, and he's never better or more human than in these exchanges, especially when the questioner is angry or wrong - McCain will "I respectfully disagree" or "We have a difference of opinion" and the detail his objections in lucid English with a gentleness that's never condescending. For a man with a temper, McCain is unbelievably patient and decent with people at THMs, especially when you consider that he's 63, in chronic pain, sleep-deprived, and under enormous pressure not to gaffe or get himself in trouble. He doesn't. No matter how stale and Message-Disciplined the 22.5 at the beginning, in the Town Hall Q&As you get an overwhelming sense that this is a decent, honorable man trying to tell the truth to people he really sees. You will not be alone in this impression. And so but then in the Spartanburg Q&A, after two China questions and one on taxing Internet commerce, a totally demographically average thirty-something middle-class soccer morn in rust-colored slacks and big round glasses gets picked and stands up and somebody brings her the mike. It turns out her name is Donna Duren, of right here in Spartanburg SC, and she says she has a 14-year-old son named Chris, in whom Mr. and Mrs. Duren have been trying to inculcate family values and respect for authority and a non-cynical idealism about America and its duly elected leaders. They want him to find heroes he can believe in, she says. Donna Duren's whole story takes a while, but nobody's bored, and even on the monitors in the lobby you can sense a change in the theater's voltage, and the national pencils start moving in and elbowing people aside (which they're really good at) to get close to the monitors. Mrs. Duren says that Chris -- clearly a sensitive kid -- was "made very very upset" by the Lewinsky scandal and all the R-rated revelations and the appalling behavior of Clinton and Starr and Tripp and pretty much everybody on all sides during the impeachment thing, and Chris had a lot of very upsetting and uncomfortable questions that Mr. and Mrs. D. struggled to answer, and that basically it was a really hard time but they got through it. And then last year, at more or less a trough in terms of idealism and respect for elected authority, she says, Chris discovere
d John McCain and McCain2000.com, and got interested in the campaign, and his parents apparently read him some G-rated parts of Faith of My Fathers, and the upshot is that young Chris finally found a public hero he could believe in: John S. McCain III. It's impossible to know what McCain's face is doing during this story because the monitors are taking CNN's feed, and Randy of CNN's lens is staying hard and steady on Donna Duren, who appears so iconically prototypical and so thoroughly exudes the special quiet dignity of an average American who knows she's average and just wants a decent, non-cynical life for herself and her family that she can say things like "family values" and "hero" without anybody rolling their eyes. But then last night, Mrs. D. says, as they were all watching non-violent TV in the family room, the phone suddenly rang upstairs, and Chris went up and got it, and Mrs. D. says a little while later he came back down into the family room crying and just terribly upset and told them the phone call had been a man who started talking to him about the 2000 campaign and then asked Chris if he knew that John McCain was a liar and a cheater and that anybody who'd vote for John McCain was either stupid or un-American or both. That caller had been a push-poller for Bush2000, Mrs. Duren says, knuckles on her mike-hand white and voice almost breaking, and she says she just wanted Senator McCain to know about it, about what happened to Chris, and wants to know whether anything can be done to keep people like this from calling innocent young kids and plunging them into disillusionment and confusion about whether they're stupid for trying to have heroes they believe in. At which point (0853h.) two things happen out here in the Fine Arts Center lobby. The first is that the national pencils disperse in a radial pattern, each dialing his cellphone, and the network field producers all come barreling out of the theater doors pulling their cellphone antennas out with their teeth, and everybody tries to find a little empty area to Waltz in while they call the gist of this riveting Negativity-related development in to networks and editors and try to raise their counterparts in the Bush2000 press corps to see if they can get a React from the Shrub on Mrs. Duren's story, at the end of which story the second thing happens, which is that CNN's Randy finally pans to McCain and you can see McCain's facial expression, which is pained and pale and actually looks more distraught even than Mrs. Duren's face had looked. And what McCain does, after looking silently at the floor a second, is -- apologize. He doesn't lash out at Bush or at push-polling or appear to try to capitalize politically in any way. He looks sad and compassionate and regretful and says that the only reason he got into this race in the first place was to try to help inspire young Americans to feel better about devoting themselves to something, and that a story like what Mrs. Duren took the trouble to come down here to the THM this morning and tell him is just about the worst thing he could hear, and that if it's OK with Mrs. D. he'd like to call her son and apologize personally on the phone and maybe tell Chris that yes there are some bad people out there but that it's never a mistake to believe in something, that politics is still worthwhile as a Process to get involved in, and he really does look upset, McCain does, and almost as what seems like an afterthought he says that one thing Donna Duren and other concerned parents and citizens can do is call the Bush campaign and tell them to stop this push-polling, that Governor Bush is a good man with a family of his own and it's difficult to believe he'd ever endorse his campaign doing things like this if he knew about it, and that he (McCain) will be calling Bush again personally for like the umpteenth time to ask him to stop the Negativity, and McCain's eyes look ... wet, as in teary, which maybe is just a trick of the techs' TV lights but is nevertheless disturbing, the whole thing is disturbing, because McCain seems upset in a way that's almost too dramatic. He takes a couple more THM questions, then stops abruptly and says he's sorry but he's just so incredibly upset about the Chris Duren thing that he's having a hard time concentrating on anything else, and he asks the THM crowd's forgiveness, and thanks them, and forgets his Message Discipline and doesn't finish with he'll always. Tell them. The truth but they applaud like mad anyway, and the lobby's monitors' feed is cut as Randy and Jim C. et al go shoulder-held to join the scrum as McCain starts to exit. And now none of this is simple at all. especially not McCain's exaggerated-seeming distress about Chris Duren, and a small set of disturbing and possibly very cynical interconnected thoughts and questions start whirling around in the journalistic head. Like the fact that Donna Duren's story was a far more devastating indictment of the Shrub's campaign tactics than anything McCain himself could say, and is it possible that McCain, on the theater's stage, wasn't aware of this? Is it possible that some part of McCain could realize that what happened to Chris Duren is very much to John S. McCain's political advantage, and yet he's still such a decent, uncalculating guy that all he feels is horror and regret that a kid was disillusioned? Was it human compassion that made him apologize first instead of criticizing Bush2000, or is McCain just maybe shrewd enough to know that Mrs. D.'s story had already nailed Bush to the wall and that by apologizing and looking distraught McCain could help underscore the difference between his own human decency and Bush's uncaring Negativity? Is it possible that he really actually had tears in his eyes? And come to think of it hey, why would a push-poller even be interested in trying to push-poll somebody too young to vote? Does Chris Duren maybe have a really deep-sounding phone voice or something? But wouldn't you think a push-poller would ask somebody's age before launching into his spiel? And how come nobody asked this question, not even the jaded 12M, out in the lobby? What were they thinking? Bullshit I is empty except for Jay, who's grabbing a nap on one of the couches, and through the port windows you can see all the techs and heads and talent in a king-size scrum around Mrs. Donna Duren in the gravel courtyard, and there's the additional cynical thought that doubtless some enterprising network crew is even now pulling up in front of poor Chris Duren's junior high (which unfortunately tonight on TV turns out to be just what happened). The bus idles empty for a very long time -- the post-event scrums and standups last longer than the whole THM did and then when the BSI regulars finally do pile in they're all extremely busy trying to type and phone and file, and all the techs have to get their Sony DVS-series Digital Editors out and help their producers find and time the clip of Mrs. Duren's story and McCain's response so they can feed it to the networks right away, and the Twelve Monkeys have as more or less one body stormed the Straight Talk Express, which is just up ahead on I-85 and riding very low in the stern from all the weight in McCain's rear salon. The point is that none of the usual media pros are available to interface with and help deconstruct the Chris Duren Incident and help try to figure out what to be cynical about and what not to and which of the many disturbing questions the whole Incident provokes are paranoid or irrelevant and which ones might be journalistically valid ... such as was McCain really serious about calling Chris Duren? How was he going to get the Durens' phone number when Mrs. D. was scrummed solid the whole time he and the staff were leaving? And where were Mike Murphy and the other High Command through that whole thing, who can usually be seen Cell-Waltzing in the shadows at every THM but today were nowhere in sight? Is it just possible that McCain -- maybe not even consciously -- played up his reaction to Mrs. Duren's story and framed his distress to give himself a plausible, good-looking excuse to get out of the Negative spiral that's been hurting him so badly in the polls that Jim and Frank say he may well lose SC if things keep on this way? Is it too cynical even to consider such a thing? Because at the following day's first Press-Avail, John S. McCain issues a plausible, good-looking, highly emotional statement to the whole scrummed corps. This is on a warm, pretty 2/11 morning outside the Embassy Suites (or maybe Hampton Inn) in Charleston, right after Baggage Call. McCain informs the press that the case of young Chris Duren has caused him such distress that after a great deal of late-night soul-searching he's now ordered his staff to cease all Negativity and to pull all the McCain2000 response ads in South Carolina regardless of whether the Shrub pulls his own Negative ads or not. And of course framed as it is in the distressed context of the Chris Duren Incident, McCain's decision in no way now makes him look wimpy or appeasing, but rather like a truly decent, honorable, high-road guy who doesn't want young people's political idealism fucked with in any way if he can help it. It's a masterful statement, and a stirring and high-impact Press-Avail, and everybody in the scrum seems impressed and in some cases deeply and personally moved, and nobody (including ROLLING STONE) ventures to point out aloud that, however unfortunate the phone call was for the Durens, it turned out to be fortunate as hell for McCain2000 in terms of this week's tactical battle, that actually the whole thing couldn't have worked out better for McCain2000 if it had been ... well, like, scripted, if like say Mrs. Donna Duren had been a trained actress or gifted amateur who'd been somehow secretly approached and rehearsed and paid and planted in that crowd of over 300 random unscreened questioners where her raised hand in that sea of average voters' hands was seen and chosen and she got to tell a moving story that made all five networks last night and damaged Bush badly and now has released McCain from this week's tactical box. Any way you look at it (and there's a long DT to think about it), yesterday's Incident and THM were an almost incredible stroke of political luck for McCain, or else a stroke of something else that no one -- not ROLLING STONE, not the Twelve Monkeys or even the totally sharp and unsentimental and astute Jim C. -- ever once broaches or mentions out loud, which might be understandable, since maybe even considering whether it was even possible would be so painful it would just break your heart and make it hard to go on, which is what the press and staff and Straight Talk caravan and McCain himself have to do all day, and the next, and the next -- go on. SUCK IT UP Paradox: It is impossible to talk about the really important stuff in politics without using terms that have become such awful cliches they make your eyes glaze over and are hard to even hear. One such term is "leader," which all the big candidates use all the time -- as in "providing leadership," "a proven leader," "a new leader for a new century," etc. -- and have reduced to such a platitude that it's hard to try to think about what "leader" really means and whether indeed what today's Young Voters want is a leader. The weird thing is that the word "leader" itself is cliche and boring, but when you come across somebody who actually is a real leader, that person isn't cliche or boring at all; in fact he's sort of the opposite of cliche and boring. Obviously, a real leader isn't just somebody who has ideas you agree with, nor is it just somebody you happen to think is a good guy. A real leader is somebody who, because of his own particular power and charisma and example, is able to inspire people, with "inspire" being used here in a serious and non-cliche way. A real leader can somehow get us to do certain things that deep down we think are good and want to be able to do but usually can't get ourselves to do on our own. It's a mysterious quality, hard to define, but we always know it when we see it, even as kids. You can probably remember seeing it in certain really great coaches, or teachers, or some extremely cool older kid you "looked up to" (interesting phrase) and wanted to be just like. Some of us remember seeing the quality as kids in a minister or rabbi, or a Scoutmaster, or a parent, or a friend's parent, or a supervisor in a summer job. And yes, all these are "authority figures," but it's a special kind of authority. If you've ever spent time in the military, you know how incredibly easy it is to tell which of your superiors are real leaders and which aren't, and how little rank has to do with it. A leader's real "authority" is a power you voluntarily give him, and you grant him this authority not with resentment or resignation but happily; it feels right. Deep down, you almost always like how a real leader makes you feel, the way you find yourself working harder and pushing yourself and thinking in ways you couldn't ever get to on your own. Lincoln was, by all available evidence, a real leader, and Churchill, and Gandhi, and King. Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, and de Gaulle, and certainly Marshall and maybe Eisenhower. (Of course Hitler was a real leader too, a very powerful one, so you have to watch out; all it is is a weird kind of power.) Probably the last real leader we had as U.S. President was JFK, forty years ago. It's not that Kennedy was a better human being than the seven presidents we've had since: we know he lied about his WWII record, and had spooky Mob ties, and screwed around more in the White House than poor Clinton could ever dream of. But JFK had that weird leader-type magic, and when he said things like "Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country" nobody rolled their eyes or saw it as just political bullshit. Instead, a lot of them felt inspired. And the decade that followed, however fucked up it was in other ways, saw millions of Young Voters devote themselves to social and political causes that had nothing to do with getting a great job or owning nice stuff or finding the best parties; and the '60s were, by most accounts, a generally cleaner and happier time than now. So it's worth thinking about why, when John McCain says he wants to be president in order to inspire a generation of young Americans to devote themselves to causes greater than their own self-interest (which means he's saying he wants to be a real leader), a great many of those young Americans will yawn or roll their eyes or make some ironic joke instead of feeling totally inspired the way they did with Kennedy. True, JFK's audience was more "innocent" than we are: Vietnam hadn't happened yet, or Watergate, or the Savings and Loan scandal, etc. But there's also something else. The science of sales and marketing was still in its drooling infancy in 1961 when Kennedy was saying "Ask not ..." The young people he inspired had not been skillfully marketed to all their lives. They knew nothing of Spin. They were not totally, terribly familiar with salesmen. Now you have to pay close attention to something that's going to seem real obvious. There is a difference between a great leader and a great salesman. Because a salesman's ultimate, overriding motivation is his own self-interest. If you buy what he's selling, the salesman profits. So even though the salesman may have a very powerful, charismatic, admirable personality, and might even persuade you that buying really is in your interest (and it really might be) -- still, a little part of you always knows that what the salesman's ultimately after is something for himself. And this awareness is painful ... although admittedly it's a tiny pain, more like a twinge, and often unconscious. But if you're subjected to enough great salesmen and sales-pitches and marketing concepts for long enough -- like from your earliest Saturday-morning cartoons, let's say -- it is only a matter of time before you start believing deep down that everything is sales and marketing, and that whenever somebody seems like they care about you or about some noble idea or cause, that person is a salesman and really ultimately doesn't give a shit about you or some cause but really just wants something for himself. Some people believed that Ronald W. Reagan (1981-88) was our last real leader. But not many of them were young. Even in the '80s, most younger Americans, who could smell a marketer a mile away, knew that what Reagan really was was a great salesman. What he was selling, of course, was the idea of himself as a leader. And if you're under, say, 35 this is what pretty much every U.S. President you've grown up with has been: a very talented salesman, surrounded by smart, expensive political strategists and media consultants and Spinmasters who manage his "campaign" (as in "advertising campaign") and help him sell us on the idea that it's in our interests to vote for him. But the real interests that drove these guys were their own. They wanted, above all, To Be The President, wanted the mind-bending power and prominence, the historical immortality -- you could smell it on them. (Young Voters tend to have an especially good sense of smell for this sort of thing.) And this is why these guys weren't real leaders: because their deepest, most elemental motives were selfish, there was no chance of them ever inspiring us to transcend our own selfishness. Instead, they helped reinforce our market-conditioned belief that everybody's ultimately out for himself and that life is about selling and profit and that words and phrases like "service" and "justice" and "community" and "patriotism" and "duty" and "Give government back to the people" and "I feel your pain" and "Compassionate Conservatism" are just the politics industry's proven sales-pitches, exactly the same way "Anti-Tartar" and "Fresher Breath" and "Four Out of Five Dentists Surveyed Recommend" are the toothpaste industry's pitches. We may vote for them, the same way we may go buy toothpaste. But we're not inspired. They're not the real thing. Yes, this is simplistic. All politicians sell, always have. FDR and JFK and MLK and Gandhi were great salesmen. But that's not all they were. People could smell it. That weird little extra something. It had to do with "character" (which, yes, is also a cliche -- suck it up). All of this is why watching John McCain hold Town Hall Meetings and be all conspicuously honest and open and informal and idealistic and no-bullshit and say "I run for president not to Be Somebody, but to Do Something" and "We're on a national crusade to give government back to the people" in front of these cheering crowds just seems so much more goddamn complicated than watching old b/w clips of John Kennedy's speeches. It feels impossible, in February '00, to tell whether John McCain is a real leader or merely a very talented political salesman, just another entrepreneur who's seen a new market-niche and devised a way to fill it. Because here's another paradox: Spring 2000 - midmorning in America's hangover from the whole Lewinskyand-impeachment thing - represents a moment of almost unprecedented cynicism and disgust with national politics, a moment when blunt, I-don't-give-a-shit-if-you-elect-me honesty becomes an incredibly attractive and salable and electable commodity. A moment when an anticandidate can be a real candidate. But of course if he becomes a real candidate, is he still an anticandidate? Can you sell someone's refusal to be sold? There are a lot of elements of the McCain2000 campaign -- naming and touting the bus for "Straight Talk," the timely publication of Faith of My Fathers, the much-hyped "openness" and "spontaneity" of the Express's media salon, the Message-Disciplined way McCain thumps "Always. Tell you. The truth" that indicate some very shrewd, clever marketers are trying to market this candidate's rejection of shrewd, clever marketing. Is this bad? Is it hypocritical? Is it hypocritical that one of McCain's ads' lines in South Carolina is "... telling the truth even when it hurts him politically," which of course since it's an ad means that McCain's trying to get political benefit out of his indifference to political benefit? What's the difference between hypocrisy and paradox? Does the whole thing seem awfully confusing? The fact of the matter is that if you are a true-blue, marketing-savvy Young Voter, the only real certainty you're going to feel about John McCain's 2000 campaign is that it produces in you a very modern and very American kind of confusion, a sort of interior war between your deep need to believe and your deep belief that the need to believe is bullshit, that's there's nothing left anywhere but salesmen. When your cynicism's winning, you'll find it's possible to see even McCain's most attractive qualities as just marketing angles. His famous habit of bringing up his own closet's skeletons, for example - bad grades, messy divorce, indictment as one of the Keating Five this could be real honesty and openness, or it could just be McCain's shrewd way to preempt criticism by criticizing himself before anyone else gets the chance. The humble way he talks about his heroism as a POW - "It doesn't take much talent to get shot down"; "I wasn't a hero, but I was fortunate enough to serve my time in the company of heroes" - this could be real humility, or it could be McCain's clever way of appearing both heroic and humble. The confusion you'll feel is not all your fault. There's a very real, very American tension between what John McCain's appeal is and the way that appeal must be structured and packaged in order to make him politically viable. To get you to buy. And sometimes McCain himself seems a little too good at the packaging, as with for example recall 2/10's Chris Duren Incident in Spartanburg and McCain's enormous distress and his promise to phone and apologize personally to the disillusioned kid. So the next afternoon, at a pre-F&F Press-Avail back in North Charleston, the new unilaterally nonNegative McCain informs the corps that he's going up to his hotel room right now to call young Chris. The phone call is to be "a private one between this young man and me," McCain says. Then a Press Liaison steps in looking very serious and announces that only network techs will be allowed in the room, and while they can film the whole call, only the first ten seconds of audio will be permitted. "Ten seconds, then we kill the sound," the Liaison says, looking hard at Frank C. and the other audio guys. "This is a private call, not a media event." So why let TV cameras film McCain making it? And why only ten seconds of sound? Why not either sound or no sound? The answer is modern and American and shrewd and right out of Marketing 101. McCain's campaign wants to publicize McCain keeping his promise and calling a traumatized kid, but also to publicize the fact that McCain is calling him "privately" and not exploiting Chris Duren for crass political purposes. There's no other possible reason for the ten-second audio cutoff, which of course will require networks that run the film to explain why there's no sound after the initial Hello, which of course will make McCain look doubly good, both caring and nonpolitical. Does the shrewd calculation of appeal here imply that McCain doesn't really care about Chris and want to buck him up and restore the kid's faith in the Political Process? Not necessarily. But what it does mean is that McCain2000 wants to have it both ways, rather like modern corporations who give to charity and then try to reap PR benefits by hyping their altruism in their ads. Does stuff like this mean the gifts and phone call aren't "good"? The answer depends on how gray-area-tolerant you are about sincerity vs. marketing, or sincerity plus marketing, or leadership plus the packaging and selling of same. Nobody else can tell you how to see it or convince you you shouldn't yawn and turn away in disgust. Maybe McCain deserves the disgust; maybe he's really just another salesman. But if you, like poor old ROLLING STONE'S nonprofessional pencil, have come to a point on the Trail where you've started fearing your own cynicism every bit as much as you fear your credulity and the salesmen who feed on it, you're apt to find your thoughts returning again and again to a certain dark box in a certain Hilton half a worm and three careers away, to the torture and fear and offer of reprieve and a certain Young Voter named John McCain's refusal to violate a Code. Because there were no techs' cameras in that box, no aides or consultants, no paradoxes or gray areas; nothing to sell. There was just one guy and whatever in his character sustained him. This is a huge deal. In your mind, that Hoa Lo box becomes sort of a dressing room with a star on the door, the private place behind the stage where one imagines "the real John McCain" still lives. But the paradox here is that this box that makes McCain "real" is: impenetrable. Nobody gets in or out. That's why, however many behind-the-scenes pencils get put on the case, be apprised that a "profile" of John McCain is going to be just that: one side, exterior, split and diffracted by so many lenses there's way more than one man to see. Salesman or leader or neither or both: the final paradox - the really tiny central one, way down deep inside all the other boxes and enigmas that layer McCain - is that whether he's For Real depends now less on what's in his heart than on what might be in yours. Try to stay awake.
