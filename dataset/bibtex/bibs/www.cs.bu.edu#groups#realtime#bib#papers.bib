  abstract={We present a new reliable multicast protocol, called
  ARM (for Adaptive Reliable Multicast).  Our protocol integrates
  ARQ and FEC techniques.  The objectives of ARM are (1) reduce the
  message overhead due to NACK requests, (2) reduce the amount of data
  transmission, and (3) reduce the time it takes for all receivers to
  receive the data intact (without loss).  During data transmission,
  the sender periodically informs the receivers of the number of
  packets that are yet to be transmitted.  Based on this information,
  each receiver predicts whether this amount is enough to recover its
  losses. Only if it is not enough, that the receiver requests the
  sender to encode additional redundant packets.  Using ns 
  simulations, we show the superiority of our hybrid ARQ-FEC protocol
  over the well-known Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol.}

  abstract={SomeCast is a novel paradigm for the reliable multicast of
    real-time data to a large set of receivers. SomeCast is
    receiver-initiated and thus scalable in the number of receivers,
    the diverse characteristics of paths between senders and
    receivers, and the dynamic conditions of such paths. SomeCast
    enables receivers to dynamically adjust the rate at which they
    receive multicast information to enable the satisfaction of their
    QoS constraints. This is done by enabling a receiver to join SOME
    number of concurrent multiCAST sessions, whereby each session
    delivers a portion of an encoding of the real-time data. By
    adjusting the number of such sessions dynamically, client-specific
    QoS constraints are met independently. The SomeCast paradigm can
    be thought of as a generalization of the AnyCast and ManyCast
    paradigms, which have been proposed in the literature to address
    issues of scalability of UniCast and MultiCast environments,
    respectively. In this paper we overview the SomeCast paradigm,
    describe an instance of a SomeCast protocol, and present
    simulation results that quantify the significant advantages gained
    from adopting such a protocol.}

  abstract={A number of recent studies have pointed out that TCP's
    performance over ATM networks tends to suffer, especially under
    congestion and switch buffer limitations.  Switch-level
    enhancements and link-level flow control have been proposed to
    improve TCP's performance in ATM networks.  Selective Cell Discard
    (SCD) and Early Packet Discard (EPD) ensure that partial packets
    are discarded from the network ``as early as possible'', thus
    reducing wasted bandwidth. While such techniques improve the
    achievable throughput, their effectiveness tends to degrade in
    multi-hop networks. In this paper, we introduce Lazy Packet
    Discard (LPD), an AAL-level enhancement that improves effective
    throughput, reduces response time, and minimizes wasted bandwidth
    for TCP/IP over ATM. In contrast to the SCD and EPD policies, LPD
    delays as much as possible the removal from the network of cells
    belonging to a partially communicated packet.  LPD preserves
    network bandwidth by keeping such cells alive and by ensuring that
    additional cells, obtained through Reed-Solomon block coding at
    the sender's AAL, are eventually transmitted to salvage the packet
    in question.  We outline the implementation of LPD and show the
    performance advantage of TCP/LPD, compared to plain TCP and

    generalization of the classical RMS results of Liu and Layland
    \cite{ll:sched} for periodic tasks with highly variable execution
    times and statistical QoS requirements.  The main tenet of SRMS is
    that the variability in task resource requirements could be
    smoothed through aggregation to yield guaranteed QoS. This
    aggregation is done over time for a given task and across multiple
    tasks for a given period of time. Similar to RMS, SRMS has two
    components: a feasibility test and a scheduling algorithm. SRMS
    feasibility test ensures that it is possible for a given periodic
    task set to share a given resource without violating any of the
    statistical QoS constraints imposed on each task in the set. The
    SRMS scheduling algorithm consists of two parts: a job admission
    controller and a scheduler. The SRMS scheduler is a simple,
    preemptive, fixed-priority scheduler. The SRMS job admission
    controller manages the QoS delivered to the various tasks through
    admit/reject and priority assignment decisions. In particular, it
    ensures the important property of task isolation, whereby tasks do

   allow for the reservation of the needed bandwidth over a Virtual
   Circuit (VC) have been proposed.  Commonly, these algorithms assign
   VCs to routes using the least-loaded concept, and thus result in
   balancing the load over the set of all candidate routes.  In this
   paper, we show that for such reservation-based VC routing
   algorithms---which allow for the exclusive use of a preset fraction

   balancing is not desirable as it results in resource fragmentation,
   which adversely affects the likelihood of accepting new VC

     Real-time Database framework---an architecture and a transaction

     consists of admission control and scheduling components which
     provide early notification of failure to submitted transactions
     that are deemed not valuable or incapable of completing on time.
     In particular, our Concurrency Admission Control Manager (CACM)
     ensures that transactions which are admitted do not overburden
     the system by requiring a level of concurrency that is not
     sustainable.  The transaction model consists of two components: a
     primary task and a compensating task.  The execution
     requirements of the primary task are not known a priori, whereas
     those of the compensating task are known a priori. Upon the
     submission of a transaction, the Admission Control Mechanisms are
     employed to decide whether to admit or reject that
     transaction. Once admitted, a transaction is guaranteed to {\em
     finish} executing before its deadline. A transaction is
     considered to have finished executing if exactly one of two
     things occur: Either its primary task is completed (successful
     commitment), or its compensating task is completed (safe
     termination). Committed transactions bring a profit to the

     goal of the admission control and scheduling protocols (e.g.,

 abstract={
    Traditionally, the goal of load management protocols for
    distributed systems has been to ensure that nodes are equally
    loaded.  In this paper, we show that for real-time systems, load
    balancing is not desirable since it results in the available
    bandwidth being distributed equally amongst all nodes---in effect
    making all nodes in the system capable of offering almost the same
    bandwidth (in cycles per second) to incoming tasks.  We show
    that this ``one size fits all'' practice leads to a higher rate of
    missed deadlines as incoming tasks may be denied service because
    they require bandwidth that cannot be granted at any single
    node---while plenty of fragmented bandwidth is collectively
    available in the system.  We propose a new load-profiling strategy
    that allows the nodes of a distributed system to be unequally
    loaded so as to maximize the chances of finding a node that would
    satisfy the computational needs of incoming real-time tasks.  The
    performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated via simulation,
    and is contrasted to other dynamic scheduling protocols for

    The popularity of TCP/IP coupled with the premise of high speed
    communication using Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology
    have prompted the network research community to propose a number
    of techniques to adapt TCP/IP to ATM network environments.  ATM
    offers Available Bit Rate (ABR) and Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR)
    services for best-effort traffic, such as conventional file
    transfer.  However, recent studies have shown that TCP/IP, when
    implemented using ABR or UBR, leads to serious performance
    degradations, especially when the utilization of network resources
    (such as switch buffers) is high. Proposed
    techniques---switch-level enhancements, for example---that attempt
    to patch up TCP/IP over ATMs have had limited success in
    alleviating this problem.  The major reason for TCP/IP's poor
    performance over ATMs has been consistently attributed to packet
    fragmentation, which is the result of ATM's 53-byte cell-oriented
    switching architecture.
  
    In this paper, we present a new transport protocol, TCP Boston,
    that turns ATM's 53-byte cell-oriented switching architecture into
    an advantage for TCP/IP.  At the core of TCP Boston is the
    Adaptive Information Dispersal Algorithm (AIDA), an efficient
    encoding technique that allows for dynamic redundancy control.
    AIDA makes TCP/IP's performance less sensitive to cell losses,
    thus ensuring a graceful degradation of TCP/IP's performance when
    faced with congested resources.  In this paper, we introduce AIDA
    and overview the main features of TCP Boston. We present detailed
    simulation results that show the superiority of our protocol when
    compared to other adaptations of TCP/IP over ATMs. In particular,
    we show that TCP Boston improves TCP/IP's performance over ATMs
    for both network-centric metrics (e.g., effective throughput) and
    application-centric metrics (e.g., response time).

    Various concurrency control algorithms differ in the time when
    conflicts are detected, and in the way they are
    resolved. Pessimistic (PCC) protocols detect conflicts as soon as
    they occur and resolve them using blocking. Optimistic (OCC)
    protocols detect conflicts at transaction commit time and resolve
    them using rollbacks. For real-time databases, blockages and
    rollbacks are hazards that increase the likelihood of transactions
    missing their deadlines. We propose a Speculative Concurrency
    Control (SCC) technique that minimizes the impact of blockages and
    rollbacks. SCC relies on added system resources to speculate on
    potential serialization orders, ensuring that if such
    serialization orders materialize, the hazards of blockages and
    roll-backs are minimized. We present a number of SCC-based
    algorithms that differ in the level of speculation they introduce,
    and the amount of system resources (mainly memory) they require.
    We show the performance gains (in terms of number of satisfied
    timing constraints) to be expected when a representative SCC
    algorithm (SCC-2S) is adopted.

Multicasting involves the delivery of messages

A major objective of the routing protocol

Moreover,
some heuristics exist to efficiently find multicast trees

However,
these heuristics are not fast enough for large-scale networks.

A salient feature of QDMR is that
it {\em dynamically} adjusts its low-cost tree construction policy
based on how far the current on-tree node is from
violating the QoS delay bound. 
This QoS dependent (adaptive) tree construction,
together with the capability to merge least-delay paths
into the low-cost tree in case of stringent delay requirements,
lead to the following properties:
(1)~QDMR guarantees that a feasible multicast tree 
(that satisfies the requested delay) will be found if such tree exists;
(2)~this delay-bounded multicast tree is very rapidly generated; and
(3)~the tree has low cost.
Through analysis and extensive simulations,
we confirm the premise of QDMR
by comparing it to many existing multicast algorithms.

of real-time ({\em e.g.} audio/video) applications in integrated services
networks, several routing algorithms that allow for the reservation of the
needed bandwidth over a Virtual Circuit (VC), 
established on one of several candidate routes,
have been proposed.  Traditionally, such routing is done using the
least-loaded concept, and thus 
results in balancing the load across the set of candidate routes.  
In this paper,
we propose the use of {\em load profiling} as an
attractive alternative to load balancing for routing
guaranteed bandwidth VCs (flows). 
Load profiling techniques allow the distribution of
``available'' bandwidth across a set of candidate routes to match the
characteristics of incoming VC QoS requests. 
We thoroughly characterize the performance of VC routing
using load profiling and contrast it to routing using load balancing
and load packing. We do so both analytically and via extensive
simulations of multi-class traffic routing in Virtual Path (VP) based
networks. 
Our findings show that for routing guaranteed bandwidth
flows in VP networks, load profiling is desirable as it reduces
VP bandwidth fragmentation, which increases the likelihood of
accepting new VC requests.  
This fragmentation could be particularly harmful when
the granularity of VC requests is large. Typically, this occurs when a
common VC is established to carry the {\em aggregate} traffic flow of
many high-bandwidth real-time sources.  For VP-based networks, our
simulation results show that our load-profiling VC routing scheme
performs better or as well as the traditional load-balancing VC
routing in terms of revenue under both skewed and uniform workloads.
Furthermore, load-profiling routing improves routing fairness by
proactively increasing the chances of admitting high-bandwidth
flows.}

integrated networks require the underlying

Quality of Service (QoS) constraints.
The problem of 
constrained shortest (least-cost) path routing is known to be NP-hard, and
some heuristics have been proposed to find a near-optimal solution.
However, these heuristics either impose relationships among
the link metrics to reduce the complexity of the problem 
which may limit the general applicability of the heuristic,
or are too costly in terms of execution time to be 
applicable to large networks. 
In this paper, we focus on solving the
{\it delay-constrained} minimum-cost path problem, and present a fast
algorithm to find a near-optimal solution. 
This algorithm, called
DCCR (for Delay-Cost-Constrained Routing), 
is a variant of the $k$-shortest path algorithm.
DCCR uses a new adaptive path weight function 
together with an additional constraint imposed on the path cost,
to restrict the search space.
Thus, DCCR can return a near-optimal solution in a very short time. 
Furthermore,
we use the method proposed by Blokh and Gutin \cite{BG95} to further reduce
the search space by using a tighter bound on path cost.
This makes our algorithm more accurate and even faster. 
We call this improved algorithm SSR+DCCR (for Search Space Reduction+DCCR).
Through extensive simulations, 
we confirm that SSR+DCCR performs very well compared
to the optimal but very expensive solution.}

The objective of the routing protocol

The cost of a tree depends on the costs of its links.
The cost of a link should reflect the effect of allocating 
resources to the new connection
on existing and future connections.
Many studies have proposed multicast algorithms to
construct low-cost QoS-constrained trees.
However, these studies assume that {\it some} cost is given
for each link, and they do not examine the effect of 
the link cost function.
In this paper,
we examine the effect of various link cost functions 
on the performance of two classes of multicast routing algorithms 
under both uniform and skewed real-time workload.
We also investigate the impact of inaccurate 
network state information.
Our simulation results show that
when network state information is accurate (most up-to-date)
at each router, the choice of the link cost function
only has a negligible effect, if any, on the routing
performance.
More interestingly, we find that, a link
cost function that is more sensitive to load
performs better
when link state information is relatively accurate,
while
when link state information is more stale, a link cost
function that is less sensitive to load
performs better. 
This is more pronounced under higher load
and when multicast groups are more dense.}

the workload becomes skewed,

environment needed for groups of diverse users to cooperate to achieve their

is the lack of cooperation between CSCW systems and the underlying network
services to accommodate the dynamic behavior of CSCW groups.
Multicast routing presents a strong case 
where current network services are
inadequate for the traffic generated in CSCW environments.
In this paper, we demonstrate the need for CSCW-specific multicast routing and
present an integrated QoS architecture where a router
QoS manager, on behalf of a multicast routing manager,  negotiates with 
host and CSCW-specific QoS managers for efficient resource utilization
and guaranteed QoS delivery. The multicast routing manager switches
between routing trees or algorithms as warranted by the changes in

        abstract = {Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has the potential of
providing the environment needed for groups of diverse users to
cooperate in real-time to achieve their common goals.  This potential
has been under-utilized due to the lack of cooperation between CSCW
systems and the underlying network services to accommodate the dynamic
behavior and varying Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of CSCW
groups and the applications they use.  To satisfy such requirements, QoS
multicast routing should be employed.  Unfortunately, current multicast
services are inadequate for the traffic generated in CSCW environments.
In this paper, we present a CSCW-specific routing architecture that
supports QoS requirements and is both scalable and robust.  Scalability
is needed to accommodate large number of multicast groups and highly
dynamic group membership and behavior, while robustness provides
reliability and stable performance for each group during adaptation and
in presence of the other existing groups.
In our architecture, a router QoS manager, on behalf of a multicast
routing manager, negotiates with host and CSCW-specific QoS managers for
efficient resource utilization and guaranteed QoS delivery. The
multicast routing manager switches between routing trees and algorithms
as warranted by the changes in the characteristics and requirements of
the CSCW systems running at the hosts.  We present a class-based and a
partial view-based method to scalability.  We also present a centralized
and a distributed method to establishing a group's QoS multicast path
while providing robustness.  In addition to prototyping our architecture
and defining appropriate protocols and mappings between the various QoS
and router managers, we are investigating the use of the Internet
standard SNMP for information gathering.  This necessitates extending
its management information bases (MIBs) to include group objects.}

virtual circuit (VC) routing algorithms

Typically,

A request is then made
to setup a real-time VC over this path

The request is blocked if the requested resources are not available.
These VC routing algorithms are usually evaluated

we compare several VC routing schemes in terms of

a recently developed time-dependent evaluation method.

For best-effort services,
we propose a new approach 
to achieving type-of-service (TOS) classes
with adaptive next-hop routing.
We consider two TOS classes, namely,
delay-sensitive and throughput-sensitive.
As in routing protocols such as OSPF and integrated IS-IS,
each node has a different next-hop for each destination and TOS class.
Traditionally, a node has a single FCFS queue for each outgoing link,
and the next-hops are computed using link measurements.
In our approach, we attempt to isolate the two
traffic classes by using for each outgoing link a separate FCFS queue
for each TOS class; the link is shared cyclicly between its TOS queues.
The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that
traffic.  The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to
overall link utilizations.
We compare our approach with the traditional approach using 
discrete-event simulation
and Liapunov analysis (for stability of routes).
Our approach offers lower
end-to-end delay to the delay-sensitive traffic.  A related property is
that the routes for the delay-sensitive traffic are more stable, 
i.e.\ less oscillations.  
An unexpected property is that the 
overall end-to-end delay is lower,
because the throughput-sensitive traffic moves away to under-utilized routes.}

For this purpose, new algorithms and protocols have been proposed

The interaction between these three components is crucial to the

In this paper, we present an {\rm iterative discrete-time approach} that yields a

The model applies to connection-oriented networks with

It allows the investigation of various control schemes for

Preliminary results indicate that our approach is computationally much
