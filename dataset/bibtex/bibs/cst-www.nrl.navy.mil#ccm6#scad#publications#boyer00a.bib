  abstract =	 {More than a decade ago computer simulations based on Gordon-Kim potentials suggested that NaCaF$_3$ would be a ferroelectric compound if it could be formed experimentally.  Recent attempts to form thin films of NaCaF$_3$ using pulsed-laser deposition have prompted us to carry out further theoretical studies of this material.  Here we apply the self-consistent atomic deformation method to calculate electronic, structural and vibrational properties of NaCaF$_3$, and the constituent compounds NaF and CaF$_2$.}
