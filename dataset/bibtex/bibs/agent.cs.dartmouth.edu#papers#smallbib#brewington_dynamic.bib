    abstract = {Recent experiments and analysis suggest that there are about 800
million publicly-indexable web pages. However, unlike books in a traditional
library, web pages continue to change even after they are initially published
by their authors and indexed by search engines. This paper describes
preliminary data on and statistical analysis of the frequency and nature of
web page modifications. Using empirical models and a novel analytic metric of
"up-to-dateness", we estimate the rate at which web search engines must
re-index the web to remain current.},
