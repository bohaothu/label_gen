	Abstract = {Bayesian networks are a useful tool in the representation of uncertain
	knowledge. This paper proposes a new algorithm called ACO-E, to learn
	the structure of a Bayesian network. It does this by conducting a
	search through the space of equivalence classes of Bayesian networks
	using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). To this end, two novel extensions
	of traditional ACO techniques are proposed and implemented. Firstly,
	multiple types of moves are allowed. Secondly, moves can be given
	in terms of indices that are not based on construction graph nodes.
	The results of testing show that ACO-E performs better than a greedy
	search and other state-of-the-art and metaheuristic algorithms whilst
	searching in the space of equivalence classes.},
