  abstract =     "This paper presents a system and the associated
                 algorithms for repairing the boundary representation of
                 CAD models. Two types of errors are considered:
                 topological errors, i.e., aggregate errors, like
                 zero-volume parts, duplicate or missing parts,
                 inconsistent surface orientation, etc., and geometric
                 errors, i.e., numerical imprecision errors, like cracks
                 or overlaps of geometry. The output of our system
                 describes a set of clean and consistent two-manifolds
                 (possibly with boundaries) with derived adjacencies.
                 Such solid representation enables the application of a
                 variety of rendering and analysis algorithms, e.g.,
                 finite-element analysis, radiosity computation, model
                 simplification, and solid free-form fabrication. The
                 algorithms described here were originally designed to
                 correct errors in polygonal B-Reps. We also present an
                 extension for spline surfaces. Central to our system is
                 a procedure for inferring local adjacencies of edges.
                 The geometric representation of topologically-adjacent
                 edges are merged to evolve a set of two-manifolds.
                 Aggregate errors are discovered during the merging
                 step. Unfortunately, there are many ambiguous
                 situations where errors admit more than one valid
                 solution. Our system proposes an object-repairing
                 process based on a set of user-tunable heuristics. The
                 system also allows the user to override the algorithm's
                 decisions in a repair-visualization step. In essence,
                 this visualization step presents an organized and
                 intuitive way for the user to explore the space of
                 valid solutions and to select the correct one.",

   abstract = {We investigate the relationship between geometric thickness,
thickness, outerthickness, and arboricity of graphs.
In particular, we prove 
that all graphs with arboricity two or outerthickness two 
have geometric thickness $O(\log n)$.
The technique used can be extended to other classes of graphs so long
as a separator theorem exists.
For example, we can apply it to show the known bound that thickness two
graphs have geometric thickness $O(\sqrt{n})$, yielding a simple construction
in the process.

In this paper, we give polynomial-time algorithms that can take a graph $G$ with a given combinatorial embedding on a surface $\cal S$ of genus $g$ and produce a planar drawing of $G$ in $R^2$, with a bounding face defined by a polygonal schema $\cal P$ for $\cal S$.  Our drawings are planar, but they allow for multiple copies of vertices and edges on $\cal P$'s boundary, which is a common way of visualizing higher-genus graphs in the plane.  As a side note, we show that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph embedded in a genus-$g$ surface has a set of $2g$ fundamental cycles with vertex-disjoint interiors, which would be desirable from a graph-drawing perspective.},

   abstract = {We study methods for drawing
trees with perfect angular resolution, i.e.,
with angles at each vertex, $v$, equal to $2\pi/d(v)$.
We show:
1) Any unordered tree has a crossing-free straight-line drawing
with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area.
2)
There are ordered trees that require exponential area for any
crossing-free straight-line drawing having perfect angular
resolution.
3)
Any ordered tree has a crossing-free {\em Lombardi-style} drawing 
(where each edge is represented by a circular arc)
with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area.

Thus, our results explore what is achievable with straight-line drawings and 
what more is achievable with
Lombardi-style drawings, with respect to drawings of trees with
perfect angular resolution.

We show that at least six sides per polygon are necessary by constructing a class of planar graphs that cannot be represented by pentagons.
We also show that the lower bound of six sides is matched by an upper bound of six sides with a linear-time algorithm for representing any planar graph by touching hexagons.
Moreover, our algorithm produces convex polygons with edges with slopes 0, 1, -1 and with all vertices lying on an $O(n) \times O(n)$ grid.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for navigating an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) through coordinate-free Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks. The navigation algorithm proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, for each node in the sensor network we compute a hop-level distance from the target node, which indicates the number of communication hops between the node and any destination nodes. In the second phase, sets of nodes are chosen sequentially to induce potential fields that drive the UGV towards the destination. Overall, a hop-distance from the destination nodes is assigned to control main navigation direction while potential fields monitored by listeners on the UGV are employed to determine the UGV's movement. The major contribution of this paper is that our algorithm does not attempt to localize either the UGV or sensor nodes. Therefore, this navigation algorithm overcomes limitations of traditional navigation methods.},
