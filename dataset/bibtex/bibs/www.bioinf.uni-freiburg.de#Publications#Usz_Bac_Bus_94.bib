  abstract = { The natural language system DISCO is described. It
                  combines a powerful and flexible grammar development
                  system; linguistic competence for German including
                  morphology, syntax and semantics; new methods for
                  linguistic performance modeling on the basis of
                  high-level competence grammars; new methods for
                  modelling multi-agent dialogue competence; an
                  interesting sample application for appointment
                  scheduling and calendar management. },
