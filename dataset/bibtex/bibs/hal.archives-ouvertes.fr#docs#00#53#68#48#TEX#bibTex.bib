	trust and reputation in virtual societies is a recent discipline
	oriented to increase the reliability and performance of electronic
	communities. Computer science has moved from the paradigm of isolated
	machines to the paradigm of networks and distributed computing. Likewise,
	artificial intelligence is quickly moving from the paradigm of isolated
	and non-situated intelligence to the paradigm of situated, social
	and collective intelligence. The new paradigm of the so called intelligent
	or autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) together with
	the spectacular emergence of the information society technologies
	(specially reflected by the popularization of electronic commerce)
	are responsible for the increasing interest on trust and reputation
	mechanisms applied to electronic societies. This review wants to
	offer a panoramic view on current computational trust and reputation
	models.},
