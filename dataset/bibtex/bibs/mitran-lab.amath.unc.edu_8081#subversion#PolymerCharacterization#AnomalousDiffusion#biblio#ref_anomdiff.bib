  title = {Single particle tracking in systems showing anomalous diffusion:
	the role of weak ergodicity breaking},
  journal = {Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {1800-1812},
  abstract = {Anomalous diffusion has been widely observed by single particle tracking
	microscopy in complex systems such as biological cells. The resulting
	time series are usually evaluated in terms of time averages. Often
	anomalous diffusion is connected with non-ergodic behaviour. In such
	cases the time averages remain random variables and hence irreproducible.
	Here we present a detailed analysis of the time averaged mean squared
	displacement for systems governed by anomalous diffusion{,} considering
	both unconfined and restricted (corralled) motion. We discuss the
	behaviour of the time averaged mean squared displacement for two
	prominent stochastic processes{,} namely{,} continuous time random
	walks and fractional Brownian motion. We also study the distribution
	of the time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble
	mean{,} and show that this distribution preserves typical process
	characteristics even for short time series. Recently{,} velocity
	correlation functions were suggested to distinguish between these
	processes. We here present analytical expressions for the velocity
	correlation functions. The knowledge of the results presented here
	is expected to be relevant for the correct interpretation of single
	particle trajectory data in complex systems.},

  abstract = {In gene regulatory systems in which proteins bind to multiple sites
	on a DNA molecule, the characterization of chemical mechanisms and
	single-step reaction rates is difficult because many chemical species
	may exist simultaneously in a molecular ensemble. This problem was
	circumvented by detecting DNA looping by the lactose repressor protein
	of Escherichia coli in single DNA molecules. The looping was detected
	by monitoring the nanometer-scale Brownian motion of microscopic
	particles linked to the ends of individual DNA molecules. This allowed
	the determination of the rates of formation and breakdown of a protein-mediated
	DNA loop in vitro. The measurements reveal that mechanical strain
	stored in the loop does not substantially accelerate loop breakdown,
	and the measurements also show that subunit dissociation of tetrameric
	repressor is not the predominant loop breakdown pathway.},

  title = {Influence of sequence and distance between two operators on interaction
	with the lac repressor.},
  journal = {Journal of Biological Chemistry},
  year = {1987},
  volume = {262},
  pages = {14583-14591},
  number = {30},
  abstract = {The influence of additional operator or pseudooperator sequences on
	the lactose repressor-operator interaction has been investigated.
	Results of kinetic and equilibrium binding measurements suggest an
	important in vivo role for the Z-gene pseudooperator in repressor-operator
	binding; the formation of a ternary, looped complex is indicated
	by the influence of secondary operator sites on binding parameters.
	Although the binding affinity of the Z-gene pseudooperator [Oz] is
	only approximately 1/30 that observed for the primary operator [O],
	the binding affinity to DNA containing both Oz and O is significantly
	higher than either sequence alone or the sum of the two. This synergistic
	effect is enhanced further by replacing the pseudooperator sequence
	[Oz] with the primary operator sequence and results in an even stronger
	ternary complex in plasmids with duplicate primary sites. The distance
	between the center of the two primary operators affects the formation
	of a ternary complex in the linear DNA molecules. Decreased dissociation
	rate constants were observed with spacing of operator-like sequences
	between 300 and 500 base pairs (bp). Minimal influence of the second
	operator on repressor binding is observed when the operators are
	separated by approximately 4000 or approximately 100 bp. The significant
	influence of distance on kinetic and equilibrium parameters was demonstrated
	by measurements on plasmid pRW1511 [Oi-O-PL-Oz] cleaved with restriction
	enzymes either in the polylinker region to place Oi-O and Oz on opposite
	ends of the linear plasmid or outside this region to maintain the
	sites within 500 bp. These results are consistent with the formation
	of operator-repressor-pseudooperator ternary complex to generate
	a looped DNA structure.},
