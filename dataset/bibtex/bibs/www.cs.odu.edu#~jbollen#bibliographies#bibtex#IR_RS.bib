year = 2003,

pages = {169--182},
abstract = {This article describes a service for providing literature recommendations, which is part of a networked digital library project whose principal goal is to develop technologies for supporting digital services. The proposed literature recommendation system makes use of the Web usage logs of a literature digital library. The recommendation framework consists of three sequential steps: data preparation of the Web usage log, discovery of article associations, and article recommendations. We discuss several design alternatives for conducting these steps. These alternatives are evaluated using the Web logs of our university's electronic thesis and dissertation (ETD) system. The proposed literature recommendation system has been incorporated into our university's ETD system, and is currently operational},

@ARTICLE{i3r:croft1987,
title = {I3R: A new approach to the design of document retrieval systems},
author = {W. B. Croft and R. H. Thompson},
journal = {Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
volume = 38,
number = 6,
year = 1987,
pages = {389--404},
abstract={The most effective method of improving the retrieval performance of a document retrieval system is to acquire a detailed specification of the user's information need. The system described in this article, I3R, provides a number of facilities and search strategies based on this approach. The system uses a novel architecture to allow more than one system facility to be used at a given stage of a search session. Users influence the system actions by stating goals they wish to achieve, by evaluating system output, and by choosing particular facilities directly. The other main features of I3R are an emphasis on domain knowledge used for refining the model of the information need, and the provision of a browsing mechanism that allows the user to navigate through the knowledge base.},

@ARTICLE{classi:juntae1993,
title = {Classification and retrieval of knowledge on a parallel marker-passing architecture},
author = {Kim Jun-Tae and D. I.  Moldovan},
year = 1993,
pages = {753 -- 761},
volume = 5,
issue = 5,
journal = {IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering},
abstract = {Frame-based systems or semantic networks have been generally used for knowledge
     representation. In such a knowledge representation system, concepts in the
     knowledge base are organized based on the subsumption relation between concepts,
     and classification is a process of constructing a concept hierarchy according to
     the subsumption relationships. Since the classification process involves search
     and subsumption test between concepts, classification on a large knowledge base
     may become unacceptably slow, especially for real-time applications. In this
     paper, a massively parallel classification and property retrieval algorithm on a
     marker passing architecture is presented. The subsumption relation is first
     defined by using the set relationship, and the parallel classification algorithm
     is described based on that relationship. In this algorithm, subsumption test
     between two concepts is done by parallel marker passing and multiple subsumption
     tests are performed simultaneously. To investigate the performance of the
     algorithm, time complexities of sequential and parallel classification are
     compared. Simulation of the parallel classification algorithm was performed using
     the SNAP (Semantic Network Array Processor) simulator, and the influence of
     several factors on the execution time is discussed.},

@ARTICLE{bayesi:savoy1992,
author = {J. Savoy},
title = {Bayesian-inference networks and spreading activation in hypertext systems},
year = 1992,
journal = {Information Processing and Management},
volume = 28,
number = 3,
pages = {389--406},
abstract = {Browsing is the foremost method in searching through information in a hypertext or hypermedia system. However, as the number of nodes and links increases, this technique is far from satisfactory, and other search mechanisms must be provided. Classical search techniques such as menu selection hierarchies, string matching, Boolean query, etc., are already available, but they treat nodes as independent entities rather than considering the link semantics between nodes. Moreover, in order to write a query the users often encounter many problems such as how to find the appropriate terms that describe the information needs, how to correctly write a query in a language using artificial syntax, etc. This paper describes an alternative based on a Bayesian network that structures the indexing terms and stores the user's information needs. In our approach, the user does not have to write a formal query because the computation required is accomplished automatically and without any prior information or constraint. Moreover, using a constrained spreading activation, our solution uses link semantics to search relevant starting points for browsing.},
