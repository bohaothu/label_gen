  title =  "Flexible decision control in an autonomous trading agent",
  abstract = "An autonomous trading agent is a complex piece of software
 that must operate in a competitive environment and support a research
agenda. We describe the structure of decision processes in the MinneTAC
 trading agent, focusing on the use of \emph{evaluators} -- configurable,
composable modules for data analysis and prediction that are chained
together at runtime to support agent decision-making. Through a set of
examples, we show how this structure supports decisions that are based
on combinations of off-line learning and on-line observation and
analysis. Variations of MinneTAC are also able to use
\emph{selectors}, modules closely related to evaluators that allow the
agent to reconfigure itself in various ways in response to changes in
the environment or its own perceived situation in the
environment. Finally, we evaluate aspects of MinneTAC's performance
that are related to its use of evaluators, both from the standpoint of
its decision quality and its ability to support an active research
agenda.",
