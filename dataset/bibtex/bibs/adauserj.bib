                 The hierarchical library coupled with genericity
                 enables complex reusable subsystems to be developed in
                 a natural way. Public children provide a convenient

                 private children enable the implementation to be
                 decomposed without granting visibility to the client.
                 Furthermore by avoiding unnecessary dependence, the

                 unnecessary recompilation of existing clients.",

                 child units in two forms, the public children and the

                 and maintenance of software systems is fraught with
                 risks. Such problems are just one aspect of an overall
                 `software crisis'. One attempt to control the software
                 crisis is the increased use of Commercially available
                 Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software components. Because COTS
                 software components are marketed as products, there is
                 an understandable assumption that they are reliable,
                 easy to use and well behaved. With an increasing use of
                 computer systems in roles which demand high integrity
                 and reliability, the effect of COTS software components
                 on system integrity is clearly an issue. This paper
                 reports on an investigation into the suitability of
                 COTS software components for use in high integrity and
                 safety related systems. In concludes that COTS software
                 components can constitute a risk to system integrity,
                 and that such risk is not directly under the control of
                 the software developer. Measures must therefore be
                 taken to manage and control the risk of using COTS

                 Statements makes use of this to allow simulation or

                 the OOD flavor of the resulting programs, some
                 programming rules are suggested, which specify naming
                 conventions, program structure, and the use or
                 restriction of certain language features. For those
                 unfamiliar with the terminology, the final section

                 provided by the C interfaces to PCTE as specified by
                 ECMA-158. The process of implementing the interfaces
                 revealed a number of errors in the ECMA PCTE standards,
                 such as errors in ECMA-162 concerning the mapping of
                 ECMA-149 onto Ada, errors in ECMA-158 such as missing
                 operations or functions with incorrect parameter modes,
                 discrepancies between the Ada and C bindings and errors
                 in ECMA-149. The architecture of the interfaces and
                 their test harness has been designed to allow easy

                 introduction of persistence in Ada. An environment has
                 a graph structure: is composed of a set of identifiers,
                 their linked data and their types. A persistent
                 environment is a subset of an environment, defined from
                 identifiers called persistent roots, their types and
                 all data linked to them. The persistence of an
                 environment is a property that lets its subgraph remain
                 existent when run-time ends. In order to be implicit,
                 the persistence must respect the orthogonality,
                 propagation and transparency rules. This paper shows
                 how to represent a persistent environment in Ada83 and
                 Ada95 and the major problems encountered. We are
                 realizing a prototype in collaboration with
                 O2-Technology. This company supplies the O2 software as
                 the underlying system of our prototype.",

                 (quality processes), the `soft' issues (social

                 how input data is transformed into output, and then
                 essentially takes each such transformation as the basis
                 for a task. The other approach models the task

                 starts by partitioning the events in the problem into
                 threads. Each thread is a sequence of events, spaced in
                 time. The total system consists of multiple threads
                 operating concurrently. Such a thread model is minimal

                 simultaneously. A thread can often be seen as the
                 ``life'' of some entity in the problem. Essentially,
                 each thread gives rise to a task in the software.

                 Apart from their obvious significance as an aid to

                 become a torrent academics has, over the last two
                 years, become a torrent which is daily attracting
                 millions to its banks. This phenomenal growth has
                 largely been due to the development of the World Wide
                 Web (The Web) and its associated protocols, but has
                 dragged the popularity of existing e-mail and USENET

                 revolutionary approach to software development

  abstract =     "Cocktail is a compiler toolkit originally developed by
                 the ``Gesellschaft fur Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung
                 (GMD)'' at Karlsruhe in Germany. It supports all phases
                 of compiler construction by providing generators for
                 scanners, parsers, abstract syntax trees, attribute
                 evaluators, traversers of abstract syntax trees,
                 attribute evaluators, traversers of abstract syntax
                 trees, and back ends. The original toolkit generates C
                 and Modula-2 code. The authors adjusted the tools
                 (other than the code generator) to generate Ada 83 code
                 before Ada 95 became standardised and any Ada 95
                 compiler was available. The generated Ada 83 code is
                 quite similar to generated Modula-2. When the Ada 95
                 compiler, Gnat, was released, they took advantage of
                 the object-oriented features of Ada 95 for code
                 generation. This led to a major simplification of the
                 generated abstract syntax a major simplification of the
                 generated abstract syntax tree. Nevertheless, in taking
                 advantage of the possibility to define dispatching
                 operations, they observed an explosion of the generated
                 code, which led to tremendously longer compile times
                 compared to the former Ada 83 code. Finally, they
                 realised that the object-oriented features of Ada 95
                 were not sufficient to support the code generation as
                 conveniently as they had expected.",

                 the ISO/ITU Reference Model of Open Distributed
                 Processing (ODP) by the inclusion of failure
                 transparency. The Persistent Object Group Service
                 (POGS) described in this article keeps Object Group
                 Service (POGS) described in this article keeps track of
                 the state of a distributed application as far as global
                 checkpoint consistency is concerned. Application
                 objects take checkpoints of their own in a
                 non-coordinated fashion, using the POGS to detect
                 global state inconsistencies. As a consequence of
                 consulting POGS, objects take additional checkpoints
                 that would not have occurred otherwise, but which are
                 necessary to ensure global state consistency. The
                 advantage of the POGS approach lies in the fact that
                 global checkpoint consistency control is in the fact
                 that global checkpoint consistency control is separated
                 from the objects that actually do the checkpointing.
                 This is a necessary step on the way to integrating

                 background information on the so-called software crisis

                 use may be more clearly understood by those who have

                 brief general discussion of software engineering
                 environments is also provided. This is followed by a

                 users. The article concludes with some remarks
