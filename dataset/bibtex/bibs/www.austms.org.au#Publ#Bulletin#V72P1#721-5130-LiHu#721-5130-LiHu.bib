 abstract={The purpose of this paper is to introduce a nonlinear scalarisation function for solving a class of implicit vector equilibrium problems. We prove a scalarisation lemma to show the relation between the implicit vector equilibrium problem and the nonlinear scalarisation function. Then we derive some new existence theorems for solutions of implicit vector equilibrium problems, using the scalarisation lemma and the FKKM theorem. }
