                  systems sample speech at a fixed set of locations
                  relative to each frame. Modeling the temporal
                  dynamic behavior of speech is thereby complicated.
                  This work shows that by explicitly using
                  transitional information when extracting features,
                  one can better model the acoustic phonetic
                  structure, resulting in higher word level
                  recognition performance.  In this proposed approach,
                  features representing local transitional information
                  are used (a constant number of features are selected
                  at each time frame, but the features are sampled
                  near areas of greatest spectrum change within a
                  relatively long window.)  By explicitly modeling
                  transitions in this way, we can also model local
                  contextual information. Using this technique, the
                  word level error rate decreased up to 30\% on the
                  databases we tested.}}

                  frame-based systems lack the ability to
                  realistically model the dynamics of speech.
                  Segment-based systems offer the potential to
                  integrate the dynamics of speech, at least within 
                  the phoneme boundaries, although it is difficult to
                  obtain accurate phonemic segmentation in fluent 
                  speech. In this paper we propose a new approach
                  which uses syllable-like units in recognition. In
                  the proposed approach, syllable-like units are
                  defined by rules and used as the basic units 
                  of recognition.  The motivation for using
                  syllable-like units is (1) by modeling perceptually
                  more meaningful units, better modeling of speech can
                  be achieved; and (2) this method provides a better
                  framework for incorporating dynamic modeling
                  techniques into the recognition system. The proposed
                  approach has achieved the same recognition
                  performance on the task of recognizing months of the
                  year as compared to the best frame-based recognizer

                  model the dynamics of the spectrum, and are used as
                  basis for classification
                  \cite{Gold94,Afify_Gong96}. Although some
                  improvement has been achieved in this way, one would
                  hope for more substantial improvements given that
                  the independence assumption is removed.  One reason
                  why this was not achieved may be that the trajectory
                  models are based on cepstral coefficients; we show
                  that these tracks contain spurious oscillations.
                  This suggests that these trajectory features might
                  have a high within-class variance. We introduce a
                  measure of evaluating the smoothness of
                  trajectory-based features. This measure provides a
                  method of selecting the best of a set of similar
                  features.  Formant trajectories prove to be
                  significantly smoother than trajectories of mel
                  scale cepstral coefficients (MFCC) by this measure,
                  but this does not translate directly to improved

        abstract = {A number of studies have shown that a pair of
                  perceptual effective formants can be defined to
                  capture most of the phonetic information present in
                  vowels.  Various methods of computing the effective
                  formant values were proposed. However, many of them
                  depend on the accuracy of conventional formant
                  estimation.  In this work, we present a method of
                  automatically estimating perceptual effective
                  formants without estimating the actual formant
                  values and compare the results with the perceptually
                  measured effective formant values.  The preliminary
                  results show that the method is effective in
                  estimating the perceptual effective formants.
                  Classification experiments using perceptual
                  effective formants as explicit features do not
                  demonstrate any advantages.  However, using the
                  perceptual effective second formant value as input
                  to our formant estimation can help to correct up to
                  44\% of the formant tracking errors.

                  relationship, and explore the applications in
                  speaker normalization/adaptation.  We propose a new
                  method which incorporate correlations amongst
                  classes. Using principal component analysis we
                  construct a speaker space based on a speaker
                  covariance matrix obtained from the training
                  data. The speaker covariance matrix is constructed
                  in such a manner as to explicitly describe the
                  correlations between classes. By explicitly modeling
                  these correlations it is possible to adapt the model
                  or normalize the speaker's features. These
                  hypothesis are tested in segment classification
                  tasks where other variant conditions (such as
                  contextual variation) are minimized.

  abstract =     {In concatenative synthesis, 
new utterances are created by
concatenating segments (units) of recorded speech. When
the segments are extracted from a large speech corpus, a
key issue is to select segments that will sound natural in
a given phonetic context. Distance measures are often used
for this task. However, little is known about the
perceptual relevance of these measures. More insight into
the relationship between computed distances and perceptual
differences is needed to develop accurate unit selection
algorithms, and to improve the quality of the resulting
computer speech. In this paper, we develop a perceptual
test to measure subtle phonetic differences between speech
units. We use the perceptual data to evaluate several
popular distance measures. The results show that distance
measures that use frequency warping perform better than
those that do not, and minimal extra advantage is gained
by using weighted distances or delta features.                    }}
