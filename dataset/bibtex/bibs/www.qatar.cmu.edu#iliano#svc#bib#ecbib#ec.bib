Size: 326 entries

This, like any bibliography, is incomplete.  Any corrections, updates,
comments, suggestion, new entries, new URL's for papers, etc. are very much
appreciated.

Entry Names: Last name of the first author, followed by year of publication.
  If this is ambiguous, we added a descriptive suffix (e.g. lics, cade,
  tr [techreport], phd [phdthesis]).  If it's still ambiguous we added
  a single letter a, b, etc.

Field Format: All fields are delimited by double-quotes or single symbols.
  This tremendously simplifies various Emacs functions for search and display.
  Diacritical marks must therefore be enclosed in {} so that BibTeX is not
  confused about the extent of the field (e.g. "Bengt Nordstr{\"o}m").

Strings: We did not use any strings or abbreviations so that each entry is
  self-contained and may be copied to other bibliography files.

urlps = "..."  If the paper is available on the World-Wide Web in (compressed)
  POSTSCRIPT format, this is the URL to locate it.  All standard bibliography
  styles ignore this field. We have a style which uses it to produce an
  appropriate hypertext reference for later conversion to HTML.

urldvi = "..."  If the paper is available on the World-Wide Web in (compressed)
  DVI format, this is the URL to locate it.  All standard bibliography styles
  ignore this field. We have a style which uses it to produce an appropriate
  hypertext reference for later conversion to HTML.

urlnote = "..."  If the paper or some document related to it (code, HTML page,
  etc.) is available on the World-Wide Web in a format different from DVI or
  POSTSCRIPT, this is the URL to locate it.  All standard bibliography styles
  ignore this field. We have a style which uses it to produce an appropriate
  hypertext reference for later conversion to HTML. It is possible to take
  advantage of this field by means of the macro "\href{<hyperlink>}{text}"
  that will wrap <hyperlink> around <text>.

url = "..."  If the paper is available on the World-Wide Web, this is the URL
  to locate it. Whenever available, (compressed) postscript versions were
  prefered.  All standard bibliography styles ignore this field. We have a
  style which uses it to produce an appropriate hypertext reference for later
  conversion to HTML. This field is defined only for backward compatibility.

url2 = "..." This field contains alternate URLs. It is not currently used.

author = "..."  Full names as far as available in <initials> <last name>
  format. Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

title = "..." Capitalized according to standard (American?) convention.  This
  will be de-capitalized for most bibliography styles as appropriate.

booktitle = "..."  For conferences we used "Proceedings of the ..." instead of
  the way the title sometimes appears on the cover ("Automated Deduction, 11th
  International Conference, Proceedings")

month = ...  Here is recently changed to using standard abbreviations
  jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec as recommended in the
  BibTeX documentation, since it allows uniform formatting in different
  styles.

year = "..." For a conference, the year of the conference and not necessarily
  the year in which the proceedings appeared.

address = "..." For a conference or workshop, the location where it was held.
  Otherwise the address of the publisher or institution.

publisher = "..." For Springer lecture notes we used "Springer-Verlag LNCS nnn"
  instead of the cumbersome and verbose series and number fields.
