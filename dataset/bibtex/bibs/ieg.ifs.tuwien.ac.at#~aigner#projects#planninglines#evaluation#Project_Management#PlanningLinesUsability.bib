  abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a survey designed to
	 capture the 'real world' experiences of people active in project
	 management. The survey took the form of a questionnaire that was sent to
	 995 Project Managers and which achieved a response rate of 23.7%.
	 Each respondent was asked to describe a recent project and identify
	 factors that were regarded as critical to that project's outcome. The
	 extent to which the project gave rise to side-effects was explored and
	 particular emphasis was placed on the use that had been made of any of
	 the many project management methods, tools and techniques that are
	 available. Respondents were also asked to judge the effectiveness of
	 the methods, tools and techniques they had used and to report any
	 limitations or drawbacks they had encountered. The results showed
	 that most respondents used only a small number of methods, tools and
	 techniques with project management software and Gantt charts being
	 the most widely used aids. Almost half of the respondents reported
	 drawbacks to the methods, tools and techniques they had employed.
	 The criteria for judging project success most cited in the project
	 management literature (on time; to budget; and to specification) were the
	 criteria used by the respondents to judge their projects' success.
	 However, two further criteria were reported as being of particular
	 relevance. These were both concerned with the consequences of the
	 project on the organisation involve. In contrast to the finding of
	 many surveys of project success rates, a remarkably high proportion
	 (41%) of the projects reported upon here were judged to be completely
	 successful, though it should be noted that the judgements were made
	 by Project Managers who had worked on the projects being judged.},

	 The data available included the estimated task durations given by
	 experts and the subsequent actual duration times. By looking at the
	 results of the case study, the paper shows that although the majority
	 of tasks are overestimated, the mean error is an underestimate of
	 about 1%. The experts however could do even better by taking more
	 cognisance of the number of subtasks that make up a task and hence
	 use the WBS at a lower level when they are estimating durations.},

	 theme, it discusses what constitutes project complexity. It aims to be
	 inclusive rather than exclusive. Highlighted are structural complexity,
	 the number and interdependence of elements (following a paper by
	 Baccarini) and uncertainty in goals and means (following a paper by
	 Turner and Cochrane). The paper considers whether these aspects can be
	 operationalised. It gives some ideas about why project complexity
	 might be considered to be increasing, in particular the increasing
	 complexity of products being developed, and moves towards shorter
	 timescales. Finally, it notes some areas where new methods are needed.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to
	 identify the techniques which are used in the construction industry for
	 monitoring and minimising the effects of delays and to establish how these
	 techniques could make use of both the current computer technology and
	 advanced IT tools, such as knowledge-based expert systems (KBESs) and
	 visualisation techniques. First, the techniques identified are briefly
	 presented. They are as-built method, time impact analysis method,
	 and as-planned method. The paper describes a study of the software
	 packages that was carried out as a product survey, with material being
	 sourced from 33 software vendors. The software packages evaluated are
	 presented under three basic criteria: general characteristics; technical
	 features; and specialist features. General characteristics consist of
	 the name of the system and the name and address of its vendor. The
	 technical features consist of an analysis of the standard features
	 which apply to commercially available project management software.
	 Specialist features consist of an analysis of features which are
	 applicable to delay management. Hardware and software requirements
	 were reviewed to establish what is physically needed to operate the
	 software package. KBESs and visualisation techniques in the field of
	 project scheduling are also examined, with close attention being paid
	 to systems which assist in the field of delay dispute resolution.
	 Finally, the possible way forward is presented and demonstrated.},

  month = jul # {~21-22},
  abstract = {Previous research in project scheduling has been primarily focusing on providing
	 efficient solution procedures in a deterministic scheduling environment.
	 In reality, however, project manager is challenged by the conflict
	 between the dynamic and evolving nature of project information. In
	 addition, the amount of data volume and complicated relationships
	 among constraints make the understanding of scheduling situation
	 difficult. Thus managers find it hard to take correct actions dealing with
	 constantly changing constraints. In this paper, we present a research
	 effort that experiments with allowing human schedulers to work with
	 visualized schedules of large projects. Information visualization is
	 used as a strategy to visually represent large data volume and their
	 interrelationships from human problem-solving perspective. A system
	 SWAV is outlined to support managers in making scheduling decisions
	 under uncertainty environments. This paper describes the research
	 problem and proposes a framework for information visualization in
	 resource constrained project management and scheduling. },
