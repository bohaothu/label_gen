ABSTRACT:: 
      In this paper, we present the design of a mobile-agent system 
that provides a mobile user with a personalized information retrieval 
service and we describe the implementation of the infrastructure for 
such a system.  This "Personal Agent System" gathers information from 
the Internet and uses context-aware mechanisms to manage the 
information according to a mobile user's needs and preferences.  The 
user's schedule and location are the context indicators in this 
system.  These indicators are critical in ensuring that users obtain 
only the information they want, receive information in a form that is 
most useful for viewing on their mobile device, and is notified of 
new information in a minimally intrusive manner.  The system 
incorporates a rule-based learning system to enhance the 
personalization achieved by the system.
