  abstract =     {We introduce a novel worm containment strategy that integrates two complementary worm quarantine techniques.  The two techniques are linked, with one strategy employing the other as an indicator of worm infection.  A group defense mechanism shares such indicators among neighboring networks, and when enough corroboration occurs, the network engages in traffic filtering to halt infection attempts. \par We present an SSFnet-based microscopic simulation of the containment strategy against random scan worms, and explore various performance characteristics of the group defense mechanism. The simulation results help to characterize the conditions and degree to which the integrated quarantine strategy can both slow worm propagation and prevent the worm from reaching its full saturation potential.},

  abstract = {The notion of worm-killing worm has been in the folklore for some time. However the obvious fear of the killer worm itself being compromised, or of any self-propagating code set loose (possibly over administrative boundaries), has barred serious exploration on the practical aspects of the idea. In this paper, we suspend such concerns momentarily, and investigate its functional validity. This effort is motivated by recent fast worm epidemics exemplified by that of SQL slammer, which was overwhelmingly faster than traditional human-intervened response. Specifically, this paper evaluates the killer worm in terms of the prevention effect and the incurred traffic cost. Above and beyond, we consider supplementary techniques that could boost the performance and mitigate the harmful side-effects of the worm-killing worm.},

In this paper, we provide a worm propagating model. It bases on the classical epidemic Kermack-Kermack model, adopts dynamic quarantine strategy, dynamic infecting rate and removing rate. The analysis shows that model can efficiently reduce a worm's propagation speed, which can give us more precious time to defend it, and reduce the negative influence of worms. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the model.}

Ensuring system survivability has increased in importance as critical infrastructures have become heavily dependent on computers. In this paper we present a systematic method for performing survivability analysis of networked systems. An architect injects failure and intrusion events into a system model and then visualizes the effects of the injected events in the form of scenario graphs. Our method enables further global analyses, such as reliability, latency, and cost-benefit analyses, where mathematical techniques used in different domains are combined in a systematic manner. We illustrate our ideas on an abstract model of the United States Payment System.}

  ABSTRACT = {Reproducing the effects of large-scale worm attacks in a laboratory setup in a realistic and reproducible manner is an important issue for the development of worm detection and defense systems. In this paper, we describe a worm simulation model we are developing to accurately model the large-scale spread dynamics of a worm and many aspects of its detailed effects on the network. We can model slow or fast worms with realistic scan rates on realistic IP address spaces and selectively model local detailed network behavior. We show how it can be used to generate realistic input traffic for a working prototype worm detection and tracking system, the Dartmouth ICMP BCC: System/Tracking and Fusion Engine (DIB:S/TRAFEN), allowing performance evaluation of the system under realistic conditions. Thus, we can answer important design questions relating to necessary detector coverage and noise filtering without deploying and operating a full system. Our experiments indicate that the tracking algorithms currently implemented in the DIB:S/TRAFEN system could detect attacks such as Code Red v2 and Sapphire/Slammer very early, even when monitoring a quite limited portion of the address space, but more sophisticated algorithms are being constructed to reduce the risk of false positives in the presence of significant ``background noise'' scanning.},

   abstract = {An Internet worm automatically replicates itself to vulnerable systems and may infect hundreds of thousands of servers across the Internet. It is conceivable that the cyber-terrorists may use a wide-spread worm to cause major disruption to our Internet economy. While much recent research concentrates on propagation models, the defense against worms is largely an open problem. We propose a distributed anti-worm architecture (DAW) that automatically slows down or even halts the worm propagation. New defense techniques are developed based on behavioral difference between normal hosts and worm-infected hosts. Particulary, a worm-infected host has a much higher connection-failure rate when it scans the Internet with randomly selected addresses. This property allows DAW to set the worms apart from the normal hosts. We propose a temporal rate-limit algorithm and a spatial rate-limit algorithm, which makes the speed of worm propagation configurable by the parameters of the defense system. DAW is designed for an Internet service provider to provide the anti-worm service to its customers. The effectiveness of the new techniques is evaluated analytically and by simulations.},
