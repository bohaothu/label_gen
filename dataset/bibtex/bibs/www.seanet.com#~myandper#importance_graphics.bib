% This annotated bibliography contains references to articles,
% dissertations, and books about the use of importance (defined
% as an adjoint of light) in ray tracing and global illumination.
%
% The entries are divided into six categories:
%  - Theoretical results in rendering
%  - "Classic" ray tracing and distribution ray tracing
%  - Finite element methods
%  - Monte Carlo methods
%  - Volume ray tracing and participating media
%  - Overviews
% The entries are sorted chronologically within each category.
%
% Note that importance is also known as "visual importance", "potential",
% "visual potential", "value", or "potential value".
%
% Many thanks to Philippe Bekaert and Rick Speer who helped point out and
% find some of these references.

% I have been unable to find and read a few of the references; those are

              gathered of how large a fraction of the particles/photons

              other patch eventually makes it to the important region.
              (This fraction is kept in an array of size PxP, where P 
              is the number of patches in scene).  Then, in the main
