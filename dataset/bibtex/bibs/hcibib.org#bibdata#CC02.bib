%X The tutorial begins with a model of creative processes and refines it into
design principles. Participants will learn of eight ways to improve software
that supports human creative processes:
 - searching and browsing digital libraries
 - visualizing data and processes,
 - consulting with peers and mentors,
 - thinking by free associations,
 - exploring solutions: what- if tools,
 - composing artifacts and performances,
 - reviewing and replaying session histories, and
 - disseminating results.
These practical suggestions can be integrated into existing software
applications, built into web services, or serve as the framework for novel
tools. Software examples will be shown and brainstorming sessions will use
projects from participants.

%X This paper presents computational models of creative designing. It commences
with describing notions of creative designing within individuals, groups and
then societies. In doing so it moves from absolute to situated cognition
approaches. The paper then describes various computational approaches that
simulate individual create designing processes with exemplars. It then moves on
to describe situated cognition as the basis for group creative designing, which
is described through a multi-agent example. Finally, the notion of creativity
as a social behaviour is explored through simulations.

variations, and the continual evaluation of one's progress. While these
processes are frequently non-linear and iterative, modern user interfaces do
not explicitly support these practices, and instead impose a linear progression
through tasks that is a poor fit for creative pursuits. In this paper we use
data from three case studies, and draw upon Schon's theory of
reflection-in-action to illustrate specific deficiencies in current user
interfaces when used in creative endeavors. We then develop a set of guidelines
for user interface design and demonstrate their application in three designs
intended to support tasks in the domain of image manipulation.

%X As complexity theory has demonstrated in correlation with dialectical
thinking, the relationship between order and disorder does not lie simply in
their opposition. This paper proposes that generative artworks have a useful
analogical relation to the way computer systems (and systems in general)
operate and the ways in which artist-programmers might interfere with these
operations. This principle of the correlation of dialectical and generative
processes will be demonstrated by referring to the exhibition Generator (Spacex
Gallery, May-June 2002, and touring in the UK) and in particular by referring
to two works: ordure::real-time by Stuart Brisley & Adrian Ward; and
forkbomb.pl by Alex McLean. Despite the appearance of order, Generator suggests
that disorder is just below the surface and this is where change can be found
and prompted.

%X Previous research investigating sketching processes during object
visualisation and design has indicated that drawing occurs in a primarily
part-by-part manner, whereby the component structures of objects appear to
dominate the organisation of ongoing activity. Some non-part-by-part sketching
does arise, however, and appears to be closely linked with those parts of
objects that possess multiple functionality. The present experiment aimed to
provide further evidence to support the influence of functional knowledge on
sketching. Overall, the results indicate that functional understanding is an
important element of visual reasoning and sketch production in design-related
tasks. We propose that functional knowledge serves simultaneously to promote
certain aspects of representational accuracy (e.g., in terms of functional
properties of parts) whilst, paradoxically, engendering other aspects of
representational inaccuracy (e.g., in terms of the precise geometric structure
of parts).

%X In the field of art and design, there are some circumstances in which the
use of computers for drawing would seem to confer few tangible benefits; and in
situations where computers are productively employed, usage is often tightly
bound by convention. Consequently, some practitioners doubt whether the
technology has anything new to offer them. In this paper, a wide-ranging review
of contemporary, computer-mediated drawing leads the author to conclude that
such scepticism is unfounded -- that computers are not only enabling artists
and designers to extend the scope of drawing, but that they are also helping us
to understand aspects of the drawing process itself.

%X This study consists of four experimental meetings, which explore whether
functions of sketching in design activity are also valid for idea generation
meetings in design. The relevant functions of sketching found in theory are: 1)
supporting a re-interpretive cycle in the individual thinking process, 2)
supporting re-interpretation of each other's ideas in group activity, and 3)
enhancing the access to earlier ideas. The results provide some support for the
first and the third function. No support was found for the second function.

artificial creative systems. The artificial creativity approach to the
development of computational models of creative systems is described with
reference to Csikszentmihalyi's systems view of creativity. Some interesting
results from studies using an early implementation of an artificially creative
system, The Digital Clockwork Muse, are presented. The different studies show
how the artificial creativity approach supports the study of creativity from a
variety of standpoints that mirror the disciplines that study human creativity.
The use of artificial creativity allows these different studies to be
conveniently conducted on the same computational model and integrated in to a
more complete picture of the creative process.

programmer have collaboratively produced a series of interactive software
tools, including a various types of movie players, innovative 3D visualizations
and application systems. Visual interaction design is viewed as a process of
seeking for compromises between what are desirable (expressed by the designer)
and what are possible (expressed by the programmer). In the collaboration, each
of the designer and the programmer collects, represents, interacts with, and
reflects on a various types of visual representations. This paper characterizes
the visual interaction design task, presents our framework to analyze the
creative processes, and reports in detail how their creative processes have
been carried out.

elements into non-expressive elements and expressive elements and allows the
performer to directly manipulate the performance with the expressive elements.
We illustrate three prototype systems based on the concept and evaluate their
effectiveness through the systems' subjective experiments. The results of the
experiments suggest the possibility of our concept as well as effectiveness. In
addition, we discuss an essential feature of musical performance and the role
of a facilitating system for musical performance.

%X In this paper, we describe two experiments for examining how designers think
with drawings in order to generate visual images of the design object. In the
first experiment, we assigned to subjects the task of designing a chair, which
evokes a 'sad image'. An assumption of our work, based on previous experiments,
is that an abstract keyword is more difficult to apply to a visual image of the
design than using a concrete keyword. From the results of this experiment,
several different paths in the thinking process were found and we concluded
that the creative thinking process needs a high abstract level in transforming
a goal description to its corresponding visual image. In the second experiment,
the aim was to understand more details of the creative thinking process. We
monitored the subjects' drawing process by using video cameras from two
different angles. In this experiment, we adopted a method whereby the subjects
verbalized about their actions during the design process. Based up the results
of this experiment, we found several different search modes in the subjects'
thinking processes. Finally, we propose a general thinking path model of
creative design.

%* (c) Copyright 2002 ACM
%W http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/581710.581730
%X This paper proposes an explanation of the cognitive change that occurs as
the creative process proceeds. During the initial, intuitive phase, each
thought activates, and potentially retrieves information from, a large region
containing many memory locations. Because of the distributed,
content-addressable structure of memory, the diverse contents of these many
locations merge to generate the next thought. Novel associations often result.
As one focuses on an idea, the region searched and retrieved from narrows, such
that the next thought is the product of fewer memory locations. This enables a
shift from association-based to causation-based thinking, which facilitates the
fine-tuning and manifestation of the creative work.

%X Collaborative projects in art and technology provide an opportunity to
investigate how co-creativity takes place. This paper describes some of the
characteristics of collaborative work that were identified from empirical
evidence captured during the COSTART project [4]. We examine the way the
information was analyzed and the results of that exercise. An approach to
modeling co-creativity based on case study data is described and three example
models proposed. This work enabled us to consider the implications of the
different models for supporting creativity and their relationship to success
factors. We conclude that the provision of 'support' for co-creativity in art
and technology needs to include ongoing collaborative relationships that are
fostered by organizations dedicated to the co-evolution of both art and new
technology.

%X Most current creativity support systems support short-term temporal thinking
that is separate from users' daily activities. In this paper, we propose a
system that supports long-term idea-generation in daily life. The system
consists of two subsystems: a management system for problems and ideas called
IdeaManager; and a personal information storage system called iBox. When
information is registered in iBox, it searches related problems and ideas in
IdeaManager and then presents the results. Then users try to generate or
enhance ideas for automatically retrieved problems or ideas using registered
information as the hint. Our target users are those who must generate novel
ideas and acquire relevant information for a certain problem or theme, such as
researchers or planners. To evaluate and enhance our system, we carried out a
six-week experiment. During this period, subjects managed their problems and
ideas in their daily activities. In the experiment, several methods of
searching for related problems and ideas in IdeaManager were compared. Based on
the results, we give some proposals for future systems.

facility, a workflow tracking mechanism through which previous workspace states
can be examined and restored, and the ability to create a variety of

%X In the field of design and creativity support, "externalization of mental
space" has been recognized as an important challenge. In this paper, we tackle
this challenge on musical composition, which is one of the important human
creative activities. In our research, we focus on the analysis of cognitive
processes in musical composition. That is, we analyze what the cognitive
processes in musical composition are like and how the process is affected when
a representation of information is changed. For this research, we propose a
musical composition supporting system named "MACSS (MAcroscopic Composition
Supporting System)" which offers a spatial representation of music to a
composer to support his/her composition process. Comparing with ordinary
musical editors, which give chronological (1-dimensional, score-metaphored)
representation, this system provides a macroscopic view by locating phrases on
the 2-dimensional space. We have investigated how the cognitive process changes
when the spatial representation is introduced, i.e., the representation of
information is changed. Moreover, we have analyzed the observed change
microscopically, especially the processes of "mental fixation" and "mental
leap". We have found how the spatial representation triggers mental leap
escaping from mental fixation in musical composition.

these two systems, followed by concluding remarks whereby we suggest that
adaptive imitation games may foster even more effective correspondence between
artificial life models and creative processes.

investigated, through a cognitive psychological experiment and its protocol
analysis, experts' and novices' interactive process between the mental
operation by which participants considered their ideas and the external
operations by which they actually produced physical objects in creative
activity. In our experiment, the participants were required to build a creative
robot with LEGO Mindstorms. The experimental results showed that the experts
could create work that fulfilled both high originality and practicality
simultaneously. Moreover, the following four points were confirmed as
characteristics of the experts' creative process: (1) the experts globally
considered their initial ideas, (2) the experts reconstructed their ideas by
considering comprehensively the relationship among the elements constructing
their plans, (3) the experts reconstructed their ideas more actively, and (4)
the experts were able to embody successfully their ideas by focusing on various
aspects of important viewpoints.

%X To contribute to HCI investigation and interface design that develops
interactive systems for creative solutions, I attempt to formulate a model of
the human capability to combine familiar objects or concepts in an unusual way.
Important components of the creative process are feature association,
combination, abstraction, selection, integration, and adaptation to establish
an optimal fit between two or more semantically remote entities. In the act of
creating, the goal is to show (a quantity of) similarity where no one saw it
before. The function is knowledge acquisition (also emotionally), to find all
the available possibilities in a given situation, (showing how) to find new
solutions, new ways to get what you want. The effect of a creation may be
surprise as a function of the tension between similarity and dissimilarity
between objects and/or concepts. Depending on individual tolerance levels, the
balance between similarity and dissimilarity may be satisfying or pleasing.
Consequences for representations design are discussed.

%X Existing CHI interaction models are focused on understanding the needs of
users. They begin with user tasks and user feedback. While the involvement of
users is critical for human computer interaction development, so is the
imagination the artist-scientist-designer-developer. We constitute a legitimate
source of impetus in the definition and development of interactive artifacts,
as well as functioning as interpreters, measurers, and respondents. The
development of interactivity is a fundamentally creative process. This paper
distills a creative model for the development of interactivity as a residue of
the CollageMachine development experience. Both the model and the artifact are
components that contribute to the integrated approach of interface ecology.
