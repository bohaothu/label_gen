elegant solution to the problem of incorporating unlabeled data into a Gaussian 
process (GP) classification model.  In this paper, we show how this binary 
likelihood model can be generalised to the multi-class setting through the use 
of the multinomial probit GP classifier.  We present a Gibbs sampling scheme for 
sampling the GP parameters and also derive a more efficient variational updating 
scheme.  We find that the performance improvement is roughly consistent with 
that observed in binary classification and that there is no significant 
performance difference between the Gibbs sampling and variational schemes.},Publisher =
