	Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the polarization on the achievable
throughput and the probability of successful transmission in the cellular
network architectures. A channel link model is proposed in the specific
case of Rayleigh-faded communication links. More precisely, we propose a
closed-form expression for the link probability of success with respect to
the topology of the deployment and the channel characteristics. 

The per-node throughput is analyzed and the gain achieved by using two
different polarization modes is discussed. It turns out that, for uniform
random placement of the nodes in a scenario where two cellular networks are
deployed on a same location, the diversity of polarization ensures that the
networks can be operate as if they were disjoint.},

@inproceedings{Dricot:2009hl,
	Abstract = {Traditional schemes for network architectures rely on \textit{centralized}
concepts. In this case,  all packets over the network, or even inside a
single cell, must be routed by a \textit{base-station}, which plays as the
intermediate between the user and the backbone network. Examples include
cellular mobile phones technologies (GSM/GPRS/EDGE) or Wi-Fi systems for
laptop computers (IEEE 802.11a/b/g networks). 

More recently, new alternative ways to exchange data in wireless networks
have emerged. 
These new solutions are based on the use of autonomous mobile devices
connected to each other directly and without the need for pre-existing
configuration parameters or centralized infrastructures. Therefore,
multi-hop relaying and routing play an important role in the operation of
such networks and many routing algorithms focus on finding the best route,
according to a proper cost function such as the shortest-path or the
maximum battery-life routing. 

Meanwhile, these approachs do not consider the cross-layer issues
suggested in several other papers which clearly highlight the impact that
physical layer has on routing efficiency.},
