	Abstract = {Hybridization of intelligent systems is a promising research field of modern artificial/computational intelligence concerned with the development of the next generation of intelligent systems. A fundamental stimulus to the investigations of Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS) is the awareness in the academic communities that combined approaches will be necessary if the remaining tough problems in artificial/computational intelligence are to be solved. Recently, hybrid intelligent systems are getting popular due to their capabilities in handling several real world complexities involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness. Current research interests in this field focus on integration of the different soft computing paradigms like fuzzy logic, neurocomputation, evolutionary computation, probabilistic computing and their interactions with hard computing techniques, intelligent agents, machine learning, other intelligent computing frameworks and so on. The phenomenal growth of hybrid intelligent systems and related topics has created the need for this International conference as a venue to present the latest research. HIS'02 builds on the success of last year's.},

	Abstract = {Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational technique for revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of measurements or signals. ICA assumes a statistical model whereby the observed multivariate data, typically given as a large database of samples, are assumed to be linear or nonlinear mixtures of some unknown latent variables. The mixing coefficients are also unknown.  The latent variables are non gaussian and mutually independent, and they are called the independent components of the observed data.  By ICA, these independent components, also called sources or factors, can be found. Thus ICA can be seen as an extension to Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis. ICA is a much richer technique, however, capable of finding the sources when these classical methods fail completely. 
In many cases, the measurements are given as a set of parallel signals or time series. Typical examples are mixtures of simultaneous sounds or human voices that have been picked up by several microphones, brain signal measurements from multiple EEG sensors, several radio signals arriving at a portable phone, or multiple parallel time series obtained from some industrial process. The term blind source separation is used to characterize this problem.
The lecture will first cover the basic idea of demixing in the case of a linear mixing model and then take a look at the recent nonlinear demixing approaches.
Although ICA was originally developed for digital signal processing applications, it has recently been found that it may be a powerful tool for analyzing text document data as well, if the documents are presented in a suitable numerical form. A case study on analyzing dynamically evolving text is covered in the talk.}}

	Abstract = {When Zadeh first introduced the notion of a fuzzy set, it was laughed away by the ruling caste of 'serious' mathematicians and logicians.  Driven by ignorance, the main reason for it was probably strategic: as fuzzy set theory touches upon the very building block of mathematics, it might be better to deny it than to risk being taken out of business.  Even the ample practical realizations had no effect on them.
Unfortunately, the fuzzy mathematics community has offered plenty of stones to be thrown at them.  One by one, the core mathematical theories were subjected to fuzzification: topology, algebra, analysis, etc.  The literature has witnessed various waves of these activities, not in the least the 'replace min by a triangular norm' wave.  The majority of these works are sheer mathematical exercises and have no reason to appeal to the established mathematical community.
Indeed, instead of trying to generalize things on a micro-level, the potential interest of fuzzy set theory lies on the macro-level, offering a global view and additional insight into existing mathematical theories.  Fortunately, more and more works of this kind are appearing, and are, finally, attracting the interest of non-fuzzy mathematicians.  A nice work of the latter kind is the far-reaching monograph "Metamathematics of fuzzy logic" by Hajek on fuzzy logic in "narrow sense", making its way into the established community of many-valued logicians.  Another example is the book "Triangular norms" of Klement, Mesiar and Pap, dealing with the omnipresent concept of a triangular norm, originating from the theory of probabilistic metric spaces, but elegantly further explored by this trio of fine 'fuzzy' mathematicians.
The purpose of this lecture is not to bore the listeners with a historic account of the contributions that fuzzy set theorists did make to the development of mathematics, but to offer the audience a digestible selection of mathematical appetizers illustrating what fuzzy set theory has to offer.  One thing is clear: it takes a multi-skilled mathematician to succeed.  Without the purpose of being pretentious, the author will discuss a number of developments he was privileged to be involved in.  Possible topics include uninorms (ranging from semi-group aspects to applications in expert systems), fuzzy preference structures (ranging from functional equations to applications in decision support systems) and similarity measures (ranging from inequalities in quantum-mechanics to applications in numerical taxonomy).}}

	Abstract = { A new field of robotics is emerging. Robots are today moving towards applications beyond the structured environment of a manufacturing plant. They are making their way into the everyday world that people inhabit.  The successful introduction of robotics into human environments will rely on the development of competent and practical systems that are dependable, safe, and easy to use. The discussion focuses on models, strategies, and algorithms associated with the autonomous behaviours needed for robots to work, assist, and cooperate with humans. In addition to the new capabilities they bring to the physical robot, these models and algorithms and more generally the body of developments in robotics is having a significant impact on the virtual world.  Haptic interaction with an accurate dynamic simulation provides unique insights into the real-world behaviors of physical systems.  The potential applications of this emerging technology include virtual prototyping, animation, surgery, robotics, cooperative design, and education among many others.  Haptics is one area where the computational requirement associated with the resolution in real-time of the dynamics and contact forces of the virtual environment is particularly challenging.  The presentation describes various methodologies and algorithms that address the computational challenges associated with interactive simulations involving multiple contacts and impacts with complex human-like structures.}}

On a range of benchmarks the evolved multiple classifier system is better than all of its components.  Indeed its Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) are better than [Scott et al., 1998]s "Maximum Realisable Receiver Operating Characteristics" MRROC (convex hull)
An important component in the drug discovery is testing potential drugs for activity with P450 cell membrane molecules.  Our technique has been used in a blind trial where artificial neural networks are trained by Clementine on P450 pharmaceutical data. Using just the trained networks, GP automatically evolves a composite classifier. Recent experiments with boosting the networks will be compared with genetic programming.}}

We present an interactive approach, based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy database queries, which makes it possible to implement such summaries.  We show how fuzzy queries are related to linguistic summaries, and show that one can introduce a hierarchy of prototype forms (proto forms), or abstract summaries in the sense of latest Zadeh's ideas meant mainly for increasing deduction capabilities of search engines.  For illustration we show an implementation for a sales database in a computer retailer, employing some type of a proto form of a linguistic summary. (see also paper in this book) }}

	Abstract = {Information security (INFOSEC) is an issue of global concern. As the Internet is bringing great convenience and benefits to the modern society, the rapidly increasing connectivity and accessibility to the Internet is also posing a serious threat to security and privacy, to individuals, organizations, and nations alike. Finding effective ways to detect, prevent, and respond to intrusions and hacker attacks of networked computers and information systems, therefore, has become a timely research topic.
	In this talk, I will present the application of soft computing methods in information security. Since intrusions and malicious attacks are commonly detected by inspecting the system audit data, soft computing methods can be utilized in various ways for analyzing, organizing, and mining the tremendous amount of audit data generated by computer systems.
	I will also describe several of our ongoing INFOSEC research projects that use soft computing methods: intrusion detection using Support Vector Machines(SVMs); feature ranking and selection for intrusion detection; and steganalysis (stegonagraphy detection). Our research demonstrates the soft computing paradigms tremendous potential for problem solving in information security, e.g., SVMs are ideal learning machines for intrusion detection, and neural networks and fuzzy systems have various applications in INFOSEC problems as well.}}

	Abstract = {In 1987, fuzzy control was successfully applied in industrial plants in Japan. In the late eighties, neuro-control was used for robot arms including the robot arm of the space shuttle, chemical processes, continuous production of high- quality parts, and aerospace applications) in the U.S.A.. In 1991, the BISC (Berkley Initiative in Soft Computing) was established as an ILP (industrial liaison program), with Dr. Zadeh, as its director. Since the establishment of BISC, researchers through the world have been studying soft computing, i.e.,  the fusion of fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and evolutionary computation (EC). The term computational intelligence as defined by Dr. L. A. Zadeh, is the combination of soft computing and numerical processing. First this term was used in 1990 by the IEEE Neural Networks Council. Three IEEE International Workshop on Soft Computing in Industry has been held in Muroran, Japan in 1993, 1996, and 1999,  with Dr. Zadeh as plenary speaker each time . The first workshop put emphasis on the fusion of neural networks and fuzzy logic. In the second workshop, evolutionary computation ,chaotic computing, and immune networks were discussed. The third workshop focused on cognitive distributed artificial intelligence (human-like information processing  and reactive distributed artificial intelligence (bioinformatic information processing) . The IEEE international workshops on applications of industries were held in Finland and the U.S.A. in 1999 and 2001, respectively. The 1st trough 5th On-line World Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications were held every year. State-of ?the-art industrial applications were presented at those conferences. There were a large number of application papers of soft computing in the related IEEE Transactions and other related journals for the past ten years.
	Soft Computing (SC) is an evolving collection of methodologies, which aims to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve robustness, tractability, and low total cost. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy Logic (FL), Neural Networks (NN), and Evolutionary Computation (EC) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and EC should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. Soft computing (SC) has been theoretically developed for the past decade, since Dr. L. A. Zadeh proposed the concept in the early 1990s. Later, chaos computing and immune networks were added  to explain so-called complex systems, cognitive distributed artificial intelligence, and reactive distributed artificial intelligence. . Evolutionary computation has been developed and modified for application to optimization for large-scale and complex systems. Data mining technology, which has been developed since the late 80s using heterogeneous technologies, including soft computing methods based on pattern  recognition techniques, has been recently used for interpreting and understanding important associations for large-scale and complex systems hidden in large database The term intelligence has been frequently used by Dr. Zadeh's human like information processing(cognitive artificial intelligence) and by Dr. Fogel's bioinformatic information processing(reactive artificial intelligence): i.e. intelligent behavior is able to result from an ability to predict the environment coupled with the selection of an algorithm that permits the translation of each prediction into a suitable response. Intelligent information processing is considered to be emergent, self-organizing (adaptive) and interactive among human beings, environment and artificial objects with an  advanced learning method using a combination of perception and motion. Soft computing plays an important role in intelligent information processing. 
	Soft computing is causing a paradigm shift (breakthrough) in engineering and science fields since soft computing can solve problems that have not been able to be solved by traditional analytic methods(tractability). In addition , SC yields rich knowledge representation (symbol and pattern), flexible knowledge acquisition (by machine learning from data and by interviewing experts), and flexible knowledge processing (inference by interfacing between symbolic and pattern knowledge), which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost(high machine IQ and low cost). Tractability, high machine IQ and low cost enable industrial systems to be innovative. 
	Soft computing is considered to create new computational capabilities combining or fusing each soft computing methodology (hybrid system). This talk starts with the history of neuro-fuzzy control. Then, I will present the features of neuro-fuzzy hybrid systems. Lastly, I will introduce our developed novel fast and accurate fuzzy neural network for control and diagnosis of nonlinear dynamic systems using general parameter learning and adaptation.}}

	Abstract = { From the many attempts to produce a conceptual framework for the organization of living systems, the notions of (M R) systems and Autopoiesis stand out for their rigor, their presupposition of the circularity of metabolism, and the new epistemologies that they imply.  From their inceptions, these two notions have been essentially disconnected because each has defined its own language and tools.  Here we demonstrate the existence of a deep conceptual link between (M R) systems and Autopoietic systems.  This relationship permits us to posit that Autopoietic systems, which have been advanced as capturing the central aspects of living systems, are a subset of (M,R) systems. This result, in conjunction with previous theorems proved by Rosen, can be used to outline a demonstration that the operation of Autopoietic systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines.  This demonstration is rather delicate as it involves four different aspects: a) \"the central theorem of Rosen\" involving the stability of metabolic networks with circular organization, b) the use of the theory of Categories to model systems with circular organization, c) a preliminary proof that such systems can not be computable \"a la Turing\" and d) an identification between Autopoietic and (M R) systems.  This work will analyze with detail the mathematics behind Rosen central theorem as well as the implications for computing of the intrinsic anticipatory behavior of Autopoietic systems. The unfamiliar computing aspects of Autopoietic system arise from the internal reference frame of the controller.  The control is done by the logic of the maintenance of circular organization in the presence of structural coupling. (see also paper in this book)}}

	Abstract = {A neural network architecture is introduced for the real-time learning of input sequences using external performance feedback. The target problem domain suggests the use of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks [1] that are able to function in a robust and fast real-time adaptive active network environment, where user requests and new proxylets (services) are constantly being introduced over time [2,3]. The architecture learns, self-organises and self-stabilises in response to the user requests and maps the requests according to the types of proxylets available. However, the ART1 architecture and the original algorithm are modified to incorporate an external feedback mechanism whereby the performance of the system is fed into the network periodically. This modification, namely the Isnap-driftI algorithm, uses fast convergent, minimalist learning (snap) when the overall network performance has been poor and slow learning (drift towards user request input patterns) when the performance has been good. A key concern of the research is to devise a mechanism that effectively searches for alternative solutions to the ones that have already been tried, guided simultaneously by the input data (bottom-up information) and the performance feedback (top-down information). Preliminary simulations evaluate the two-tiered architecture using a simple operating environment consisting of simulated training and test data. }}

The proposed system employs a case-based reasoning model to wrap a growing cell structures network, a radial basis function network and a set of Sugeno fuzzy models to provide an accurate prediction. Each of these techniques is used in a different stage of the reasoning cycle of the case-based reasoning system to retrieve, to adapt and to review the proposed solution to the problem.

Because of its simplicity in theory and implementation, it is often used for analysis in various disciplines. However, because of its linearity, PCA is not always suitable, and has redundancy in expressing data. To overcome this problem, some methods of nonlinear PCA have been proposed. However, most of the methods have drawbacks, such that the number of principal components must be predetermined, and also the order of the generated principal components is not explicitly given. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical neural network model composed of a number of multi-layered perceptrons to perform nonlinear PCA that preserves the order of the principal components. Moreover, our method does not need to know the number of the principal components in advance. The effectiveness of the proposed model will be shown through experiments. }}

Our model was constructed through neural system identification (Zipser, 1993) and a fully recurrent neural network model was optimized to perform a rule-guided delayed task. In the model's hidden layer, rule-selective units as in Wallis et al.(2001) were found, and an examination of connection weights substantiated that rule-selective neurons maintain encoded rule information and indirectly contributed to rule-guided responses. The simulation results predict functional interactions among neurons exhibiting various task-related activities. }}

	Abstract = {In Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)/ Data Mining literature, IinterestingnessI measures are used to rank rules according to the IinterestI a particular rule is expected to evoke in a user. In this paper, we introduce an aspect of interestingness called Iitem-relatednessI to determine interestingness of item-pairs occurring in association rules. In actuality, association rules that contain weakly-related item-pairs are the ones that are interesting. We elucidate and quantify three different types of item-relatedness. Relationships corresponding to item-relatedness proposed by us are shown to be captured by paths in a Ifuzzy taxonomyI (an extension of the concept hierarchy tree). We then combine these measures of item-relatedness to arrive at a total-relatedness measure. This total relatedness measure appropriately combines each aspect of relatedness-relationships among items. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of this total measure on a sample taxonomy. We analyse the results and explain intuitive correspondences between numerical results and reality. }}

These differences, strictly interconnected, cause a lot of problems when there is a necessity to port a whole set of fuzzy rules from one system to another. To solve this portability issue, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) formed a specific committee to propose a standard format to represent fuzzy systems, named Fuzzy Control Language (FCL). Subsequently, in another context, another research group have proposed a standardized system to represent Evolutionary Computation Systems using an XML-based grammar. Based on this idea, strengthened by growing Internet fame, we propose a mapping of the FCL grammar and capabilities in a standardized XML format, showing at the same time, a bunch of extensions that can further enhance FCL language expressive power. }}

The interplay between genotype (chromosomes) and phenotype (expression trees) is made possible by the structural and functional organization of the linear chromosomes. This organization allows the unconstrained operation of important genetic operators such as mutation, transposition, and recombination. Although simple, the genotype/phenotype system of gene expression programming can provide some insights into natural evolutionary processes. In this work the question of the initial diversity in evolving populations of computer programs is addressed by analyzing populations undergoing either mutation or recombination. The results presented here show that populations undergoing mutation recover practically undisturbed from evolutionary bottlenecks whereas populations undergoing recombination alone depend considerably on the size of the founder population and are unable to evolve efficiently if subjected to really tight bottlenecks. }}

First we describe our multi-objective genetic local search (MOGLS) algorithm, which is the hybridization of a simple EMO algorithm with local search. Next we discuss some implementation issues of local search in our MOGLS algorithm such as the choice of initial (i.e., starting) solutions for local search and a termination condition of local search. Then we implement hybrid EMO algorithms using well-known EMO algorithms: SPEA and NSGA-II. Finally we compare those EMO algorithms with their hybrid versions through computational experiments. Experimental results show that the hybridization with local search can improve the search ability of the EMO algorithms when local search is appropriately implemented in their hybrid versions. }}

We introduce a GA where a permutation is used to encode the secondary structure of RNA molecules. We discuss initial results on RNA sequences of lengths 76 and 785 nucleotides and present several improvements to the algorithm. We show that with a higher selection intensity through the Keep-Best Reproduction operator and 1-elitism the best results (i.e. the structures with the lowest free energy) are achieved. }}

Based on insights gained from biology, we suggest a simple form of Elitist selection, termed {\em Group Elitism}, which has a strong and robust positive effect on the performance of noisy algorithms. We discuss the notion of Elitism as an extreme form of {\em Fitness-Associated Variation}, and show that Group Elitism efficiently deals with the harmful effects of evaluation noise without compromising its benefits in evading local adaptive maxima. }}

This work presents a training method that uses the data set in an incremental manner such that it is possible to determine when the behavior displayed by the LM during the learning stage truthfully represents its future behavior when confronted by unseen data samples. The method uses the set of samples in an efficient way, which allows discarding all those samples not really needed for the training process. The new training procedure, which will be called ``Incremental Training Algorithm'', is based on a theoretical result that is proven using recent developments in statistical learning theory. A key aspect of this analysis involves identification of three distinct stages through which the learning process normally proceeds, which in turn can be translated into a systematic procedure for determining the generalization level achieved during training. It must be emphasized that the presented algorithm is general and independent of the architecture of the LM and the specific training algorithm used. Hence it is applicable to a broad class of supervised learning problems and not restricted to the example presented in this work. }}

	Abstract = {The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a very difficult and practically relevant combinatorial optimization problem which has attracted much research effort. Local search (LS) moves can be quickly evaluated on the QAP, and hence favoured methods tend to be hybrids of global optimization schemes and LS. Here we introduce the {\em multiobjective} QAP (mQAP) where $m \geq 2$ distinct QAPs must be minimized simultaneuously over the same permutation space, and hence we require a set of solutions approximating the Pareto front (PF). We argue that the best way to organise a hybrid LS for the mQAP will depend on details of the multiobjective fitness landscape. By using various techniques and measures to probe the landscapes of mQAPs, we attempt to find evidence for the relative ease with which the following can be done by LS: approach the PF from a random initial solution, or search along or close to the PF itself. On the basis of such explorations, we hope to design an appropriate hybrid LS for this problem. The paper contributes a number of landscape measurement methods that we believe are generally appropriate for multiobjective combinatorial optimization. }}

	Abstract = {Classifier systems are machine learning ruleset-discovery systems; the XCS classifier system has been found in recent years to compete well with rival machine learning systems on difficult benchmarks, and is now being intensively researched for real world applications. A problem common to all such systems is their accuracy on unseen data, and hence their real-world performance. This is not surprising, and standard methods such as cross-validation and early-stopping are commonly used in training to assess likely performance on unseen data. However, an additional and related issue is the confidence we can have in a prediction as a function of our confidence in the inputs. Predictions which lay on the boundary between two differing outcomes (e.g. the system may say ImalignantI in response to an input pattern, but a slight difference in that pattern might cause it to respond IbenignI) must somehow be identified and questioned on their validity. We describe a technique which takes a ruleset learned by XCS (or another system), and provides highly useful confidence information when predictions are made with that ruleset. Further, we describe a measure which enables confidence-in-prediction behaviour to be assessed for different rulesets. Using this measure, called zero tolerance performance, we find that small, succinct and general rulesets produce better confidence-in-prediction performance. This mitigates against direct use of classifier system learned rulesets, since these tend to be very large, but it validates recent research which is successfully applying post-processing techniques which quickly reduce such a ruleset to a much smaller but equally accurate one. Development and testing is done on the standard Wisconsin Breast Cancer database. }}

Latent semantic indexing (LSI), which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), and probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) have already been proposed to overcome problems in document indexing, but critical problems remain. In contrast to LSI and PLSI, our proposed method uses a more meaningful, robust statistical model based on factor analysis and information theory. As a result, this model can solve the remaining critical problems in LSI and PLSI. Experimental results with a test collection showed that our method is superior to LSI and PLSI from the viewpoints of information retrieval and classification. We also propose a new term weighting method based on entropy. }}

	Abstract = {Support vector machines (SVM) was originally designed for regression and binary classification. It promises to give good generalization and has been applied to various tasks. The basic idea behind SVM is to do the classification through solving a nonlinear(quadratic) programming. In this paper, we concentrate on adaptive support vector classification problems. Since there are many parameters in the kernel functions of SVM, tuning the smooth parameters can certainly improve the performance of classification. The general literature of SVM has not discussed in detail the subject of tuning the various user defined parameters. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between maximum margin and classification errors and estimate the best kernel parameters. Toy and real life data are used in the experiments }}

	Abstract = {Intrusion detection is a critical component of secure information systems. This paper addresses the issue of identifying important input features in building an intrusion detection system (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection may result. Feature ranking and selection, therefore, is an important issue in intrusion detection. Since support vector machines (SVMs) tend to scale better and run faster than neural networks with higher accuracy for intrusion detection, we apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data. Important features for each of the 5 classes of intrusion patterns in the DARPA data are identified. It is shown that SVM-based IDS using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance. An IDS for class-specific detection based on five SVMs is proposed. }}

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new classifier derived from a variant of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) rule. This classification scheme, which we call kNN Learning Vector Classifier (kNN-LVC), has a similar architecture to that of Learning Vector Quantizers (LVQs). In fact, both methods place in the observation space a set of centroids or prototypes with a limited area of influence; however, our approach finds optimal prototypes by optimizing a new discriminant function that considers the k nearest prototypes to a sample. Among kNN-LVC characteristics are its localized nature, easy training and interpretation, small storage requirements, and a very competitive performance. The proposed technique is benchmarked against other classifiers as kNN and LVQ. Experiments show good generalization capabilities and efficacy of our approach on datasets with enough number of data in relation to dimensionality. }}

	Abstract = {Feature extraction is an important task for data mining applications, in particular for classification. On one hand it leads to a better understanding of the relations between features and classification results. On the other hand it helps to perform fast classifications with a reduced number of features. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the mostly used techniques for linear feature extraction. Recently neural networks have been proposed for non-linear feature extraction out-performing PCA in many cases like non-linear principal component analysis (NLPCA). The mentioned approaches have in common an error reduction when reproducing the initial feature space from the reduced space. We present a new approach which tries instead conserving the patterns distribution from the original space to the reduced space. This model called dNN (Distance Neural Network) pro-vides very good results for several cases outperforming PCA and shows to be com-petitive with the best non-linear techniques for feature extraction. }}

	Abstract = {This paper presents a contribution to the theory of optimal feature-subset selection associated with pattern recognition or classification tasks. It extends the theory of Mutual Information (MI) to deal with the difficulties introduced by feature interaction. The essential contribution is to permit MI calculations between sets of features and the target class such that all interactions between the features in the chosen set are taken into account in the MI value produced. In order to accomplish this extension from traditionally pairwise (i.e., feature-feature or feature-class) MI computation we have developed algorithms to transform any continuous-valued feature into a discrete-valued one, and to transform any set of discrete-valued features into a `composite' feature suitable for the necessary MI calculations. We have built these algorithms into classical forwards and backwards sequential search procedures, and these provide an initial survey of the interactions present among features within a given set of feature vectors. If no significant feature interaction is present then the features have effectively been ranked, and the optimal subset selection problem has been solved. When feature interactions are present, the initial survey will indicate where and what interactions are present and will suggest, if necessary, further probes with the extended MI algorithm to reveal their full nature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended MI algorithm on a number of examples that have been presented as problematic in the literature, especially in the feature-selection literature that has employed MI theory . }}

	Abstract = {Voice transmission plays a crucial role in many applications such as e.g. telecommunications. An alternative to increase the efficiency of voice transmission is using a codification that permits compressing the signal to be transmitted. Such a compression assumes data sets with basic forms, whose combination produce the voice signal. Generally this data set is organized around an array of data, known as codebook. The codebook is constructed by a vectorial quantization process, which consists of looking for what vectors are most representatives, within a set. Next a structure of data is created that stores the vectors, also known as centers. Then, given a codebook with the most representative basic forms, the problem is translated to take a piece of voice, look for its position and transmit it. Since the receiver will have the same structure of data the voice will be able to be synthesized. The problem consists in the search in the codebook, which can be expensive in terms of computation and other resources, which perform operation in real time, characteristic that in some services is fundamental, for example in telecommunication. In this work we present a new algorithm to construct and to cross codebooks by using a data mining tool such as self organizing maps over a database of humans voices. This algorithm produces a codebook structure within a relation of proximity between its elements, reducing the problem to a local search, which allows to decrease compression time and to reduce the rate of transmitted bits. }}

The main purpose of those algorithms is to gather as many relevant web pages as possible, and most of them only show the approaches of the first crawling. However, no one has ever mentioned some important questions, such as how the crawler does during the next crawlings, does the crawling process can be done in an incremental way, how to track the change of web pages, etc. In this paper, we present an algorithm that covers the detail of both the first and the consecutive crawlings. For efficient result of the next crawling, we keep the log of previous crawling to build some knowledge bases: starting URLs, topic keywords and URL prediction. These knowledge bases are used to build the experience of the topic-specific web crawler to produce better result for the next crawling. }}

This paper presents the theoretical basis for a spatial searching of Web documents. It reviews spatial reasoning concepts associated with spatial relations and describes a model for organizing and deriving spatial relations based on a hierarchical structure of the space, that is, a conceptual model of the space in terms of connected regions. Using a study case, this work presents guidelines for how this model can be used for extending current searching techniques of Web documents to answer queries that are constrained by spatial relations. }}

In addition, while deterministic approaches may find the best solution, they can also miss possible solutions due to local optimum effects. In this paper, we present an approach to searching spatial configurations that explores the characteristics of genetic algorithms to find solutions within a time framing. The novelty of our approach lies in the combination of genetic algorithms with a heuristic operator and an indexing schema for handling binary spatial constraints. Experimental results compare a genetic versus a deterministic algorithm and show the convenience of using a genetic algorithm depending on the type and complexity of a user query. }}

We suggest that a mix between the two is actually a better alternative. Depending on the workload generated by the users, the composite inverted lists algorithm we propose in this paper can operate either as a local or global inverted list, or both at the same time. }}

The transfer function of the HFFN provides a differentiable function for the performance function of the parameter vector, P, for the target network allowing gradient search methods for finding the optimum P.

	Abstract = {A scene-based algorithm for nonuniformity correction (NUC) in focal-plane arrays (FPA) detectors has been developed. The NUC technique is based in the inverse covariance form (ICF) of the Kalman filter. The gain and the offset of each detector of the FPA are modeled by discrete-time Gauss-Markov processes. These parameters are taken as constant within a given sequence of frames, corresponding to a certain time and operational conditions, but they randomly drift from one sequence to another in response to new operational conditions. For each detector and each sequence of frames, the ICF filter input is an observation vector consisting of detector's read-out values. The output of ICF filter for any sequence of infrared frames is the detectors' gain and offset. The efficacy of the ICF of the Kalman filter to compensate for nonuniformity noise in infrared imagery is demonstrated using sequences of infrared imagery with both artificial nonuniformity and artificial drift in the detectors' parameters. It is shown that the ICF filter and the Kalman filter generate similar reductions of nonuniformity. However, the ICF filter compensates the noisy images with less number of operations per pixel and per frame than the Kalman filter. }}

The method simultaneously estimates detector's parameters and performs the non-uniformity compensation using a neural approach and a Kalman estimator in a frame by frame recursive basis. Each detector's output is connected to its own inverse model: a single 1-input linear neuron. The neuron bias is directly related to the detector's offset, and have the property of being softly adapted using simple learning rules, choosing a suitable error measure to fit the NUC objective. The proposed method has been tested with sequences of real infrared data taken with a InSb IRFPA, reaching high correction levels, reducing the fixed pattern noise, and obtaining an effective frame by frame adaptive estimation of each detector's offset. }}

Classification performance is measured by the correct classification of noisy signal patterns despite using pure signal patterns for building the classifier. GNSPC is basically a decision tree classifier with similarity classification rules. The rules are used to test the similarity of signal patterns. A combination of a genetic algorithm and a neural network is used to find the best rules for the decision tree. This combination provides powerful classification capabilities with great tuning flexibility for either performance or cost-efficiency. Learning techniques are employed to set the genetic algorithm global parameters and to obtain training data for the neural network. }}

The two operations and the matrix have to be provided for full algorithm specification. For 2D-Histogram lookup, the matrix is derived from the 2D-Histogram of both processed images. The main advantage of using the 2D-Histogram is the darkening of rarely occurring structures in the image, while highly probable image structures becomes bright. The so-processed images are then given to a 2D-Lookup procedure for automatic filter generation. For low-contrast texture faults, i.e. faults which are hard to separate from the background texture, the approach shows better performance in fault region detection than the approach of 2DLookup adaptation without 2D-Histogram lookup. For handwriting separation from textured background, no achievement was obtained. }}

This approach provides the security administrator with a global view of what happens in the system. In particular, it controls unobserved actions through hypothesis generation, clusters repeated actions in a single scenario, recognizes intruders that are changing their intrusion objectives and is efficient to detect variations of an intrusion scenario. This approach can also be used to eliminate a category of false positives that correspond to false attacks, that is actions that are not further correlated to an intrusion objective.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new learning algorithm for a mixture Gaussian based neural network, called Self-growing Probabilistic decision-based neural networks (SPDNN) for better density function estimation, and pattern classification. We also developed a new Self-growing Mixture Gaussian learning (SMGL) algorithm, that is able to find the natural number of components based on a self-growing validity measure, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). It starts with a single component randomly initialized in the feature space and grows adaptively during the learning process until most appropriate number of components are found. In our experiments on anchor/speaker identification, we have observed noticeable improvement among various model-based or vector quantization-based classification schemes. Key Words: Self-growing Probabilistic Decision-based Neural Networks (SPDNN), Supervised learning, Competitive learning, Unsupervised learning, Validity measure. }}

	Abstract = {This work presents a new hybrid architecture applied to autonomous mobile robot control - HyCAR (Hybrid Control for Autonomous Robots). This architecture provides a robust control for robots as they become able to operate and adapt themselves to different environments and conditions. We designed this new hybrid control architecture, integrating the two main techniques used in robotic control (de-liberative and reactive control) and the most important environment representation techniques (grids, geometric and topological maps), through a three-layer architec-ture approach (vital, functional and deliberative layers). To guarantee the robustness of our control system, we also integrated a localization module based on Monte Carlo localization method. This localization module possesses an important role in our control system, and supplies a solid base for the control and navigation of autonomous mobile robots. In order to validate our control architecture, a realistic simulator of mobile robots was implemented (SimRob3D) allowing the practical use of the proposed system. We implemented several three-dimensional environment models, as well as diverse sensorial and kinematics models found in actual robots. Our simulation results had demonstrated that the control system is perfectly able to determine the mobile robot position into a partially known environment, considering local or global localization, and also to determine if the robot needs to re-localize it-self given an incorrect localization. In navigation tasks the robot was able to plan and follow self-generated trajectories in a dynamic environment, which can include several unexpected static and mobile obstacles. We also demonstrated that with the integration of topological and grid information we improved planning algorithm execution. }}

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to clustering a Web userIs interests represented as text term maps using the unsupervised Neural Networks algorithm (Self Organising Map) from the records in the particular userIs history file. Self Organising Map is a good tool for clustering the text data set into a low-dimensional regular grid that can be visualised as maps labeled with text terms. In this research, an experiment was carried out to find the User Interests Term Map in which all associated terms could be grouped in the same cluster. The text terms based on the Web userIs interests could be applied to the intelligent Web query search in future work. }}

	Abstract = {Web servers play a crucial role to convey knowledge and information to the end users. With the popularity of the WWW, discovering the hidden information about the users and usage pattern is critical to determine effective marketing strategies and to optimise the server usage and accommodate future growth. Many of the currently available server analysis tools could provide only statistical data without much useful information. Mining useful information becomes a challenging task when the user traffic volume is enormous and keeps on growing. In this paper, we propose a concurrent neuro-fuzzy model to analyse useful information from the available statistical/text data from the Web log analyser. We made use of the cluster information generated by Self Organising Map (SOM) for data analysis and a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to forecast the daily and hourly traffic volume. Empirical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed hybrid technique is efficient and could be extended to other Web environments. }}

	Abstract = {Since there are many resources on the WWW, it has become natural for us to extract available information from them. We would like to see many documents in order to get useful information. Though summaries are useful pieces of documents, a document has various viewpoints to be summarized. Therefore, if a viewpoint of a summary is different from user's, a user cannot grasp the contents of the document correctly, and the user has to see through the documents until the end. In this paper, we present a system which makes a summary based on a user's viewpoint by user's search keywords. }}

	Abstract = {Frequent flyer program is a popular promotional tool used by most major airlines in the world. The trend of airlines forming alliances with other airlines to expand their service-base means that the potential routes that one can take to get from one city to another have increased exponentially. Airline customers however are typically provided with a table which only shows the list of direct flights or flights with a transit point that can be booked using frequent flyer points. The online frequent flyer calculators available on the internet seem to basically work based on this incomplete table. To optimise the use of available frequent flyer points and to provide satisfactory automated customer service, a better frequent flyer points calculator which accesses the complete map of the available routes and the distance of each sector of a route needs to be built. This paper shows the use of standard graph algorithms to build such a frequent flyer points calculator. }}

	Abstract = {The design focus of the Tocorime Apicu integrated search engine builds upon new approaches and techniques associated with evolutionary computation to improve the precision and recall mechanisms of existing information retrieval systems within popular search engines. The interactions of the four major components of engines are facilitated through the use of a hierarchical communication topology which partitions the nodes of a distributed computing system into subclusters. The hierarchical communication topology is based on an information ecosystem modeled upon and incorporating the social structure of honeybees---this providing mechanisms for the efficient sharing of information. }}
