                 noisy measurements where one faces a linear inverse
                 problem in the presence of noise. Primary interest is
                 in some function f(t) but data are accessible only
                 about some linear transform corrupted by noise; The
                 usual linear methods for such inverse problems do not
                 perform satisfactorily when f(t) is spatially
                 inhomogeneous. One existing nonlinear alternative is
                 the wavelet-vaguelette decomposition method, based on
                 the expansion of the unknown f(t) in wavelet series. In
                 the vaguelette- wavelet decomposition method proposed
                 here, the observed data are expanded directly in
                 wavelet series. The performances of various methods are

                 context of the estimation of the derivative of a
                 function observed subject to noise. A result is proved

                 somewhat larger than that used for standard denoising
                 problems, both the wavelet-based approaches have an

                 can be naturally rephrased within the wavelet transform
                 framework, being directly related to approximations of
                 the signal in the sense of a Haar-multiresolution
                 analysis. A natural wavelet based generalisation to
                 traditional aggregation is then proposed:
                 ``a-aggregation''. It is shown that a-aggregation
                 cannot lead to good estimators of H, and so a new kind
                 of aggregation, ``d-aggregation'', is defined, which is
                 related to the details rather than the approximations
                 of a multiresolution analysis. An estimator of H based

                 different frequency bands by utilizing the
                 multiresolution structure of wavelet decomposition.
                 Motion vectors at a higher resolution are predicted by
                 the motion vectors at a lower resolution through a
                 proper scaling. Experimental results on a salesman
                 video sequence show that the use of the 2-D
                 oversampling algorithm of a biorthogonal spline wavelet
                 has reduced the required number of motion vectors while
                 maintaining an acceptable prediction error when
                 compared to the classical block matching technique
                 using the standard wavelet transform. The proposed
                 approach will advance the video compression methodology
                 for applications to HDTV and video conferencing.",

                 finding wide use for analyzing and interpreting time
                 series data. This paper describes a new use for
                 wavelets--identifying trends in time series. The
                 general signal considered has a quadratic trend. The
                 inverted Haar wavelet and the elephant wavelet,
                 respectively, provide estimates of the first-order and
                 second-order coefficients in the trend polynomial.
                 Unlike usual wavelet applications, however, this
                 analysis requires only one wavelet dilation scale L,
                 where L is the total length of the time series. Error
                 analysis shows that wavelet trend detection is roughly
                 half as accurate as least squares trend detection when
                 accuracy is evaluated in terms of the mean-square error
                 in estimates of the first-order and second-order trend
                 coefficients. But wavelet detection is more than twice
                 as efficient as least squares detection in the sense
                 that it requires fewer than half the number of
                 floating-point operations of least squares regression
                 to yield the three coefficients of the quadratic trend
                 polynomial. This paper demonstrates wavelet trend
                 detection using artificial data and then various
                 turbulence data collected in the atmospheric surface
                 layer, and last, provides guidelines on when linear and
                 quadratic trends are ``significant'' enough to require
                 removal from a time series.",

                  nonparametric approach in assuming that the density
                  and hazard rate have no specific parametric
                  form. The method is based on dividing the time axis
                  into a dyadic number of intervals and then counting
                  the number of events within each interval. The
                  number of events and the survival function of the
                  observations are then separately smoothed over time
                  via linear wavelet smoothers, and then the hazard
                  rate function estimators are obtained by taking the
                  ratio. We prove that the estimators have pointwise
                  and global mean-square consistency, obtain the best
                  possible asymptotic mean integrated squared error
                  convergence rate and are also asymptotically
                  normally distributed. We also describe simulation
                  experiments that show that these estimators are
                  reasonably reliable in practice. The method is
                  illustrated with two real examples. The first uses

                  metastases from a colorectal primary tumour without
                  other distant metastases. The second is concerned

                  Wavelets, Wavelets in Physics, and Splines and 
                  Wavelets in Statistics. Part one presents the broad 
                  spectrum of current research in the theory and 
                  applications of spline functions. Theory ranges from 
                  classical univariate spline approximation to an 
                  abstract framework for multivariate spline 
                  interpolation. Applications include scattered-data
                  interpolation, differential equations and various 
                  techniques in CAGD. Part two considers two 
                  developments in subdivision schemes; one for uniform 
                  regularity and the other for irregular situations. 
                  The latter includes construction of multidimensional 
                  wavelet bases and determination of bases with a given 
                  time frequency localization. In part three, the 
                  multifractal formalism is extended to fractal 
                  functions involving oscillating singularites. There 
                  is a review of a method of quantization of classical 
                  systems based on the theory of coherent states. 
                  Wavelets are applied in the domains of atomic, 
                  molecular and condensed-matter physics. In part four, 
                  ways in which wavelets can be used to solve important 
                  function estimation problems in statistics are shown. 
                  Different wavelet estimators are proposed in the 
                  following distinct cases: functions with 
                  discontinuities, errors that are no longer Gaussian,
                  wavelet estimation with robustness, and error 
                  distribution that is no longer stationary. Some of 
                  the contributions in this volume are current research 
                  results not previously available in monograph form. 
                  The volume features many applications and interesting 
                  new theoretical developments. Readers will find

                  intermittent departures (potential `signals') from
                  the background sound environment in the data
                  (`noise'), where the latter may itself be evolving
                  and changing over time. We develop an adaptive model
                  of the background interference, using recursive
                  density estimation of the joint distribution of
                  certain summary features of its wavelet
                  decomposition. Observations considered to be
                  outliers from this density estimate at any time are
                  then flagged as potential `signals.' The performance
                  of our method is illustrated on artificial data,
                  where a known `signal' is contaminated with
                  simulated underwater `noise' using a range of
                  different signal-to-noise ratios, and a `baseline'
                  comparison is made with results obtained from a
                  relatively unsophisticated, but commonly used,
                  time-frequency approach. A similar comparison is
                  then reported in relation to the more significant
                  problem of detecting various types of dolphin sound
                  in real conditions.",

                  the daily number of sunspot groups visible on the
                  Sun's surface between 1610 and 1995, has recently
                  been made available by Hoyt and Schatten. Wavelet
                  analysis of this record shows that an episode of the
                  periodicity near 158 days occurred during the
                  eighteenth century, around the maximum of solar
                  cycle 2, and that episodes of the periodicity, much
                  weaker than that in solar cycle 2, have appeared
                  around the maxims of solar cycles 16-21 (covering
                  the interval 1923-1986). The presence of the
                  periodicity in the group sunspot number confirms
                  that it is caused by a periodic emergence of
                  magnetic flux. On the other hand, periodogram
                  analysis allows one to compare the behavior of the
                  periodicity in both sunspot groups and sunspot
                  areas, and the results suggest that, at least during
                  the twentieth century, the periodic emergence of
                  magnetic flux has adopted two different forms. In
                  solar cycles 16 and 17, new sunspot groups were
                  periodically formed, simultaneously increasing
                  the number of sunspot groups and the total sunspot
                  area on the Sun's surface, while during solar cycles
                  18, 19, 20, and 21 the periodicity has occurred
                  within already formed sunspot groups, increasing
                  sunspot areas only. We point out that this second
                  type of emergence, which enhances the magnetic
                  complexity of sunspot groups, is responsible for the
                  appearance of the periodicity in high-energy solar
                  flares as detected by the Solar Maximum Mission
                  during solar cycle 21.",

                 and image processing. A natural framework for
                 developing such a theory is the study of stochastic
                 processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in
                 which different depths in the tree or lattice

                 to the analyses of the total matter distribution, and
                 3) detection of large-scale structures from galaxy
                 counts. From the analyses of n-body simulations we show
                 that the vision model from the wavelet transform

                 data of canopy opening measurements taken in 12 stands

                 near-optimality properties. In this paper, we derive

                 estimates in finite sample situations. These formulas

                  obtained via the inverse transform of the denoised

                  the samples are nonequispaced. It can be shown that

                  the estimate is optimally adaptive to unknown degree

                  estimate enjoys a smoothness property: if the target
                  function is the zero function, then with probability

                 Specifically, an nth-order expansion is developed for
                 the error in the wavelet approximation at resolution
                 $2^{-l}$ of deterministic and random signals. The

                 assumption. For deterministic signals square integrable
                 over the entire real line, for stationary random

                 and measure its performance. The data used contained
                 subject EEG responses to two different stimuli using
                 the `odd-ball' paradigm. Electrical signals measured at
                 standard locations on the scalp were processed to
                 detect and identify the Evoked Response Potentials
                 (ERP's). First, electrical artifacts emitting from the
                 eyes were identified and removed. Second, the mean
                 signature for each type of response was extracted and
                 used as a matched filter to define baseline detector
                 performance for the noisy data. Third, a nonlinear
                 filtering procedure based on the wavelet extrema
                 representation was used to de-noise the signals.
                 Overall detection rates for the de-noised signals were
                 then compared to the baseline performance. It was found
                 that while the filtered signals have significantly
                 lower noise than the raw signals, detector performance
                 remains comparable. We therefore conclude that all of
                 the information that is important to matched filter
                 detection is preserved by the filter. The implication
                 is that the wavelet based filter eliminates much of the

                  signal. Data-adaptive optimality is achieved with
                  respect to an objective function, e.g. minimizing
                  entropy, and concerns the choice of the Heisenberg
                  rectangles tiling the time-frequency domain over

                  also shown how optimizing a concave objective
                  function is equivalent to concentrating maximal
                  energy into a few basis elements. Signal- adaptive
                  basis selection algorithms currently in use do not

                  have an asymmetric time-frequency

                  whole signal, not to the period corresponding to
                  these frequencies). Revealing short-lived
                  frequencies to the investigator can bring up

                 of which gives a very reasonable guess for the
                 component of the input signal which was buried in
                 noise. The algorithm has two main components. The first
                 one concerns the identification of the main
                 characteristics of the noise component and of the
                 typical effects it has on the wavelet transform of the
                 input signal. This information is used to identify the
                 points in the time-scale space which cannot be extrema
                 of the wavelet transform, unless something else than
                 noise was present in the input signal. This is done by
                 bootstrap in general but direct Monte Carlo simulations
                 can be used when parametric knowledge on the
                 distribution of the noise is available. The second part
                 deals with the actual reconstruction of what is
                 believed to be the component of the input which is to
                 be identified. This part of the algorithm uses the
                 reconstruction procedure of Mallat and Zhong (1992) as
                 revised by the author (1992) the main novelty being the
                 fact that this procedure is fed with the set of points
                 in the time-scale plane which passed the trimming test
                 of the extrema of the wavelet transform. The author
                 illustrates the efficiency of the reconstruction

                 much of the research coming from mathematicians, most
                 of the literature uses terminology, concepts and proofs
                 that may, at times, be difficult and intimidating for
                 the engineer. Wavelet Basics has therefore been written
                 as an introductory book for scientists and engineers.
                 The mathematical presentation has been kept simple, the
                 concepts being presented in elaborate detail in a
                 terminology that engineers will find familiar.
                 Difficult ideas are illustrated with examples which
                 will also aid in the development of an intuitive
                 insight. Chapter 1 reviews the basics of signal
                 transformation and discusses the concepts of duals and
                 frames. Chapter 2 introduces the wavelet transform,
                 contrasts it with the short-time Fourier transform and
                 clarifies the names of the different types of wavelet
                 transforms. Chapter 3 links multiresolution analysis,
                 orthonormal wavelets and the design of digital filters.
                 Chapter 4 gives a tour d'horizon of topics of current
                 interest: wavelet packets and discrete time wavelet
                 transforms, and concludes with applications in signal

                  packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to
                  name a few. Decomposition into overcomplete systems
                  is not unique, and several methods for decomposition
                  have been proposed, including the method of frames
                  (MOF), Matching pursuit (MP), and, for special
                  dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). Basis
                  Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal
                  into an ``optimal'' superposition of dictionary
                  elements, where optimal means having the smallest
                  l(1) norm of coefficients among all such
                  decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several
                  advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better
                  sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting
                  relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed
                  problems, in abstract harmonic analysis, total
                  variation denoising, and multiscale edge
                  denoising. BP in highly overcomplete dictionaries
                  leads to large-scale optimization problems. With
                  signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet
                  dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of

                  successfully only because of recent advances in
                  linear programming by interior-point methods. We
                  obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual

                 shrinkage estimation in wavelets. Wavelets are used in 
                 applications for data denoising, via shrinkage of the 
                 coefficients towards zero, and for data compression, by 
                 shrinkage and setting small coefficients to zero.  We 
                 approach wavelet shrinkage by using Bayesian 
                 hierarchical models, assigning a positive prior 
                 probability to the wavelet coefficients being zero.  The
                 resulting estimator for the wavelet coefficients is a 
                 multiple shrinkage estimator that exhibits a wide

                 numerical analysis and signal processing. This book is
                 based on Ondelettes et Traitement Numerique du Signal
                 by Albert Cohen. It has been translated from French by
                 Robert D. Ryan and extensively updated by both Cohen
                 and Ryan. It studies the existing relations between
                 filter banks and wavelet decompositions and shows how
                 these relations can be exploited in the context of
                 digital signal processing. Throughout, the book
                 concentrates on the fundamentals. It begins with a
                 chapter on the concept of multiresolution analysis,
                 which contains complete proofs of the basic results.
                 The description of filter banks that are related to
                 wavelet bases is elaborated in both the orthogonal case
                 (Chapter 2), and in the biorthogonal case (Chapter 4).
                 The regularity of wavelets, how this is related to the
                 properties of the filters, and the importance of
                 regularity for the algorithms are the subjects of
                 Chapter 3. Chapter 5 looks at multiscale decomposition
                 as it applies to stochastic processing, in particular
                 to signal and image processing. Wavelets and Multiscale

                  desirable mathematical properties relevant to
                  time-frequency analysis. However, the presence of
                  interference terms renders the WD of multicomponent
                  signals extremely difficult to interpret. In this
                  work, we propose adaptive suppression of
                  interference terms using the shift-invariant wavelet
                  packet decomposition. A prescribed signal is
                  expanded on its best basis and transformed into the
                  Wigner domain. Subsequently, the interference terms
                  are eliminated by adaptively thresholding the
                  cross-WD of interactive basis functions, according
                  to their amplitudes and distance in an idealized
                  time--frequency plane. We define a distance measure
                  that weighs the Euclidean distance with the local
                  distribution of the signal. The amplitude and
                  distance thresholds control the cross-term
                  interference, the useful properties of the
                  distribution, and the computational complexity. The
                  properties of the resultant modified Wigner
                  distribution (MWD) are investigated, and its
                  performance in eliminating interference terms, while
                  still retaining high-energy resolution, is compared
                  with that of other existing approaches. It is shown
                  that the proposed MWD is directly applicable to
                  resolving multicomponent signals. Each component is
                  determined as a partial sum of basis functions over
                  a certain equivalence class in the time--frequency

                  incorporated into the search algorithm. The added
                  dimension is a relative shift between given parent
                  node and its respective children nodes. We prove
                  that for any subspace it suffices to consider one of
                  two alternative decompositions, made feasible by the
                  SWP library. These decompositions correspond to a
                  zero shift and a 2(-l) relative shift where l
                  denotes the resolution level. The optimal relative
                  shifts, which minimize the information cost, are
                  estimated using finite depth subtrees. By adjusting
                  their depth, the quadratic computational complexity
                  associated with SIWPD may be controlled at the
                  expense of the attained information cost down to
                  O(Nlog(2)N).",

                  presented. A collection of signal models is
                  generated using an extended library of orthonormal
                  wavelet-packet bases, and an additive cost function,

                  the shift-invarient wavelet packet decomposition
                  (SIWPD) and thresholding the resulting
                  coefficients. This approach is extendable to local

                  that parametrizes the time-varying spectral density
                  f_{theta(.)}(\lambda). Whereas the mean function is
                  estimated by a usual kernel estimator, each
                  component of theta(.) is estimated by a nonlinear
                  wavelet method. According to a truncated wavelet
                  series expansion of theta^{(i)}(.), we define
                  empirical versions of the corresponding wavelet
                  coefficients by minimizing an empirical version of
                  the Kullback-Leibler distance. In the main smoothing
                  step, we perform nonlinear thresholding on these
                  coefficients, which finally provides a locally
                  adaptive estimator of theta^{(i)}(.). This method is
                  fully automatic and adapts to different smoothness
                  classes. It is shown that usual rates of convergence
                  in Besov smoothness classes are attained up to a
                  logarithmic factor.",

                  (LOD) series are investigated for their
                  characteristics on interannual time scales during
                  the half-century period 1949 to 1998. During this
                  epoch, the interannual variability in LOD can be
                  separated naturally into three bands: a
                  quasi-biennial, a triennial-quadrennial and one at
                  six-seven years. The atmosphere appears to excite
                  the first two bands, while it does not contribute to
                  the last. Considering the quasi-biennial (QB) band
                  alone, the atmosphere appears to excite most of its
                  signal in LOD, but it arises from separate
                  fluctuations with stratospheric and tropospheric
                  origin. Thus, although close in frequency,
                  stratospheric and tropospheric processes differ in
                  their amplitude and phase variability. The time
                  shift can be noted especially during the strong El
                  Nino events of 1982-83 and 1997-98
                  when both processes have positive phase and thus
                  combine to help produce particularly strong peak in
                  AAM and LOD. In addition, we have reconfirmed the 
                  downward propagation in the stratosphere and upward 
                  propagation in the troposphere of AAM observed in 
                  earlier studies for other variables. In the 
                  triennial-quadrennial (TQ) band, time-variable
                  spectral analyses reveal that LOD and AAM contain 
                  strong variability, with periods shorter than four 
                  years before 1975 and longer thereafter. This signal
                  originates mainly within the troposphere and 
                  propagates upwards from the lower to the higher 
                  layers of the troposphere. According to a zonal 
                  analysis, an equatorial poleward mode, strongly 
                  linked to the SOI, explains more than 60% of the 
                  total variability at these ranges. In addition, this 
                  study also indicates that an equatorward mode, 
                  originating within polar latitudes, explains, on
                  average, more than 15% of the triennial-quadrennial 
                  oscillation (TQO) variability in AAM, and up to 30% 
                  at certain epochs. Finally, a six year period in LOD 
                  noted in earlier studies, as well as in lengthier 
                  series covering much of the century, is found to be 
                  absent in atmospheric excitations, and it is thus 
                  likely to arise from mantle/core interactions.",

                 wavelet bases has not yet been fully investigated. We
                 use compactly supported wavelets to obtain

                 curves, densities, spectral densities, images - from
                 noisy data. A now rich and complex body of work
                 develops nearly or exactly minimax estimators for an
                 array of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the
                 results have rarely moved into practice, for a variety
                 of reasons - among them being similarity to known
                 methods, computational intractability and lack of
                 spatial adaptivity. We discuss a method for curve
                 estimation based on n noisy data: translate the
                 empirical wavelet coefficients towards the origin by an
                 amount [sq.root](2 log n) [sigma]/[sq.root]n. The
                 proposal differs from those in current use, is
                 computationally practical and is spatially adaptive; it
                 thus avoids several of the previous objections.
                 Further, the method is nearly minimax both for a wide
                 variety of loss functions - pointwise error, global
                 error measured in Lp-norms, pointwise and global errors
                 in estimation of derivatives - and for a wide range of
                 smoothness classes, including standard Hlder and
                 Sobolev classes, and bounded variation. This is a much
                 broader near optimality than anything previously
                 proposed: we draw loose parallels with near optimality
                 in robustness and also with the broad near
                 eigenfunction properties of wavelets themselves.
                 Finally, the theory underlying the method is
                 interesting, as it exploits a correspondence between
                 statistical questions and questions of optimal recovery

                  nonlinear shrinkage of the empirical wavelet

                  asymptotically minimax over Besov bodies with p less

                  even the minimax rates over Triebel and Besov
                  classes with p < 2, so the method can significantly

                  linear minimax adaptation theory and the heuristic

                  necessity of using strongly nonlinear adaptive

                  known that linear adaptive estimates are the best

                  possible to suggest a quasi-linear wavelet estimate,
                  by adding to a linear adaptive estimate a minimal
                  number of nonlinear terms on finest scales, that
                  offers advantages of linear adaptive estimates and
                  at the same time matches asymptotic properties of
                  strongly nonlinear procedures like the benchmark

                  quasi-linear estimation both theoretically and via a

                  matches properties of SureShrink over the Besov
                  scale, but also allows us to relax familiar
                  assumptions and solve a long standing problem of
                  rate and sharp optimal estimation of monotone

                  functions that contain spiky/jumps parts and smooth

                 decimation stage it lacks the often desired property of
                 shift invariance. On the other hand, the oversampled or
                 nonorthogonal wavelet offers a finer resolution in
                 translation; thus reducing the effect of shift of
                 origin, it becomes more robust to changes in the
                 initial phase of the signal. In some areas of signal
                 processing, such as wideband correlation processing,
                 sensitivity to time alignment necessitates the use of
                 the nonorthogonal wavelet transform. The price paid for
                 the advantage of robustness to shifting is the
                 introduction of redundancy in the expression. In many

                  different amount of smoothing at different spatial
                  locations, but in the context of wavelets this is so
                  awkward to implement that it is not really
                  practicable. Instead, it is attractive to select the
                  primary resolution level (or smoothing parameter) so
                  as to give good performance for smooth parts of the

                  that, in order to achieve optimal rates of
                  convergence, it is necessary for the primary
                  resolution level of the empirical wavelet transform
                  to vary with location, sometimes
                  extensively. nevertheless, the convergence rate
                  penalty incurred through using a non-varying
                  resolution level, chosen to provide good performance

                 curves. New statistical challenge includes testing 
                 whether there is any statistically significant 
                 difference among these sets of curves. In this 
                 article we propose some new tests for comparing 
                 two groups of curves based on the adaptive Neyman 
                 test and the wavelet thresholding techniques 
                 introduced earlier by Fan. We demonstrate that these 
                 tests inherit the properties outlined by Fan and 
                 that they are simple and powerful for detecting 
                 differences between two sets of curves. We then 
                 further generalize the idea to compare multiple sets 
                 of curves, resulting in an adaptive high-dimensional 
                 analysis of variance, called HANOVA. These newly 
                 developed techniques are illustrated by using a 
                 dataset on pizza commercials where observations are 
                 curves and an analysis of cornea topography in 
                 ophthalmology where images of individuals are 
                 observed. A simulation example is also presented to 
                 illustrate the power of the adaptive Neyman test.",

                 Kolomogorov-Smirnov test and the Cramer-Von Mises test,
                 are based on the empirical distribution functions.
                 Although these tests possess root-n consistency, they
                 effectively use only information contained in the low
                 frequencies. This leads to low power in detecting fine
                 features such as sharp and short aberrants as well as
                 global features such as high-frequency alternations.
                 The drawback can be repaired via smoothing-based test
                 statistics. In this article we propose two such kind of
                 test statistics based on the wavelet thresholding and
                 the Neyman truncation. We provide extensive evidence to
                 demonstrate that the proposed tests have higher power
                 in detecting sharp peaks and high frequency
                 alternations, while maintaining the same capability in
                 detecting smooth alternative densities as the
                 traditional tests. Similar conclusions can be made for
                 two-sample nonparametric tests of distribution
                 functions. In that case, the traditional linear rank
                 tests such as the Wilcoxon test and the Fisher-Yates
                 test have low power in detecting two nearby densities
                 where one has local features or contains high-frequency
                 components, because these procedures are essentially
                 testing the uniform distribution based on the sample
                 mean of rank statistics. In contrast, the proposed
                 tests use more fully the sampling information and have
                 better ability in detecting subtle features.",

                 radars are characterized by very large bandwidth and
                 fine range resolution. Potential applications of this
                 type of radar include terrain mapping, and target
                 identification/classification. In this paper we use a
                 non- stationary approach and analyze UWB radar data
                 using time- frequency and time-scale transformations.
                 The time-frequency transformations considered are the
                 Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the Wigner-Ville
                 Distribution (WD), the Instantaneous Power Spectrum
                 (IPS), and the ZAM transform. Two discrete
                 implementations of the Wavelet Transform (DWT) are also
                 investigated: the decimated A-trous algorithm proposed
                 by Holschneider et al, which uses non-orthogonal
                 wavelets; and the Mallat algorithm, which employs
                 orthogonal wavelets. The transients under study are UWB
                 radar returns from a boat (with and without corner
                 reflector) in the presence of sea clutter, multipath,
                 and radio frequency interferences (RFI). Results show
                 that all time-frequency and time-scale transforms
                 clearly detect the transient radar returns
                 corresponding to the boat with a corner reflector.
                 However, as the radar cross section of the target
                 decreases (boat without a corner reflector), results
                 change drastically as the RFI component dominates the
                 signal. Simulations show that the Instantaneous Power
                 Spectrum may be better adapted for localizing the
                 transient among the time-frequency techniques studied.
                 The decimated A-trous algorithm has the best time
                 resolution of the techniques studied as the return
                 appears better localized in the scalogram.",

                 is a new approach for the construction of biorthogonal
                 wavelets entirely in the spatial domain, i.e.,
                 independent of the Fourier Transform. Constructing
                 wavelets using lifting consists of three simple phases:
                 the first step or Lazy wavelet splits the data into two
                 subsets, even and odd, the second step calculates the
                 wavelet coefficients (high pass) as the failure to
                 predict the odd set based on the even, and finally the
                 third step updates the even set using the wavelet
                 coefficients to compute the scaling function
                 coefficients (low pass). The predict phase ensures
                 polynomial cancelation in the high pass (vanishing
                 moments of the dual wavelet) and the update phase
                 ensures preservation of moments in the low pass
                 (vanishing moments of the primal wavelet). By varying
                 the order, an entire family of transforms can be built.
                 The lifting scheme ensures fast calculation of the
                 forward and inverse wavelet transforms that only
                 involve FIR filters. The transform works for images of
                 arbitrary size with correct treatment of the
                 boundaries. Also, all computations can be done

                  of wavelet analysis which is especially suitable for
                  analyzing spatial structures, such as atmospheric
                  fields. For this purpose, OWA is more efficient and
                  accurate than the nonorthogonal wavelet analysis
                  (NWA) which has been introduced to the
                  meteorological community in recent years, and which
                  is more suitable for ``making time series sing.''
                  Since NWA is strictly correct only for infinite
                  domains, OWA must be derived from NWA by use of
                  appropriate boundary conditions, in this case, by
                  periodization of OWA on an infinite domain. OWA is
                  not translation invariant, unlike NWA. Two remedies
                  are to use all possible translations, known as the
                  Stationary Wavelet Transform, or else to use a
                  `best' translation, known as the Best Shift OWA. OWA
                  is a generalization of Fourier series, and the
                  associated multiresolution analysis (MRA) is a
                  generalization of Reynolds averaging. Like these,
                  OWA/MRA on discrete and continuous domains satisfy
                  analogous identities arithmetically exactly, unlike
                  NWA. OWA/MRA is more efficient than Fourier series
                  for analyzing nearly-singular synthetic functions,
                  and also sequences of observed geopotential height
                  maps which contain atmospheric blocking. Close to or
                  more than 90% of the spatial variance of
                  latitude-band averaged geopotential height, averaged
                  over five different blocking events, is
                  reconstructed by only two wavelets using best
                  shift. This is comparable to EOF analysis, but is
                  much faster and less data-dependent. All of the
                  basic OWA programs are freely available for MATLAB

                 varied applications. What are wavelets, and why might

                 wavelets is to analyze according to scale. Indeed, some
                 researchers feel that using wavelets means adopting a
                 whole new mind-set or perspective in processing data.
                 Wavelets are functions that satisfy certain
                 mathematical requirements and are used in representing
                 data or other functions. Most of the basic wavelet
                 theory has now been done. The mathematics have been
                 worked out in excruciating detail, and wavelet theory
                 is now in the refinement stage. This involves
                 generalizing and extending wavelets, such as in
                 extending wavelet packet techniques. The future of
                 wavelets lies in the as-yet uncharted territory of
                 applications. Wavelet techniques have not been
                 thoroughly worked out in such applications as practical
                 data analysis, where, for example, discretely sampled

                 traces in reservoir studies. The wavelet transform has
                 the great advantage over the Fourier transform in being
                 able to better localize changes. The multiscale nature
                 and structure of the DWT leads to a method of display
                 which highlights this and allows comparison of changes
                 in the transform with changing data. Many different
                 sorts of wavelet exist and it is found that the quality
                 of reconstruction of a seismic trace segment, using
                 some of the coefficients, is dependent on the choice of
                 wavelet, which leads us to consider choosing a wavelet
                 under a 'best reconstruction' criterion. Location

                 coefficients as attributes for whole trace segments or
                 fractional trace segments are given. Provided the DWT
                 is applied consistently, for example with a fixed
                 wavelet, and non-truncated data, the transform produces
                 useful results. Care must be exercised if it is applied
                 to data of different lengths. However, as the algorithm
                 is refined and improved in the future, the DWT should
                 prove increasingly useful.",

                  wavelet estimators, we suggest threshold methods for
                  general kernel density estimators, including those
                  of classical Rosenblatt-Parzen type. Thresholding
                  makes kernel methods competitive in terms of their
                  adaptivity to a wide variety of aberrations in
                  complex signals. It is argued that term-by-term
                  thresholding does not always produce optimal
                  performance, since individual coefficients cannot be
                  estimated sufficiently accurately for reliable
                  decisions to be made. Therefore, we suggest grouping
                  coefficients into blocks and making simultaneous
                  threshold decisions about all coefficients within a
                  given block. It is argued that block thresholding
                  has a number of advantages, including that it
                  produces adaptive estimators which achieve
                  minimax-optimal convergence rates without the
                  logarithmic penalty that is sometimes associated
                  with term-by-term thresholding. More than this, the
                  convergence rates are achieved over large classes of
                  functions with discontinuities, indeed with a number
                  of discontinuities that diverges polynomially fast
                  with sample size. These results are also established

                  function using wavelet methods. For example, it has
                  been shown that block thresholding reduces mean
                  squared error by rendering the estimator more
                  adaptive to relatively subtle, local changes in
                  curvature, of the type that local bandwidth choice

                 square error tend to dampen one another out, even over
                 very small intervals, with the result that mean
                 integrated square error properties of linear wavelet
                 methods are much closer to those of kernel methods than
                 is perhaps reasonable, given the local behaviour. We
                 illustrate the adaptive qualities of the nonlinear
                 component of a wavelet estimator by describing its
                 performance when the target function is smooth but has
                 high-frequency oscillations. It is shown that the
                 nonlinear component automatically adapts to changing
                 local conditions, to the extent of achieving (except
                 for a logarithmic factor) the same convergence rate as
                 the optimal linear estimator, but without a need to
                 adjust the underlying bandwidth. This makes explicitly
                 clear the way in which the linear part of the estimator
                 takes care of the &lsquo;average&rsquo; characteristics
                 of the unknown curve, while the nonlinear part corrects
                 for more erratic fluctuations, in a manner which is
                 virtually independent of the construction of the linear
                 part.",

                 thresholded ones, and so react more rapidly to sudden
                 changes in the frequency of the underlying signal. They
                 also suffer less from spurious aberrations of Gibbs
                 type, produced by excessive bias. On the other hand,
                 they are more susceptible to spurious features produced

                 modulated (AM) acoustical signals applied at the ear

                 areas wavelet-like algorithms replace the classical
                 Fourier-type expansion of a function. This unique new
                 book is an excellent introduction to the basic
                 properties of wavelets, from background math to
                 powerful applications. The authors provide elementary
                 methods for constructing wavelets, and illustrate
                 several new classes of wavelets. The text begins with a
                 description of local sine and cosine bases that have
                 been shown to be very effective in applications. Very
                 little mathematical background is needed to follow this
                 material. A complete treatment of band-limited wavelets
                 follows. These are characterized by some elementary
                 equations, allowing the authors to introduce many new
                 wavelets. Next, the idea of multiresolution analysis
                 (MRA) is developed, and the authors include simplified
                 presentations of previous studies, particularly for
                 compactly supported wavelets. Some of the topics
                 treated include: Several bases generated by a single
                 function via translations and dilations;
                 Multiresolution analysis, compactly supported wavelets,
                 and spline wavelets; Band-limited wavelets;
                 Unconditionality of wavelet bases; Characterizations of
                 many of the principal objects in the theory of
                 wavelets, such as low-pass filters and scaling
                 functions. The authors also present the basic
                 philosophy that all orthonormal wavelets are completely
                 characterized by two simple equations, and that most
                 properties and constructions of wavelets can be
                 developed using these two equations. Material related
                 to applications is provided, and constructions of
                 splines wavelets are presented. Mathematicians,
                 engineers, physicists, and anyone with a mathematical
                 background will find this to be an important text for
                 furthering their studies on wavelets.",

                  a constant term, main effects (functions of one

                  of two or more variables). The least-squares
                  projection is onto an approximating space

                  series in time-scale space directly leads to the
                  computational efficiency of the wavelet
                  representation of a N x N matrix operator by
                  allowing the N largest elements of the wavelet
                  represented operator to represent the matrix
                  operator [Devore, et al. (1992a) and (1992b)]. This
                  property allows many dense matrices to have sparse
                  representation when transformed by wavelets.In this
                  paper we generalize the long-memory parameter
                  estimator of McCoy and Walden (1996) to estimate
                  simultaneously the short and long-memory
                  parameters. Using the sparse wavelet representation

                  variances. Maximization of this approximate
                  likelihood function over the short and long-memory
                  parameter space results in the approximate wavelet
                  maximum likelihood estimates of the ARFIMA model. By
                  simultaneously maximizing the likelihood function
                  over both the short and long-memory parameters and
                  using only the wavelet coefficient's variances, the
                  approximate wavelet MLE provides a fast alternative
                  to the frequency-domain MLE. Furthermore, the
                  simulation studies found herein reveal the
                  approximate wavelet MLE to be robust over the
                  invertible parameter region of the ARFIMA model's
                  moving average parameter, whereas the
                  frequency-domain MLE dramatically deteriorates as

  abstract =	 "We develop an ordinary least squares estimator of
                  the long-memory parameter from a fractionally
                  integrated process that is an alternative to the
                  Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) estimator. Using the
                  wavelet transform from a fractionally integrated
                  process, we establish a log-linear relationship
                  between the wavelet coefficients' variance and the
                  scaling parameter equal to the log-memory
                  parameter. This log-linear relationship yields a
                  consistent ordinary least squares estimator of the
                  long-memory parameter when the wavelet coefficients'
                  population variance is replaced by their sample
                  variance. We derive the small sample bias and
                  variance of the ordinary least squares estimator and
                  test it against the GPH estimator and the
                  McCoy-Walden maximum likelihood wavelet estimator by
                  conducting a number of Monte Carlo
                  experiments. Based upon the criterion of choosing
                  the estimator which minimizes the mean squared
                  error, the wavelet OLS approach was superior to the
                  GPH estimator, but inferior to the McCoy-Walden
                  wavelet estimator for the processes
                  simulated. However, given the simplicity of
                  programming and running the wavelet OLS estimator
                  and its statistical inference of the long-memory
                  parameter we feel the general practitioner will be
                  attracted to the wavelet OLS estimator.",

                 the wavelet transform. A variety of threshold choices
                 is proposed, including one based on an unbiased

                 unattainable 'bench-mark', that can be considered in

                 spatial adaptivity, and more generally is obtained by
                 the use of an 'oracle' that provides information that

                 the level-dependent threshold estimator performs well

  abstract =     "The problem of detecting corresponding points is
                 studied in the case in which local deformations exist
                 and a new method named ``wavelet correlation'' is
                 proposed. There is a difficulty in that a reasonable
                 window width cannot be designed in local correlation,
                 which is one of the methods for a corresponding
                 problem. The wavelet correlation is derived by
                 extending the notion of local correlation and is
                 considered to overcome difficulty. The fundamental
                 concept is derived by the belief that a signal can be
                 decomposed to several (sinusoidal) components and the
                 window width can be varied according to each component.
                 It is claimed that any algorithm using local
                 correlation can be replaced by the one using wavelet
                 correlation. In this paper, the wavelet correlation
                 derived from local correlation is compared with the
                 Laplacian distance and the local correlation itself by
                 experiments. Further, a matching method that uses a
                 narrow-band property of a wavelet correlation function
                 is proposed and the matching error is evaluated through
                 experiments using one-dimensional signals. Finally, an
                 absolute measure of matching by using normalized
                 wavelet correlation is introduced and applied for
                 detecting discontinuities of local deformations.",

                  multitaper spectral analysis (MTSA) to estimate spectra 
                  from the time series, then using wavelet denoising of 
                  the log spectra. MTSA leads to a power spectrum 
                  estimate with reduced variance and better leakage 
                  properties than the conventional periodogram. Under the 
                  assumption of stationarity and mild regularity 
                  conditions, the log multitaper spectrum has a 
                  statistical distribution that is approximately Gaussian, 
                  so wavelet denoising is asymptotically an optimal method 
                  to reduce the noise in the estimated spectra. We find 
                  that a single m-v spectrum benefits greatly from MTSA 
                  followed by wavelet denoising and that wavelet denoising 
                  by itself can be used to improve m-averaged spectra. We 
                  compare estimates using two different five-taper 
                  estimates (Slepian and sine tapers) and the periodogram 
                  estimate for Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) 
                  time series at selected angular degrees l. We compare 
                  those three spectra with and without wavelet denoising, 
                  both visually and in terms of the mode parameters 
                  estimated from the preprocessed spectra using the GONG 
                  peak-fitting algorithm. The two multitaper estimates
                  give equivalent results. The number of modes fitted well 
                  by the GONG algorithm is 20%-60% larger (depending on l 
                  and the temporal frequency) when applied to the 
                  multitaper estimates than when applied to the 
                  periodogram. The estimated mode parameters (frequency, 
                  amplitude, and width) are comparable for the three power 
                  spectrum estimates, except for modes with very small 
                  mode widths (a few frequency bins), where the multitaper 
                  spectra broaden the modes compared with the periodogram. 
                  At frequencies below 3 mHz, wavelet denoising of the log 
                  multitaper power spectra tends to increase the number of 
                  modes for which the GONG peak-fitting algorithm 
                  converges well. Close to 3 mHz, where all modes are 
                  resolved, wavelet denoising makes little difference. At 
                  higher frequencies close to the acoustic cutoff 
                  frequency, where modes are blended into ridges, wavelet 
                  denoising the multitaper spectra reduces the number of 
                  good fits. We tested the influence of the number of 
                  tapers used and found that narrow modes at low n-values 
                  are broadened to the extent that they can no longer be 
                  fitted if the number of tapers is too large. For 
                  helioseismic time series of this length and temporal 
                  resolution, the optimal number of tapers is less than

                  transform. The observational site is located at the

                  characterized by high moisture in the atmospheric
                  surface layer. On the average relative humidity
                  varied from 70% to 100% during the experiment. The
                  wind and temperature data, collected at Kharagpur
                  (22 degrees 25' N, 87 degrees 18' E) at six
                  observational hours of a day in June 1990 during the
                  Monsoon Trough Boundary Layer Experiment (MONTBLEX),
                  have been utilized in the study. The wind and
                  instantaneous momentum flux time series were
                  decomposed into 12 scales using the Haar wavelet
                  transform. The eddies exhibited a large temporal
                  variability generating intermittency in the energy
                  and Bur distributions. A criterion based on the
                  isotropy has been suggested for separating the large
                  eddies from the small eddies. At the separation
                  scale the isotropy coefficient drops sharply. It is
                  shown that the intermittency in the small eddies
                  resulted from the spatial variation of energy, and
                  deviation of velocity statistics from the Gaussian
                  distribution known as flatness. The deviation from
                  the -5/3 power law has been attributed to the
                  increased mean values of, (i) the coefficient of
                  variation of energy, and (ii) the flatness factor,
                  in the inertial subrange. The decomposition of the
                  instantaneous momentum Bur time series reveals that
                  the major contribution to the total flux arises from
                  the large eddies. The quadrant analysis of the
                  momentum flux shows that ejections and sweeps
                  account for a substantial part of the total
                  flux. and quantifies the relative importance of the

                  scales corresponding to periods of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,

                  variability of modes in AISMR and SOI. The 2 and 8
                  year modes in both are found to exhibit low
                  frequency modulation. The 4 year mode in both showed

                  activities of 2, 4 and 8 year modes were associated
                  with a large/low number of deficient AISMR
                  years. The SOI derived from 2, 4 and 8 year modes in
                  the ENSO years, is found to be related to AISMR
                  variability, at 1% level of significance. The 2, 4
                  and 8 year modes in AISMR and SOI are found to be
                  correlated at a 5% level of significance. There is a
                  large temporal variability in the correlations of
                  these modes. The occurrences of maxima and minima in
                  these correlations followed a sequence, first in the
                  8 year mode, then in the 4 year mode and in the end,
                  in the 2 year mode. The reasons for de-association
                  between AISMR activity and SOI in the last 8 years
                  of the present decade have been attributed to (i)
                  the negative contributions by 128, 64, 32 and 16
                  year modes, (ii) the low activity of 4 and 8 year

                 wavelet family called the Galilean wavelet has been
                 designed to tune to four main parameters namely the
                 scale, the spatio-temporal position, the spatial
                 orientation, and the velocity. The paper starts with
                 the theory of motion-compensated wavelet filtering in
                 the discrete realm of image processing. As a major
                 difference to multi-dimensional homogeneous spaces, the
                 spatio-temporal signals involve motions that warp the
                 signal along the temporal dimension. Modeling motion
                 with 2-D affine transformations leads to
                 spatio-temporal generalizations. Decomposition in to
                 elementary operators lead to developing transformation
                 groups and exploiting the related representation
                 theory. The construction of continuous spatio-temporal
                 wavelets in $R^n \times R$ spaces is then handled with
                 classical techniques of calculation. Close connections
                 may then be established among all the spatio-temp oral
                 wavelet transforms through different sets of
                 transformations. This approachgenerates a general
                 framework for the study of future tools. Frames of
                 wavelets are thereafter investigated to revisit
                 discrete wavelet transforms in a more general way.
                 Eventually illustrations demonstrate the ability of the
                 Galilean wavelet transforms to analyze spatio-temporal

  abstract =     "Addresses the problem of the sensitivity of wavelet
                 representations to translations for two-dimensional
                 signals. The authors describe a fast algorithm to
                 calculate the two-dimensional wavelet transforms for
                 all the circular translates of an input image. They
                 select the optimal translate for the decomposition

                 low-variance spectrum estimate of a non-stationary data
                 process. The `multiwavelet' algorithm uses, within each
                 frequency band, a number of mutually orthogonal Slepian
                 wavelets, optimally concentrated in frequency. The sum
                 of squared wavelet transforms with the Slepian wavelets
                 results in a spectrum estimate that is both
                 low-variance and resistant to broad-band bias. The
                 multiwavelet algorithm is used to estimate the
                 time-varying spectral density matrix S(f,t) for two or
                 more time series, in particular for three-component
                 seismic data. Coherent three-component motion is
                 described by motion along a single trajectory, with
                 appropriate projections onto the three component axes.
                 This trajectory is found by applying a singular value
                 decomposition (SVD) to a matrix M(f,t) of wavelet
                 transform values. The normalized first singular value
                 of the SVD determines whether a correlation among the
                 three components of the seismogram is statistically
                 significant. Where significant, coherent particle
                 motion is reconstructed by a linear combination of the
                 wavelets with coefficients specified by the first
                 left-singular vector. The polarization of this motion
                 with respect to the coordinate axes is given by the
                 first right-singular vector. Where the wavelets are
                 real-valued, the usefulness of this method is limited
                 to cases in which the three components of the seismic
                 record oscillate in phase with each other, as is often
                 the case for seismic body waves. Elliptical
                 polarization is handled by pairing even and odd Slepian
                 wavelets into complex-valued wavelets, capable of
                 detecting phase shifts between components. The authors
                 demonstrate the multiwavelet spectrum and polarization
                 estimators on seismic data from a large shallow
                 earthquake in the Solomon Islands, and from the deep
                 earthquakes beneath Fiji (1994 March 9) and Bolivia

                  space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional
                  functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal

                 noise background which arises from temporal
                 persistence. This background is estimated by a 'robust'
                 procedure that, unlike conventional techniques, is
                 largely unbiased by the presence of signals immersed in
                 the noise. Making use of multiple-taper spectral
                 analysis methods, the technique further provides for a
                 distinction between purely harmonic (periodic) signals,
                 and broader-band ('quasiperiodic') signals. The
                 effectiveness of our signal detection procedure is
                 demonstrated with synthetic examples that simulate a
                 variety of possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals

                 sediment core reveals significant periodic components
                 at known astronomical forcing periodicities and a
                 significant quasiperiodic 100 year peak. Analysis of a
                 roughly 1500 year tree-ring reconstruction of
                 Scandinavian summer temperatures suggests significant
                 quasiperiodic signals on a near-century timescale, an
                 interdecadal 16-18 year timescale, within the
                 interannual El Ninio/Southem Oscillation (ENSO) band,
                 and on a quasibiennial timescale. Analysis of the 144
                 year record of Great Salt Lake monthly volume change
                 reveals a significant broad band of significant
                 interdecadal variability, ENSO-timescale peaks, an
                 annual cycle and its harmonics. Focusing in detail on
                 the historical estimated global-average surface
                 temperature record, we find a highly significant
                 secular trend relative to the estimated red noise
                 background, and weakly significant quasiperiodic
                 signals within the ENSO band. Decadal and quasibiennial

                 octave band filters such that the width of each band as
                 a proportion of its center frequency is constant. A
                 long-memory process having a power spectrum that plots
                 as a straight line on log-frequency/log-power scales
                 over many octaves of frequency is intrinsically related
                 to such a structure. As an example of such processes,
                 we focus on one class of discrete-time, stationary,
                 long-memory processes, the fractionally differenced
                 Gaussian white noise processes (fdGn). We show how the
                 DWT breaks down a fdGn, and show the exact correlation
                 structure of the resulting coefficients for different
                 wavelets (Daubechies' minimum-phase and
                 least-asymmetric and Haar). The DWT is an impressive
                 ``whitening filter.'' A discrete wavelet-based scheme
                 for simulating fdGn's is discussed and is shown to be
                 equivalent to a spectral decomposition of the
                 covariance matrix of the process; however, it can be
                 carried out using only information on the nature of the
                 spectrum of the process --- that is, time-domain
                 information is not required. It produces results
                 comparable with theexact Hosking method. We then show
                 that, using wavelet methods, the spectral slope
                 parameter $d$ can be estimated as well, or better, than
                 when using the best Fourier-based method known to us,
                 namely regression on multitaper spectral ordinates.
                 Since wavelet analysis and synthesis methods can be
                 applied to a much wider variety of empirical or
                 theoretical long-memory processes, wavelet methods
                 could prove a valuable tool in the future in the

                 flux of kinetic energy through scale r at position x.
                 The discrete version of e(r,x) is computed from
                 laboratory one-dimensional velocity signals in a
                 boundary layer and in a turbulent wake behind a
                 circular cylinder. The author also computes (r,x),
                 t(r,x) and pi (r,x) from three-dimensional velocity
                 fields obtained from direct numerical simulations. His
                 findings are that the localized kinetic energies become
                 very intermittent in x at small scales and exhibit
                 multifractal scaling. The transfer and flux of kinetic
                 energy are found to fluctuate greatly in physical space
                 for scales between the energy containing scale and the
                 dissipative scale.",

                 not necessarily Gaussian, stochastic process, which is
                 stationary in the wide sense. It is known in the case
                 of Gaussian regression that these estimators outperform
                 traditional linear methods if the degree of smoothness
                 of the regression function varies considerably over the
                 interval of interest. Such methods are based on a
                 nonlinear treatment of empirical coefficients that
                 arise from an orthonormal series expansion according to
                 a wavelet basis. The main goal of this paper is to
                 transfer these methods to spectral density estimation.
                 This is done by showing the asymptotic normality of
                 certain empirical coefficients based on the tapered
                 periodogram.Using these results we can show the risk
                 equivalence to the Gaussian case for monotone
                 estimators based on such empirical coefficients. The
                 resulting estimator of f keeps all interesting
                 properties such as high spatial adaptivity that are
                 already known for wavelet estimators in the case of
                 Gaussian regression. It turns out that appropriately
                 tuned versions of this estimator attain the optimal
                 uniform rate of convergence of their L 2 risk in a wide
                 variety of Besov smoothness classes, including classes
                 where linear estimators (kernel, spline) are not able
                 to attain this rate. Some simulations indicate the

                 wavelets have the simple structure w(x)=(exp(i4 pi

                 noise processes. Based on these, various techniques for
                 estimating the properties of such processes have been
                 developed. This paper provides theoretical analysis of
                 a new wavelet-based approach which has the advantages
                 of having low computational complexity and being able
                 to handle the case where the 1/f(gamma) noise might be
                 embedded in a further white-noise process. However, the
                 analysis conducted here shows that these advantages are
                 balanced by the fact that the wavelet-based scheme is
                 only consistent for spectral exponents gamma in the
                 range gamma is an element of (0, 1). This is in
                 contradiction to the results suggested in previous
                 empirical studies. When gamma is an element of (0, 1)
                 this paper also establishes that wavelet-based
                 maximum-likelihood methods are asymptotically Gaussian
                 and efficient. Finally, the asymptotic rate of
                 mean-square convergence of the parameter estimates Is
                 established and is shown to slow as gamma approaches
                 one. Combined with a survey of non-wavelet-based
                 methods, these new results give a perspective on the
                 various tradeoffs to be considered when modeling and

                  field by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is
                  studied. We show how the Fourier power spectrum can
                  be detected by using the wavelet function
                  coefficients (WFC) of the DWT. This method can
                  successfully measure the power spectrum in samples
                  for which traditional methods often fail because the
                  samples are finite sized, have a complex geometry,
                  or are varyingly sampled. We demonstrate that the
                  spectrum features, such as the power law index, the
                  magnitude, and the typical scales can be determined
                  by the DWT reconstructed spectrum. We apply this
                  method to analyze the power spectrum of the spatial
                  distribution of the Ly-alpha clouds. The two popular
                  data sets used for the spectrum detection have quite
                  different geometries and samplings, yet the
                  one-dimensional (1D) power spectra and their 3D
                  reconstruction given by the DWT estimator show the
                  same features. The analysis makes clear that the DWT
                  estimator is a sensitive tool in revealing common

                  proposed as a technique for studying nonstationary
                  signals. By simulated data it. was revealed that the
                  Morlet wavelet transform is especially convenient
                  for analyzing signals with: (I) a wide range of
                  dominant frequencies which are-localized in

                 We consider two estimators of the wavelet variance: the
                 first based upon the discrete wavelet transform, and
                 the second, called the maximal-overlap estimator, based
                 upon a filtering interpretation of wavelets. We
                 determine the large sample distribution for both
                 estimatorsand show that the maximal-overlap estimator
                 ismore efficient for a class of processes of interest
                 in the physical sciences. We discuss methods for
                 determining an approximate confidence interval for the
                 wavelet variance. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo
                 experiments that the large sample distribution for the
                 maximal-overlap estimator is a reasonable approximation
                 even for the moderate sample size of 128 observations.

                  economical by taking advantage of multiresolution
                  analysis, it has insufficient resolution in both
                  scale and location to resolve detailed information
                  of turbulence structures. Lacking in resolution, the
                  energy at a particular frequency (or wavelength) may
                  leak into neighboring frequencies and may pass down
                  to smaller scales to produce an artificial
                  ``cascade'' of energy (with a slope close to

                  important to the wavelet spectrum, especially in the

                  structures, since the method most accurately senses
                  energy contained in pulses that have a similar
                  pattern to the wavelet function. To use the method
                  as a filter can be problematic owing to the low
                  resolution of the orthonormal wavelet transform;
                  nonorthonormal wavelet analysis should be employed
                  when high resolution is important. When orthonormal

                  applies a phase shift in the Fourier domain to deduce 
                  a scalar wavefield at one depth level given its value 
                  at another. The phase-shift operator varies with 
                  frequency and wavenumber, and assumes constant 
                  velocity across the extrapolation step. We use 
                  nonstationary filter theory to generalize this method 
                  to nonstationary phase shift (NSPS), which allows the 
                  phase shift to vary laterally depending upon the local 
                  propagation velocity. For comparison, we derive an 
                  analytic form for the popular phase shift plus 
                  interpolation (PSPI) method in the limit of an 
                  exhaustive set of reference velocities. NSPS and this 
                  limiting form of PSPI can be written as generalized 
                  Fourier integrals which reduce to ordinary phase shift 
                  in the constant velocity limit. In the (x, omega) 
                  domain, these processes are the transpose of each 
                  other; however, only NSPS has the physical 
                  interpretation of forming the scaled, linear 
                  superposition of laterally-variable impulse responses 
                  (i.e., Huygen's wavelets).The difference between NSPS 
                  and PSPI is clear when they are compared in the case 
                  of a piecewise constant velocity variation. Define a 
                  set of windows such that the jth window is unity when 
                  the propagation velocity is the jth distinct velocity 
                  and is zero otherwise. NSPS can be computed by applying 
                  the window set to the input data to create a set of 
                  windowed wavefields, which are individually phase-shift 
                  extrapolated with the corresponding constant velocity, 
                  and the extrapolated set is superimposed. PSPI proceeds 
                  by phase-shift extrapolating the input data for each 
                  distinct velocity, applying the jth window to the jth 
                  extrapolation, and superimposing. Though neither 
                  process is fully correct, PSPI has the unphysical limit 
                  that discontinuities in the lateral velocity variation 
                  cause discontinuities in the wavefield, whereas NSPS 
                  shows the expected wavefront ``healing.'' We then 
                  formulate a finite aperture compensation for NSPS which 
                  has the practical result of absorbing lateral boundaries 
                  for all incidence angles. Wavefield extrapolation can be 
                  regarded as the crosscorrelation of the wavefield with 
                  the expected response of a point diffractor at the new 
                  depth level. Aperture compensation simply applies a 
                  laterally varying window to the infinite, theoretical 
                  diffraction response. The crosscorrelation becomes 
                  spatially variant, even for constant velocity, and hence 
                  is a nonstationary filter. The nonstationary effects of 
                  aperture compensation can be simultaneously applied with 
                  the NSPS extrapolation through a laterally variable 
                  velocity field.",

                  be useful tools for statistical signal and image
                  processing. The hidden Markov tree model captures
                  the key features of the joint density of the wavelet
                  coefficients of real-world data. One potential
                  drawback to the HMT framework is the need for
                  computationally expensive iterative training. In
                  this paper, we prose two reduced-parameter HMT
                  models that capture the class of real-world
                  images. In the image HMT (iHMT) model we use the
                  fact that for a large class of images the structure
                  of the HMT is self-similar across scale. This allows
                  us to reduce the complexity of the iHMT to just nine
                  easily trained parameters. In the universal HMT
                  (uHMT) we take a Bayesian approach and fix these
                  nine parameters. The uHMT requires no training of
                  any kind. While simple, we show using a series of
                  image estimation/denoising experiments that these
                  two new models retain nearly all of the key
                  structure modeled by the full HMT. Finally, we
                  propose a fast shift-invariant HMT estimation
                  algorithm that outperforms all other wavelet- based
                  estimators in the current literature, both in mean-

                  wavelet spectral analysis. Wavelet spectra from the
                  specific streamflow series are obtained for outflow
                  binned at 3 degrees-length segments along the border

  abstract =     "Statistical independence is one of the most desirable 
                  properties of a coordinate system for representing and
                  modeling images. In reality, however, truly independent 
                  coordinates may not exist for a given set of images, or
                  it may be too difficult to compute them in practice. 
                  Therefore, it makes sense to obtain the least
                  statistically-dependent coordinate system efficiently. 
                  To achieve this goal, we use the best-basis algorithm 
                  with new criterion that can rapidly select the least 
                  statistically-dependent basis (LSDB) from a basis 
                  dictionary (e.g., the local cosine or wavelet packet 
                  dictionaries) containing a huge number of orthonormal 
                  (or biorthogonal) bases. Our new basis selection 
                  criterion is minimization of the mutual information of 
                  the distributions of the basis coefficients as a 
                  measure of statistical dependence, which in turn is 
                  equivalent to minimization of the sum of the 
                  differential entropy of each coordinate in the basis 
                  dictionary. We show that this criterion, combined with 
                  the best-basis algorithm, can find the coordinates 
                  closest to the statistical independence from all 
                  possible bases searchable in a basis dictionary with 
                  O(n [log n]^p), where n is the dimensionality of the 
                  image (the number of pixels in each image), and p=1 for 
                  the wavelet packet dictionaries, and p=2 for the local 
                  cosine/sine dictionaries.  In this sense, we can view 
                  this LSDB algorithm as the best-basis version of the 
                  Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which is 
                  increasingly gaining popularity. This criterion is 
                  different from that of the Joint Best Basis (JBB) 
                  proposed by Wickerhauser, which can be viewed as the 
                  best-basis version of the Karhunen-Loeve basis (KLB). 
                  We demonstrate the application of the LSDB to image 
                  approximation and modeling and compare its performance 
                  with that of KLB and JBB using a collection of real 
                  geophysical acoustic waveforms and an image database 
                  of human faces. For these datasets, the LSDB provides 
                  the best approximation in terms of the average relative 
                  l^2 errors among various bases including the KLB, JBB, 
                  DCT, and wavelet basis. For image modeling, we propose 
                  two simple stochastic models for a given class of 
                  signals or images based on the LSDB coordinates. The 
                  first model is to assume the statistical independence 
                  among the LSDB coordinates, which allows us to sample 
                  typical coefficients of each coordinate separately 
                  using the empirical distribution estimated from the 
                  available training coefficients of that coordinate, 
                  which in turn easily allows us to simulate new images 
                  at our disposal. For the geophysical acoustic 
                  waveforms, this first model turned out to be good 
                  enough. The second model is based on the ``second 
                  rotation'' by the KLB computed from the top m LSDB 
                  coordinates. This model gives us the decorrelated 
                  coordinates built on top of the LSDB coordinates. 
                  The simulation results on the human face database 
                  using the second model suggest that this second 
                  rotation can further reduce the statistical 
                  dependency among the coordinates, and allows better 
                  modeling for a class of complicated images.",

  abstract =     "If a stochastic process can be regarded as a
                 superposition of the wavelets which arise randomly and
                 independently of one another, the random-wavelet
                 picture of a stochastic process is intuitive and
                 convenient. This paper investigates theoretically in
                 what case the picture can be used; i.e., in what case
                 the autocorrelation of the stochastic process can be
                 diagonalized by using the over-complete wavelet system.
                 A general method for calculating the pseudodiagonal
                 form from an arbitrarily given autocorrelation function
                 using the operator algebra is proposed. Next, some
                 properties of stationary wavelet-diagonal processes are
                 investigated where it is shown that the power spectra
                 of these processes are related to the spectral
                 estimates under the circumstances in which the number
                 of the time points are constrained to a constant finite
                 number.",

                  has been shown to have asymptotic near-optimality
                  properties over a wide class of functions. As
                  originally formulated by Donoho and Johnstone,
                  WaveShrink assumes equally spaced data. Because so
                  many statistical applications (e.g., scatterplot
                  smoothing) naturally involve unequally spaced data,
                  we investigate in this paper how WaveShrink can be
                  adapted to handle such data. Focusing on the Haar
                  wavelet, we propose four approaches that extend the
                  Haar wavelet transform to the unequally spaced
                  case. Each approach is formulated in terms of
                  continuous wavelet basis functions applied to a
                  piecewise constant interpolation of the observed
                  data, and each approach leads to wavelet
                  coefficients that can be computed via a matrix
                  transform of the original data. For each approach,
                  we propose a practical way of adapting
                  WaveShrink. We compare the four approaches in a
                  Monte Carlo study and find them to be quite
                  comparable in performance. The computationally
                  simplest approach (isometric wavelets) has an
                  appealing justification in terms of a weighted mean
                  square error criterion and readily generalizes to
                  wavelets of higher order than the Haar.",

                  orthogonal scaling function to support such a
                  sampling theorem, the scaling function must be
                  cardinal (interpolating). They also showed that the
                  only orthogonal scaling function that is both
                  cardinal and of compact support is the Haar
                  function, which is not continuous, This paper
                  addresses the same question, but in the multiwavelet
                  context, where the situation is different. This
                  paper presents the construction of compactly
                  supported orthogonal multiscaling functions that are
                  continuously differentiable and cardinal. The
                  scaling functions thereby support a Shannon-like
                  sampling theorem, Such wavelet bases are appealing
                  because the initialization of the discrete wavelet
                  transform (prefiltering) is the identity operator.",

                  carried out by filterbank iteration; however, for a
                  fixed number of zero moments, this does not yield a
                  discrete-time basis that is optimal with respect to
                  time localization. This paper discusses the
                  implementation and properties of an orthogonal DWT,
                  with two zero moments and with improved time
                  localization. The basis is not based on filterbank
                  iteration; instead, different filters are used for
                  each scale. For coarse scales, the support of the
                  discrete-time basis functions approaches two thirds
                  that of the corresponding functions obtained by
                  filterbank iteration, This basis, which is a special
                  case of a class of bases described by Alpert,
                  retains the octave-hand characteristic and is
                  piecewise linear (but discontinuous). Closed-form
                  expressions for the filters are given, an efficient
                  implementation of the transform is described, and

                  the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under
                  translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms
                  are also unstable with respect to dilations of the
                  input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of
                  the input signal. The authors formalize these
                  problems by defining a type of translation
                  invariance called shiftability. In the spatial
                  domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of
                  aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the
                  property holds are specified by the sampling
                  theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the
                  context of other domains, particularly orientation
                  and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are
                  simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are

                 and shape variability and because the background
                 mammogram texture is typically inhomogeneous. We
                 develop a two-stage method based on wavelet transforms
                 for detecting and segmenting calcifications. The first
                 stage is based on an undecimated wavelet transform,
                 which is simply the conventional filter bank
                 implementation without downsampling, so that the
                 low-low (LL), low-high (LH), high-low (HL), and
                 high-high (HH) sub-bands remain at full size. Detection
                 takes place in HH and the combination LH+HL. Four
                 octaves are computed with two inter- octave voices for
                 finer scale resolution. By appropriate selection of the
                 wavelet basis the detection of microcalcifications in
                 the relevant size range can be nearly optimized. In
                 fact, the filters which transform the input image into
                 HH and LH+HL are closely related to prewhitening
                 matched filters for detecting Gaussian objects
                 (idealized microcalcifications) in two common forms of
                 Markov (background) noise. The second stage is designed
                 to overcome the limitations of the simplistic Gaussian
                 assumption and provides an accurate segmentation of
                 calcification boundaries. Detected pixel sites in HH
                 and LH+HL are dilated then weighted before computing
                 the inverse wavelet transform. Individual
                 microcalcifications are greatly enhanced in the output
                 image, to the point where straightforward thresholding
                 can be applied to segment them. FROC curves are
                 computed from tests using a freely distributed database
                 of digitized mammograms.",

                 offers a clear and easy-to-understand introduction to
                 two central ideas -- filter banks for discrete signals,
                 and wavelets. The connections are fully explained --
                 the wavelet is determined by a choice of filter
                 coefficients. All important wavelet properties
                 (orthogonality or biorthogonality, symmetry, accuracy
                 of approximation, and smoothness) come from specific
                 properties of the filters. The text shows how to
                 construct those filters and wavelets. The applications
                 are very widespread -- and they continue to develop
                 rapidly. The book gives a direct approach to signal
                 processing and image processing through filter banks
                 that iterate on the lowpass filter (this is the wavelet
                 idea). Blocking and ringing artifacts are analyzed,
                 along with many MATLAB applications. Wavelets and

                  databases of financial time series, their similarity

                  powerful technique which allows for the rapid
                  evaluation of similarity between time series in
                  large data bases. It is based on the orthonormal
                  decomposition of the time series into the Haar
                  basis. We demonstrate that this approach is capable
                  of providing estimates of the local slope of the
                  time series in the sequence of multi-resolution
                  steps. The Haar representation and a number of
                  related represenations derived from it are suitable

                 sacrifices as little as possible of both.

                 are presented and applied to signal compression, noise

                 further provided with interactive software (MATLAB) via
                 an internet accessible WEB site. Starting from basic
                 principles of signal representation with atomic
                 functions, a mathematically well founded theory of the
                 discretization of analog signals is developed. General
                 families are specialized to wavelet families and the

                  monsoon are shown to have undergone significant
                  interdecadal changes in variance and coherency over
                  the last 125 years. Wavelet analysis is applied to
                  indexes of equatorial Pacific sea surface
                  temperature (Nino3 SST), the Southern Oscillation
                  index, and all-India rainfall. Time series of 2-7-yr
                  variance indicate intervals of high ENSO-monsoon
                  variance (1875-1920 and 1960-90) and an interval of
                  low variance (1920-60). The ENSO-monsoon variance
                  also contains a modulation of ENSO-monsoon
                  amplitudes on a 12-20-yr timescale.The annual-cycle
                  (1 yr) variance time series of Nino3 SST and Indian
                  rainfall is negatively correlated with the
                  interannual ENSO signal. The 1-yr variance is larger
                  during 1935-60, suggesting a negative correlation
                  between annual-cycle variance and ENSO variance on
                  interdecadal timescales.The method of wavelet
                  coherency is applied to the ENSO and monsoon

                  to be highly coherent, especially during intervals
                  of high variance. The Nino3 SST and Indian rainfall
                  are approximately 180 degrees out of phase and show
                  a gradual increase in phase difference versus

                  data and models of the El Ni\~no-Southern
                  Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. In statistical
                  analyses this barrier manifests itself as a drop-off
                  in monthly persistence (lagged correlation) while in
                  coupled ocean-atmosphere models it appears as a
                  decrease in forecast skill. The persistence barrier
                  for ENSO indices is investigated using historical
                  sea surface temperature and sea level pressure
                  data. Simple statistical models are used to show
                  that the persistence barrier occurs because the
                  boreal spring is the transition time from one
                  climate state to another, when the `signal-to-noise'
                  of the system is lowest and the system is most
                  susceptible to perturbations. The strength of the
                  persistence barrier is shown to depend on the degree
                  of phase locking of the ENSO to the annual
                  cycle. The phase locking of the ENSO to the annual
                  cycle, as well as the ENSO variance, is shown to
                  vary on interdecadal time scales. During 1871--1920
                  and 1960--1990 the ENSO variance was high, while
                  during 1920--1950 the ENSO variance was low. Using
                  wavelet analysis, this interdecadal variability in
                  ENSO is shown to be correlated with changes in
                  Indian summer monsoon strength. Finally, the change
                  in persistence barrier strength between 1960--1979
                  and 1980--1995 is related to changes in the phase
                  locking of ENSO to the annual cycle. These changes
                  in persistence and phase locking appear to be
                  related to the increased forecast skill seen in
                  recent coupled ocean-atmosphere models.",

                 are yielding important insights into boundary-layer
                 processes. Wavelet analysis, however, has some as yet
                 undiscussed limitations: failure to recognize these can
                 lead to misinterpretation of wavelet analysis results.
                 Here we discuss some limitations of wavelet analysis
                 when applied to nonstationary turbulence. Our main
                 point is that the analysis wavelet must be carefully
                 matched to the phenomenon of interest, because wavelet
                 coefficients obscure significant information in the
                 signal being analyzed. For example, a wavelet that is a
                 second-difference operator can provide no information
                 on the linear trend in a turbulence signal. Wavelet
                 analysis also yields no meaningful information about
                 nonlinear behavior in a signal - contrary to claims in
                 the literature - because, at any instant, a wavelet is
                 a single-scale operator, while nonlinearity involves
                 instantaneous interactions among many scales.",

                  is shown to be unbiased and of minimum or close to
                  minimum variance for the scale parameter, and
                  asymptotically unbiased and efficient for the second
                  parameter. Through theoretical arguments and
                  numerical simulations it is shown that in practice,
                  even for small data sets, the bias is very small and
                  the variance close to optimal for both
                  parameters. Closed-form expressions are given for
                  the covariance matrix of the estimator as a function
                  of data length, and are shown by simulation to be
                  very accurate even when the technical idealizations
                  are not satisfied, Comparisons are made against two
                  maximum-likelihood estimators. In terms of
                  robustness and computational cost the wavelet
                  estimator is found to be clearly superior and
                  statistically its performance is comparable, We

  abstract =     "The fourth-order cumulant matching method has been
                 developed recently for estimating a mixed-phase wavelet
                 from a convolutional process. Matching between the
                 trace cumulant and the wavelet moment is done in a
                 minimum mean-squared error sense under the assumption
                 of a non-Gaussian, stationary, and statistically
                 independent reflectivity series. This leads to a highly
                 nonlinear optimization problem, usually solved by
                 techniques that require a certain degree of
                 linearization, and that invariably converge to the
                 minimum closest to the initial model. Alternatively, we
                 propose a hybrid strategy that makes use of a simulated
                 annealing algorithm to provide reliability of the
                 numerical solutions by reducing the risk of being
                 trapped in local minima. Beyond the numerical aspect,
                 the reliability of the derived wavelets depends
                 strongly on the amount of data available. However, by
                 using a multidimensional taper to smooth the trace
                 cumulant, we show that the method can be used even in a
                 trace-by-trace implementation, which is very important
                 from the point of view of stationarity and consistency.
                 We demonstrate the viability of the method under
                 several reflectivity models. Finally, we illustrate the
                 hybrid strategy using marine and held real data
                 examples. The consistency of the results is very
                 encouraging because the improved cumulant matching
                 strategy we describe can be effectively used with a
                 limited amount of data.",

                  introduced by Dahlhaus [2]. Allowing for departures
                  from stationary proves useful for modelling, e.g.,
                  transient phenomena, quasi-oscillating behaviour or
                  spectrum modulation. In contrast to classical
                  parametric and nonparametric (linear) approaches we

                  Unfortunately, the periodogram is a very poor estimate
                  when the true spectrum has a high dynamic range and/or
                  is rapidly varying. In addition, because the 
                  distribution of the log periodogram is markedly 
                  non-Gaussian, special wavelet-dependent thresholding 
                  schemes are needed.  These difficulties can be 
                  bypassed by starting with a multitaper spectrum 
                  estimator.  The logarithm of this estimator is close 
                  to Gaussian distributed if a moderate number (greater
                  than or equal to 5) of tapers are used. In contrast to 
                  the log periodogram, log multitaper estimates are not 
                  approximately pairwise uncorrelated at the Fourier 
                  frequencies, but the form of the correlation can be 
                  accurately and simply approximated.  For 
                  scale-independent thresholding, the correlation acts 
                  in accordance with the wavelet shrinkage paradigm to 
                  suppress small-scale `noise spikes' while leaving 
                  informative coarse scale coefficients relatively 
                  unattenuated. This simple approach to spectrum 
                  estimation is demonstrated to work very well in 
                  practice. Additionally, the progression of the 
                  variance of wavelet coefficients with scale can be 
                  accurately calculated, allowing the use of 
                  scale-dependent thresholds.  This more involved 
                  approach also works well in practice but is not

                  the area of ``denoising signals'' or nonparametric
                  regression. This thesis provides a new application
                  for the discrete wavelet transform, assessing
                  nonstationary events in time series -- especially
                  long memory processes. Long memory processes are
                  those which exhibit substantial correlations between
                  events separated by a long period of
                  time. Departures from stationarity in these heavily
                  autocorrelated time series, such as an abrupt change
                  in the variance at an unknown location or ``bursts''
                  of increased variability, can be detected and
                  accurately located using discrete wavelet transforms
                  -- both orthogonal and overcomplete. A cumulative
                  sum of squares method, utilizing a
                  Kolomogorov--Smirnov-type test statistic, and an
                  information criterion method are investigated. By
                  analyzing a time series on a scale by scale basis,
                  each scale corresponding to a range of frequencies,
                  the ability to detect and locate a sudden change in
                  the variance in the time series is introduced. Using
                  this same procedure to detect a change in the long
                  memory parameter is also investigated. Applications
                  involve the Nile River minimum water levels and
                  vertical ocean shear measurements. In the

                  spectrum of recorded time series have been
                  hypothesized to be nonstationary events; e.g., the
                  Madden--Julian oscillation. The Madden--Julian
                  oscillation is a result of large-scale circulation
                  cells oriented in the equatorial plane from the
                  Indean Ocean to the central Pacific. The oscillation
                  has been noted to have higher frequencies during
                  warm events in El Nino--Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
                  years. The concepts of wavelet covariance and
                  wavelet correlation are introduced and applied to
                  this problem as an alternative to cross-spectrum
                  analysis. The wavelet covariance is shown to

                  normality of estimators of the wavelet covariance
                  and correlation is shown in order to construct
                  approximate confidence intervals. Both quantities
                  are generalized into the wavelet cross-covariance
                  and cross-correlation in order to investigate
                  possible lead/lag relations in bivariate time
                  series. Atmospheric measurements (such as station
                  pressure and zonal wind speeds) from a single
                  station at Canton Island (2.8S, 171.7W) are analyzed
                  and nicely replicate the results found in Madden and
                  Julian (1971). To highlight that the wavelet methods
                  can provide insight over and above traditional
                  spectral methods (including multitaper techniques) a
                  daily ``Southern Oscillation Index'' and station
                  pressure series from Truk Island (7.4N, 151.8W) are
                  analyzed. The wavelet cross-covariance nicely
                  decomposes the usual cross-covariance into scales
                  which are more easily associated with physical
                  phenomena. The time-varying wavelet covariance is
                  used to show the increase in positive correlation
                  between the SOI and Truk Island station pressure in
                  the first half of each year versus latter half.",

                  the usefulness of the Allan-variance and its higher
                  dimensional generalization, the Delta-variance, for
                  the characterization of molecular cloud
                  structures. In this study we present the connection
                  between the Allan- and Delta-variance and a more
                  popular structure analysis tool: the wavelet
                  transform. We show that the Allan- and
                  Delta-variances are the variances of wavelet
                  transform coefficients.",

                 signals in the 1980s. Used to detect signals against
                 noise, wavelet analysis excels for transients or for

                 the renown WAVELET ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
                 Series, Efi Foufoula-Georgiou and Praveen Kumar begin
                 with a self-contained overview of the nature, power,
                 and scope of wavelet transforms. The eleven original
                 papers that follow in this edited treatise show how
                 geophysical researchers are using wavelets to analyze
                 such diverse phenomena as intermittent atmospheric
                 turbulence, seafloor bathymetry, marine and other
                 seismic data, and flow in aquifiers. Wavelets in
                 Geophysics will make informative reading for

                 of statistics, astronomy and meteorology together to
                 discuss and formalize important problems. Applications

                 time series and to its applications to astronomy,
                 meteorology and climatology. The topics covered include
                 detection of periodicities, spectral analysis of
                 unequally spaced data, detection of change points and
                 higher order spectral methods of non-linear and
                 non-Gaussian signals. Estimation of fractal dimension
                 and applications of wavelet methods to astronomy are
                 also considered. In addition, this book includes a
                 floppy disc containing data sets to serve as a
                 benchmark series. Applications of Time Series Analysis
                 in Astronomy and Meteorology is of interest to
