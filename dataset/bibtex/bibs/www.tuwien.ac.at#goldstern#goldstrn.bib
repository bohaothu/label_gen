	be said about the distribution of the quotients 
	$a_{n+1}/a_n$ modulo 1?  
	If the characteristic polynomial has a unique largest root, then
	of course the sequence of quotients converges to that root. 
	Otherwise, it turns out that there is a continuous distribution
	function.   In the case of two or three roots of largest 
	absolute value, this function we compute this function explicitly. 
	[Surprisingly, sometimes the case of three roots can be reduced
	to the case of two roots.]
