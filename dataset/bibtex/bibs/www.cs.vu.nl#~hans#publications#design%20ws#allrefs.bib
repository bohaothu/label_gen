  review = {This paper assesses the available information about Web 2.0 to interpret
	its notion. 
	
	
	Though recognizing that the definition of Web 2.0 remains elusive,
	Clarke~\cite{Clarke2008} identifies four key aspects of Web 2.0 from
	the marketing perspective: syndication of (1) content, (2) advertising,
	(3) storage and (4) effort. There, {\em syndication} refers to the
	loose, unincorporated affiliation of people or companies, and the
	loose distribution of media material.
	
	
	In its essence, the central aspect of Web 2.0 is the transformation
	of the Web into a global platform for information sharing (corresponding
	to content syndication) coupled with the ability of both individuals
	and organizations to contribute new information and modify existing
	one. This led to cascading effects, like open access to any type
	of resources, new business models, and new privacy and ethical concerns.
	
	
	In Clarke's classification, effort syndication is especially relevant
	for AKM communities. He observes that individuals perceive themselves
	as participating to a community, whereas their efforts and behavious
	are part of an economy being used (either officially or unofficially)
	for profit. The communitarial perspective implies a fifth key aspect
	of Web 2.0 termed {\em social syndication}, this embracing "cross-leveraging
	and collaboration of content, effort and infrastucture".},

	services, along with a cost model that charges consumers based on

	on this objective: consumers are able to rent infrastructure in the

	as needed, deploy applications and store data, and access them via

	protocols on a pay-per-use basis. The acceptance of Cloud Computing,

	sumers to implement a model for business value co-creation. Therefore,
	
	a systematic approach to measure costs and bene
ts of Cloud Comput-
	
	ing is needed. In this paper, we discuss the need for valuation of
	Cloud
	
	Computing, identify key components, and structure these components
	
	in a framework. The framework assists decision makers in estimating
	
	Cloud Computing costs and to compare these costs to conventional IT

	framework can be applied to real world scenarios.},

	wikis wer meant for the generasl public --to gather content bottom-up,
	delegate control on content to its contributors and reach consensus.
	By making available information about contributors, wikis can link
	people with common interests. Wiki systems are very suitable to describe
	best practices, gather and structure information like vocabularies
	and taxonomies. Limitations include the fact that wikis typically
	lack referees or peer reviews. This can lead to potentially inaccurate
	information. Nonetheless, some limitations are mitigated by new wiki
	systems that include features, like the ability to control changes
	by alerting the original contributors, or people interested in a
	particular subject. and by cathegorizing contributors by reliability
