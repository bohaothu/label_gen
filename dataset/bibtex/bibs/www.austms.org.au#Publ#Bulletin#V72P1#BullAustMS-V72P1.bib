 abstract={ We study here the poset $DP(X)$ of density preserving continuous maps defined on a Hausdorff space $X$ and show that it is a complete lattice for a compact Hausdorff space without isolated points. We further show that for countably compact $T_3$ spaces $X$ and $Y$ without isolated points, $DP(X)$ and $DP(Y)$ are order isomorphic if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. Finally, Magill's result on the remainder of a locally compact Hausdorff space is deduced from the relation of $DP(X)$ with posets $IP(X)$ of covering maps and $E_K(X)$ of compactifications respectively. }

 abstract={ We consider the analogue of the fixed point theorem of A. Borel in the context of Tate cohomology. We show that for general compact Lie groups $G$ the Tate cohomology of a $G$-CW complex $X$ with coefficients in a field of characteristic $0$ is in general not isomorphic to the cohomology of the fixed point set, and thus the fixed point theorem does not apply. Instead, the following excision theorem is valid: if $X'$ is the subcomplex of all $G$-cells of orbit type $G/H$ where $\dim H>0$, and $V$ is a ring such that for every finite isotropy group $H$ the order $|H|$ is invertible in $V$, then $\widehat {H}^*_G(X;V)\cong \widehat {H}^*_G(X';V)$. In the special cases $G=\TT $, the circle group, and $G=\UU $, the group of unit quaternions, a more elementary geometric proof, using a cellular model of $\widehat {H}^*_\UU $ is given. }

In other words, existence of a unique line joining two distinct points implies continuity of join and intersection. For linear spaces with an open disk as point set, the same result was proved by Skornyakov. }

We show that the semigroups of full transformations, partial transformations and binary relations on an infinite set each have cyclic diagonal right and left acts. The semigroup of full finite-to-one transformations on an infinite set has a cyclic diagonal right act but its diagonal left act is not finitely generated. The semigroup of partial injections on an infinite set has neither finitely generated diagonal right nor left act, but has a cyclic diagonal bi-act. The semigroup of bijections (symmetric group) on an infinite set does not have any finitely generated diagonal acts. }

 abstract={A theorem independently due to A.I. Shirshov and E. Witt asserts that every subalgebra of a free Lie algebra (over a field) is free. The main step in Shirshov's proof is a little known but rather remarkable result: if a set of homogeneous elements in a free Lie algebra has the property that no element of it is contained in the subalgebra generated by the other elements, then this subset is a free generating set for the subalgebra it generates. Witt also proved that every subalgebra of a free restricted Lie algebra is free. Later G.P. Kukin gave a proof of this theorem in which he adapted Shirshov's argument. The main step is similar, but it has come to light that its proof contains substantial gaps. Here we give a corrected proof of this main step in order to justify its applications elsewhere. }
