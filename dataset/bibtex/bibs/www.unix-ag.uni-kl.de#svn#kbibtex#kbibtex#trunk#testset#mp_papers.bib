We show that Monge-array results for two sum-of-edge-costs shortest-path problems can likewise be extended to a general algebraic setting, provided the problems' ordered commutative semigroup satisfies one additional restriction. In addition to this general result, we also show how our algorithms can be modified to solve certain bottleneck shortest-path problems, even though the ordered commutative semigroup naturally associated with bottleneck problems does not satisfy our additional restriction. We show how our bottleneck shortest-path techniques can be used to obtain fast algorithms for a variant of Hirschberg and Larmore's optimal paragraph formation problem, and a special case of the bottleneck traveling-salesman problem.",

	abstract = "Summary: In traditional multi-commodity flow theory, the task is to send a certain amount of each commodity from its start to its target node, subject to capacity constraints on the edges. However, no restriction is imposed on the number of paths used for delivering each commodity; it is thus feasible to spread the flow over a large number of different paths. Motivated by routing problems arising in real-life applications, such as, e.g., telecommunication, unsplittable flows have moved into the focus of research. Here, the demand of each commodity may not be split but has to be sent along a single path. \par In this paper, a generalization of this problem is studied. In the considered flow model, a commodity can be split into a bounded number of chunks which can then be routed on different paths. In contrast to classical (splittable) flows and unsplittable flows, already the single-commodity case of this problem is NP-hard and even hard to approximate. We present approximation algorithms for the single- and multi-commodity case and point out strong connections to unsplittable flows. Moreover, results on the hardness of approximation are presented. In particular, we show that some of our approximation results are in fact best possible, unless P=NP.",

If the cardinality of a matching is maximum then the matching is called maximum and if a maximum matching covers all the vertices of $G$ then it is called perfect. Matching problems received a lot of attentions in the last decades since in addition to their theoretical interest, they have many practical applications in object recognition, routing.\dots{} Many sequential and parallel algorithms were proposed for several graph families. \par Deterministic NC algorithms are not known for solving the perfect matching problem in general graphs. Actually, solving the perfect problem deterministically is considered as one of the outstanding problems in parallel computation. However, this problem turned out to be in NC for some special graph families: dense graph claw-free graphs, strongly chordal graphs, co-comparability graphs, cographs, bipartite and planar graphs with polynomially bounded number of perfect matchings, planar bipartite graphs and very sparse graphs. \par We present in this paper an NC algorithm for the perfect matching problem in cycle-free graphs to which a logarithmic number of edges are added. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some definitions related to the problem. Section 3 presents our algorithm: Subsection 3.1 introduces the theoretical foundations, subsection 3.2 gives a high level description of the algorithm and subsection 3.3 gives the pseudo-code of the algorithm. Section 4 gives the proof that our algorithm belongs to the class NC. At the end, we conclude in section 5.",

These algorithms run in linear time and, under certain assumptions about the probability distribution of edge capacities, obtain an optimal solution with high probability. The design of our algorithms is based on the following general method, which we call the mimicking method, for solving problems in which some of the input data are deterministic and some are random with a known distribution: (1) Replace each random variable in the problem by its expectation; this gives a deterministic problem instance that has a special form, making it particularly easy to solve; (2) Solve the resulting deterministic problem instance; (3) Taking into account the actual values of the random variables, mimic the solution of the deterministic instance to obtain a near-optimal solution to the original problem; (4) Fine-tune this suboptimal solution to obtain an optimal solution.\par We present linear time algorithms to compute a feasible flow in directed and undirected capacitated transportation problem instances. The algorithms are shown to be successful with high probability when the probability distribution of the input data satisfies certain assumptions. We also consider the maximum flow problem with multiple sources and sinks. We show that with high probability the minimum cut isolates either the sources or the sinks, and we give a linear-time algorithm that produces a maximum flow with high probability.",

For the latter situation, an idea used originally in parallel graph algorithms, to represent trees by Euler tours, leads to a simple implementation with a time of $O(\log n)$ per tree operation, where $n$ is the number of tree vertices. We apply this representation to the implementation of two versions of the network simplex algorithm, resulting in a time of $O(\log n)$ per pivot, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the problem network.",

Several other approaches have also been developed for simplifying the planarity test. In this paper, we developed a very simple linear time testing algorithm based only on a depth-first search tree. When the given graph is not planar, our algorithm immediately produces explicit Kuratowski subgraphs. A new data structure, PC-trees, is introduced, which can be viewed as abstract subembeddings of actual planar embeddings. A graph-reduction technique is adopted so that the embeddings for the planar biconnected components constructed at each iteration never have to be changed.

Next, we define the notion of a compression of a graph ${\cal G}$ and use the result on graph partitioning to efficiently compute an optimal compression for graphs of a given size. An interesting application of the graph compression result arises from the fact that several graph algorithms can be adapted to work with the compressed representation of the input graph, thereby improving the bound on their running times, particularly on dense graphs. This makes use of the trade- off result we obtain from our partitioning algorithm. The algorithms analyzed include those for matchings, vertex connectivity, edge connectivity, and shortest paths.

It is motivated by the well-known result of Erd s and Szekers which states that every permutation of $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$ has either an increasing or decreasing subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{n}$. The distributions considered here are $G(K_{n,n},\rho)$ which is the binomial random graph model with $0<\rho<1$, and $G_r(K_{n,n},l)$ which is the random $l$-regular graph model with $l$ a positive integer. Let $L_p(n)$ and $L_l(n)$ represent the size of the largest planar matching of a graph according to $G(K_{n,n},\rho)$ and $G_r(K_{n,n},l)$, respectively. The main result of this paper is the following result: ``If $k= o(n^{{1{\o}ver 4}})$, then $L_l(n)/\sqrt{kn}$ approaches 2 in probability as $n\to\infty$. Convergence in mean to the same limit holds if $l= O(1)$.''\par A good feature of this result is that the limiting constant can be obtained exactly. Furthermore for $l=1$ the distribution of $L_l(n)$ is equal to the distribution of the largest increasing subsequence of a randomly chosen permutation of $\{1,2,3,\dots, n\}$.",

First, given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we can test whether the graph has a unique perfect matching, and find it if it exists, in $O(m\log^4n)$ time. This algorithm uses a recent dynamic connectivity algorithm and an old result of Kotzig characterizing unique perfect matchings in terms of bridges. For the special case of planar graphs, we improve the algorithm to run in $O(n\log n)$ time. Second, given one perfect matching, we can test for the existence of another in linear time. This algorithm is a modification of Edmonds' blossom-shrinking algorithm implemented using depth-first search. A generalization of Kotzig's theorem proved by Jackson and Whitty allows us to give a modification of the first algorithm that tests whether a given graph has a unique $f$-factor, and find it if it exists. We also show how to modify the second algorithm to check whether a given $f$-factor is unique.\par Both extensions have the same time bounds as their perfect matching counterparts. For the weighted case, we can test in linear time whether a maximum-weight matching is unique, given the output from Edmonds' algorithm for computing such a matching. The method is an extension of our algorithm for the unweighted case.",

Let min(Match), max(Match), and $\Sigma$(Match) denote the length of the shortest edge, the length of the longest edge, and the sum of the lengths of the edges of Match, respectively. Bottleneck matching -- a matching that minimizes max(Match) -- is suggested as a convenient way for measuring the resemblance between $A$ and $B$. Several algorithms for computing, as well as approximating, this resemblance are proposed. The running time of all the algorithms involving planar objects is roughly $O(n^{1.5})$. For instance, if the objects are points in the plane, the running time of the exact algorithm is $O(n^{1.5}\log n)$. A semidynamic data structure for answering containment problems for a set of congruent disks in the plane is developed. This data structure may be of independent interest.\par Next, the problem of finding a translation of $B$ that maximizes the resemblance to $A$ under the bottleneck matching criterion is considered. When $A$ and $B$ are point-sets in the plane, an $O(n^5\log n)$-time algorithm for determining whether for some translated copy the resemblance gets below a given $\rho$ is presented, thus improving the previous result of Alt, Mehlhorn, Wagener, and Welzl by a factor of almost $n$. This result is used to compute the smallest such $\rho$ in time $O(n^5\log^2 n)$, and an efficient approximation scheme for this problem is also given.\par The un iform matching problem (also called the balanced assignment problem, or the fair matching problem) is to find $\textnormal{Match}^*_{\textnormal{U}}$, a matching that minimizes $\max(\textnormal{Match})- \min(\textnormal{Match})$. A minimum deviation matching $\textnormal{Match}^*_{\textnormal{D}}$ is a matching that minimizes $(1/n)\Sigma(\textnormal{Match})- \min(\textnormal{Match})$. Algorithms for computing $\textnormal{Match}^*_{\textnormal{U}}$ and $\textnormal{Match}^*_{\textnormal{D}}$ in roughly $O(n^{10/3})$ time are presented. These algorithms are more efficient than the previous $O(n^4)$ time algorithms of Martello, Pulleyblank, Toth, and de Werra, and of Gupta and Punnen, who studied these problems for general bipartite graphs.",

	 running times. Our results come close to achieving this goal, in that we present algorithms with a small additive
	 error in the length of the paths obtained. Our algorithms are easy to implement, have the desired property of being
	 combinatorial in nature, and the hidden constants in the running time bound are fairly small.\par Our main result is
	 an algorithm which solves the APSP problem in unweighted, undirected graphs with an additive error of 2 in time
	 $O(n^{2.5}\sqrt\log n)$. This algorithm returns actual paths and not just the distances. In addition, we give more
	 efficient algorithms with running time $O(n^{1.5} \sqrt{k \log n} + n^2 \log^2 n)$ for the case where we are only
	 required to determine shortest paths between $k$ specified pairs of vertices rather than all pairs of vertices. The
	 starting point for all our results is an $O(m \sqrt{n \log n})$ algorithm for distinguishing between graphs of
	 diameter 2 and 4, and this is later extended to obtaining a ratio 2/3 approximation to the diameter in time $O(m
	 \sqrt{n \log n} + n^2 \log n)$. Unlike in the case of APSP, our results for approximate diameter computation can be
	 extended to the case of directed graphs with arbitrary positive real weights on the edges.",

We consider the problem of finding small-stretch paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph $G$.\par It is easy to see that finding paths of stretch less than 2 between all pairs of vertices in an undirected graph with $n$ vertices is at least as hard as the Boolean multiplication of two $n\times n$ matrices. We describe three algorithms for finding small-stretch paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The first algorithm, $\textnormal{STRETCH}_2$, runs in $\widetilde O(n^{3/2} m^{1/2})$ time and finds stretch 2 paths. The second algorithm, $\textnormal{STRETCH}_{7/3}$, runs in $\widetilde O(n^{7/3})$ time and finds stretch $7/3$ paths. Finally, the third algorithm, $\textnormal{STRETCH}_3$, runs in $\widetilde O(n^2)$ and finds stretch $3$ paths.\par Our algorithms are simpler, more efficient and more accurate than the previously best algorithms for finding small-stretch paths.

For every unit of flow entering the arc, $\mu((v,w))$ units of flow exit. We present a strongly polynomial algorithm for a single-source generalized shortest paths problem, using a left-distributive closed semiring. This permits use of a dynamic-programming routine similar to the Bellman-Ford algorithm, given a guess for the value of the optimal solution. Using Megiddo's parametric search scheme, we can compute the optimal value in strongly polynomial time. The algorithm's running time $O(mn^2\log n)$ matches the previously best known, but the algorithm is simpler, is based on the well-known theory of closed semirings, and directly works with the given graph. All previous polynomial-time algorithms were based on interior-point methods or directly solved the dual problem and translated the solution back to the primal problem. Using this generalized shortest paths algorithm, we present fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the generalized versions of the maximum flow, the nonnegative-cost minimum-cost flow, the concurrent flow, the multicommodity maximum flow, and the multicommodity non negative-cost minimum-cost flow problems with running times independent of the size of the flow multipliers' representation.",

Provided that $w \geq (\log n)^{2+\varepsilon}$, for some fixed $\varepsilon>0$, the sorting can even be accomplished in linear expected time with a randomized algorithm. Both of our algorithms parallelize without loss on a unit-cost PRAM with a word length of $w$ bits. The first one yields an algorithm that uses $O(\log n)$ time and $O(n \log\log n)$ operations on a deterministic CRCW PRAM. The second one yields an algorithm that uses $O(\log n)$ expected time and $O(n)$ expected operations on a randomized EREW PRAM, provided that $w \geq (\log n)^{2+\varepsilon}$ for some fixed $\varepsilon>0$. Our deterministic and randomized sequential and parallel algorithms generalize to the lexicographic sorting problem of sorting multiple-precision integers represented in several words."

A simple argument shows that computing all distances in $G$ with an additive one-sided error of at most 1 is as hard as Boolean matrix multiplication. Building on recent work of {\it D. Aingworth, C. Chekuri, P. Indyk} and {\it R. Motwani} [SIAM J. Comput. 28, No. 4, 1167-1181 (1999; Zbl 0926.68093)], we describe an $\widetilde{O}(\min\{n^{3/2}m^{1/2},n^{7/3}\})$-time algorithm $\textnormal{{APASP}}_2$ for computing all distances in $G$ with an additive one-sided error of at most 2. Algorithm $\textnormal{APASP}_2$ is simple, easy to implement, and faster than the fastest known matrix-multiplication algorithm. Furthermore, for every even $k>2$, we describe an ${\widetilde{O}}(\min\{n^{2-{2}/{(k+2)}}m^{{2}/{(k+2)}}, n^{2+{2}/{(3k-2)}}\})$-time algorithm $\textnormal{APASP}_k$ for computing all distances in $G$ with an additive one-sided error of at most $k$. We also give an ${\widetilde{O}}(n^2)$-time algorithm $\textnormal{APASP}_\infty$ for producing stretch 3 estimated distances in an unweighted and undirected graph on $n$ vertices. No constant stretch factor was previously achieved in ${\widetilde{O}}(n^2)$ time.\par We say that a weighted graph $F=(V,E')$ $k$-emulates an unweighted graph $G=(V,E)$ if for every $u,v\in V$ we have $\delta_G(u,v){\l}e \delta_F(u,v){\l}e \delta_G(u,v)+k$. We show that every unweighted graph on $n$ vertices has a 2-emulator with ${\widetilde{O}}(n^{3/2})$ edges and a 4-emulator with ${\widetilde{O}}(n^{4/3})$ edges. These results are asymptotically tight.\par Finally, we show that any weighted undirected graph on $n$ vertices has a 3-spanner with ${\widetilde{O}}(n^{3/2})$ edges and that such a 3-spanner can be built in ${\widetilde{O}}(mn^{1/2})$ time. We also describe an ${\widetilde{O}}(n(m^{2/3}+n))$-time algorithm for estimating all distances in a weighted undirected graph on $n$ vertices with a stretch factor of at most 3.",

We present algorithms that compute paths of stretch $2{\l}eq t{\l}eq\log n$ on undirected graphs $G=(V,E)$ with nonnegative weights. The stretch $t$ is of the form $t=\beta(2+\varepsilon')$, where $\beta$ is integral and $\varepsilon'>0$ is at least as large as some fixed $\varepsilon>0$.

We present exponential improvements over previous bounds, and we show tight relations to sorting.\par Our first result is a RAM priority queue supporting \{$t$ find-min\} in constant time and \{$t$ insert\} and \{$t$ delete-min\} in time $O(\log \log n)$, where $n$ is the current number of keys in the queue. This is an exponential improvement over the $O(\sqrt\log{n})$ bound of {\it M. L. Fredman} and {\it D. E. Willard} [J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 47, No. 3, 424-436 (1993; Zbl 0795.68049)]. Plugging this priority queue into Dijkstra's algorithm gives an $O(m\log \log m)$ algorithm for the single source shortest path problem on a graph with $m$ edges, as compared with the previous $O(m\sqrt\log{m})$ bound based on Fredman and Willard's priority queue. The above bounds assume $O(n 2^\varepsilon w)$ space, where $w$ is the word length and $\varepsilon>0$. They can, however, be achieved in linear space using randomized hashing.\par Our second result is a general equivalence between sorting and priority queues. A priority queue is monotone if the minimum is nondecreasing over time, as in many greedy algorithms. We show that on a RAM, the amortized operation cost of a monotone priority queue is equivalent to the per-key cost of sorting. For example, the equivalence implies that the single source shortest paths problem on a graph with m edges is no harder than that of sorting $m$ keys. With the current RAM sorting, this gives an $O(m \log \log m)$ time bound, as above, but the relation holds regardless of the future developments in RAM sorting.\par From the equivalence result, for any fixed $\varepsilon>0$, we derive a randomized monotone $O({\sqrt\log n}^{1+\varepsilon})$ priority queue with expected constant time \{$t$ decrease-key\}. Plugging this into Dijkstra's algorithm gives an $O(n\sqrt{\log n}^{1+\varepsilon}+m)$ algorithm for the single source shortest path problem on a graph with n nodes and m edges, complementing the above $O(m\log \log m)$ algorithm if $m\gg n$. This improves the $O(n\log n/\log \log n + m)$ bound by {\it M. L. Fredman} and {\it D. E. Willard} [ibid. 48, No. 3, 533-551 (1994; Zbl 0806.68057)], based on their $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ priority queue with constant \{t decrease-key\}.",

	abstract = "Let $\{a_\mathbf{r} : \mathbf{r} \in (\mathbb{Z}^+)^d \}$ be a $d$-dimensional array of numbers, for which the generating function $F(\mathbf{z}) := \sum_\mathbf{r} a_\mathbf{r} \mathbf{z}^\mathbf{r}$ is meromorphic in a neighborhood of the origin. For example, $F$ may be a rational multivariate generating function. We discuss recent results that allow the effective computation of asymptotic expansions for the coefficients of $F$. Our purpose is to illustrate the use of these techniques on a variety of problems of combinatorial interest. The survey begins by summarizing previous work on the asymptotics of univariate and multivariate generating functions. Next we describe the Morse-theoretic underpinnings of some new asymptotic techniques. We then quote and summarize these results in such a way that only elementary analyses are needed to check hypotheses and carry out computations. The remainder of the survey focuses on combinatorial applications, such as enumeration of words with forbidden substrings, edges and cycles in graphs, polyominoes, and descents in permutations. After the individual examples, we discuss three broad classes of examples, namely functions derived via the transfer matrix method, those derived via the kernel method, and those derived via the method of Lagrange inversion. These methods have the property that generating functions derived from them are amenable to our asymptotic analyses, and we describe further machinery that facilitates computations for these classes of examples.

	abstract = "Basic path-matchings, introduced by Cunningham and Geelen (FOCS 1996), are a common generalization of matroid intersection and non-bipartite matching. The main results of this paper are a new algebraic characterization of basic path-matching problems and an algorithm for constructing basic path-matchings in $O(n^w)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $w$ is the exponent for matrix multiplication. Our algorithms are randomized, and our approach assumes that the given matroids are linear and can be represented over the same field. Our main results have interesting consequences for several special cases of path-matching problems. For matroid intersection, we obtain an algorithm with running time $O(nr^(w-1))=O(nr^1.38)$, where the matroids have $n$ elements and rank $r$. This improves the long-standing bound of $O(nr^1.62)$ due to Gabow and Xu (FOCS 1989). Also, we obtain a simple, purely algebraic algorithm for non-bipartite matching with running time $O(n^w)$. This resolves the central open problem of Mucha and Sankowski (FOCS 2004). ",

Explicit constructions of objects with such properties are often very difficult, or unknown. In computer science, probabilistic al- gorithms are sometimes simpler and more efficient than the best known deterministic algorithms for the same problem. Despite this evidence for the power of random choices, the computational theory of pseu- dorandomness shows that, under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions, every probabilistic algorithm has an efficient deterministic simulation and a large class of applications of the the probabilistic method can be converted into explicit constructions. In this survey paper we describe connections between the conditional ''derandomization'' results of the computational theory of pseudorandomness and unconditional explicit constructions of certain combinatorial objects such as error-correcting codes and ''randomness extractors.''",

We present upper bounds on the threshold width, and show that our bound is sharp for $d=1$ and at most a sublogarithmic factor away for $d\ge2$. Interestingly, the threshold width is much sharper for random geometric graphs than for Bernoulli random graphs. Further, a random geometric graph is shown to be a subgraph, with high probability, of another independently drawn random geometric graph with a slightly larger radius; this property is shown to have no analogue for Bernoulli random graphs.",

	abstract = "We develop a new technique for proving cell-probe lower bounds for static
data structures. Previous lower bounds used a reduction to communication games,
which was known not to be tight by counting arguments. We give the first lower
bound for an explicit problem which breaks this communication complexity
barrier. In addition, our bounds give the first separation between polynomial
and near linear space. Such a separation is inherently impossible by
communication complexity.
 Using our lower bound technique and new upper bound constructions, we obtain
tight bounds for searching predecessors among a static set of integers. Given a
set Y of n integers of l bits each, the goal is to efficiently find
predecessor(x) = max{y in Y | y <= x}, by representing Y on a RAM using space
S.
 In external memory, it follows that the optimal strategy is to use either
standard B-trees, or a RAM algorithm ignoring the larger block size. In the
important case of l = c*lg n, for c>1 (i.e. polynomial universes), and near
linear space (such as S = n*poly(lg n)), the optimal search time is Theta(lg
l). Thus, our lower bound implies the surprising conclusion that van Emde Boas'
classic data structure from [FOCS'75] is optimal in this case. Note that for
space n^{1+eps}, a running time of O(lg l / lglg l) was given by Beame and Fich
[STOC'99].",
