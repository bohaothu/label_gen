                 online services and explore a prototype-based approach
                 that applies ideas from manifold ranking. Since
                 algorithms for ranking on graphs or manifolds often
                 lack a way of dealing with out of sample data, they are
                 of limited use for pattern recognition. In this paper,
                 we therefore propose to consider diffusion processes
                 over bipartite graphs which allow for a dual treatment
                 of objects and features. As with Google's PageRank,
                 this leads to Markov processes over the prototypes. In
                 contrast to related methods, our model provides a
                 Bayesian interpretation of the transition matrix and
                 enables the ranking and consequently the classification
                 of unknown entities. By design, the method is tailored
                 to histogram features and we apply it to
                 histogram-based color image analysis. Experiments with
                 images downloaded from flickr.com illustrate object
                 localization in realistic scenes.",
