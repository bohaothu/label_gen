	Abstract = {One of the ob jectives of the Sealife pro ject is to dynamically link to computational services that are relevant to the web pages visited by a scientist while browsing the web. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the services we have identified, based on our use cases, as potentially relevant to the Sealife pro ject. For each service we provide a short description of their functionality (their semantics). Although the composition of services is not the focus of our work until the later phases of the pro ject, we also provide a description of a sample work-flow as an illustration of how the described services may be combined to achieve additional functionality.
