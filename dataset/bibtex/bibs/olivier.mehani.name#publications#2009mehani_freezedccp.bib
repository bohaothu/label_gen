	abstract	= "We present enhancements to the TCP-Friendly Rate Con-
		trol mechanism (TFRC) which are designed to better cope with the
		intermittent connectivity available to mobile devices or in
		Delay Tolerant Networks. Our aim is to prevent losses during
		disconnected periods and quickly adapt to new network
		conditions. We propose to suspend the transmission before
		disconnections occur in a way inspired by Freeze-TCP, then
		probe, in a new way, the network after reconnecting to enable
		full use of the newly available bandwidth. We first evaluate
		the potential performance gains for realistic network
		parameters. We then describe the proposed additions to TFRC
		and their implementation within the Datagram Congestion Control
		Protocol (DCCP) in ns-2.  Comparisons of simulation results for
		example mobility scenarios show that the proposed enhancements
		enable faster recovery upon reconnection as well as
		significantly improved adjustment to the newly available network
		conditions.  ",
