    abstract = {The complexity of developing and deploying context-aware
pervasive-computing applications calls for distributed software
infrastructures that assist applications to collect, aggregate, and
disseminate contextual data. In this paper, we motivate a data-centric design
for such an infrastructure to support context-aware applications. Our
middleware system, Solar, treats contextual data sources as stream
publishers. The core of Solar is a scalable and self-organizing peer-to-peer
overlay to support data-driven services. We describe how different services
can be systematically integrated on top of the Solar overlay and evaluate the
resource discovery and data-dissemination services. We also discuss our
experience and lessons learned when using Solar to support several
implemented scenarios. We conclude that a data-centric infrastructure is
necessary to facilitate both the development and deployment of context-aware
pervasive-computing applications.}
