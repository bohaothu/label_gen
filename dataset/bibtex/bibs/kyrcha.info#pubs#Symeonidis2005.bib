  abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning systems efficiently administer all tasks
	concerning real-time planning and manufacturing, material procurement
	and inventory monitoring, customer and supplier management. Nevertheless,
	the incorporation of domain knowledge and the application of adaptive
	decision making into such systems require extreme customization with
	a cost that becomes unaffordable, especially in the case of SMEs.
	We present an alternative approach for incorporating adaptive business
	intelligence into the company's backbone. We have designed and developed
	a highly reconfigurable, adaptive, cost efficient multi-agent framework
	that acts as an add-on to ERP software, employing Data Mining and
	Soft Computing techniques in order to provide intelligent recommendations
	on customer, supplier and inventory management. In this paper, we
	present the architectural details of the developed framework.}
