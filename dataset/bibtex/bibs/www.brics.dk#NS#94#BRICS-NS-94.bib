                  {\bf Course Description}\\
                  The aim of the course is to describe recent
                  advances in formal techniques for establishing
                  observational equivalence of functional
                  programs. It considers both operational and
                  denotational methods and the relationship
                  between them. One goal is to give an exposition
                  of Howe's method for characterizing
                  observational equivalence as a co-inductively
                  defined ``applicative bisimulation''. Another
                  goal is to describe Freyd's analysis of
                  recursively defined domains in terms of a
                  property of mixed initiality/finality.
                  Applications of this are given to proving
                  correspondence of operational and denotational
                  semantics and to inductive and co-inductive
                  reasoning about ``user-declared'' datatypes.",

                  in reasoning about programs and their

                  recursively defined data-structures, and
                  program termination. For researchers interested
                  in establishing these properties on a computer,
                  such reasoning must be automated or at least
                  partially supported. In this five hour seminar
                  I will cover some of the central issues in
                  automating proof by mathematical induction. In
                  particular, formalisms for mathematical
                  induction, techniques for selecting induction
                  schemata and well-founded orders, rewriting in
                  inductive theorem proving, and applications.
                  The topics will often be illustrated using
                  ideas and techniques that have been developed
                  at Edinburgh and embodied in the CLAM Inductive
