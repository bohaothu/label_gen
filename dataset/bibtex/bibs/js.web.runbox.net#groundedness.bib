  abstract	= {The phrase \textquoteleft{}The iterative conception of
		  sets\textquoteright conjures up a picture of a particular
		  settheoretic universe -- the cumulative hierarchy -- and
		  the constant conjunction of phrasewith-picture is so
		  reliable that people tend to think that the cumulative
		  hierarchy is all there is to the iterative conception of
		  sets: if you conceive sets iteratively, then the result is
		  the cumulative hierarchy. In this paper, I shall be arguing
		  that this is a mistake: the iterative conception of set is
		  a good one, for all the usual reasons. However, the
		  cumulative hierarchy is merely one way among many of
		  working out this conception, and arguments in favour of an
		  iterative conception have been mistaken for arguments in
		  favour of this one special instance of it. (This may be the
		  point to get out of the way the observation that although
		  philosophers of mathematics write of the iterative
		  conception of set, what they really mean -- in the
		  terminology of modern computer science at least -- is the
		  recursive conception of sets. Nevertheless, having got that
		  quibble off my chest, I shall continue to write of the
		  iterative conception like everyone else.).},

		  is not true. But when we write this true conclusion on line
