    Solutions to computationally hard problems often require that
    search be used.  Integrating search into the learning phase has been
    previously proposed in an ad-hoc manner (Daume & Marcu, 2005).  In
    this paper, we show that structured prediction can be mapped into a
    search setting using language from reinforcement learning, and known
    techniques for reinforcement learning (Langford et al., 2005) can give
    formal performance bounds on the structured prediction task.
