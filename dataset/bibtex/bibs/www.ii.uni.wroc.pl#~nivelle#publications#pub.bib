   TITLE       = {Complexity of Interpretation Problems in Truth Maintenance 
                  Systems},

   ABSTRACT    = {A Truth Maintenance System is a system that maintains 
                  {\em beliefs} using {\em non-monotonic justifications}.
                  A non-monotonic justification is a rule of form
                  $ A_1, \ldots, A_p, \mbox{abs}(B_1), \ldots, \mbox{abs}(B_q) 
                   \rightarrow C, $ where $ \mbox{abs}(B_j) $ means that the
                  belief $ B_j $ have to be absent. 
                  Mostly, there are more than one interpretation possible:
                  For example, the set 
                  $ \abs(A) \rightarrow B, \ 
                    \abs(B) \rightarrow A $ 
                  would allow two belief sets, believing $ \{ A \}, $ 
                  and believing $ \{ B \}. $ 
                  The general problem of computing belief sets is
                  NP-hard. If one allows $ 3 $-valued beliefs
                  (by introducing dontknow), the problem becomes
                  quadratic. This is called {\em skeptical semantics}.
                  Unfortunately, for most interesting rule sets, nearly
                  all beliefs will have the status 'dontknow', which
                  is not very useful. 
                  I showed in the thesis, that the skeptical semantics
                  is the best possible tractable semantics.

in a number of important ways. First, it avoids translations
into large undecidable logics, and works directly on modal or
description logic formulas instead. Second, by using labeled
formulas, it avoids the complexities of earlier propositional
resolution-based methods for modal logic. Third, it provides
a method for manipulating so-called assertional information
in the description-logic setting. And fourth, we believe
that it combines ideas from the method of prefixes used in 
tableaux and resolution in such a way that some of the
heuristics and optimizations devised in either field
are applicable.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We give a decision procedure for the

   The procedure is based on resolution with superposition. 
   The relevance of the guarded fragment lies in the fact
   that many modal logics can be translated into it. 
   In this way the guarded fragment acts as a framework explaining
   some of the nice properties of these modal logics.
   By constructing an implementable decision procedure for 
   the guarded fragments we define an effective procedure
   for deciding these modal logics. 
   It is surprising to see that one does not need any sophisticated
   simplification and redundancy elimination method to make superposition
   terminate on the class of clauses that is obtained from the clausification
   of guarded formulas. Yet the decision procedure obtained
   is optimal with regard to time complexity.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The two-variable fragment of first-order logic is the
                  set of formulas that do not contain function symbols,
                  that possibly contain equality, and that contain at
                  most two variables. This paper shows how resolution
                  theorem-proving techniques can be used to provide an 
                  algorithm for deciding whether or not any given formula 
                  in the two-variable fragment is satisfiable. Previous
                  resolution-based techniques could deal only with the 
                  equality-free subset of the two-variable fragment. },

  ABSTRACT     = {We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for modal,
     description and hybrid logic that improves on previous proposals in 
     important ways. It avoids translations into large undecidable logics,
     and works directly on modal, description or hybrid logic formulas instead.
     In addition, by using the hybrid machinery it avoids the complexities 
     of earlier propositional resolution-based methods for modal logic.
     It combines ideas from the method of prefixes used in tableaux,
     and resolution ideas in such a way that some of the heuristics 
     and optimizations devised in either field are applicable}

                  redundancy.
                  We give a general method of obtaining a calculus with 
                  splitting from a resolution restriction without splitting
		  by adjoining splitting symbols.
                  We then prove a relative completeness theorem: Every 
                  saturated set of clauses of the resolution calculus with 
                  adjoined proposition symbols contains a saturated set of 
                  the original resolution refinement without adjoined

  ABSTRACT     = {The paper discusses three problems that arise
                  when one wants to construct a clausal normal form of 
		  a first-order formula, and simultaneously construct 
		  a proof that this clausal normal form is correct. 
		  We assume that the resulting proofs are in type theory. 
		  First the problem of non-equivalence preserving
		  transformations is discussed. It turns out that 
		  all such transformations are second order provable
		  if one assumes choice axioms. 
		  Second, the problem of the size of the resulting proofs
		  is discussed. It can be handled by using introduction of 
		  definitions, and by using proof normalization.
		  The third problem discussed, is the problem 
		  of handling strong and optimized Skolemization.
		  We show that both types of Skolemization can be
		  reduced to standard Skolemization, so that only
		  one type of choice axioms is needed.},
