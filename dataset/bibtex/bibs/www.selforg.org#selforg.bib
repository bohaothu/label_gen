Among other simulation parameters, the mobility model plays a very important role in determining the protocol performance in MANET. Thus, it is essential to study and analyze various mobility models and their effect on MANET protocols. In this chapter, we survey and examine different mobility models proposed in the recent research literature. Beside the commonly used Random Waypoint model and its variants, we also discuss various models that exhibit the characteristics of temporal dependency, spatial dependency and geographic constraint. Hence, we attempt to provide an overview of the current research status of mobility modeling and analysis.},

	abstract = {Motivated by realistic sensor network scenarios that have misinformed nodes and variable network topologies, we propose a fundamentally different approach to routing that combines the best features of limited-flooding and information-sensitive path-finding protocols into a reliable, low-power method that can make delivery guarantees independent of parameter values or information noise levels. We introduce Parametric Probabilistic Sensor Network Routing Protocols, a family of light-weight and robust multi-path routing protocols for sensor networks in which an intermediate sensor decides to forward a message with a probability that depends on various parameters, such as the distance of the sensor to the destination, the distance of the source sensor to the destination, or the number of hops a packet has already traveled. We propose two protocol variants of this family and compare the new methods to other probabilistic and deterministic protocols, namely constant-probability gossiping, uncontrolled flooding, random wandering, shortest path routing (and a variation), and a load-spreading shortest-path protocol inspired by [Servetto, Barrenechea, 2002]. We consider sensor networks where a sensor's knowledge of the local or global information is uncertain (parametrically noised) due to sensor mobility, and investigate the trade-off between robustness of the protocol as measured by quality of service (in particular, successful delivery rate and delivery lag) and use of resources (total network load). Our results show that the multi-path protocols are less sensitive to misinformation, and suggest that in the presence of noisy data, a limited flooding strategy will actually perform better and use fewer resources than an attempted single-path routing strategy, with the Parametric Probabilistic Sensor Network Routing Protocols outperforming other protocols. Our results also suggest that protocols using network information perform better than protocols that do not, even in the presence of strong noise.},

from all nodes to the source of the npdate. TBRPF uses the topology information
reeeived along the broadcast trees to compnte the minimum-hop

instead of shortest-path trees (based on link costs) results in less frequent

The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on the node density: the higher it is, the more consistent energy savings can potentially be achieved. However, no general analyses of network lifetime have been done either for a base network (one without any energy conservation technique) or for one using cooperative energy conservation strategies. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime/density tradeoff under the hypothesis that nodes are distributed uniformly at random in a given region, and that the traffic is evenly distributed across the network. We also analyze the case where the node density is just sufficient to ensure that the network is connected with high probability. This analysis, which is supported by the results of extensive simulations, shows that even in this low density scenario, cell-based strategies can significantly extend network lifetime.},

but smart sensors to be deployed for a wide range of
environmental monitoring applications. In order to constrain
communication overhead, dense sensor networks call for new and
highly efficient methods for distributing queries to nodes that
have observed interesting events in the network. A highly efficient
data-centric routing mechanism will offer significant power cost
reductions [17], and improve network longevity. Moreover,
because of the large amount of system and data redundancy
possible, data becomes disassociated from specific node and
resides in regions of the network [10][7][8]. This paper describes
and evaluates through simulation a scheme we call Rumor
Routing, which allows for queries to be delivered to events in the
network. Rumor Routing is tunable, and allows for tradeoffs
between setup overhead and delivery reliability. It’s intended for
contexts in which geographic routing criteria are not applicable
because a coordinate system is not available or the phenomenon
of interest is not geographically correlated.},

	abstract = {Advances in microsensor and radio technology enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. The low-per node cost allows these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed. The nodes in these dense networks coordinate to perform the distributed sensing and actuation tasks. Moreover, as described in this paper, the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density so as to extend overall system lifetime. The large number of nodes deployed in this systems preclude manual configuration, and the environmental dynamics precludes design-time preconfiguration. Therefore, nodes have to self-configure to establish a topology that provides communication under stringent energy constraints. ASCENT builds on the notion that, as density increases, only a subset of the nodes is necessary to establish a routing forwarding backbone. In ASCENT, each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multihop network topology based on the measured operating region. This paper motivates and describes the ASCENT algorithm and presents analysis, simulation, and experimental measurements. We show that the system achieves linear increase in energy savings as a function of the density and the convergence time required in case of node failures while still providing adequate connectivity.},

	abstract = {A routing problem in static wireless ad hoc networks is considered as it arises in a rapidly deployed, sensor based, monitoring system known as the wireless sensor network. Information obtained by the monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with both information-generation process models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming problem.},

Span builds on the observation that when a region of a shared-channel wireless network has a sufficient density of nodes, only a small number of them need be on at any time to forward traffic for active connections. 

Span is a distributed, randomized algorithm where nodes make local decisions on whether to sleep, or to join a forwarding backbone as a coordinator. Each node bases its decision on an estimate of how many of its neighbors will benefit from it being awake, and the amount of energy available to it. We give a randomized algorithm where coordinators rotate with time, demonstrating how localized node decisions lead to a connected, capacity-preserving global topology. 

Improvement in system lifetime due to Span increases as the ratio of idle-to-sleep energy consumption increases. Our simulations show that with a practical energy model, system lifetime of an 802.11 network in power saving mode with Span is a factor of two better than without. Additionally, Span also improves communication latency and capacity.},

represented by the limited availability of energy within network
nodes; therefore making good use of energy is a must. A widely
employed energy-saving technique is to place nodes in sleep mode,
corresponding to a low-power consumption as well as to reduced
operational capabilities. In this work, we develop aMarkov model
of a sensor network whose nodes may enter a sleep mode, and we
use this model to investigate the system performance in terms of
energy consumption, network capacity, and data delivery delay.
Furthermore, the proposed model enables us to investigate the
trade-offs existing between these performance metrics and the
sensor dynamics in sleep/active mode. Analytical results present
an excellent matching with simulation results for a large variety
of system scenarios showing the accuracy of our approach.},

We review results that pertain to the capacity of a battery and its dependence on the intensity of the discharge current. The phenomenon of charge recovery that takes place under bursty or pulsed discharge conditions is identified as a mechanism that can be exploited to enhance the capacity of a battery. The bursty nature of many data traffic sources suggests that data transmissions may provide natural opportunities for charge recovery. We explore stochastic models to track charge recovery in conjunction with bursty discharge processes. Using the postulated model, we identify the improvement to battery capacity that results from a pulsed discharge driven by bursty stochastic discharge demand. The insight from this analysis leads us to propose discharge shaping techniques that trade-off energy efficiency with delay},

restarts path discovery when a node moves. The second
is a simple handoff scheme similar to those used in cellular
networks. The third introduces special proxy nodes
as path anchors, and the fourth scheme provides hints
to the diffusion layer to pre-create routes in an anticipated
direction of motion. We compared the behavior of
the various schemes for a mobile user tracking an object
in a sensor network under four mobility scenarios. Our
simulation results show that a combination of these simple
enhancements to diffusion permit sink speeds of up
7 meters per second without generating excessive overhead.
Increasing the transmit power was also an effective
method of reducing the impact of mobility. Finally,
we found that random motion is the most difficult mobility
scenario, so approaches shown to work under random
motion should also work well under more realistic
mobility conditions.},

data routing. This allows us to maximize information
gain while minimizing detection latency

have demonstrated that the information-driven

controllers for the swarm-bot using artificial evolution. Specifically, we study
aggregation and coordinated motion of the swarm-bot using a physics-based
simulation of the system. Experiments, using a simplified simulation model of
the s-bots, show that evolution can discover simple but effective controllers for
both the aggregation and the coordinated motion of the swarm-bot. Analysis
of the evolved controllers shows that they have properties of scalability, that
is, they continue to be effective for larger group sizes, and of generality, that
is, they produce similar behaviors for configurations different from those they
were originally evolved for. The portability of the evolved controllers to real
s-bots is tested using a detailed simulation model which has been validated
against the real s-bots in a companion paper in this same special issue.},

	abstract = {Despite more than a decade of experimental work in multi-robot systems, important theoretical aspects
of multi-robot coordination mechanisms have, to date, been largely ignored. To address part of this negligence,
this dissertation focuses on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). Most work on
MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many coordination architectures having been proposed and
validated in a proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed.
With the goal of bringing some objective grounding to this important area of research, this dissertation
presents a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given,
and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization
problems. By casting MRTA problems in the well-understood framework of optimization, a half-century
of work in operations research, game theory, economics, and network flows can be adapted for use in
robotic domains. This dissertation demonstrates how such theory can be used for analysis and greater
understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and suggests how the same theory can be used in
the synthesis of new approaches.
Although vital for the advancement of the field, analysis is only one component of a comprehensive
research agenda. Sensor-actuator systems such as robots present a rich, complex problem domain that can
exhibit significant levels of noise and uncertainty. One must implement and empirically validate proposed
MRTA algorithms. Thus this dissertation also presents experimental work with an auction-based task
allocation system, implemented on physical robots. Optimization theory is used to explain how and why
this approach is successful.
This kind of empirical work is a natural complement to formal analysis, and can serve the crucial role
of suggesting modifications to the formal model that is analyzed. Such experiments require substantial
supporting software infrastructure. This dissertation describes the underlying software facilities that were
developed for experimental use in the study of MRTA, as well as for more general use. Specifically discussed
is the Player/Stage project, which produces high-quality Open Source software to support robotics
research, with the goal of providing a standard platform for mobile robot experimentation and simulation.},

The specific task considered in this paper is that of communicating a specified quantity of information from each sensor to a collector node. The problem of finding the communication scheme which maximizes functional lifetime can be formulated as a linear program, under "fluid-like" assumptions on information bits. This paper focuses on analytically solving the linear program for some simple regular network topologies.The two topologies considered are a regular linear array, and a regular two-dimensional network. In the linear case, an upper bound on functional lifetime is derived, as a function of the initial energies and quantities of data held by the sensors. Under some assumptions on the relative amounts of the energies and data, this upper bound is shown to be achievable, and the exact form of the optimal communication strategy is derived. For the regular planar network, upper and lower bounds on functional lifetime, differing only by a constant factor, are obtained.Finally, it is shown that the simple collection scheme of transmitting only to nearest neighbors, yields a nearly optimal lifetime in a scaling sense.},

network, where a query gathers sensor data within a specific
geographic region. Redundancy within a sensor network
can be exploited to reduce the communication cost incurred
in execution of such queries. Any reduction in communication
cost would result in an efficient use of the battery
energy, which is very limited in sensors. One approach to
reduce the communication cost of a query is to self-organize
the network, in response to a query, into a topology that
involves only a small subset of the sensors sufficient to process
the query. The query is then executed using only the
sensors in the constructed topology.
In this article, we design and analyze algorithms for such
self-organization of a sensor network to reduce energy consumption.
In particular, we develop the notion of a connected
sensor cover and design a centralized approximation
algorithm that constructs a topology involving a nearoptimal
connected sensor cover. We prove that the size of
the constructed topology is within an O(log n) factor of the
optimal size, where n is the network size. We also develop
a distributed self-organization version of our algorithm, and
propose several optimizations to reduce the communication
overhead of the algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the distributed
algorithm using simulations and show that our approach
results in significant communication cost reduction.},

If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is Θ(W√An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only Θ(W/√n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance},

However, without proper query control techniques, ZRP

Our proposed query control schemes exploit the structure

prevention of overlapping queries. These techniques can be
applied to single-channel or multiple-channel ad hoc

Abstract
Software management is a critical task in the system administration of enterprise scale networks.
Enterprise scale networks that have traditionally comprised of large clusters of workstations
are expanding to include low power ad-hoc wireless sensor networks (WSN). The existing
tools for software updates in workstations cannot be used with the severely resource constrained
sensor nodes. In this article, we survey the software update techniques in WSNs. We base our
discussion around a conceptual model for the software update tools in WSNs. Three components
of this model that we study are the execution environment at the sensor nodes, the software
distribution protocol in the network and optimization of transmitted updates. We present the
design space of each component and discuss in-depth the trade offs that need to be considered
in making a particular design choice. The discussion is interspersed with references to deployed
systems that highlight the design choices.},

Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of
direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop
routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for
sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that
utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations
(cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among
the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination
to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks,
and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol
to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted
to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH
can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy
dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols.
In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation
evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system
lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have become a very attractive research topic in recent years. Many academic and professional research groups made efforts to construct operative hardware devices and sophisticated software to meet the special conditions in their projects. But still there has been little done to create a general structure for smart sensors to cooperate and to offer their services to human or software clients. In this paper we present first results of our investigations in this topic. As a test scenario and source of inspiration we set up a sensor network prototype in an office situation, where the physical environment should be measured and adjusted according to specific conditions. In particular the light and humidity state of potted plants within an office should be autonomously adjusted to the plants special needs as most research associates in our lab forget to care for their plants on a regular basis. On the basis of this prolific scenario we introduce a first stage middleware system architecture providing service distribution and accomplishment within wireless sensor networks. Core components of the architecture have been implemented in hardware and software to show the feasibility and abilities of our approach.},

mobile stations that are interconnected by a multihop wireless
network. The applications of this wireless infrastructure range
from ad hoc networking (e.g., collaborative, distributed computing)
to disaster recovery (e.g., fire, flood, earthquake), law
enforcement (e.g., crowd control, search-and-rescue), and military
(automated battlefield). Key characteristics of this system are the
large number of users, their mobility, and the need to operate
without the support of a fixed (wired or wireless) infrastructure.
The last feature sets this system apart from existing cellular
systems and in fact makes its design much more challenging.
In this environment, we investigate routing strategies that scale
well to large populations and can handle mobility. In addition,
we address the need to support multimedia communications,
with low latency requirements for interactive traffic and qualityof-
service (QoS) support for real-time streams (voice/video). In
the wireless routing area, several schemes have already been
proposed and implemented (e.g., hierarchical routing, on-demand
routing, etc.). We introduce two new schemes—fisheye state
routing (FSR) and hierarchical state routing (HSR)—which offer
some competitive advantages over the existing schemes. We
compare the performance of existing and proposed schemes via
simulation.},

aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. In such an environment, it may be
necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination,
due to the limited range of each mobile host’s wireless transmissions. This paper presents a protocol
for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing
changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which
hosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating in
an ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as host
density and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead of
the protocol is quite low, falling to just 1% of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement rates
in a network of 24 mobile hosts. In all cases, the difference in length between the routes used and the
optimal route lengths is negligible, and in most cases, route lengths are on average within a factor of 1.01
of optimal.},

routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the positions
of routers and a packet’s destination to make packet forwarding
decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions using
only information about a router’s immediate neighbors in the
network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy
forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around
the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local
topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path
and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations
increases. Under mobility’s frequent topology changes, GPSR can
use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly.
We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of
mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of
Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR’s
scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.},

performance of routing protocols for ad hoc networks. By using location information, the proposed Location-Aided Routing (LAR)
protocols limit the search for a new route to a smaller “request zone” of the ad hoc network. This results in a significant reduction in
the number of routing messages. We present two algorithms to determine the request zone, and also suggest potential optimizations to our algorithms.},

We show that data-centric routing offers significant

We also examine the complexity of optimal data aggregation,
showing that although it is an NP-hard problem
in general, there exist useful polynomial-time special cases.},

wireless network characterized by node
mobility, dynamic topology structure, unreliable

communications possible. On Demand Routing is
one of the most popular routing styles in ad hoc
networks. In On Demand Routing, "flooding" Is
used to find a feasible route from source to
destination. The function of flooding is to deliver a
packet from one source to every other node in the
system. Conventional flooding can be very costly in
On Demand networks in terms of network
throughput efficiency as well as node energy
consumption. The main reason is that the same
packet is rebroadcast unnecessarily several times
(redundant rebroadcast). Indeed, the penalty of
redundant rebroadcast increases when the size of
network grows and the density of network increases.
In this paper we introduce a novel clustering
scheme, call Passive Clustering that can reduce the
redundant rebroadcast effect in flooding. We
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme

The objective of the allocation is to minimize the total cost,

all targets. We show that finding an optimal allocation is an
NP-hard problem, even in known environments. The main
contribution of this paper is PRIM ALLOCATION, a simple and
fast approximate algorithm for allocating targets to robots
which provably computes allocations whose total cost is at
most twice as large as the optimal total cost. We then cast
PRIM ALLOCATION in terms of a multi-round single-item
auction where robots bid on targets, which allows for a decentralized
implementation. To the best of our knowledge, PRIM
ALLOCATION is the first auction-based allocation algorithm
that provides a guarantee on the quality of its allocations. Our
experimental results in a multi-robot simulator demonstrate
that PRIM ALLOCATION is fast and results in close-to-optimal
allocations despite its simplicity and decentralized nature. In
particular, it needs an order of magnitude fewer bids than
a computationally intensive allocation algorithm based on
combinatorial auctions, yet its allocations are at least as good.},

has focused on the deployment of large numbers of cheap
homogeneous sensor devices, in practical settings it is often
feasible to consider heterogeneous deployments of devices with
different capabilities. Under prescribed cost constraints, we
analyze such heterogenous deployments both mathematically and
through simulations, and show how they impact the coverage
aging process of a sensor network, i.e., how it degrades over time
as some nodes become energy-depleted. We derive expressions for
the heterogeneous mixture of devices that optimizes the lifetime
sensing coverage in a single-hop direct communication model.
We then investigate a multi-hop communication model through
simulations, and examine the impact of heterogeneity on lifetime
sensing coverage and coverage aging both with and without data
aggregation. Our results show that using an optimal mixture
of many inexpensive low-capability devices and some expensive
high-capability devices can significantly extend the duration of a

division access scheme for multimedia support. In the proposed network architecture, nodes are
organized into nonoverlapping clusters. The clusters are independently controlled and are
dynamically reconfigured as nodes move. This network architecture has three main advantages.
First, it provides spatial reuse of the bandwidth due to node clustering. Secondly, bandwidth can
be shared or reserved in a controlled fashion in each cluster. Finally, the cluster algorithm is
robust in the face of topological changes caused by node motion, node failure and node insertion/
removal. Simulation shows that this architecture provides an efficient, stable infrastructure
for the integration of different types of traffic in a dynamic radio network.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of data collection from a sensor web consisting of
N nodes, where nodes have packets of data in each round of communication that need to be
gathered and fused with other nodes’ packets into one packet and transmitted to a distant
base station. Nodes have power control in their wireless communications and can transmit
directly to any node in the network or to the base station. With unit delay cost for each
packet transmission, if all nodes transmit data directly to the base station, then both high
energy and high delay per round will occur. In our prior work [6], we developed an
algorithm to minimize the energy cost per round, where a linear chain of all the nodes are
formed to gather data, and nodes took turns to transmit to the base station. If the goal is to
minimize the delay cost, then a binary combining scheme can be used to accomplish this
task in about log N units of delay with parallel communications and incurring a slight
increase in energy cost. The goal is to find data gathering schemes that balance the energy
and delay cost, as measured by energy*delay. We conducted extensive simulation
experiments with a number of schemes for this problem with 100 nodes in playing fields of
50m x 50m and 100m x 100m and the base station located at least 100 meters and 200
meters, respectively, from any node. With CDMA capable sensor nodes, a chain-based
binary scheme performs best in terms of energy*delay. If the sensor nodes are not CDMA
capable, then parallel communications are possible only among spatially separated nodes,
and a chain-based 3 level hierarchy scheme performs well. These schemes perform 60 to
100 times better than direct scheme and also outperform a cluster based scheme, called
LEACH.},

	abstract = {Sensor webs consisting of nodes with limited battery
power and wireless communications are deployed to collect
useful information from the field. Gathering sensed
information in an energy efficient manner is critical to
operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In [3]
a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of
communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent
to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed
data directly to the base station then it will deplete its
power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented in [3] is an
elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data
before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing
the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station,
LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to
direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes
die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (Power-Efficient
GAthering in Sensor Information Systems), a near optimal
chain-based protocol that is an improvement over
LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with
a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base
station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per
round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs
better than LEACH by about 100 to 300% when 1%, 20%,
50% , and 100% of nodes die for different network sizes
and topologies.},

layered architecture for resource-constrained multi-robot cooperation,

self-organizes the robot coalitions to track efficiently across regions.
It uses concepts of ant behavior to self-regulate the regional
distributions of robots in proportion to that of the moving
targets to be tracked in a non-stationary environment. As a
result, the adverse effects of task interference between robots are
minimized and network coverage is improved. In the lower task
execution layer, the robots use self-organizing neural networks
to coordinate their target tracking within a region. Both layers
employ self-organization techniques, which exhibit autonomic
properties such as self-configuring, self-optimizing, self-healing,
and self-protecting. Quantitative comparisons with other tracking
strategies such as static sensor placements, potential fields, and
auction-based negotiation show that our layered approach can
provide better coverage, greater robustness to sensor failures,
and greater flexibility to respond to environmental changes.},

This paper presents RAP, a new real-time communication architecture forlarge-scale sensor networks. RAP provides convenient, high-level query and event services for distributed micro-sensing applications. Novel location-addressed communication models are supported by a scalable and light-weight network stack. We present and evaluate a new packet scheduling policy called velocity monotonic scheduling that inherently accounts for both time and distance constraints. We show that this policy is particularly suitable for communication scheduling in sensor networks in which a large number of wireless devices are seamlessly integrated into a physical space to perform real-time monitoring and control. Detailed simulations of representative sensor network environments demonstrate that RAP significantly reduces the end-to-end deadline miss ratio in the sensor network.},

	abstract = {The Open Agent Architecture (OAA), developed and used for several years at SRI
International, makes it possible for software services to be provided through the co-
operative e
orts of distributed collections of autonomous agents. Communication and
cooperation between agents are brokered by one or more facilitators, which are respon-
sible for matching requests, from users and agents, with descriptions of the capabilities
of other agents. Thus, it is not generally required that a user or agent know the iden-
tities, locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying a request. OAA is
structured so as to minimize the e
ort involved in creating new agents and \wrapping"
legacy applications, written in various languages and operating on various platforms;
to encourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism and exibility in
the makeup of agent communities. Distinguishing features of OAA as compared with
related work include extreme exibility in using facilitator-based delegation of complex
goals, triggers, and data management requests; agent-based provision of multimodal
user interfaces; and built-in support for including the user as a privileged member of
the agent community.
This paper explains the structure and elements of agent-based systems constructed
using OAA. The characteristics and use of each major component of OAA infrastructure
are described, including the agent library, the Interagent Communication Language,
capabilities declarations, service requests, facilitation, management of data repositories,
and autonomous monitoring using triggers. To provide technical context, we describe
the motivations for OAA's design, and situate its features within the realm of alternative
software paradigms. A summary is given of OAA-based systems built to date, and brief
descriptions are given of several of these.},

Other than the destination's position, each node needs to know only its own position and the position of its one-hop neighbors in order to forward packets. Since it is not necessary to maintain explicit routes, position-based routing does scale well even if the network is highly dynamic. This is a major advantage in a mobile ad-hoc network where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination. Therefore, recently proposed location services are discussed in addition to position-based packet forwarding strategies. We provide a qualitative comparison of the approaches in both areas and investigate opportunities for future research.},

We have developed a generic localized algorithm for solving optimization problems in wireless ad-hoc networks that has five components: (i) data acquisition mechanism, (ii) optimization mechanism, (iii) search expansion rules, (iv) bounding conditions and (v) termination rules. the main idea is to request and process data only locally and only from nodes who are likely to contribute to rapid formation of the final solution. The approach enables two types of optimization: The first, guarantees the fraction of nodes that are contacted while optimizing for solution quality. The second, provides guarantees on solution qualities while minimizing the number of nodes that are contacted and/or amount of communication. The localized optimization approach is applied to two fundamental problems in sensor networks: location discovery and exposure-based coverage. We demonstrate its effective-ness on a number of examples},

solution to many common environment monitoring applications. In
traditional sensor network design, each unit is capable sensing,
processing and storing its own local data, as well as using a multi-hop
forwarding scheme to send this data to off-network storage. Thus,
each network element must fill at least four different rolls: sensing,
processing, communication, and storage, each of which may be
further subdivided. As nano-scale miniaturization becomes feasible,
including complete homogeneous functionality at each node will
become an increasingly difficult problem. Pico-radio devices provide
a platform by which these responsibilities can be offloaded to
different nodes, but still remain accessible through wireless
communication.
We have developed a conceptual pico-radio sensor network
system, and a corresponding design simulation and evaluation
environment, H-MAS, that separates the tasks of processing and
storage from the sensor nodes. Through agent-based computer
simulation using the SWARM toolkit, we will compare the
effectiveness of current medium access, routing, organization, and
energy conservation techniques on H-MAS, and derive several
heuristics and design rules for various network configurations. The
visualization side of H-MAS also provides a convenient way to
present the design of MAS systems to non-technical personnel.},

in sink-based wireless sensor networks. We consider uniformly
distributed sensors, each sending roughly the same
number of reports toward the closest sink. We assume
an energy consumption model governed by the relation
E = d$\alpha$+c where d, (d ≤ tx), is the transmission distance,
$\alpha$ ≥ 2 is the power attenuation, c is a technology-dependent
positive constant, and tx is the maximum transmission
range of sensors. Our results are multifold. First, we show
that for $\alpha$ > 2, all sensors whose distance to the sink
is min{tx, ( 2c
$\alpha$−2 ) 1
$\alpha$ } should transmit directly to the sink.
Interestingly, this limit does not depend on the size of the
network, expressed as the largest distance R from a sensor
to the closest sink. Next, we prove that in order to minimize
the total amount of energy spent on routing along a path
originating at a sensor in a corona and ending at the sink,
all the coronas must have the same width, equal to the
above expression. This choice, however, leads to uneven
energy depletion and to the creation of energy holes. We
show that for $\alpha$ > 2 the uneven energy depletion can be
prevented by judicious system design, resulting in balanced
energy expenditure across the network. We describe an
iterative process for determining the sizes of coronas.
Their optimal sizes (and corresponding transmission radii)
and the number of coronas depend on R. As expected,
the width of coronas in energy-balanced sensor network
increases. Finally, we show that for $\alpha$ = 2, the uneven
energy depletion phenomenon is intrinsic to the system
and no routing strategy can avoid the creation of an energy
hole around the sink.},

ad hoc networks – Landmark Ad Hoc Routing (LANMAR). LANMAR combines
the features of Fisheye State Routing (FSR) and Landmark routing.
The key novelty is the use of landmarks for each set of nodes which move as
a group (e.g., a team of co-workers at a convention or a tank battalion in the
battlefield) in order to reduce routing update overhead. Like in FSR, nodes
exchange link state only with their neighbors. Routes within Fisheye scope
are accurate, while routes to remote groups of nodes are “summarized” by
the corresponding landmarks. A packet directed to a remote destination initially
aims at the Landmark; as it gets closer to destination it eventually
switches to the accurate route provided by Fisheye. Simulation experiments
show that LANMAR provides efficient and scalable routing in large, mobile,
ad hoc environments in which group mobility applies.},

we present an innovative design for the operation of such

each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which
periodically advertises its view of the interconnection
topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network.
This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We
have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-
Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to
make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network
mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize adhoc
networks. Our modifications address some of the
previous objections to the use of Bellman-Ford, related
to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the
face of broken links and the resulting time dependent
nature of the interconnection topology describing the
links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe
the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can
be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc
networks.},

We then present a suite of techniques that perform aggressive energy optimization while targeting all stages of sensor network design, from individual nodes to the entire network. Maximizing network lifetime requires the use of a well-structured design methodology, which enables energy-aware design and operation of all aspects of the sensor network, from the underlying hardware platform to the application software and network protocols. Adopting such a holistic approach ensures that energy awareness is incorporated not only into individual sensor nodes but also into groups of communicating nodes and the entire sensor network. By following an energy-aware design methodology based on techniques such as in this article, designers can enhance network lifetime by orders of magnitude},

query. When the query is fully resolved, a completed response is
sent directly back to the querying node.
We take a mathematical modelling approach in this paper
to calculate the energy costs associated with ACQUIRE. The
models permit us to characterize analytically the impact of
critical parameters, and compare the performance of ACQUIRE
with respect to alternatives such as flooding-based querying
(FBQ) and expanding ring search (ERS). We show that with
optimal parameter settings, depending on the update frequency,
ACQUIRE obtains order of magnitude reduction over FBQ and
potentially over 60% reduction over ERS in consumed energy.},

to collect sensor data in sparse sensor networks. Our approach
exploits the presence of mobile entities (called MULEs) present in

close range, buffer it, and drop off the data to wired access points.
This can lead to substantial power savings at the sensors as they
only have to transmit over a short range. This paper focuses on a
simple analytical model for understanding performance as system
parameters are scaled. Our model assumes two-dimensional
random walk for mobility and incorporates key system variables
such as number of MULEs, sensors and access points. The
performance metrics observed are the data success rate (the
fraction of generated data that reaches the access points) and the
required buffer capacities on the sensors and the MULEs. The
modeling along with simulation results can be used for further
analysis and provide certain guidelines for deployment of such
systems.},

recently for routing in sensor networks. These protocols
exploit the redundancy among nodes by using a node
that is available for routing at the time of packet transmission.
This mitigates the effect of varying channel conditions
and duty cycling of nodes that make static selection of
routes not viable. However, there is a downside as each hop
may provide extremely small progress towards the destination
or the signaling overhead for selecting the forwarding
node may be too large. In this paper, we provide a systematic
performance evaluation, taking into account different
node densities, channel qualities and traffic rates to identify
the cases when opportunistic routing makes sense. The metrics
we use are power consumption at the nodes, average
delay suffered by packets and goodput of the protocol. Our
baseline for comparison is geographic routing with nodes
being duty cycled to conserve energy. The paper also identifies
optimal operation points for opportunistic routing that
minimizes the power consumption at nodes.},

the mean time to node failure is increased significantly. An
interesting property of using shortest-cost routing is that
packet delays do not increase. Finally, we note that our new

To maximize the lifetime of ad hoc mobile networks, the power consumption rate of each node must be evenly distributed, and the overall transmission power for each connection request must be minimized. These two objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously by employing routing algorithms proposed in previous work. We present a new power-aware routing protocol to satisfy these two constraints simultaneously; we also compare the performance of different types of power-related routing algorithms via simulation. Simulation results confirm the need to strike a balance in attaining service availability performance of the whole network vs. the lifetime of ad hoc mobile devices},

behaviours. Social insects like ants, termites or bees make use of different
forms of communication, which can be roughly classified in three
classes: indirect (stigmergic) communication, direct interaction and direct
communication. The use of stigmergic communication is predominant
in social insects (e.g., the pheromone trails in ants), but also direct
interactions (e.g., antennation in ants) and direct communication can be
observed (e.g., the waggle dance of honey bee workers). Direct communication
may be beneficial when a fast reaction is expected, as for instance,
when a danger is detected and countermeasures must be taken. This is
the case of hole avoidance, the task studied in this paper: a group of selfassembled
robots – called swarm-bot – coordinately explores an arena
containing holes, avoiding to fall into them. In particular, we study the
use of direct communication in order to achieve a reaction to the detection
of a hole faster than with the sole use of direct interactions through
physical links. We rely on artificial evolution for the synthesis of neural
network controllers, showing that evolving behaviours that make use of
direct communication.},

	abstract = {Sensor networks have a wide range of potential, practical and useful applications. However, there are issues that need to be addressed for efficient operation of sensor network systems in real applications. Energy saving is one critical issue for sensor networks since most sensors are equipped with nonrechargeable batteries that have limited lifetime. To extend the lifetime of a sensor network, one common approach is to dynamically schedule sensors' work/ sleep cycles (or duty cycles). Moreover, in cluster-based networks, cluster heads are usually selected in a way that minimizes the total energy consumption and they may rotate among the sensors to balance energy consumption. In general, these energy-efficient scheduling mechanisms (also called topology configuration mechanisms) need to satisfy certain application requirements while saving energy. In this paper, we provide a survey on energy-efficient scheduling mechanisms in sensor networks that have different design requirements than those in traditional wireless networks. We classify these mechanisms based on their design assumptions and design objectives. Different mechanisms may make different assumptions about their sensors including detection model, sensing area, transmission range, failure model, time synchronization, and the ability to obtain location and distance information. They may also have different assumptions about network structure and sensor deployment strategy. Furthermore, while all the mechanisms have a common design objective to maximize network lifetime, they may also have different objectives determined by their target applications.},

architecture for wireless sensor networks composed of a few
resource rich mobile nodes and a large number of simple
static nodes. These mobile nodes can either act as mobile
relays or mobile sinks. To investigate the performance of
these two options and the trade-offs associated with these
two options, we first consider a finite network. We then compute
the lifetime for different routing algorithms for three
cases (i) when the network is all static (ii) when there is one
mobile sink and (iii) when there is one mobile relay. We
find that using the mobile node as a sink results in the maximum
improvement in lifetime. We contend however that
in hostile terrains, it might not always be possible for the
sink to be mobile. We then investigate the performance of
a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that
the improvement in network lifetime over an all static network
is upper bounded by a factor of four. Also, the proof
implies that the mobile relay needs to stay only within a
two hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility
and routing algorithm which comes close to the upper
bound. However this algorithm requires all the nodes in
the network to be aware of the location of the mobile node.
We then proposed an alternative algorithm, which achieves
the same performance, but requires only a limited number
of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the
mobile. We finally compare the performance of the mobile
relay and mobile sink and show that for a densely deployed
sensor field of radius R hops, we require O(R) mobile relays
to achieve the same performance as the mobile sink.},

For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degree of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This article presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways. (1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. (2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity within a unified framework; in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. (3) We integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. (4) We propose a probabilistic coverage model and extend CCP to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations.},

GAF conserves energy by identifying nodes that are equivalent from a routing perspective and turning off unnecessary nodes, keeping a constant level of routing fidelity. GAF moderates this policy using application- and system-level information; nodes that source or sink data remain on and intermediate nodes monitor and balance energy use. GAF is independent of the underlying ad hoc routing protocol; we simulate GAF over unmodified AODV and DSR. Analysis and simulation studies of GAF show that it can consume 40% to 60% less energy than an unmodified ad hoc routing protocol. Moreover, simulations of GAF suggest that network lifetime increases proportionally to node density; in one example, a four-fold increase in node density leads to network lifetime increase for 3 to 6 times (depending on the mobility pattern). More generally, GAF is an example of adaptive fidelity, a technique proposed for extending the lifetime of self-configuring systems by exploiting redundancy to conserve energy while maintaining application fidelity.},

One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.In this paper, we introduce the Cougar approach to tasking sensor networks through declarative queries. Given a user query, a query optimizer generates an efficient query plan for in-network query processing, which can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, since queries are asked in a declarative language, the user is shielded from the physical characteristics of the network. We give a short overview of sensor networks, propose a natural architecture for a data management system for sensor networks, and describe open research problems in this area.},

assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple
power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that
periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter,
such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low message
overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate
bounds on node density and intra-cluster and inter-cluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost
surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is
effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable data aggregation.},

A good probabilistic broadcast protocol can achieve higher throughput and lower energy consumption, without sacrificing the reachability or having any significant degradation. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach that dynamically adjusts the rebroadcasting probability as per the node distribution and node movement. This is done based on locally available information and without requiring any assistance of distance measurements or exact location determination devices. We evaluate the performance of our approach by comparing it with the AODV protocol (which is based on simple flooding) as well as a fixed probabilistic approach. Simulation results show our approach performs better than both simple flooding and fixed probabilistic schemes.},

	abstract = {The mobility model is one of the most important factors in
the performance evaluation of a mobile ad hoc network

model has been used to model the node mobility, where
the movement of one node is modeled as independent from
all others. However, in reality, especially in large scale
military scenarios, mobility coherence among nodes is
quite common. One typical mobility behavior is group
mobility. Thus, to investigate military MANET scenarios,
an underlying realistic mobility model is highly desired. In
this paper, we propose a “virtual track” based group mobility
model (VT model) which closely approximates the mobility
patterns in military MANET scenarios. It models
various types of node mobility such as group moving
nodes, individually moving nodes as well as static nodes.
Moreover, the VT model not only models the group mobility,
it also models the dynamics of group mobility such as
group merge and split. Simulation experiments show that
the choice of mobility model has significant impact on

	abstract = {Sensor networks are often deployed in a redundant
fashion. In order to prolong the network lifetime, it is desired
to choose only a subset of sensors to keep active and put the
rest to sleep. In order to provide fault tolerance, this small
subset of active sensors should also provide some degree of
redundancy. In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing
a minimum subset of sensors such that they maintain a required
degree of coverage and also form a connected network with
a required degree of fault tolerance. In addition, we consider
a more general, variable radii sensor model, wherein every
sensor can adjust both its sensing and transmission ranges to
minimize overall energy consumption in the network. We call this
the variable radii k1-Connected, k2-Cover problem. To address
this problem, we propose a distributed and localized Voronoibased
algorithm. The approach extends the relative neighborhood
graph (RNG) structure to preserve k-connectivity in a graph, and
design a distributed technique to inactivate desirable nodes while
preserving k-connectivity of the remaining active nodes. We show
through extensive simulations that our proposed techniques result
in overall energy savings in random sensor networks over a wide
range of experimental parameters.},

	abstract = {The vast reduction in size and power consumption of CMOS circuitry has led to a large research effort based around the vision of ubiquitous networks of wireless communication nodes. The wireless devices are usually designed to run on batteries. However, as the networks increase in number and the devices decrease in size, the replacement of depleted batteries is not practical. Furthermore, a battery that is large enough to last the lifetime of the device would dominate the overall system size, and thus is not very attractive. There is clearly a need to explore alternative methods of powering these small communication nodes. This book, therefore, focuses on potential "ambient" sources of power that can be scavenged or harvested and subsequently used to run low power electronics and wireless transceivers. 
A wide range of potential power sources are briefly explored. Based on a comparison of these many potential sources, commonly occurring vibrations was chosen as an attractive, and little explored, power source. Models for different types of power converters using both electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion mechanisms have been developed. The models have been validated by testing prototypes driven at vibrations similar to those found in many industrial and commercial building environments. Finally, integration of a piezoelectric generator, power circuit, and custom design radio transceiver is demonstrated. 
Power sources are becoming a bottleneck to the widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks. This work reviews many potential alternative sources of ambient power that can be scavenged. Vibration to electricity converters are explored in great detail, and based on studies and experiments, are shown to be an attractive power source in many applications. 
Energy Scavenging for Wireless Sensor Networks with Special Focus on Vibrations will be of interest to researchers and professionals in the areas of wireless electronics, smart structures and MEMS as well as power electronics.},
