  abstract =     "In this article, an integrated conjecture about the
                 method of drawing of monumental prehistoric
                 wall-paintings is presented and supported.
                 Specifically, the article deals with paintings that
                 initially decorated the internal walls of the highest
                 floor of a building, called Xeste 3 , at Akrotiri of
                 the Greek island of Thera circa. 1650 B.C. It is argued
                 that these wall-paintings could had been drawn while
                 the brush was guided by an apparatus, which corresponds
                 to advanced for the era of geometric prototypes with
                 impressive precision. A set of assumptions concerning
                 the actions the artists might have taken in order to
                 create the spiral themes is stated and supported. These
                 assumptions refer to the existence of a draft plan, the
                 sequence of brush strokes, the placement of the brush
                 on the wall, as well as the possible form of the
                 apparatus. These conjectures are evaluated and tested
                 by means of curve fitting and image analysis methods
                 developed by the authors. The results indicate that all
                 drawn contour parts optimally fit along a single
                 prototype linear spiral with fitting error of less than
                 0.4mm, supporting existence of a very advanced culture
                 for the era of geometric guide. It is statistically
                 rejected that this guide could have the form of a
                 stamp. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the
                 painter might have used a draft plan of the spiral
                 themes to prepare the final drawing and that the linear
                 spiral guide has been used by alternating its
                 placements in order to form the internal and external
                 spiral contour.",

  abstract =     "The Chinese zither, called guqin, has existed for over
                 3,000 years and always played an important role in
                 Chinese social history. An interesting but unfortunate
                 fact is that the traditional notation of guqin music
                 does not provide the duration information for each
                 music note which requires the player to learn from his
                 teacher and memorize. As a result, among several
                 thousands of compositions that have been created and
                 recorded with guqin music notation, only around 100 of
                 them are still being played today. In this article we
                 use a machine learning method to study the guqin music
                 recovery problem which tries to use the guqin music
                 notation to recover the duration of each music note.
                 Information provided by the music note is used as
                 features to predict the duration information with a
                 support vector machine. The experimental result shows
                 that our system can predict with fair accuracy, and can
                 be used as a valuable reference for human guqin masters
                 to recover guqin music.",

  abstract =     "The guqin is an ancient Chinese musical instrument
                 that has secured a key position in Chinese elite
                 culture. The guqin has its own special notation
                 composed of reduced characters. The input system of the
                 guqin notation is necessary for digital storage and
                 analysis of guqin notation. This article presents the
                 first handwriting input system of guqin notation. This
                 system adopts a radical-based approach. In this
                 approach, the radicals of the input reduced character
                 are extracted first. Next the layout template that best
                 matches the character is found. The name of the
                 character can then be interpreted according to the
                 radicals and the matching layout template. Radical
                 extraction is the key step of any radical-based
                 approach. In this article a method of radical
                 extraction for online cursive characters is proposed.
                 Experimental results show that the approach is
                 efficient and that the input system performs well.",

  abstract =     "The dichotomy between full detail representation and
                 the efficient management of data digitization is still
                 a big issue in the context of the acquisition and
                 visualization of 3D objects, especially in the field of
                 the cultural heritage. Modern scanning devices enable
                 very detailed geometry to be acquired, but it is
                 usually quite hard to apply these technologies to large
                 artifacts. In this article we present a project aimed
                 at virtually reconstructing the impressive ($7 \times
                 11$ m.) portal of the Ripoll Monastery, Spain. The
                 monument was acquired using triangulation laser
                 scanning technology, producing a dataset of 2212 range
                 maps for a total of more than 1 billion triangles. All
                 the steps of the entire project are described, from the
                 acquisition planning to the final setup for
                 dissemination to the public. We show how time-of-flight
                 laser scanning data can be used to speed-up the
                 alignment process. In addition we show how, after
                 creating a model and repairing imperfections, an
                 interactive and immersive setup enables the public to
                 navigate and display a fully detailed representation of
                 the portal. This article shows that, after careful
                 planning and with the aid of state-of-the-art
                 algorithms, it is now possible to preserve and
                 visualize highly detailed information, even for very
                 large surfaces.",
