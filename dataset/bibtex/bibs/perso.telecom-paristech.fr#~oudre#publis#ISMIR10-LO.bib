  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for local key and chord
estimation from audio signals. A harmonic content of the
musical piece is first extracted by computing a set of chroma
vectors. Correlation with fixed chord and key templates
then selects a set of key/chord pairs for every frame. A
weighted acyclic harmonic graph is then built with these
pairs as vertices, and the use of a musical distance to weigh
its edges. Finally, the output sequences of chords and keys
are obtained by finding the best path in the graph.
The proposed system allows a mutual and beneficial
chord and key estimation. It is evaluated on a corpus composed
of Beatles songs for both the local key estimation
and chord recognition tasks. Results show that it performs
better than state-of-the art chord analysis algorithms while
providing a more complete harmonic analysis.}
