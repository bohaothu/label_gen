In several of my posts, I have spoken of studies about gays and
lesbians as parents, and the effects of home-life on gay and lesbian
youth.  This post is a bibliography of recent research on these
subjects.  I have grouped related articles and categorized them for
people.  I have also included some studies on pediophilia for Dave and
others that think this might be an issue.

I should note that I do not consider this to be a complete
bibliography.  It is what a couple of searches turned up at a local
library. Also, the articles described do not necessarily deal with
adoption per se.  They deal with gays and lesbians as parents, and
their fitness, and the effect on parents learning their children are
gay.

       LANGUAGE: English
       ABSTRACT: Interviewed 10 single gay fathers (aged 29-43 yrs) and 11
single lesbian mothers (aged 32-44 yrs). Data were
consistent with other studies (e.g., M. Harris and P.
Turner; see PA, Vol 74:21804) of gay parents and their
children. Ss consistently reported that their homosexuality
had not caused longterm problems for their children. Most
Ss reported overall positive relationships with their
children and strong parentchild bonds. Compared with
fathers, mothers were more economically depressed,
experienced greater role strain, and reported poorer
relationships with exspouses. Mothers also reported more
difficulty reconciling their gay and parent roles than did
fathers.

       ABSTRACT: Reviews research literature on children of homosexual (HS)
parents, including comparisons with children of heterosexual
parents. CHILDREN OF HS PARENTS DID NOT APPEAR DEVIANT IN
GENDER IDENTITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, OR SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT.
Issues that emerged during their upbringing related more to
society's rejection of homosexuality than to poor parent-
child relationships. Most social adjustment problems
occurred in both groups and were commonly related to family
history of divorce. Results are supported by J. Schwartz's
(unpublished manuscript) investigation of the above variables
in adult-aged daughters in relation to mothers' sexual
orientations, with a focus on role modeling theory.

       ABSTRACT: Explores the problems and benefits that may occur in families
in which a parent is homosexual. Relevant research is
reviewed and critiqued in discussing the legal and
developmental questions that are often raised concerning the
impact that a parent's homosexuality has on his/her
children. In addition, the qualitative relationship between
the parent and child is examined, including a discussion of
the role of the nongay parent and the importance of self-
disclosure. Suggestions for working with families and gay
parents are presented. (21 ref)

       ABSTRACT: Investigated early family backgrounds of 30 gay fathers (aged
22-62 yrs) compared to a matched sample of 30 gay nonfathers
(aged 22-62 yrs), with particular emphasis on parent-son
relationships. It was hypothesized that, contrary to
predictions based on Freudian theory, there would be no
difference in homosexual fathers' and nonfathers'
perceptions of their early family life and relationships
with their mothers and fathers. Questionnaires from these Ss
derived from a larger nationwide study of 285 homosexual men
from Dignity (an organization for homosexuals) chapters in
the US were analyzed using ANOVA. No difference was found
between the fathers' and nonfathers' perceptions of their
parents' acceptance of them. Both groups perceived their
mothers to be significantly more accepting than their
fathers. Both groups also reported growing up in intact
homes where heterosexual relationships were modeled for
them, pleasant memories existed, and marital discord was not
commonplace. These results support the growing body of
research that questions the Freudian-based concept of a
causal relationship between early familial relationship
patterns and sexual orientation. (25 ref)

       ABSTRACT: Assessed data on the early family backgrounds of 30 gay
fathers (aged 22-62 yrs), with particular emphasis on
parent-son relationships. Questionnaire responses from an
instrument that contained questions on demographic
background, parental acceptance, and family atmosphere
during childhood were analyzed using a chi-squared test of
independence. Ss reported growing up in intact homes where
heterosexual relationships were modeled for them, pleasant
memories existed, and marital discord was not commonplace.
Although relationships with mothers were perceived to be
slightly better than those with fathers, both maternal and
paternal parent-child relationships were described more as
adequate and positive than inadequate or negative. (29 ref)

       ABSTRACT: Studied 11 young adults (aged 16-23 yrs) whose mothers, either
prior to or postdivorce, "came out" as lesbian. The Ss'
experiences surrounding their mother's disclosure were
explored, and sexual identity issues and friendships were
highlighted. Findings indicate profound loyalty and
protectiveness toward the mother, openness to diversity, and
sensitivity to the effects of prejudice. Ss reported strong
needs for peer affiliation and perceived secrecy regarding
their mother's lesbianism as necessary for relationship
maintenance. Other concerns, abating over time, were
unrealized fears of male devaluation and homosexuality.
Pervasive sadness about the parental breakup remained and
wishes for family reunification were relinquished when
mother "came out."

etiology to the exploration of whether gay and lesbian
individuals, couples, families, and children in gay- or
lesbian-headed families are as mentally healthy and socially
well-adapted as other populations. In addition, a
psychological metaphor has dominated this field of study, as
researchers have sought to capture the elements of gay and
lesbian identity and the elusive "coming out" process.

their sons. The children mirrored these expectations, boys
with greater frequency than the girls. Most of the children
expressed reservations about having a homosexual mother.

       ABSTRACT: Based on a population of 317 gay and lesbian youths (aged 14-
23 yrs), the current investigation explored the
appropriateness of a reflected appraisals perspective in
predicting the degree to which parental attitudes, as
perceived by youth, affected their self-esteem and
comfortableness being gay. A lesbian was most comfortable
with her sexual orientation if she also reported that her
parents accepted her homosexuality; these variables did not,
however, predict her level of self-esteem. Among gay males,
parental acceptance predicted comfortableness being gay if
the parents were also perceived as important components of a
youth's self-worth; a male most comfortable with his sexual
orientation had the highest level of self-esteem. Results
are discussed in terms of (1) sex of parent, (2) sex-role
development, (3) comparisons of gays and lesbians, and (4)
research on gay and lesbian youth.

process and/or the self-evaluation of 214 homosexual males
and 103 lesbians (aged 14-23 yrs). Ss completed a gay and
lesbian questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Inventory. Lesbians who reported satisfying relationships
with their parents and who had relatively young parents were
more likely to be ""out'' to their parents. Ss who reported
satisfying relationships with their mothers had the highest
levels of self-esteem; males who were out to their mothers and
who had satisfying but infrequent relationships with their
fathers were most likely to report high self-esteem. These
relationships were strongest for males who claimed to be
exclusively homosexual and were raised in small towns.

       LANGUAGE: English
       ABSTRACT: Contends that gay and lesbian youths confront a number of
difficult problems, including telling their parents about
their sexual orientation and helping their families adjust
to the news. Ineffective communication, poor self-esteem,
and unresolved grief and anger often complicate the
adolescent's telling his/her parents. Frequently,
misinformation about homosexuality, religious beliefs, and
homophobia adversely influence parental reactions.
Impediments to the relationship between parents and sexual-
minority youth are discussed, and strategies to promote
positive family adjustment are presented.

       LANGUAGE: English
       ABSTRACT: Explored the relationship between gay men coming out to
parents, and specific perceived parental variables, in an
attempt to discriminate between parents who are more or less
accepting. Factors such as how the disclosure occurred and
reasons for coming out were also investigated. Survey data
from 93 gay men were examined. Results indicate that most
parents initially reacted negatively to the disclosure but
became more accepting over time. Parental values and
characteristics associated with homophobia were found to be
good predictors of the change in parent-son relationship
following disclosure. However, the predictions were often in
unexpected directions. The majority of Ss reported having a
more positive relationship with their mothers than with
their fathers, both before and after coming out.

       ABSTRACT: Studied stages of the coming out process and the influence of
racial and ethnic identification and the pressure of
traditional family values on 27 17-20 yr old African-
American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Eurasian, and Caucasian
male adolescents who were in the midst of accepting a gay
identity. Questionnaire results suggest 3 stages:
sensitization; awareness with confusion, denial, guilt, and
shame; and acceptance. Traditional family values played a
greater role in predicting coming out experiences than did
race. Families were categorized as having high or low
traditional values based on (1) the importance of religion,
(2) emphasis on marriage, (3) emphasis on having children,
and (4) whether a non-English language was spoken in the
home. Families with a strong emphasis on traditional values
were perceived as less accepting of homosexuality than were
the low traditional families.

       ABSTRACT: Examined lifetime sexual behaviors among 2 samples of
predominantly African American or Hispanic male adolescents,
believed to be at high risk for HIV infection: 59 runaways
(aged 12-17 yrs) in 2 residential shelters and 60 Ss (aged
14-18 yrs) attending a community agency (COA) for gay and
bisexual youth. 93% of the runaways had engaged in sexual
activity with female partners. Runaways had a median of 11
female partners; COA Ss had a median of 7 male partners.
Both groups initiated sexual activity at an early age: mean
age of 12.3 yrs for runaways and 12.9 yrs for COA Ss. The
age of initiation of various acts suggested a developmental
sequence of psychosexual milestones within each group. 15%
of COA Ss and 8% of runaways reported consistent condom use.
29% of runaways and 23% of COA Ss received and/or gave money
and/or drugs for sexual acts.

Gay and lesbian youths in out-of-home care settings need to
have equal access to the same quality of care as do other
children in child welfare settings; however, there are major
obstacles to providing effective quality services for these
adolescents. Some of these obstacles are presented, and
suggestions for improvement are provided.

       ABSTRACT: Examined heterosexual adolescent males' negative attitudes
toward gays using data from a 1988 national survey of 1,880
male youth (aged 15-19 yrs). Results indicate that the vast
majority of Ss, 89%, found sex between 2 men "disgusting,"
and only 12% felt confident that they could befriend a gay
person. Ss with more traditional male role attitudes, a
religious fundamentalist orientation, and a parent who had
completed fewer years of education were significantly more
 likely to express homophobic views. However, these models also
indicate that homophobic attitudes were not associated with
the absence of a religious affiliation, placing greater
importance on religion, or frequency of worrying about AIDS.

related to sex roles (instrumentality and expressivity),
sexual orientation, occupational level, and marital status
in 54 lesbian women, 105 heterosexual women, and 161
unselected female controls. The Personal Attributes
Questionnaire was administered to all Ss. Neither
instrumentality nor expressivity alone or in combination
predicted sexual orientation. Lesbians did not differ from
other groups of women on either variable unless they were
being compared with housewives (i.e., married with children
and no job outside the home), who tended to score lower on
instrumentality. Housewives were perceived as deviating from
the norm and thus should be considered as an inappropriate
heterosexual comparison group for lesbian women.

       ABSTRACT: Examined whether male homosexuality arises from prenatal
stress during the brain's sexual differentiation. Stress-
proneness and retrospective reports of stress during
pregnancy were obtained from 215 mothers of male and female
heterosexuals, bisexuals, and homosexuals. For males,
neither between-family nor within-family analyses revealed a
maternal stress effect for either sexual orientation or
childhood gender nonconformity. However, mothers of
effeminate children reported more stress-proneness than other
mothers. Male homosexuality was strongly familial,
suggesting a reconsideration of genetic and familial
environmental mechanisms.

       LANGUAGE: English
       ABSTRACT: Examined (1) whether there is a genetic contribution to male
sexual orientation and (2) the behavioral nature of this
contribution. Three groups of probands (aged 19-65 yrs) were
recruited: male monozygotic (MZ) twins, male dizygotic (DZ)
twins with same-sex cotwins, and male Ss with adoptive
brothers. Sexual orientation of relatives was ascertained by
asking the probands or asking the relatives directly. 52% of
the MZ cotwins, 22% of the DZ cotwins, and 11% of the
adoptive brothers were either homosexual or bisexual.
Homosexuals who behaved like typical boys during childhood did
not appear to have been influenced by external events during
and after childhood, indicating that homosexuality
associated with childhood gender nonconformity is not more
heritable.

       ABSTRACT: Hypothesized that gay males are more likely than heterosexual
men to have been physically abused by parents. This
hypothesis was tested comparing 17 gay and 67 heterosexual
male college students on the Conflict Tactics Scale and
measures of closeness to mother and father and childhood
cross-gendering. Gay males were found to have been more
abused during adolescence. ABUSE WAS RELATED TO A HISTORY OF
CHILDHOOD FEMININITY, TO HAVING POOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
FATHERS, AND TO HAVING ENGAGED IN GAY SEX DURING
ADOLESCENCE.
[*note: abuse is related to factors associated with being gay, yet the
sexual orientaton of the children was not affected by the abuse]

       ABSTRACT: Investigated parental reactions to knowledge of a child's gay

completed W. W. Hudson and W. A. Ricketts's (see PA, Vol
68:7089) index of homophobia (IHP), the Coopersmith Self-
Esteem Inventory for Adults, and short versions of the
Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS) and the Texas Social
Behavior Inventory (TSBI) to measure homophobia and to examine
possible differences and changes in self-esteem and sex-role
stereotyping. Ss with high IHP scores differed significantly
from Ss with low IHP scores with respect to scores on the
AWS and TSBI; high- and low-IHP Ss also differed as to the
amount of time elapsed since their child's disclosure. As
expected, IHP scores correlated negatively with all
measures. Also, the amount of time an S had known of his or
her child's sexuality in combination with the S's sex-role
stereotypes was a good predictor of his or her homophobia
score.

         SOURCE: Law & Psychology Review 1992 Spr Vol 16 189-200
       LANGUAGE: English
       ABSTRACT: Examines how courts faced with a homosexual father or mother
currently decide child custody. Courts that follow the per
se standard of review have concluded that homosexual parents
should automatically lose custody of their children. By
contrast, the nexus approach requires a causal connection
between parental conduct and an adverse effect on the child.
Courts that determine that no adverse impact exists usually
permit the child to remain in the home. A COMMON FEAR OF
SOCIETY IS THAT CHILDREN REARED IN A HOMOSEXUAL MILIEU WILL
BE SOCIALLY STIGMATIZED AND EMOTIONALLY DAMAGED. STUDIES SHOW
THIS FEAR TO BE UNJUSTIFIED. Children of homosexual parents
who were interviewed showed remarkable adaptation to
parental lifestyle. Case materials illustrate the
discussion.

       ABSTRACT: Retrospective self-reports about childhood curiosity to see
persons in the nude were used to compare the development of
erotic sex and age preferences among 4 groups of males: 46
heterosexual pedophiles, 30 homosexual pedophiles, 462
gynephiles (who erotically prefer physically mature
females), and 51 androphiles (who erotically prefer
physically mature males). Results suggest (1) THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF EROTIC SEX PREFERENCE PRECEDES THAT OF
EROTIC AGE PREFERENCE, and (2) a greater proportion of
pedophiles than of individuals who prefer physically mature
partners remembers curiosity in their own childhood to see
nude children without remembering such curiosity in regard
to adults. A further set of retrospective self-reports,
obtained from 78 gynephilic male university students
suggests that in gynephiles the erotic appeal of children of
the preferred sex ceases by about the time of puberty.
