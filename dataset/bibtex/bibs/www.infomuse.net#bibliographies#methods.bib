  title = {A primer on sequence methods},
  journal = {Organization science},
  year = {1990},
  pages = {375--392},
  volume = {1},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {This paper considers the technical problem of analyzing sequences
	of social events. Examples of such sequences from organizational
	behavior include organizational life cycles, patterns of innovation
	development, and career tracks of individuals. The methods considered
	here enable the analyst to find characteristic patterns in such sequences.
	Forces shaping those patterns can then be found by more conventional
	methods. After a brief definitional section, the paper begins by
	discussing three types of sequence questions: (1) questions about
	whether a typical sequence or sequences exist, (2) questions about
	why such patterns might exist, and (3) questions about the consequences
	of such patterns. The theoretical foundations of the first type of
	question, which is in fact the most important, are then considered.
	Having established the legitimacy of the approach here taken, the
	paper then introduces two exemplary datasets with which to focus
	discussion. These raise the issue of conceptualization and measurement
	of sequence data. Illustrative cases are presented to show the importance
	of extreme care in conceiving a sequence to measure and then choosing
	indicators for it. The paper then turns to methods proper, considering
	them in several categories. It first briefly mentions methods not
	employing "distance measures" between events: permutational techniques,
	stochastic (e.g., Markov) models, and durational methods. Most of
	these do not directly address sequence questions but can be used
	to do so if necessary. Turning to the methods based on event distance,
	the paper first considers the problem of measuring distance between
	events (1) in terms of elapsed time, (2) in terms of categories of
	events, and (3) in terms of observed successions. It then considers
	methods for unique event sequences (sequences in which no events
	repeat), proposing the use of multidimensional scaling and illustrating
	it with an analysis of data on medical organizations. For the separate
	case of repeating event sequences, the paper discusses optimal matching
	methods, which count the number of individual transformations required
	to change one sequence into another. These methods are illustrated
	by an analysis of data on musicians' careers. The paper then briefly
	considers the problem of finding subsequences common to several longer
	sequences (or repeated in one longer sequence). It closes with a
	discussion of assumptions made and caveats required when these types
	of methods are used. (METHODOLOGY; SEQUENCES; CAREERS; LIFE CYCLE)

	Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher

	Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have

	theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and
	actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological
	literature that calls itself generically ''qualitative research.''

  abstract = {Abstract: For many qualitative researchers in the social sciences,
	learning about and teaching qualitative research methods and methodology
	raises a number of questions. This topic was the focus of a symposium
	held during the Second B erlin Sum - mer School for Qualitative Research
	Methods in July 2006. In this contribution, some of the issues discussed
	during the symposium are taken up and extended, and some basic dimensions
	underlying these issues are summarized. & How qualitative research
	methods and methodology are taught is closely linked to the ways
	in which qualitative researchers in the social sciences conceptualize
	themselves and their discipline. In the following, we distinguish
	between a paradigmatic and a pragmatic view. From a pragmatic point
	of view, qualitative research methods are considered research strategies
	or techniques and can be taught in the sense of recipes with specific
	steps to be carried out. According to a paradigmatic point of view
	(strongly inspired by constructivism), qualitative research methods
	and methodology are conceptualized as a craft to be practiced together
	by a "master" and an "apprentice." Moreover, the teaching of qualitative
	research methods also depends heavily on the institutional standing
	of qualitative compared to quantitative research method. & Based
	on these considerations, five basic dimensions of learning about
	and teaching qualitative research methods are suggested: ways of
	teaching (ranging from the presentation of textbook knowledge to
	cognitive apprenticeship) and instructors' experience with these;
	institutional contexts, including their development and the teaching
	of qualitative research methods in other than university contexts;
	the "fit" between personality and method, including relevant personal
	skills and talents; and, as a special type of instructional context
	that increasingly has gained importance, distance learning and its
	implications for learning about and teaching qualitative research
	methods. & Key words: learning about and teaching qualitative methods
	and methodology, qualitative research styles, quantitative and qualitative
	methods and methodology, methods and methodology as craft, methods
	and methodology as research strategy, didactics of research methods
	and methodology, institutional contexts of instruction and learning,
	fit between personality and method, transfer of qualitative research
	skills, learning about and teaching qualitative methods in the context

	It outlines what is taken to be the conventional view in many methodological
	discussions, namely, that research questions guide decisions about
	research design and research methods. This position is taken to imply
	that social researchers typically take the view that research methods
	need to be tailored to the research questions that guide an investigation.
	The paper questions how far this position pertains to actual research
	practice. Drawing on interviews with researchers about their practices
	in relation to mixed-method research, two discourses were found in
	the transcripts. A particularistic discourse that reflects the traditional
	view, whereby mixed-method research is viewed as only appropriate
	when research questions warrant it, was uncovered. In addition, a
	universalistic discourse, which sees mixed-method research as more
	generally superior, was also uncovered. The implications of these
	viewpoints for understanding the role of research questions are then

	- The paper presents a literature-based conceptual analysis of pioneering
	work in phenomenology (including that of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger,
	Paul Ricoeur, and others), application of such ideas as intentionality
	and being in information studies work, and the potential for greater
	application of the information seeker as other. Findings - The literature
	on phenomenology contains thought that is directly relevant to information
	studies and information work. Close examination of perception, intentionality,
	and interpretation is integral to individuals' activities related
	to searching for and retrieving information, determining relevance,
	and using technology. Essential to the realization of phenomenology's
	potential is adoption of communication by dialogue so that an information
	seeker is ab le both to conceptualize need and to articulate that
	need. Some promising work in information studies demonstrates an
	openness to the ongoing and continuous perceptual experiences of
	information seekers and the relation of that process of perceiving
	to the growth of knowledge. Originality/value - Offers a different
	way of thinking about human-information relationships and the ways
	that information professionals can interact with information seekers.},

	for its simplicity of use, its focus on subjects' terminology (rather

	objects or labelled cards into distinct groups using a single criterion.
	This paper focuses on the challenges associated with analyzing the

	direct researcher interpretation of elicited linguistic terms are
	distinguished from methods that are purely syntactic, and hence can

	in particular, is highlighted. The set of novel computational techniques

	paper concludes by noting that even large-scale data sets can be
	meaningfully analysed by combining well-known interpretative methods
	with the new computational approaches presented within this special

	analysis. This paper defines NMST, a quantitative measure of knowledge
	discrimination based on repeated, single-criterion card sorts that
	is independent of criteria or category names and that is particularly
	amenable to statistical analysis. The NMST measure is illustrated
	by applying it to a particular data set collected in a large multinational
	card sort study of subjects, where the knowledge area comes from
	a first-year programming course. Applied to this data set, the NMST
	measure is shown to distinguish, with statistical significance, between
	a set of subjects with only an introduction to programming and a
	set of subjects who have completed the equivalent of a bachelor's

	office clothes, with a sample of ten male and ten female subjects
	who normally worked in an office environment. The pictures on the
	cards were taken from catalogues, and showed women's outfits which
	might be worn in an office. The subjects sorted the cards repeatedly
	and generated criteria and categories of their own choice. Some of
	the criteria and categories had not been previously reported in the
	clothing research literature. Over half of the male subjects, but
	none of the female subjects, used 'married/unmarried woman' as a
	sorting criterion, although only one of the images sorted showed
	a wedding ring. A significantly higher proportion of male than of
	female subjects used dichotomous categorization (i.e. sorting the
	cards into two piles for one or more of the criteria). The reasons
	for this are obscure, but do not appear to be a simple outcome of
	males not knowing much about female clothing. Previous research into
	clothing has tended to involve researcher-centred approaches such
	as semiotics; the results from this study suggest that there would
	be advantages in wider use of subject-centred approaches such as
	card sorts, both in this domain and elsewhere. It was concluded that
	card sorts were a useful method and should be more widely used.},

  abstract = {This article examines the claim that fieldwork is an adequate method
	for gaining knowledge of everyday life. It points to similarities
	between the conditions of anthropological knowledge and those of
	everyday life through a discussion of a single ethnographic example,
	the buying and selling of cattle in south-west France. Four interrelated
	themes emerge. First, an exploration of the idea of 'acquiring habits
	for action' through fieldwork, or apprenticeship, and its congruence
	with the practices of everyday life, for this has implications that
	impinge upon discussions of ethnographic method, ethnographic writing
	and the status of anthropological knowledge. Second, attention is
	drawn to the effects introduced into ethnographic descriptions and,
	more generally, into social practice, by the abstracting or 'objectifying'
	properties of language, that tend to eliminate any trace of temporality
	and of the acquisition of habits, of context, and of 'lived life'.
	The third theme, which is organized around the inescapably temporal
	nature of the experience of everyday life and the potential inadequacy
	of language to express fully that nature, concerns the complexity
	of 'social ordering' and the importance of what has been called 'mutual
	interpretation' in the creation of 'the social'. Experience is structured
	by the exploration of heteroclite realities that are owned by nobody,
	but which are functions of everybody's understandings. Lastly, this
	location of the 'objectivity' of the social emphasizes the matter
	of constraints to be acknowledged and resources to be exploited,
	and in particular points to questions of inequality or power, and
	how these pertain to the field, fieldwork and ethnography.},

  abstract = {The bricolage offers insight into new forms of rigor and complexity
	in social research. This article explores new forms of complex, multimethodological,
	multilogical forms of inquiry into the social, cultural, political,
	psychological, and educational domains. Picking up where his previous
	Qualitative Inquiry article on the bricolage left off, this article
	examines not only the epistemological but also the ontological dimensions
	of multimethodological/multitheoretical research. Focusing on webs
	of relationships instead of simply things-in-themselves, the bricoleur
	constructs the object of study in a more complex framework. In this
	process, attention is directed toward processes, relationships, and
	interconnections among phenomena. Such analysis leads bricoleurs
	to multiple dimensions of multilogicality. In this context, the article
	generates a variety of important categories in which multiple perspectives
	may be constructed: methodology, theory, interpretation, power relations,
	and narratology.},

	the concept of bricolage, the essay describes a critical notion of

	avoids both the superficiality of methodological breadth and the
	parochialism of unidisciplinary approaches. The notion of the bricolage
	advocated here recognizes the dialectical nature of the disciplinary
	and interdisciplinary relationship and promotes a synergistic interaction
	between the two concepts. In this context, the bricolage is concerned
	not only with divergent methods of inquiry but with diverse theoretical
	and philosophical understandings of the various elements encountered
	in the act of research. The insights garnered here move researchers
	to a better conceptual grasp of the complexity of the research acta
	cognizance often missed in mainstream versions of qualitative research.
	In particular, critical bricoleurs employ historiographical, philosophical,
	and social theoretical lenses to gain a more complex understanding
	of the intricacies of research design. },

	created during the process of qualitative analysis? A methodological
	(conventional) answer to this question usually speaks of mental processes
	and conceptual work. This paper suggests a different view???sociological
	rather than methodological; or more precisely a view inspired by
	a contemporary sociology of science. It describes qualitative analysis
	as a set of material practices. Taking grounded theory methodology
	and the work with the computer programme Atlas.ti as an example,
	it is argued that thinking is inseparable from doing even in this
	domain. It is argued that by adopting the suggested perspective we
	might be better able to speak of otherwise hardly graspable processes
	of qualitative analysis in more accountable and instructable ways.
	Further, software packages would be better understood not only as
	"mere tools" for coding and retrieving, but also as complex virtual
	environments for embodied and practice-based knowledge making. Finally,
	grounded theory methodology might appear in a somewhat different
	light: when described not in terms of methodological or theoretical
	concepts but rather in terms of what we practically do with the analysed
	data, it becomes perfectly compatible with the radical constructivist,
	textualist, or even post-structuralist paradigms of interpretation
	(from which it has allegedly departed by a long way). URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs0802124},

  abstract = {This article reviews the field of qualitative inquiry, identifying
	three conceptual breaks: the "orthodox consensus" of positivism which
	conceives the social world as a collection of external facts and
	attempts to eliminate bias and subjectivity; postpositivist philosophy
	of science, which concedes that objective observation of pure data
	is impossible but nevertheless tries to establish criteria of "good"
	research practice; and the interpretive turn, which rehabilitates
	subjectivity and views data collection as a mutual construction of
	meaning where the researcher is engaged in "double hermeneutics"
	(GIDDENS). The interpretive turn has implications for history, memory,
	and storage of data. However, while recognizing the interactionist
	and contextual nature of data collection, the article points out
	that it is counterproductive to overemphasize its implications, as
	some postmodern strands of interpretive research do. Drawing on the
	hermeneutic notions of objectivation and the hermeneutic circle,
	it is argued that interpretive research data consist of objectivations,
	and therefore lend themselves to storage and future revision, newly
	emerging questions, and (re-) interpretation. Furthermore, data storage
	allows for data access by non-specialists, including the subjects
	of the research. Archiving consequently potentially contributes to
	empowerment, feedback and dialogue. Key words: interpretive turn,
	qualitative data, history, memory, archiving, hermeneutics, dialogue,
	empowerment 1. Conceptual Breaks within Qualitative Research 2. The
	Turn towards Interpretation 3. History, Memory, Storage },

	Respondents were asked to discuss either a serious life or health

	situation in terms of sequential steps, to form the timeline. For
	each step, they were then asked to remember the questions they had
	at each previously named step. Here the interview technique diverged
	from the strict time-line interview format. For specific points in
	the map identified by researchers, open-ended questions "querying
	respondents about their behavior, thoughts and the reasons behind
	those behaviors and thoughts" were asked to "tap into the evaluation
	criteria behind the respondent's thoughts, actions and reactions.
	Probes for clarity, probes for coverage, and chaining for depth were
	also employed. The method did result in a set of criteria, though
	there were more criteria regarding source evaluation than strategy
	evaluation. Strength of time-line interviewing methodology: - taps
	into cognitive behavior - has been more widely used in a variety
	of settings than other user-oriented methods - presupposes no particular
	information system, thereby giving us access to any and all information
	systems - "takes advantage of the way she assumes human beings perceive
	their realities by tapping respondents' experiences in sequential
	order. This allows the researcher access to either past, present
	or future criteria as defined by the respondent, a method that is
	relatively naturalistic and unobtrusive." (p. 154) Weaknesses of

	Rigor in IS research is still one of the critical scientific issues
	facing the field. Without solid validation of the instruments that
	are used to gather data on which findings and interpretations are
	based, the very scientific basis of the profession is threatened.
	This study builds on four prior retrospectives of IS research that
	conclude that IS positivist researchers continue to face major barriers
	in instrument, statistical, and other forms of validation. It goes
	beyond these studies by offering analyses of the state-of-the-art
	of research validities and deriving specific heuristics for research
	practice in the validities. Some of these heuristics will, no doubt,
	be controversial. But we believe that it is time for the IS academic
	profession to bring such issues into the open for community debate.
	This article is a first step in that direction. Based on our interpretation
	of the importance of a long list of validities, this paper suggests
	heuristics for reinvigorating the quest for validation in IS research
	via content/construct validity, reliability, manipulation validity,
	and statistical conclusion validity. New guidelines for validation

	of the World Wide Web. The outline of content analysis as a systematic
	and quantitative scientific method for measuring the content of messages
	have existed for centuries. Nevertheless, its development and diffusion
	have been primarily spurred by the rise of mass media, newspapers
	in the 19th century and electronic media in the 20th century. The
	growth of the Internet promises to induce a similar expansion of
	its use and refinement of its techniques. The World Wide Web is characterized
	by its ubiquity, global reach, interactivity decentralized, hyperlinked
	structure, and multimedia format. All of these characteristics present
	researchers with opportunities and challenges at each step of a content
	analysis: sampling, unitization, development of content categories,
	coding, and analysis. Based on a review of recent content analytic
	research, this article analyzes these issues and suggests methodological
	improvements for future research.},

	of interpretive qualitative research (objectivity, evaluation of
	studies, sampling, context, interpretation and integrity) that emerge
	from a review of nine research methods involving synthesis and a
	broader review of the research synthesis literature. Seven fundamental

	procedure is presented. In conclusion, the aims of synthesis procedures

	widely used in library and information science (LIS) studies with
	varying research goals and objectives. The research method is applied
	in qualitative, quantitative, and sometimes mixed modes of research
	frameworks and employs a wide range of analytical techniques to generate
	findings and put them into context. This article characterizes content
	analysis as a systematic, rigorous approach to analyzing documents
	obtained or generated in the course of research. It briefly describes
	the steps involved in content analysis, differentiates between quantitative
	and qualitative content analysis, and shows that content analysis
	serves the purposes of both quantitative research and qualitative
	research. The authors draw on selected LIS studies that have used
	content analysis to illustrate the concepts addressed in the article.
	The article also serves as a gateway to methodological books and
	articles that provide more detail about aspects of content analysis
	discussed only briefly in the article. Reprinted by permission of

	an acknowledgement that such generalisations can be made must bring
	us to specify the limits of generalisation in interpretive research.
