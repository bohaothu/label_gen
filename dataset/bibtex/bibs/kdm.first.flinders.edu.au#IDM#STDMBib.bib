   Abstract = {The development of systems for knowledge discovery in databases, including the use of association rules, has become a major research issue in recent years.  Although initially motivated by the desire to analyse large retail transaction databases, the general utility of association rules makes them applicable to a wide range of different learning tasks.  However association rules do not accommodate the temporal relationships that may be intrinsically important in some application domains.  In this paper we present an extension to association rules to accommodate temporal semantics.  By finding associated attributes first and then looking for temporal relationships between them, these temporal association rules incorporate potentially valuable temporal semantics.  Our approach to temporal reasoning accommodates both event-based and interval-based models of time simultaneously.  In addition, the use of a generalised taxonomy of relationships supports the generalisation of temporal relationships and their specification at different levels of abstraction.  This approach also facilitates the possibility of reasoning with incomplete or missing information.  Preliminary experimental results have indicated that the cost of adding temporal knowledge is of the same order as the cost of learning the initial association rules.},

At the same time, interest in temporal databases has been increasing and an increasing number of both prototype and implemented systems are using an enhanced temporal understanding to explain aspects of behaviour associated with the implicit time-varying nature of the universe.  This paper investigates the confluence of these two areas, surveys the work to date, and explores the issues involved and the outstanding problems in temporal data mining.},
