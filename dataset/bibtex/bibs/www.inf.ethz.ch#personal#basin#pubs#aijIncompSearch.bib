ABSTRACT = {
We examine search algorithms in games with incomplete
information, formalising a best defence model of such games
based on the assumptions typically made when
incomplete information problems are analysed in expert
texts.  We show that equilibrium point strategies for
optimal play exist for this model, and define an
algorithm capable of computing such strategies.  Using
this algorithm as a reference we then analyse search
architectures that have been proposed for the
incomplete information game of Bridge. These
architectures select strategies by analysing some
statistically significant collection of complete
information sub-games.  Our model allows us to clearly
state the limitations of such architectures in
producing expert analysis, and to precisely formalise
and distinguish the problems that lead to
sub-optimality.  We illustrate these problems with
simple game trees and with actual play situations from
Bridge itself.
