Corpus-based concatenative methods for musical sound synthesis have
attracted much attention recently.
They make use of a variety of sound snippets in a database to assemble a
desired sound or phrase according to a target specification given in sound
descriptors or by an example sound.

With ever-larger sound databases easily available, together with a
pertinent description of their contents, they are increasingly used for
composition, high-level instrument synthesis, interactive exploration
of a sound corpus, and others.

This paper gives an overview of the components needed for corpus-based
concatenative synthesis, and details of some realisations.

Signal processing methods are crucial for all parts of analysis, (segmentation
and descriptor analysis), for synthesis, and can intervene in the selection part
e.g. for spectral matching.},

    abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mainstay of modern data analysis - a black box that is widely used but poorly understood. The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This tutorial focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works; furthermore, it crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA . This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.},
