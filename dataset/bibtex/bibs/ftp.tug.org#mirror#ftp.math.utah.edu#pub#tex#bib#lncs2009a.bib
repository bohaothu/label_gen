                 problem. However, the availability of different types
                 of framework for publishing web content greatly
                 increases the number of web pages. Therefore, the
                 crawler should be fast enough to prioritize and
                 download the important pages. As the importance of a
                 page is not known before or during its download, the
                 crawler needs a great deal of time to approximate the
                 importance to prioritize the download of the web pages.
                 In this research, we propose Fractional PageRank
                 crawlers that prioritize the downloaded pages for the
                 purpose of discovering important URLs early during the
                 crawl. Our experiments demonstrate that they improve
                 the running time dramatically while crawling the

  abstract =     "Web search engines use link-based reputation systems
                 (e.g. PageRank) to measure the importance of web pages,
                 giving rise to the strategic manipulations of
                 hyperlinks by spammers and others to boost their web
                 pages' reputation scores. Hopcroft and Sheldon [10]
                 study this phenomenon by proposing a network formation
                 game in which nodes strategically select their outgoing
                 links in order to maximize their PageRank scores. They
                 pose an open question in [10] asking whether all Nash
                 equilibria in the PageRank game are insensitive to the
                 restart probability $\alpha$ of the PageRank algorithm.
                 They show that a positive answer to the question would
                 imply that all Nash equilibria in the PageRank game
                 must satisfy some strong algebraic symmetry, a property
                 rarely satisfied by real web graphs. In this paper, we
                 give a negative answer to this open question. We
                 present a family of graphs that are Nash equilibria in
                 the PageRank game only for certain choices of
                 $\alpha$.",

                 information retrieval to provide a content-neutral
                 ranking metric over web pages. It employs power method
                 iterations to solve for the steady-state vector of a
                 DTMC. The defining one-step probability transition
                 matrix of this DTMC is derived from the hyperlink
                 structure of the web and a model of web surfing
                 behaviour which accounts for user bookmarks and
                 memorised URLs. \par

                 In this paper we look to provide a more accessible,
                 more broadly applicable explanation than has been given
                 in the literature of how to make PageRank calculation
                 more tractable through removal of the dangling-page
                 matrix. This allows web pages without outgoing links to
                 be removed before we employ power method iterations. It
                 also allows decomposition of the problem according to
                 irreducible subcomponents of the original transition
                 matrix. Our explanation also covers a PageRank
                 extension to accommodate TrustRank. In setting out our
                 alternative explanation, we introduce and apply a
                 general linear algebraic theorem which allows us to map
                 homogeneous singular linear systems of index one to
                 inhomogeneous non-singular linear systems with a shared
                 solution vector. As an aside, we show in this paper
                 that irreducibility is not required for PageRank to be
                 well-defined.",
