  abstract = {Automotive systems have to support a large variety of functional and technical variants.
	For that purpose it has to be decided early in the development process whether different variants shall be implemented by one generic software solution or by several specific solutions.
	In the research project VEIA description means, methods, and the prototypical tool v.control have been developed to answer this question.

	In v.control functional requirements and software solutions are represented by architecture models.
	Their elements may be variable, that means that the description language supports the indication of options, alternatives, and parameters.
	Via the connection with models of the characteristic features of the system's variants executable models can be generated that, in addition, conform to AUTOSAR.
	To evaluate design alternatives for the different software solutions metrics have been defined and implemented.
	In this way the prototype does not only prove the feasability of the method developed in the project, but also demonstrates the objective utility of the construction of VEIA models for the development process.},
