  abstract = {Based on our recent observations at the 7th International Semantic Web Conference and some related workshops as the ``Social Data on The Web&#39;&#39;, as well as other frequent discussion threads on the Web, trust and privacy on the Social Web remains a hot, yet unresolved topic. Indeed, while Web 2.0 helped people to easily produce data, it lead to various issues regarding how to protect and trust this data, especially when it comes to personal data. On the one hand, we are wondering how to protect our private information online, above all when this information is re-used at our disadvantage. On the other hand, information should not only be protected when being published by its owners, but tools should also help users to assess trustworthiness of third-party information online. According to our recent research works, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, we think that Semantic Web technologies can provide at least partial solutions to enable a &#39;trust and privacy layer&#39; on top of the Social Web. Hence, this position paper will present our work on the topic, that is in our opinion, also particularly relevant to the mobile Web community, according to the advances of ubiquitous Social Networking with, e.g., microblogging from mobile devices.},
