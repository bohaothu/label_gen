                 introduced to represent {\em inter al.} mappings from a
                 set into itself. Although not every diagram is
                 decomposable into a finite number of given base
                 diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
                 to a suitable extension of the given set and of the
                 basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods
                 of flow diagrams are given. The first has three base
                 diagrams; the second only two. In the second part of
                 the paper, the second methd is applied to the theory of
                 Turing machines. With every Turing machine provided
                 with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar
                 machine, doing essentially the same job, but working on
                 a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing
                 alternate blank squares. The new machine belongs to the
                 family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition
                 and iteration from the two machines $\lambda$ and $R$.
                 That family is a proper subfamily of the whole family
                 of Turing machines.",
