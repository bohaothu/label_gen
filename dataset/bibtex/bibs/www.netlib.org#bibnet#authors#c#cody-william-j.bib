%%%                        This bibliography was developed from NHFB's

%%%                        ftp.ira.uka.de, from searches of

%%%                        from the bibliographies in WJC's papers.
%%%                        WJC (now retired) kindly provided some
%%%                        corrections, and references to 13 papers
%%%                        which NHFB's searches had missed.

%%%                        BibTeX citation tags are uniformly chosen
%%%                        as name:year:abbrev, where name is the
%%%                        family name of the first author or editor,
%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
%%%                        3-letter condensation of important title
%%%                        words. Citation tags were automatically
%%%                        generated by the biblabel software

                 a summary of approximations to the elementary functions
                 for the CDC-1604 computer. The approximations and
                 techniques suggested by Maehly are equally applicable
                 to the second large computer in the CDC line, the 3600.
                 Unlike the 1604, however, the 3600 has built-in
                 double-precision floating-point arithmetic. The present
                 work, largely inspired by the successes of Maehly and
                 his associates, concerns the extension of one of
                 Maehly's ideas to a double-precision subroutine for the

                 Approximations in Function Evaluation Routines'' [Comm.
                 ACM 10, (March 1967)], C. T. Fike fails to discuss one
                 very important aspect of the ``economical'' methods for
                 polynomials. Since these evaluation methods involve a
                 decreased number of arithmetic operations over the
                 usual Horner's method (or at least replace a
                 multiplication by an addition) the implication is that
                 they are faster to execute. Dr. Fike points out that
                 these methods can be poorly conditioned for particular
                 polynomials, thus requiring extended precision or
                 fixed-point arithmetic to maintain accuracy and costing
                 more in time than Horner's method. But even if we
                 assume the methods are well conditioned, the need to
                 store away and retrieve intermediate results in some
                 machines with only one floating-point arithmetic
                 register can wipe out the time savings effected by a
                 reduction in the number of arithmetic operations. On
                 many of today's high-performance computers the time
                 required to store away and retrieve a result is about
                 the same as the time required for a floating-point
                 addition. It is no longer sufficient to estimate the
                 efficiency of a method by a count of arithmetic
                 operations alone.",
