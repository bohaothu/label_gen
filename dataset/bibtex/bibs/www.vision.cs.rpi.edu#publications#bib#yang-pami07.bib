  abstract =	 {Our goal is an automated 2d-image-pair registration
                  algorithm capable of aligning images taken of a wide
                  variety of natural and man-made scenes as well as
                  many medical images. The algorithm should handle low
                  overlap, substantial orientation and scale
                  differences, large illumination variations, and
                  physical changes in the scene. An important
                  component of this is the ability to automatically
                  reject pairs that have no overlap or have too many
                  differences to be aligned well. \\ We propose a
                  complete algorithm, including techniques for
                  initialization, for estimating transformation
                  parameters, and for automatically deciding if an
                  estimate is correct. Keypoints extracted and matched
                  between images are used to generate initial
                  similarity transform estimates, each accurate over a
                  small region. These initial estimates are
                  rank-ordered and tested individually in
                  succession. Each estimate is refined using the
                  Dual-Bootstrap ICP algorithm, driven by matching of
                  multiscale features. A three-part decision criteria,
                  combining measurements of alignment accuracy,
                  stability in the estimate, and consistency in the
                  constraints, determines whether the refined
                  transformation estimate is accepted as
                  correct. Experimental results on a data set of 22
                  challenging image pairs show that the algorithm
                  effectively aligns 19 of the 22 pairs and rejects
                  99.8\% of the misalignments that occur when all
                  possible pairs are tried. The algorithm
                  substantially out-performs algorithms based on
                  keypoint matching alone.}
