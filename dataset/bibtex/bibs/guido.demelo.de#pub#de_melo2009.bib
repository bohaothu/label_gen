  abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for creating user interfaces from
abstract representations for the automotive domain. The approach is based on transformations between different user interface abstraction levels.
Existing user interface representation methods are presented and evaluated. The impact of specific requirements for automotive human-ma\-chine interaction is discussed. Considering these requirements a process based on transformation rules is outlined
to allow for flexible integration of external infotainment applications coming from mobile devices or web sources into the in-car interaction environment.},
