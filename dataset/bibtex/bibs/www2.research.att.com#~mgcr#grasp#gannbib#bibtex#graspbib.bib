			Each edge $e$ having extremities into two different 
			components of $T$ is considered a candidate for 
			being inserted into the current tree, but immediately 
			discarded (reduction strategy) if it does not respect 
			some conditions that depend on three criteria and 
			that, if verified, ensure that it is unlikely that 
			the involved edge can be part of an improving 
			move. 
			One criterion is based on the relative cost $r(e)$ 
			of the edge $e$, i.e. the difference between the 
			weight of a minimum spanning tree and the weight of 
			a constrained spanning tree in which the presence 
			of $e$ is enforced. 
			Another criterion is based on the decomposition 
			of the cost of a move defined by the candidate edge 
			$e$ for insertion and by a candidate path $(p--q)$ 
			(from $p$ to $q$) for removal. 
			The cost $\Delta$ of such a move can be written as 
			$\Delta=\Delta_1+\Delta_2$, where $\Delta_1$ is 
			associated with the edge exchanges that will generate 
			the component containing $e$ in the new solution, 
			while $\Delta_2$ is given by the reconnection of 
			the remaining elements along the candidate path 
			$(p--q)$. 
			The third criterion does not compute $\Delta_2$ 
			and uses a lower bound $\delta\leq \delta_1$: 
			a candidate edge $e$ is discarded if $\delta\geq 0$ 
			for each possible candidate path $(p--q)$ that 
			can be used in conjunction with $e$.
			The authors also propose a {GRASP} that uses the same 
			neighborhood structure as the previously described 
			local search and some short term memory elements 
			of tabu search and that implements a randomized 
			version of a savings heuristic in the construction 
			phase.
