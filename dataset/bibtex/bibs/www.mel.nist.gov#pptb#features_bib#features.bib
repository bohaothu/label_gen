Bibliography on Form Features and Feature-based Design


Mike Pratt - October 1993


	Key to symbols (which refer to documents in my own
possession): B - Book (or Bound proceedings), D - Copy in RDRC Design
Group Paper Library (DGPL), E - Extract of document referred to, J -
Journal in which paper appears, O - Overheads from conference
presentation, P - Photocopy or reprint of paper, P' - Preprint or
draft, X - Not in my possession or in DGPL.

	A few recent references are included to papers concerning
features in the context of robot vision.  However, the bibliography is
not intended to be exhaustive in this field.  Coverage is much more
complete in the areas of automated feature recognition from geometric
models and applications of form features in mechanical engineering
design, group technology coding, process planning, assembly planning,
tolerancing and related areas.  Selected papers are also included on
robotics and kinematics generally as they affect assembly modelling
and tolerancing theory.  Some papers on tools for concurrent
engineering are included.  The papers listed are mainly concerned with
representational issues.
