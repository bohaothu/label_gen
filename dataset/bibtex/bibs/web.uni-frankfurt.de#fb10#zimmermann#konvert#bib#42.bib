	topic={robotics;dynamic-systems;reasoning-about-noisy-sensors;},
	contentnote={Abstract: Dynamic world modeling requires the integration of multiple sensor
		observations obtained from multiple vehicle locations at different times.
		A crucial problem in this interpretation task is the presence of uncertainty
		in the origins of measurements (data association or correspondence uncertainty)
		as well as in the values of measurements (noise uncertainty). Almost all
		previous work in robotics has not distinguished between these two very
		different forms of uncertainty. In this paper we propose to model the uncertainty
		due to noise, e.g. the error in an object's position, by conventional covariance
		matrices. To represent the data association uncertainty, an hypothesis
		tree is constructed, the branches at any node representing different possible
		assignments of measurements to features. A rigorous Bayesian data association
		framework is then introduced that allows the probability of each hypothesis
		to be calculated. These probabilities can be used to guide an intelligent
		pruning strategy. The multiple hypothesis tree allows decisions concerning
		the assignment of measurements to be postponed. Instead, many different
		hypotheses are considered. Expected observations are predicted for each
		hypothesis and these are compared with actual measurements. Hypotheses
		that have their predictions supported by measurements increase in probability
		compared with hypotheses whose predictions are unsupported. By "looking
		ahead" two or three time steps and examining the probabilities at the leaves
		of the tree, very accurate assignment decisions can be made. For dynamic
		world modeling, the approach results in multiple world models at a given
		time step, each one representing a possible interpretation of all past
		and current measurements and each having an associated probability. In
		addition, each geometric feature has an associated covariance that models
		the uncertainty due to noise. This framework is independent of the sensing
		modality, being applicable to most temporal data association problems.
		It is therefore appropriate for the broad class of vision, acoustic and
		range sensors currently used on existing mobile robots. Preliminary results
		using ultrasonic range data demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

	contentnote={Abstract: A central problem in multistrategy learning systems is the selection
		and sequencing of machine learning algorithms for particular situations.
		This is typically done by the system designer who analyzes the learning
		task and implements the appropriate algorithm or sequence of algorithms
		for that task. We propose a solution to this problem which enables an AI
		system with a library of machine learning algorithms to select and sequence
		appropriate algorithms autonomously. Furthermore, instead of relying on
		the system designer or user to provide a learning goal or target concept
		to the learning system, our method enables the system to determine its
		learning goals based on analysis of its successes and failures at the performance
		task. The method involves three steps: Given a performance failure, the
		learner examines a trace of its reasoning prior to the failure to diagnose
		what went wrong (blame assignment); given the resultant explanation of
		the reasoning failure, the learner posts explicitly represented learning
		goals to change its background knowledge (deciding what to learn); and
		given a set of learning goals, the learner uses nonlinear planning techniques
		to assemble a sequence of machine learning algorithms, represented as planning
		operators, to achieve the learning goals (learning-strategy construction).
		In support of these operations, we define the types of reasoning failures,
		a taxonomy of failure causes, a second-order formalism to represent reasoning
		traces, a taxonomy of learning goals that specify desired change to the
		background knowledge of a system, and a declarative task-formalism representation
		of learning algorithms. We present the Meta-AQUA system, an implemented
		multistrategy learner that operates in the domain of story understanding.
		Extensive empirical evaluations of Meta-AQUA show that it performs significantly
		better in a deliberative, planful mode than in a reflexive mode in which
		learning goals are ablated and, furthermore, that the arbitrary ordering
		of learning algorithms can lead to worse performance than no learning at
		all. We conclude that explicit representation and sequencing of learning
		goals is necessary for avoiding negative interactions between learning
		algorithms that can lead to less effective learning. }

		The main contribution of this work is a theory of credal networks that
		displays as much flexibility and representational power as the theory of
		standard Bayesian networks. Results in this paper show how to express judgements
		of irrelevance and independence, and how to compute inferences in credal
		networks. A credal network admits several extensions---several sets of
		probability measures comply with the constraints represented by a network.
		Two types of extensions are investigated. The properties of strong extensions
		are clarified through a new generalization of d-separation, and exact and
		approximate inference methods are described for strong extensions. Novel
		results are presented for natural extensions, and linear fractional programming
		methods are described for natural extensions. The paper also investigates
		credal networks that are defined globally through perturbations of a single

		system that takes two inputs. The first is an ontology that defines the
		classes (e.g., company, person, employee, product) and relations (e.g.,
		employed_by, produced_by) of interest when creating the knowledge base.
		The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext
		that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs,
		the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks
		on the Web. This article describes our general approach, several machine
		learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a
		prototype system that has created a knowledge base describing university
