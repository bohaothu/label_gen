                 retrieval is considered as uncertain inference. Here we
                 present a new, powerful inference method for this
                 purpose which combines Datalog with probability theory
                 on the basis of intensional semantics. We describe
                 syntax and semantics of probabilistic Datalog and also
                 present an evaluation method and a prototype
                 implementation. This approach allows for easy
                 formulation of specific retrieval models for arbitrary
                 applications, and classical probabilistic IR models can
                 be implemented by specifying the appropriate rules. In
                 comparison to other approaches, the possibility of
                 recursive rules allows for more powerful inferences.
                 Finally, probabilistic Datalog can be used as a query
                 language for integrated information retrieval and
                 database systems."

      combination with uncertain inference. Different data types with vague predicates are required to allow for queries referring to
      arbitrary attributes of documents. Physical data independence separates search operators from access paths, thus solving text
      search problems related to noun phrases, compound words and proper nouns. Projection and inheritance on attributes support the
      creation of unified views on a set of IR databases. Uncertain inference allows for query processing even on incompatible database

                 has the advantage that it avoids repeated computations
                 by storing all intermediate results and replacing
                 recomputation by table lookup. However, in general,
                 storing all intermediate results for the duration of a
                 computation wastes space. In this paper, we propose an

                 fairly general class of programs at any given time
                 stores only a small subset of the facts generated. The

                 combination of vague criteria. A single database object
                 can meet a vague criterion to a certain degree. We
                 confine ourselves to queries for which the answer can
                 be computed efficiently by (perhaps repetitive)
                 combination of rankings to new rankings. Since users
                 usually will inspect some of the best answer objects
                 only, the corresponding rankings need to be computed
                 just as far as necessary to generate these first answer
                 objects. In this contribution we describe an approach
                 for estimating the number of elements needed from the
                 basic rankings to compute a given number of elements of
                 the resulting ranking. Experiments with a large text
