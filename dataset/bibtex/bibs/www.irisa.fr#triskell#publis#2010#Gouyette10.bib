	Abstract = {This paper presents a tool-suite to model variability of a Software Product Line with feature models in the context of multi-views engineering. This tool-suite proposes four modules: (i) to model variability of views using a feature diagram, (ii) to select features required for a specific product, (iii) to derive a product and (iv) to visualize variability information directly inside the base-model editor. This tool is developed and tested on the ANR Movida project which deals with multi-views engineering as part of Model-Driven Engineering.},

  abstract = {Product derivation, i.e. reusing core assets to build products, did
	not receive sufficient attention from the product-line community,
	yielding a frustrating situation. On the one hand, automated product
	derivation approaches are inflexible; they do not allow products
	meeting unforeseen, customer-specific, requirements. On the other
	hand, approaches that consider this issue do not provide adequate
	methodological guidelines nor automated support. This paper proposes
	an integrated product derivation approach reconciling the two views
	to offer both flexibility and automation. First, we perform a pre-configuration
	of the product by selecting desired features in a generic feature
	model and automatically composing their related product-line core
	assets. Then, we adapt the pre-configured product to its customer-specific
	requirements via derivation primitives combined by product engineers
	and controlled by constraints that flexibly set product line boundaries.
	Our process is supported by the Kermeta metamodeling environment
	and illustrated through an example.},
