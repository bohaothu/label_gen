 Abstract  =  "In comparison to symbolic differentiation and numerical differencing, the main rule-based technique of automatic differentiation is shown to evaluate partial derivatives accurately and cheaply. In particular, it is demonstrated that the reverse mode of automatic differentiation yields any gradient vector at no more than five times the cost of evaluating the underlying scalar function. After developing the basic mathematics, the author describes several software implementations and briefly discuss the ramifications for optimization."
