  abstract = {The Semantic Web is about to grow up. Over the last few years technologies and standards to build up the architecture of this next generation of the Web have matured and are being deployed on large scale in many live Web sites. The underlying technology stack of the Semantic Web consists of several standards endorsed by the World Wide Web consortium (W3C) that provide the formal underpinings of a machine-readable ``Web of Data'': (i) the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as a uniform exchange syntax; (ii) the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a uniform data exchange format; (iii) RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for describig ontologies; (iv) the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) to exchange rules; (v) XQuery and SPARQL as query and transformation languages. The present habilitation thesis comprises a collection of articles reflecting the author's contribution in addressing a number of relevant research problems to close gaps in the Semantic Web architecture regarding the theoretical and practical interplay of these standards.},
