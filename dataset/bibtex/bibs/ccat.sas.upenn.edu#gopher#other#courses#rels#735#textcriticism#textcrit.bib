I thought I would add a note on a small book everyone knows and 
uses: Paul Maas, Textkritik, 3d ed. (Leipzig: Teubner, 1957), 
also available in English translation: Textual Criticism, tr. 
Barbara Flower (Oxford: Clarendon, 1958).  I should point out 
that it is Lachmannian through and through, but it is still a 
good intro.  For a list of subjects, I append here an old handout 
for a privatissimum I had long ago on the subject, but it may be 
of use to you as a place to hang your thoughts.  If you add to it 
or have exceptions to make, let us know. 

 1. recensio, examinatio, interpretatio, emendatio.
 2. stemma and the genealogical method.
 3. families, types, etc.
 4. shared innovations.
 5. autograph, copy, archetype, hyparchetype, exemplar.
 6. scribal errors. errors of the eye, the hand, the ear.
 7. haplography, dittography, lettres dansantes, poor eidetic memory.
 8. lectio difficilior, facilior.
 9. wandering eye.
10. parallel texts.
11. poor knowledge of scribal tradition.
12. codicology and textual critisism.
13. gatherings and their nature.
14. omission signs.
15. signatures of various kinds; custodes.
16. corrective signs of various kinds, cf. Isidore.
17. marginalia.
18. interlinear material.
19. Problems of order of the text. Interpolations.
20. Word confusion: 
      Oh, that this all too sullied/solid flesh would melt!
21. Suspension marks.
22. holes in the parchment.
23. Diplomatic edition.
24. Zeilengetreue edition.
25. photographic edition; problems.
2S. crux.
27. logic; knowledge of ones author.
28. normalization.
29. dialect variants and their origins.
30. scriptoria and their practices.
31. good and bad manuscripts.
32. Lachmann, Quentin, Bedier.
33. The unique manuscript and textual criticism.
34. Generic vs. genetic in textual criticism.
35. The attribution of works of literature (see other page on this).
36. Rejection of passages because they do not fit expected patterns.
37. Agreement & influence: the problem of reciprocal corrections.
      Did Gottfried precede Wolfram or vice versa or neither?
38. Infusion of texts.

52. Variantenverzeichnis, variorum edition, text to choose.
53. The individual mistake and the tendency of the text.
[54. Special problems of translated texts. RAK]


Editing techniques
[From: Jim Marchand <marchand@UX1.CSO.UIUC.EDU>
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 1994 09:13:07 CST]

To aid in the discussion of editing techniques, I herewith append 
one of the handouts for my talk at SASS last spring, on editing 
techniques for Old Norse texts.  It is fragmentary and is not the 
real handout, which I could not find, but it should be a place to 
hang one's thoughts. 

[The question of editing set me to thinking.  I recently had to 
make up a time-line of events in editing technique, and I said at 
the time from memory that it was in the Vaestgoeta Lag edition of 
Schlyter and Collin (1827) that the first stemma appeared.  As 
usual, I had lost my confirmation, and, since I don't make it up 
to the library very much, was kind of stuck.  I now can offer 
confirmation: Go"sta Holm, "Carl Johan Schlyter and Textual 
Scholarship," Saga och Sed, Kungl. Gustav Adolfs Akademiens 
Aarsbok (Uppsala: Lundequist, 1972), 48-80.  I am sure he is 
right when he says (p. 52): "as far as I can see, his is the 
first manuscript stemma ever to be published."  This is fairly 
important, for he seems not to have been influenced by Lachmann, 
and it shows (read Goethe & Herder) that Darwinism and dendrology 
were in the air.  Colwell's article on "Genealogical Method" 
ought to be required reading for editors. (Sun, 24 Jul 1994 
19:42:00 CST Jim Marchand <marchand@UX1.CSO.UIUC.EDU>)] 
  

<h1>Timeline of Editing Techniques</>

1820- Dendrology.  Main proponent Lachmann, cf. S. Timpanaro, La 
genesi del metodo del Lachmann (Florence, 1963).  First stemma 
drawn by Schlyter in his edition of the V!stg!talagen, SGL 1 
(1827). 

1850- For a short time the attempt at a Zeilengetreue edition 
appeared, with Uppstroem's still valid work on Gothic and, in 
Scandinavia, particularly Konradh Gislason's Um frum-partar 
islenzkrar tungu i fornoeld (Copenhagen, 1846).  Cf. Hans Fix, 
"Production and Usage of a Machine-Readable Manuscript: A Report 
on the Saarbruecken Verson of Gragas Konungsbok," Computer 
Applications to Medieval Studies, ed. Anne Gilmour-Bryson.  
Studies in Medieval Culture XVII (Kalamazoo, 1984), 107-116. 

1900- growing dissatisfaction with the genealogical method, 
culminating in Bedier's many attacks, beginning with his 
introduction to Le Lai de l'Ombre par Jean Renart, SATF (Paris, 
1913).  The theory of the Leithandschrift. 

1920- Dom Henri Quentin introduced the notion of numerical 
taxonomy to textual criticism in Memoire sur l'etablissement du 
texte de la Vulgate (Rome, 1922).  Cf. Dom J. Froger, La critique 
des textes et son automatisation.  Initiation aux nouveautes de 
la science, 7 (Paris, 1968). 

1947- Colwell's Dilemma. In "Genealogical Method: Its 
Achievements and its Limitations," Journal of Biblical Literature 
19 (1947), 109-133, E. C. Colwell, the famous textual critic of 
the Bible, mounted the strongest attack yet against the 
genealogical method, in which he pointed out that it would only 
work with a paucity of material. 

1969- Hypertext.  Marchand's experiments with PLATO offer a text 
which is not read in a one-pass method.  Various attempts at 
reproduction of manuscripts on the computer.  Fonts.  
Grundlehner. 

1970- Image Processing.  The methods used in processing images in 
America's space program are used for manuscripts.  Scanning and 
photography are combined, and we can now use the computer as both 
darkroom and camers: Marchand, "The Computer as Camera and 
Darkroom," Offline 37, ed Robert Kraft, 22-27. Posted for ftp in 
the following groups: HUMANIST, IOUDAIOS, and RELIGION, January 
30, 1992. It appears in hard copy in Religious Studies News 7, 2 
(March 1992) and CSSR Bulletin 21, 2 (April 1992). 

1985- Reconstitution.  Attempts are made at reconstituting a 
manuscript, that is, using imaging techniques to make a copy of 
the manuscript which resembles the original more then the 
original (which has usually suffered the ravages of time and 
`scholarship'). Marchand, "The Use of the Personal Computer in 
the Humanities," Ideal 2 (1987), 17-32. 

1989 - People begin to place texts (at first in ASCII, then in 
SGML markup) on the network.  Project Gutenberg, Online Book 
Initiative, Oxford Text Archive arise, and, finally, Lysator, 
where a number of works of Old Swedish are placed, using various 
markup techniques.  Gopher to Sweden and search for Lysator. 

1990- Pictures and hypertexts can now be sent by network.  The 
University of Illinois' Mosaic program, for example, permits 
hypertext online.  One can download manuscript images of high 
quality, such as those of the Vatican exhibit and the Book of 
Kells.  For Mosaic: 
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/mosaic-
docs.html 

1990- Various mark-up languages arise, such as SGML, and editions 
are now available with such things as grammatical clues, mise en 
page, etc. indicated.  With the arrival of HTML and browsers such 
as Mosaic, hypertext editions are creatable by anyone. For HTML: 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html, and: 
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html. 

1994- First hypertext/html edition of Old Norse material (runes), 
Runer i Bergen. http://gonzo.hd.uib.no/NCCH-
docs/Runehtml/rib1.html 

<h1>Some Types of Edition</>

1. Ad usum delphini.  Editions which are normalized and normally 
without textual notes.  Meant to be used in the classroom. 

     1a. Editio castigata, a bowdlerized edition; editio 
definitiva, the edition `approved' by the author as final; 
Ausgabe letzter Hand, last edition put out by the author, with 
possible additions. 

2. Modernized.  Editions, such as those of the 
islendingasagnautgafan, where the text has been slightly 
modernized. 

3. Diplomatic edition.  Here, several versions of the same text 
are presented, usually in an `apparatus' at the bottom of the 
page.  Either some attempt is made at reconstructing the 
`archetype' [see 3a, below] or a manuscript is presented with 
differences presented in the apparatus.  Usually contains 
conjectural emendations.  Finnur J!nsson's Skjaldedigtning. 

[3a. Eclectic edition. An attempt is made to recreate from the 
textual materials as close an approximation as possible to the 
oldest recoverable form of the target text. Emendations are often 
employed. RAK]

4. Zeilengetreu ["Replica" edition. RAK].  In such an edition, an 
attempt is made to preserve the mise en page of the original; 
lines are maintained, punctuation is retained, etc. Cf. G!slason, 
mentioned above. 

5.  Photographic.  An edition made by film and camera for the 
most part, using various filtrations and methods of printing. 

6.  Computer enhanced.  Either a photograph is scanned in or a 
digitizing camera is used.  Using (one hopes) only algorithms, 
the image is enhanced to improve the photographic image.  With 
patience, miracles can be attained. 

<h1>Interesting Quotations</>

1. James Willis, Latin Textual Criticism (Urbana: U of Illinois, 
1972), 2: "There are many useful jobs which can be done by men 
who do not like to think. They can dig ditches, clean 
automobiles, and compile concordances. They cannot, however, 
become good textual critics. For the other tasks the willingness 
to work and the ability to understand and carry out simple 
instructions are enough: in textual criticism there are no simple 
instructions. Its subject matter is, at the one end, the highest 
achievements of literary technique; at the other, the mistakes 
made and the lies told by ignorant, careless, or impudent 
scribes, arising from negligence, misunderstanding, and a 
pernicious desire to do good." {Don't you just hate scribes?} 

(I should have added translations, with their various types.

<h>Bibliography on Text Criticism and Editing:</>
[From: Avril Henry <A.K.Henry@EXETER.AC.UK>
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993]

There are conflicting views on "editorial procedure", but the 
following bibliography might give you something to bite on. The 
standard (some say out-dated) book is the one by Maas, to whom 
there is, as you see below, an "update" [by M. L. West] as well 
as several works denying that the process he recommends (formal 
recension) is any use. Still, if "contamination" is not present 
-- and it isn't always -- then his logical steps do get results. 
I leave the rest of the membership to jump in with cries of 
horror. 

PLease forgive the presence of _our_ shelf-marks (or shaming 
notes to the effect that we don't have the book) -- there's no 
time to edit them out of what is only a working bibliography.
