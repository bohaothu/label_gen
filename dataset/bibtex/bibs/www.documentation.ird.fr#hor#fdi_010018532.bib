  abstract = {{A}cadja is a fishing method widely practiced in the coastal lagoons of {B}enin. {T}he principle of this traditional fishery is to set dense masses of branches in shallow water, which attract wild fish in large numbers. {T}he yearly production is very high : 7 to 20 t/ha. {E}xploited within a short time (two to three months), the acadja system could be considered simply as a fish trap or aggregating device. {I}f harvested after a longer period (six to 12 months), it may be considered as a culture system (retention, breeding, propagation, natural feeding and growth). {T}his contribution explores the latter. {T}wo production systems were used : an acadja-enclos (enclosure with acadja) and an enclosure without acadja used a a control. {A}fter 12 months, a biomass equivalent to 8 t/ha was harvested from the acadja, eight times higher than the control system. {A}mong the 18 species of fish harvested, {S}arotherodon melanotheron represented 79% of the biomass. {A}nalysis of the fish population showed that the young fry had entered through the net at the beginning of the experiment and grown in the acadja-enclos. {T}here were no differences in condition factor between the {S}. melanotheron from the acadja-enclos and from open water. {F}urther experiments have shown that acadja-enclos, which can be considered as "bamboo reefs", are very suitable for fish production in rural {C}{\^o}te d'{I}voire. {T}he acadja-enclos system appears to increase productivity greatly in lagoon fish culture. {T}he same principle could be applied in extensive aquaculture or in various aquatic management programs. {F}urther research is needed to understand the basis of this high productivity.
