 abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a multi\- modal system for pervasive context-
	aware service provision and human-environment interaction in augmented environments by the 
	use of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) or SmartPhones. The system enables mobile devices 
	and remote displays to perform as interaction devices with pervasive applications which 
	run on a dynamically composed server network. Visual interaction for service setup and 
	provision are driven by appropriate graphical interfaces and XML-based protocols, 
	which are dynamically composed according to the type of service and to the user current 
	position by means of a mobile agent-based framework. The paper discusses both protocols, 
	hardware and software system components. The first part of the document gives a general
	description of the system, which is managed by an entity-driven organization in
	augmented reality. The mobile and reference devices of the system framework are
	then discussed, along with the mobile agent software which is used to manage connections 
	among them and with system entities. The paper also gives some details
	about the ad-hoc protocols for entity interaction. Next, a case study is discussed
	dealing with service provision in a campus augmented environment which has been
	arranged according to service requirements. Finally the paper discusses some user
	experiences while using trial services.},
