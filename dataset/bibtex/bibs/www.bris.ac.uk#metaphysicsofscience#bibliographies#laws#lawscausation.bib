  abstract = {In this paper it will be argued that causal laws describe the actions
	of causal powers. The process which results from such an action is
	one which belongs to a natural kind, the essence of which is that
	it is a display of this causal power. Therefore, if anything has
	a given causal power necessarily, it must be naturally disposed to
	act in the manner prescribed by the causal law describing the action
	of this causal power. In the formal expressions of causal laws, the
	necessity operators occur within the scopes of the universal quantifiers.
	Hence the necessities must hold of each instance. The causal laws
	may thus be shown to be concerned with necessary connections between
	events or circumstances of precisely the sort required for a decent
	account of singular causation.},

  abstract = {Humean accounts of law are at the same time accounts of causation.
	Accordingly, since laws are nothing but contingent cosmic regularities,
	to be a cause is just to be an instance of such a law. Every particular
	cause-effect pair, according to these accounts, instantiates some
	law of nature. I argue that this claim is false. Singular causation
	without being governed by any law is logically and physically possible.
	Separating causes from laws enables us to see the distinct role each
	plays in science, especially in matters related to prediction and
	explanation.},
