ABSTRACT:: 
  Self-reconfiguring robots are modular systems that can change shape,
or "reconfigure," to match structure to task. They comprise many
small, discrete, often identical modules that connect together and
that are minimally actuated. Global shape transformation is achieved
by composing local motions. Systems with a single module type, known
as "homogeneous" systems, gain fault tolerance, robustness and low
production cost from module interchangeability. However, we are
interested in "heterogeneous" systems, which include multiple types of
modules such as those with sensors, batteries or wheels.  We believe
that heterogeneous systems offer the same benefits as homogeneous
systems with the added ability to match not only structure to task,
but also capability to task.
   Although significant results have been achieved in understanding
homogeneous systems, research in heterogeneous systems is challenging
as key algorithmic issues remain unexplored. We propose in this thesis
to investigate questions in four main areas: 1) how to classify
heterogeneous systems, 2) how to develop efficient heterogeneous
reconfiguration algorithms with desired characteristics, 3) how to
characterize the complexity of key algorithmic problems, and 4) how to
apply these heterogeneous algorithms to perform useful new tasks in
simulation and in the physical world. Our goal is to develop an
algorithmic basis for heterogeneous systems. This has theoretical
significance in that it addresses a major open problem in the field,
and practical significance in providing self-reconfiguring robots with
increased capabilities.
