  abstract	= {This book summarizes the results of the Swedish national
		  real-time systems research initiative ARTES and provides a
		  few representative examples of the science and scientific
		  results that have emerged from ARTES.
		  
		  ARTES was supported by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic
		  Research (SSF), with a total of 95 MSEK between 1998 and
		  2006. ARTES has unified and given strength to the Swedish
		  real-time and embedded systems research community, and
		  contributed substantially to advancing Sweden's
		  international position in this area. ARTES has had a
		  catalytic and coordinating effect for a total research
		  effort extending far beyond the funding provided by SSF. It
		  has created important synergies between disciplines,
		  ensured industrial relevance in research, and facilitated
		  important academic and industrial networking for
		  approximately 100 senior researchers and some 200
		  post-graduate students.}
