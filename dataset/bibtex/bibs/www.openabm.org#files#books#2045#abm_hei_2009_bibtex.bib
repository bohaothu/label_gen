   Abstract = {Behavioural models that allow simple representation of the complexity of human–environment links are important in vulnerability assessment because they allow the analysis of human adaptive processes in a changing environment. This paper applies an agent-based framework that considers the behavioural model of farmers in three villages in a municipality in the Philippines. Agent-based modelling is a useful policy tool for simulating the effects of different adaptation options on reducing vulnerability because it allows representation of not only the dynamic changes in climate and market but also the dynamic adaptive process of different groups of communities to the impacts of these changes. Model simulations of adaptation options under various global change scenarios showed that production support would significantly reduce future vulnerability only if complemented with appropriate market support. It is thus important for policy to provide a complementary bundle of adaptation measures. Lack of money and information are the most important reasons for not applying available technical adaptation measures, which currently hinder reduction of vulnerability in selected villages in the municipality. Social networks, which play an important role in adapting to environmental changes, are limited to relatives and neighbours, who are important sources of informal credit.},

   Volume = {95},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {54-79},
   Abstract = {Traditional approaches to studying human–environment interactions often ignore individual-level information, do not account for complexities, or fail to integrate cross-scale or cross-discipline data and methods, thus, in many situations, resulting in a great loss in predictive or explanatory power. This article reports on the development, implementation, validation, and results of an agent-based spatial model that addresses such issues. Using data from Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas (China), the model simulates the impact of the growing rural population on the forests and panda habitat. The households in Wolong follow a traditional rural lifestyle, in which fuelwood consumption has been shown to cause panda habitat degradation. By tracking the life history of individual persons and the dynamics of households, this model equips household agents with "knowledge" about themselves, other agents, and the environment and allows individual agents to interact with each other and the environment through their activities in accordance with a set of artificial-intelligence rules. The households and environment coevolve over time and space, resulting in macroscopic human and habitat dynamics. The results from the model may have value for understanding the roles of socioeconomic and demographic factors, for identifying particular areas of special concern, and for conservation policy making. In addition to the specific results of the study, the general approach described here may provide researchers with a useful general framework to capture complex human–environment interactions, to incorporate individual-level information, and to help integrate multidisciplinary research efforts, theories, data, and methods across varying spatial and temporal scales.},

   Journal = {Ecological Economics},
   Volume = {66},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {615-627},
   Abstract = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) Duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) Mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, (iii) Configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit.

Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e. social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders.},

traditional population-based epidemiological models in terms of assumptions, conceptual models, and
model structures. In particular, the author discusses four aspects of the model: (1) population segments
or unique individuals as the modeling unit, (2) continuous process or discrete events to represent the
disease development through time, (3) traveling wave or network dispersion to represent the disease
transmission in space, and (4) within-group and between-group interactions to represent local and
long-distance transmissions. Based on these conceptual discussions, a simple influenza epidemic is
simulated in order to illustrate the application of the proposed framework.},

The framework specifies a network model structure and six associated parameters. These parameters describe the properties of nodes, the properties of links, and the topology of the network. Through this model structure and associated parameters, this framework allows the representation of discrete individuals, individualized interactions, and interaction patterns in a network of human contact.

   Journal = {Environmental Modelling and Software},
   Volume = {24},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {173-190},
   Abstract = {Subsistence farming communities are dependent on the landscape to provide the resource base upon which their societies can be built. A key component of this is the role of climate and the feedback between rainfall, crop growth, land clearance and their coupling to the hydrological cycle. Temporal fluctuations in rainfall alter the spatial distribution of water availability, which in turn is mediated by soil-type, slope and landcover. This pattern ultimately determines the locations within the landscape that can support agriculture and controls sustainability of farming practices. The representation of such a system requires us to couple together the dynamics of human and ecological systems and landscape change, each of which constitutes a significant modelling challenge on its own. Here we present a proto-type coupled modelling system to simulate land-use change by bringing together three simple process models: (a) an agent-based model of subsistence farming; (b) an individual-based model of forest dynamics; and (c) a spatially explicit hydrological model which predicts distributed soil moisture and basin scale water fluxes. Using this modelling system we investigate how demographic changes influence deforestation and assess its impact on forest ecology, stream hydrology and changes in water availability.},

   Abstract = {This paper proposes a review of the development and use of multi-agent simulations (MAS) for ecosystem management. The use of this methodology and the associated tools accompanies the shifts in various paradigms on the study of ecological complexity. Behavior and interactions are now key issues for understanding and modeling ecosystem organization, and models are used in a constructivist way. MAS are introduced conceptually and are compared with individual-based modeling approaches. Various architectures of agents are presented, the role of the environment is emphasized and some computer tools are presented. A discussion follows on the use of MAS for ecosystem management. The strength of MAS has been discussed for social sciences and for spatial issues such as land-use change. We argue here that MAS are useful for problems integrating social and spatial aspects. Then we discuss how MAS can be used for several purposes, from theorization to collective decision-making support. We propose some research perspectives on individual decision making processes, institutions, scales, the credibility of models and the use of MAS. In conclusion we argue that researchers in the field of ecosystem management can use multi-agent systems to go beyond the role of the individual and to study more deeply and more effectively the different forms of organization (spatial, networks, hierarchies) and interactions among different organizational levels. For that objective there is considerably more fruit to be had on the tree of collaboration between social, ecological, and computer scientists than has so far been harvested.},

   Volume = {32},

   Pages = {6-18},
   Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate local housing market dynamics by applying an urban spatial model of gentrification based on Smith’s rent gap theory [Smith, N. (1979). Toward a theory of gentrification: a back to the city movement by capital, not people. APA Journal, 538–548]. Smith’s supply side approach explains the emergence of gentrifying neighbourhoods on the basis of investments spent in “large scale renewal projects” which only investors or developers looking for profits are able to carry out. They invest in degraded areas on the base of the gap between the actual rent and the potential rent after rehabilitation (rent gap). Afterwards the process is sustained by an imitative cooperative behaviour of property owners having advantage in investing in their properties since the quality of the nearby buildings, and their rents, arises.

In Smith’s thesis home owners, landlords and developers are the leading actors coming into play of gentrification; they behave according to the search of profit or to the enhancement of their property rents, but their decisions to invest or not are conditioned by the quality of the neighbourhood. Space is a founding element in Smith’s approach to gentrification.

In this paper, multi-agent systems and cellular automata have been envisaged as offering the most suitable modelling approach to the rent gap theory.

A set of behavioural rules for each agent involved (homeowner, landlord, tenant and developer, and the passive agent “property unit”) has been formalized in the model and implemented on a NetLogo platform. A wide range of urban system simulations have been carried on with different parameter values concerning size of the neighbourhood, rent gap threshold, and amount of capital invested. The state of each cell (property unit) at each cycle is defined in terms of rent value and a maintenance level.

All the simulations show in the long run an oscillatory behaviour of the system. The study identifies the critical parameter values which affect radical changes in the system evolution. },

Interactive GeoGraph 3D visualizations allow researchers to zoom and pan within the simulation landscape as the model runs. Model-specific 3D representations of agents flock together on terrain landscapes, and teleport or travel along links on network landscapes. Agents may be displayed on network nodes either as individual agents or as dynamic 3D bar charts that reflect the composition of each node's population. Batch modes support scientific control via fully separated random number series, customized parameter combinations, and automatic data collection for many thousands of simulation runs.

   Number = {2},
   Note = {Required},
   Abstract = {A multi-agent system was developed to simulate strategies of natural resource management in the Causse Méjan, a limestone plateau dominated by a rare grassland-dominated ecosystem endangered by pine invasion. To stimulate the emergence of alternative long-term management strategies for the sheep farms and the woodlands, contrasting dynamic viewpoints on land resources were designed at different space scales. To begin with, they were individually used to validate the model with each type of main stakeholders (foresters, farmers and the National Park of Cévennes rangers), to improve it and to propose individual scenarios of natural resource management. Once the model improved, the set of viewpoints made it possible to assess the impact of the individual scenarios on the main productive (sheep stocking rate, timber growth) and environmental (endangered species, landscape value) stakes on any spatial entity considered as relevant by any stakeholder. As the different opinions were collectively viewed and confronted, the need to agree to a compromise was highlighted and led to new scenarios based on more collective management of the pine woodlands. The results of these alternative scenarios were collectively evaluated anew and it was then possible to select a set of feasible scenarios stemming from current actors' perceptions and practices and to suggest alternative sylvopastoral management based on innovative practices. The paper underlines the usefulness of the representation of viewpoints in that it allowed for scenario description and impact assessment of the compared management strategies. It also shows how the step-by-step approach contributed to improve decision-making by National Park managers.},

   Title = {Multi-scale analysis of a household level agent-based model
of landcover change},
   Journal = {Journal of Environmental Management},
   Volume = {72},
   Pages = {57–72},
   Abstract = {Scale issues have significant implications for the analysis of social and biophysical processes in complex systems. These same scale
implications are likewise considerations for the design and application of models of landcover change. Scale issues have wide-ranging effects
from the representativeness of data used to validate models to aggregation errors introduced in the model structure. This paper presents an
analysis of how scale issues affect an agent-based model (ABM) of landcover change developed for a research area in the Midwest, USA. The
research presented here explores how scale factors affect the design and application of agent-based landcover change models.
The ABM is composed of a series of heterogeneous agents who make landuse decisions on a portfolio of cells in a raster-based
programming environment. The model is calibrated using measures of fit derived from both spatial composition and spatial pattern metrics
from multi-temporal landcover data interpreted from historical aerial photography. A model calibration process is used to find a best-fit set of
parameter weights assigned to agents’ preferences for different landuses (agriculture, pasture, timber production, and non-harvested forest).
Previous research using this model has shown how a heterogeneous set of agents with differing preferences for a portfolio of landuses
produces the best fit to landcover changes observed in the study area.
The scale dependence of the model is explored by varying the resolution of the input data used to calibrate the model (observed landcover),
ancillary datasets that affect land suitability (topography), and the resolution of the model landscape on which agents make decisions. To
explore the impact of these scale relationships the model is run with input datasets constructed at the following spatial resolutions: 60, 90,
120, 150, 240, 300 and 480 m. The results show that the distribution of landuse-preference weights differs as a function of scale. In addition,
with the gradient descent model fitting method used in this analysis the model was not able to converge to an acceptable fit at the 300 and
480 m spatial resolutions. This is a product of the ratio of the input cell resolution to the average parcel size in the landscape. This paper uses
these findings to identify scale considerations in the design, development, validation and application of ABMs of landcover change.},

   Abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between ‘pragmatic’ motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and ‘paradigmatic’ motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not ‘realism’ but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the ‘parts’ (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system’s properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

   Abstract = {Twelve papers featured in a special issue on individual-based modelling in ecology are reviewed in an effort to
identify common methodological and theoretical issues. The review focuses on issues related to the question of
whether and how individual-based modelling is changing ecological theory. One major hindrance impeding the
generation of theory from individual-based models (IBMs) is the fact that IBMs are more or less complex computer
simulation models. They are thus hard to develop, hard to communicate, and hard to analyse. Solving this problem
requires both software tools which help to implement and communicate IBMs and at least the same effort in
analysing the models as is currently put into their development. A new field of application of IBMs is Virtual
Ecology, i.e. the comparison of simulated data sets with those obtained by virtual (i.e. simulated) ecologists. This
method allows field methods, empirical measures and sampling protocols to be optimised. As far as theoretical issues
are concerned, individual variability was by far the most important issue discussed in the papers. Previously most
studies concentrated on the mechanisms generating individual variability, but there is now also a growing number of
models addressing the consequences of individual variability for population and community dynamics. In order to
determine these consequences, a currency is required which allows the model populations to be evaluated. Persistence
and other stability properties are proposed as such a unifying currency. The lesson contained in our review is that
even with just twelve papers more or less explicitly oriented towards ecological theory, elements of a theory that might
emerge from individual-based modelling in the future can already be identified.},

   Abstract = {This paper combines agent-based modeling of structural change with agricultural policy analysis. Using the agent-based model AgriPoliS, we investigate the impact of a regime switch in agricultural policy on structural change under various framework conditions. Instead of first doing a sensitivity analysis to analyze the properties of our model and then examining the introduced policy in an isolated manner, we use a meta-modeling approach in combination with the statistical technique of Design of Experiments to systematically analyze the relationship between policy change and model assumptions regarding key determinants of structural change such as interest rates, managerial abilities, and technical change. As a result, we observe that the effects of policies are quite sensitive to the mentioned properties. We conclude that an isolated analysis of a policy regime switch would be of only minor value for policy advice given the ability of simulation models to examine various potential futures.},

   Address= {Banff, Alberta, Canada},
   Abstract = {This paper describes advancements in recreation management using new technology that couples Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with Intelligent Autonomous Agents to simulate recreation behaviour in real world settings. RBSim is a computer program that allows park management to explore the consequences of change to any one or more variables so that the goal of accommodating increasing visitor use is achieved while maintaining the quality of visitor experience. RBSim provides both a qualitative understanding of management scenarios by the use of map graphics from a GIS as well as a quantitative understanding of management consequences by generating statistics during the simulation. Managers are able to identify points of over crowding, bottle necks in circulation systems, and conflicts between different user groups.

RBSim is designed to be easy to use by park management staff. This is facilitated through a tight integration with MapInfo GIS which allows a practical solution for quickly building complex simulation models. Simulation techniques provide methods for evaluating details of management decisions as they impact visitors and the environment. No other analysis tool that achieves this level of understanding is currently available.

The paper describes RBSim focussing on the parameters required to generate simulation models for existing and proposed park management scenarios},

   Pages = {475-491},

This study uses an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach to simulate residential dynamics in an area of Boston that has increasingly experienced gentrification in the past decades. The model is instantiated using basic empirical data and uses simple decision-making rules, differentiated into four classes, to simulate the process of residential dynamics. The model employs the consumption explanation of the cause of gentrification, which emphasizes the choices of individuals drawn to urban amenities, while testing the production explanation, which suggests that major investments from the public and private sphere attract and explain gentrification. Verification shows that the processes in the model work according to its construction, simulates complexity and emergent phenomena, and may be a valuable explanatory tool for understanding and learning about some processes underlying gentrification.},

   Journal = {Ecological Modelling},
   Volume = {220},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {160-174},
   Abstract = {A multi-agent simulation (MAS) was developed to assess the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue in southern France, a non-endemic area where mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (Culicidae) live. The contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, or the human biting rate, is one of the key factor to predict the risk of re-emergence of malaria, would the parasite be introduced in the region. Our model (called MALCAM) represents the different agents that could influence malaria transmission in the Camargue – people, mosquitoes, animal hosts and the landscape – in a spatially explicit environment. The model simulates spatial and temporal variations in human biting rate at the landscape scale. These variations depend on the distribution of people and potential vectors, their behaviour and their interactions. A land use/cover map was used as a cellular-spatial support for the movements of and interactions between mobile agents. The model was tested for its sensitivity to variations in parameter values, and for the agreement between field observations and model predictions. The MALCAM model provides a tool to better understand the interactions between the multiple agents of the disease transmission system, and the land use and land cover factors that control the spatial heterogeneity in these interactions. It allows testing hypotheses and scenarios related to disease dynamics by varying the value of exogenous biological, geographical, or human factors. This application of agent-based modelling to a human vector-borne disease can be adapted to different diseases and regions.},

   Pages = {553–563},
   Abstract = {Urban sprawl is an essential environmental issue to be monitored and forecasted in order to think about alternatives that could
lead to a more sustainable future development. Thus, the objective of the project presented here is to simulate the past and future
transformation of suburban land use patterns in the Vienna Region. (The paper describes some results of the project, “STAU-Wien”
(City–Suburb relations and development in the Vienna Region), was carried out during 2000–2002).
The paper discusses driving forces of suburban growth, and presents a model that simulates polycentric development of suburban
systems. The model introduces different settlement growth velocities within the suburban region considering housing area
densification and land use change from open space to built up area. In particular, the model takes into account suburban population
migration and commercial start ups controlled by regional and local factors (attractiveness/constraints) in the suburban Vienna
Region: large and small scale accessibility (traveling time to the core city, access to motorways), land prices, landscape attractiveness,
social and commercial services supply, traffic exposure obstacles as well as (land use) zoning constraints. The approach concentrates
on a Spatial Agent Model to stimulate regional migration and allocation decisions of households and commercial enterprises aiming
in the selection of target municipalities. Land use change will finally be performed by a cellular automaton to decide on densification
and land use change. The model has been developed and applied to simulate prior and future landscape transition processes for
the suburban region in the surroundings of Vienna, Austria.},

   Journal = {Conservation Ecology},
   Volume = {5},
   Number = {2},
   Abstract = { Two case studies are presented in which models were used as focal tools in problems associated with common-pool resource management in developing countries. In the first case study, based in Zimbabwe, Bayesian or Belief Networks were used in a project designed to enhance the adaptive management capacity of a community in a semiarid rangeland system. In the second case study, based in Senegal, multi-agent systems models were used in the context of role plays to communicate research findings to a community, as well as to explore policies for improved management of rangelands and arable lands over which herders and farmers were in conflict.

The paper provides examples of the use of computer-based modeling with stakeholders who had limited experience with computer systems and numerical analyses. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the major lessons learned from the two independent case studies. Perhaps the most important lesson was the development of a common understanding of a problem through the development of the models with key stakeholders. A second key lesson was the need for research to be adaptive if it were to benefit adaptive managers. Both case study situations required significant changes in project orientation as stakeholder needs were defined. Both case studies recognized the key role that research, and particularly the development of models, played in bring different actors together to formulate improved management strategies or policies. Participatory engagement with stakeholders is a time-consuming and relatively costly process in which, in the case studies, most of the costs were born by the research projects themselves. We raise the concern that these activities may not be widely replicable if such costs are not reduced or born by the stakeholders themselves.},

   Abstract = {As humans increasingly occupy and modify marginal landscapes, previously unobserved long timescale, emergent behaviors related to interactions between natural processes and human agency are possible. Barrier islands, which are low-lying strips of sand separated from a coast by lagoons, cut by inlets and topped by sand dunes, have been significantly modified through the development of tourist resorts. Resorts and barrier islands are dynamically coupled through storm damage and beach erosion, and measures taken to prevent or mitigate them. In response to rising sea level, a natural barrier island migrates steadily up the continental shelf. In contrast, we show that in a novel numerical model-coupling barrier island processes with resort development, storm damage, and hazard mitigation, policy decisions driven by market dynamics destabilize barrier island response to rising sea level, giving rise to emergent, episodic boom and bust cycles, which alternate in phase alongshore, and less frequent, regionally extensive resort destruction events. Developed barrier islands are precariously maintained at lower elevations and further offshore than their natural counterparts, a situation exacerbated by insurance, which can lead to island inundation. Our results suggest that coastal areas that have recently instituted protection measures eventually will experience a widespread upsurge in damage if these practices are sustained, even in the absence of climate-change-induced increased storminess.},

   Pages = {9-44},
   Abstract = {This paper presents a status report concerning on-going research andd evelopment work by a
team of Canadian researchers to develop a microsimulation, agent-based, integrated model of
urban land use and transportation. It describes in some detail the overall design and current status
of the ILUTE (IntegratedLand Use, Transportation, Environment) modelling system under
development. The overall purpose of ILUTE is to simulate the evolution of an entire urban region
over an extended period of time. Such a model is intended to replace conventional, aggregate,
static models for the analysis of a broadrange of transportation, housing andothe r urban policies.
Agents being simulated in the model include individuals, households and establishments. The
model operates on a ‘‘100% sample’’ (i.e., the entire population) of agents which, in the base case,
are synthesizedf rom more aggregate data such as census tables andw hich are then evolved over
time by the model. A range of modelling methods are employed within the modelling system to
represent individual agents’ behaviours, including simple state transition models, random utility
choice models, rule-based ‘‘computational process’’ models, and hybrids of these approaches. A
major emphasis within ILUTE is the development ofmicrosimulationmodels ofmarket demandsupply
interactions, particularly within the residential and commercial real estate markets. In
addition, travel demand is modelled explicitly as the outcome of a combination of household and
individual decisions concerning the participation in out-of-home activities over the course of a day.
Spatial entities in the model include buildings, residential dwelling units and commercial floorspace,
as well as aggregate ‘‘spatial containers’’ such as traffic zones, census tracts or gridc ells.},

   Abstract = {Cross-site comparisons of case studies have been identified as an important priority by the land-use science community. From an empirical perspective, such comparisons potentially allow generalizations that may contribute to production of global-scale land-use and land-cover change projections. From a theoretical perspective, such comparisons can inform development of a theory of land-use science by identifying potential hypotheses and supporting or refuting evidence. This paper undertakes a structured comparison of four case studies of land-use change in frontier regions that follow an agent-based modeling approach. Our hypothesis is that each case study represents a particular manifestation of a common process. Given differences in initial conditions among sites and the time at which the process is observed, actual mechanisms and outcomes are anticipated to differ substantially between sites. Our goal is to reveal both commonalities and differences among research sites, model implementations, and ultimately, conclusions derived from the modeling process.},

   Abstract = {The use of agent-based models (ABMs) for investigating land-use science questions
has been increasing dramatically over the last decade. Modelers have moved
from ‘proofs of existence’ toy models to case-specific, multi-scaled, multi-actor,
and data-intensive models of land-use and land-cover change. An international
workshop, titled ‘Multi-Agent Modeling and Collaborative Planning—
Method2Method Workshop’, was held in Bonn in 2005 in order to bring together
researchers using different data collection approaches to informing agent-based
models. Participants identified a typology of five approaches to empirically
inform ABMs for land use science: sample surveys, participant observation,
field and laboratory experiments, companion modeling, and GIS and remotely
sensed data. This paper reviews these five approaches to informing ABMs, provides
a corresponding case study describing the model usage of these approaches,
the types of data each approach produces, the types of questions those data can
answer, and an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of those data for use in
an ABM.},

In this article we first comprehensively review both types of agents. Then we argue that both these categories of agents borrow from Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, requiring them to share the characteristics of and be similar to AI agents. We also argue that geospatial agents form a distinct category of AI agents because they are explicit about geography and geographic data models. Our overall goal is to first capture the diversity of, and then define and categorize GIScience agent research into geospatial agents, thereby capturing the diversity of agent-oriented architectures and applications that have been developed in the recent past to present a holistic review of geospatial agents.},

   Pages = {239-263},
   Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a spatially-explicit agent-based simulation framework with a supporting 
software package to explore complex adaptive geographic systems. This framework is particularly suitable for modeling entities 
that are contextually aware, knowledge-driven, and adaptive because it represents them as geographically-aware intelligent 
agents. Fundamental advances in the explicit representation of contextual information, knowledge structures, and learning 
processes are needed for modeling intelligent agents situated within geographic systems. The representation of these agents 
requires the integration of agent-based models, machine learning, and GIS. Existing software packages for agent-based modeling, 
however, often provide insufficient support for this integration. The agent-based simulation package presented here is specifically 
designed to achieve such integration by assisting the development of agent-based models from the simulation framework. Object- 
oriented modeling techniques were used to implement this simulation package, which includes four modules: simulation, 
visualization, learning, and geoprocessing. In particular, the learning and geoprocessing modules facilitate the representation of 
adaptive behavior in agents within spatially-explicit environments. The utility of the agent-based simulation package is illustrated 
using two simulation models: one of adaptive elk behavior and another of pedestrian movement. The successful design of the 
simulation models suggests that the modeling framework with the supporting software package is well-suited to the resolution of 
complex adaptive geographic problems.},

   Journal = {Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design},
   Volume = {34},
   Pages = {200-222},
   Abstract = {In this paper is described a model of residential mobility, built to simulate individual households, their perception of and reaction to varying conditions across different scales of interaction, and their movements to occupy housing in a physical, social, and economic environment. A rich model of residential mobility, in which individual households interact with other households and real-estate infrastructure, dynamically in space and time, to form synthetic communities and artificial property submarkets.

CA and urban modelling

Agent automata differ from CA cells in several respects, but predominantly the difference is one of interpretation; inspiration for agents comes from the study of humans, from artificial intelligence research for the most part. The characteristics and rules used to design agents usually refer to behavior. Agents are commonly specified in a heterogeneous fashion, and are endowed with proactive and goal-oriented behavior, perception, communication skills, the ability to adapt and retain memory of their actions, and functionality to allow them to evolve through space and time.

Residential mobility is treated as a two-stage process. First, households decide whether to initiate a relocation event or not, looking both to internal and to external stressors in formulating this decision. If they decide to engage in a housing search, they do so based on preferences that relate to their internal characteristics and those of the larger community and submarket in which the search is focused.

Relocation decisions of households: 
1)because of the life cycle - children leave parents houses- or
2) because of the change in prefernces: 
                - a hedonic property preference(`Young' households have a preference to rent apartments, `middle' households prefer to buy apartments, and `senior' households prefer to buy houses. The expression of a housing value preference is also specified simply; households will not buy or rent a property that is more expensive than one third of their monthly  income.)
                - a wealth preference (households assess whether a neighborhood is too poor for them to enter or remain in, or whether it is too expensive to consider relocating to)
                - a segregation preference (represent households' likes and dislikes regarding the ethnic profile of residential submarkets.)
