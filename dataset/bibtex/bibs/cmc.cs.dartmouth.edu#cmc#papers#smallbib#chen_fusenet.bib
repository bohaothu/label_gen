    abstract = {In this paper we motivate a Context Fusion Network (CFN), an
infrastructure model that allows context-aware applications to select
distributed data sources and compose them with customized data-fusion
operators into a directed acyclic information fusion graph. Such a graph
represents how an application computes high-level understandings of its
execution context from low-level sensory data. Multiple graphs by different
applications inter-connect with each other to form a global graph. A key
advantage of a CFN is re-usability, both at code-level and instance-level,
facilitated by operator composition. We designed and implemented a
distributed CFN system, Solar, which maps the logical operator graph
representation onto a set of overlay hosts. In particular, Solar meets the
challenges inherent to heterogeneous and volatile ubicomp environments. By
abstracting most complexities into the infrastructure, we believe Solar
facilitates both the development and deployment of context-aware
applications. We present the operator composition model, basic services of
the Solar overlay network, and programming support for the developers. We
also discuss some applications built with Solar and the lessons we learned
from our experience.}
