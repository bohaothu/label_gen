	abstract	= "In the context of mobile and pervasive networking, it
		is not uncommon to experience frequent loss of connectivity.
		Congestion control algorithms usually mistake resulting packets
		losses for congestion events and unnecessarily reduce their
		network usage. We propose an enhancement to the TCP-Friendly
		Rate Control protocol to overcome this issue. Our contribution
		proposes to suspend the data transfer, in a way similar to
		Freeze-TCP, when an upcoming disconnection is predicted.
		Furthermore, a probing mechanism is introduced to enable fast
		adaptation to new network conditions. We present a description
		of the additional freezing and resuming mechanisms.  This
		proposal has been implemented in ns-2.  Simulation results are
		thus compared to the regular behavior.",
