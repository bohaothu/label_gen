                         Getting to Start:
            Selected readings in computer communication

                     Elliott S. Parker, comp.

     Copyright 1992.  Permission to reproduce or post this list
is given as long as the entire file including this preface is
included.
     This is some documentation on networking or computer
communications. There has been no attempt to make it
comprehensive and the main focus is on material of use to the
beginning networker, rather than engineers, network managers, or
researchers.  This is not a formal bibliography.  The selection
is somewhat eccentric and eclectic, but it is the type of
material I wish I had known about when just beginning to use the
networks.  Some of the citations are just fun to read.
     Although directions are given to access the online material
from Bitnet, much can also be accessed via anonymous FTP if you
have access to The Internet.  Also, online material is often
available from various sites, sometimes under various names.  I
have given sites that I have used.  Your own computer center may
already have some or all of the online material.  Check first
with your systems people.  Local access will cut down on network
traffic, especially for longer files.   Information is correct as
of February 1991.
     The newest copy of this list can be obtained by sending
email to COMSERVE@RPIECS.BITNET and putting only the one line,
SEND COMPUNET BIBLIO in the body.  It is also available via
anonymous FTP from the Library Software archives at HYDRA.UWO.CA
in directory LIBSOFT.
     At CMU, this is available as NETSTART INFO in the Bitnet
library disk.
     Also, this is written from the standpoint of North America.
Readers in other parts of the world may have to use a nearer
TRICKLE server for some online material.
     I would appreciate comments, corrections, and/or additions
and will include these in any revised version.  These can be sent
to my Bitnet (3ZLUFUR) address.



"Accessing the SIMTEL20 archives from BITNET."  This the
     essential guide to getting any of the thousands of programs
     and documentation from "Simtel20" for Bitnet users.  Send
     email to LISTSERV@RPIECS and in the body, put GET PDGET
     HELP.

"Archie."  This is a directory of software available on machines
     around the world, most of which require the ability to
     telnet to the particular machine.  For information, telnet
     to quiche.cs.mcgill.ca and login as archie (no caps in
     "archie" and no password required).  For information via
     email, send a message to ARCHIE@CS.MCGILL.CA and in the body
     put just the word HELP.

Darwin Systems is a list of IBM PC environment BBS's updated
     monthly.  It is available on many BBSs around the country.
     On Simtel20, it is found in PD1:<MSDOS.BBSLISTS>USBBSXX.ZIP
     where XX is the number of the current version.
     For example, send email to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 and in the body
     type /PDGET PD1:<MSDOS.BBSLISTS>USBBS93.ZIP.  The server
     will send you the Feb. 1992 listing (Check for the
     latest; how to check for the latest described in Accessing
     the SIMTEL20 Archives From Bitnet).  Besides NDSUVM1,
     LISTSERV@RPIECS will work.
         Note this is a ".ZIP" file.  This means it is compressed
     and must be unzipped on your computer before it is readable
     using the PKUNZIP program.  Check with your local BBS or
     network guru on how to do it.
          A "server" is a machine on the "other end" of your
     computer connection.  It "serves up" particular files you
     ask for if you ask for them in the correct format.  A server
     is strictly mechanical and there is no human to interpret
     what you really mean if it is different from the language
     the server requires.  "Listserv" (without the final "e") is
     a program that automates requests.

Delfino, Erik.  "E-mail connections:  It's still a jungle out
     there. . . but it is getting better," Online (Sept. 1990),
     pp. 31-35.  Tells how to send mail between different email
     systems, such as MCIMail, Internet, Bitnet, et al.

Deward, Robert, Project Director. Electronic citizenship (Pacific

Diffily, Anne.  "Confessions of a network junkie," Brown Alumni
     Monthly (Dec. 1990), pp. 20-27.

[FTPmail]  If your site has only Bitnet access, it may still be
     possible to FTP files from remote sites via mail.  Since the
     last version of this list, BITFTP has closed to non-Bitnet
     traffic, but another mail server is available at DEC's
     Western Research Lab.  The commands are different from
     BITFTP.  To get the help file, send mail to
