  abstract = {The directed assembly of nanoparticles and nanoscale materials onto
	specific locations of a surface is one of the major challenges in
	nanotechnology. Here we present a simple and scalable method and
	model for the assembly of nanoparticles in between electrical leads.
	Gold nanoparticles, 20 nm in diameter, were assembled inside electrical
	gaps ranging from 15 to 150 nm with the use of positive ac dielectrophoresis.
	In this method, an alternating current is used to create a gradient
	of electrical field that attracts particles in between the two leads
	used to create the potential. Assembly is achieved when dielectrophoretic
	forces exceed thermal and electrostatic forces; the use of anchoring
	molecules, present in the gap, improves the final assembly stability.
	We demonstrate with both experiment and theory that nanoparticle
	assembly inside the gap is controlled by the applied voltage and
	the gap size. Experimental evidence and modeling suggest that a gap-size-dependent
	threshold voltage must be overcome before particle assembly is realized.
	Assembly results as a function of frequency and time are also presented.
	Assembly of fewer than 10 isolated particles in a gap is demonstrated.
	Preliminary electrical characterization reveals that stable conductance
	of the assembled particles can be achieved.},

	the particle structures depends on the ratio of electrostatic particle-particle
	interactions and Brownian forces. When this ratio is of the order
	of 100 or greater, particles form stable chains and columns, whereas
	when it is of the order of 10 or smaller the particle distribution

	this paper, the relative magnitude of Brownian forces is in the range
	such that it does not influence the eventual collection of particles
	by dielectrophoresis and the particular locations where the particles
	are collected. However, Brownian motion is observed to influence
	the transient particle trajectories. The deviation of the particle
