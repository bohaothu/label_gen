  abstract =	 {When fitting models to data containing multiple
                  structures, such as when fitting surface patches to
                  data taken from a neighborhood that includes a range
                  discontinuity, robust estimators must tolerate both
                  gross outliers and pseudo outliers. Pseudo outliers
                  are outliers to the structure of interest, but
                  inliers to a different structure. They differ from
                  gross outliers because of their coherence. Such data
                  occurs frequently in computer vision problems,
                  including motion estimation, model fitting, and
                  range data analysis. The focus in this paper is the
                  problem of fitting surfaces near discontinuities in
                  range data. To characterize the performance of least
                  median of the squares, least trimmed squares,
                  M-estimators, Hough transforms, RANSAC, and MINPRAN
                  on this type of data, the pseudo outlier bias
                  metric is developed using techniques from the robust
                  statistics literature, and it is used to study the
                  error in robust fits caused by distributions
                  modeling various types of discontinuities. The
                  results show each robust estimator to be biased at
                  small, but substantial, discontinuities. They also
                  show the circumstances under which different
                  estimators are most effective. Most importantly, the
                  results imply present estimators should be used with
                  care, and new estimators should be developed},
