  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing interest in the application of natural language
	processing methods to biomedical text has led to an increasing number
	of corpora and methods targeting protein-protein interaction (PPI)
	extraction. However, there is no general consensus regarding PPI
	annotation and consequently resources are largely incompatible and
	methods are difficult to evaluate. RESULTS: We present the first
	comparative evaluation of the diverse PPI corpora, performing quantitative
	evaluation using two separate information extraction methods as well
	as detailed statistical and qualitative analyses of their properties.
	For the evaluation, we unify the corpus PPI annotations to a shared
	level of information, consisting of undirected, untyped binary interactions
	of non-static types with no identification of the words specifying
	the interaction, no negations, and no interaction certainty.We find
	that the F-score performance of a state-of-the-art PPI extraction
	method varies on average 19 percentage units and in some cases over
	30 percentage units between the different evaluated corpora. The
	differences stemming from the choice of corpus can thus be substantially
	larger than differences between the performance of PPI extraction
	methods, which suggests definite limits on the ability to compare
	methods evaluated on different resources. We analyse a number of
	potential sources for these differences and identify factors explaining
	approximately half of the variance. We further suggest ways in which
	the difficulty of the PPI extraction tasks codified by different
	corpora can be determined to advance comparability. Our analysis
	also identifies points of agreement and disagreement in PPI corpus
	annotation that are rarely explicitly stated by the authors of the
	corpora. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative analysis uncovers key similarities
	and differences between the diverse PPI corpora, thus taking an important
	step towards standardization. In the course of this study we have
	created a major practical contribution in converting the corpora
	into a shared format. The conversion software is freely available

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The rapid growth of the amount of publicly available reports on biomedical experimental results has recently caused a boost of text mining approaches for protein interaction extraction. Most approaches rely implicitly or explicitly on linguistic, i.e., lexical and syntactic, data extracted from text. However, only few attempts have been made to evaluate the contribution of the different feature types. In this work, we contribute to this evaluation by studying the relative importance of deep syntactic features, i.e., grammatical relations, shallow syntactic features (part-of-speech information) and lexical features. For this purpose, we use a recently proposed approach that uses support vector machines with structured kernels.RESULTS:Our results reveal that the contribution of the different feature types varies for the different data sets on which the experiments were conducted.  The smaller the training corpus compared to the test data, the more important the role of grammatical relations becomes. Moreover, deep syntactic information based classifiers prove to be more robust on heterogeneous texts where no or only limited common vocabulary is shared.CONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that grammatical relations play an important role in the interaction extraction task. Moreover, the net advantage of adding lexical and shallow syntactic features is small related to the number of added features. This implies that efficient classifiers can be built by using only a small fraction of the features that are typically being used in recent approaches.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Automatic knowledge discovery and efficient information
	access such as named entity recognition and relation extraction between
	entities have recently become critical issues in the biomedical literature.
	However, the inherent difficulty of the relation extraction task,
	mainly caused by the diversity of natural language, is further compounded
	in the biomedical domain because biomedical sentences are commonly
	long and complex. In addition, relation extraction often involves
	modeling long range dependencies, discontiguous word patterns and
	semantic relations for which the pattern-based methodology is not
	directly applicable. RESULTS: In this article, we shift the focus
	of biomedical relation extraction from the problem of pattern extraction
	to the problem of kernel construction. We suggest four kernels: predicate,
	walk, dependency and hybrid kernels to adequately encapsulate information
	required for a relation prediction based on the sentential structures
	involved in two entities. For this purpose, we view the dependency
	structure of a sentence as a graph, which allows the system to deal
	with an essential one from the complex syntactic structure by finding
	the shortest path between entities. The kernels we suggest are augmented
	gradually from the flat features descriptions to the structural descriptions
	of the shortest paths. As a result, we obtain a very promising result,
	a 77.5 F-score with the walk kernel on the Language Learning in Logic
	(LLL) 05 genic interaction shared task. AVAILABILITY: The used algorithms
	are free for use for academic research and are available from our
