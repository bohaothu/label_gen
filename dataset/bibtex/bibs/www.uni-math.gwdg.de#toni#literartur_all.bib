 abstract = {Abstract.  "Historically, information retrieval (IR) has followed two prin-
cipally diﬀerent paths that we call syntactic IR and semantic IR. In syn-
tactic IR, terms are represented as arbitrary sequences of characters and
IR is performed through the computation of string similarity. In seman-
tic IR, instead, terms are represented as concepts and IR is performed
through the computation of semantic relatedness between concepts. Se-
mantic IR, in general, demonstrates lower recall and higher precision
than syntactic IR. However, so far the latter has deﬁnitely been the win-
ner in practical applications. In this paper we present a novel approach
which allows it to extend syntactic IR with semantics, thus leverage the
advantages of both syntactic and semantic IR. First experimental re-
sults, reported in the paper, show that the combined approach performs
at least as good as syntactic IR, often improving results where semantics
can be exploited."

"The construction of standard datasets and benchmarks to evaluate 
ontology-based  search  approaches  and  to  compare  then  against 
baseline IR models is a major open problem in the semantic tech-
nologies community. In this paper we propose a novel evaluation 
benchmark for ontology-based IR models based on an adaptation 
of  the  well-known  Cranfield  paradigm  (Cleverdon,  1967)  tradi-
tionally  used  by  the  IR  community.  The  proposed  benchmark 
comprises: 1) a text document collection, 2) a set of queries and 
their corresponding document relevance judgments and 3) a set of 
ontologies  and  Knowledge  Bases  covering  the  query  topics.  The 
document  collection  and  the  set  of  queries  and  judgments  are 
taken from one  of the  most  widely used datasets in  the  IR com-
munity, the TREC Web track. As a use case example we apply the 
proposed  benchmark  to  compare  a  real  ontology-based  search 
model  (Fernandez,  et  al.,  2008) },

"In recent years, an increasing number of scientific and other domains have attempted to standardize their terminology and provide reasoning capabilities through ontologies, in order to facilitate data exchange. This has spurred research into Web-based languages, formalisms, and especially query systems based on ontologies.
Yet we argue that DBMS techniques can be extended to provide many of the same capabilities, with benefits in scalability and performance. We present OWLDB, a lightweight and extensible approach for the integration of relational databases and description logic based ontologies. One of the key differences between relational databases and ontologies is the high degree of implicit information contained in ontologies. OWLDB integrates the two schemes by codifying ontologies' implicit information using a set of sound and complete inference rules for SHOIN (the description logic behind OWL ontologies.

 abstract = {Abstract. Ontologies can be used for e-business integration, for exam-
ple by describing existing e-business standards as ontologies. If cooperat-
ing parties use diﬀerent ontologies, ontology mappings are needed, which
can be ambiguous, thus making ontology mapping disambiguation neces-
sary. Diﬀerent disambiguation strategies exist, such as community-driven
or context-sensitive referencing of ontologies, where the latter is what we
developed in our project. In this paper, we show that community-driven
referencing can be realized using a context-sensitive referencing service
in a way that the user administration is transparent to the referencing
system.},

the four search engines, these must be fuzzy (using a membership function or 
similarity grade). We focus on how the fuzzy results can be obtained from each 
technique,  and  how  they  can  then  be  combined.  This  combination  must  take 
into account the query, the similarity of the patent to each part of the query, and 
the confidence on the technique},

Increased availability of mobile computing, such as personal dig-
ital assistants (PDAs), creates the potential for constant and intelli-
gent access to up-to-date,  integrated and detailed information from
the Web, regardless of one’s actual geographical position.  Intelligent
question-answering requires the representation of knowledge from vari-
ous domains, such as the navigational and discourse context of the user,
potential user questions, the information provided by Web services and
so on, for example in the form of ontologies. Within the context of the
SmartWeb project, we have developed a number of domain-speciﬁc on-
tologies that are relevant for mobile and intelligent user interfaces to
open-domain question-answering and information services on the Web.
To integrate the various domain-speciﬁc ontologies, we have developed
a foundational ontology, the SmartSUMO ontology, on the basis of
the  DOLCE  and SUMO  ontologies.   This allows us  to  combine all},

 abstract = {Abstract. Both OWL-DL and function-free Horn rules3 are decidable
logics with interesting, yet orthogonal expressive power: from the rules
perspective, OWL-DL is restricted to tree-like rules, but provides both
existentially  and  universally  quantiﬁed  variables  and  full,  monotonic
negation. From the description logic perspective, rules are restricted to
universal quantiﬁcation, but allow for the interaction of variables in arbi-
trary ways. Clearly, a combination of OWL-DL and rules is desirable for
building Semantic Web ontologies, and several such combinations have
already been discussed. However, such a combination might easily lead to
the undecidability of interesting reasoning problems. Here, we present a
decidable such combination which is, to the best of our knowledge, more
general than similar decidable combinations proposed so far. Decidabil-
ity is obtained by restricting rules to so-called DL-safe ones, requiring
each variable in a rule to occur in a non-D},
