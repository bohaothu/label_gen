  abstract = {The VEIA project has set as its goal the formulation of a methodology for the distributed development and integration of automotive systems that is oriented toward the concrete demands of industrial development processes and has practical applications. This is to be achieved on the basis of the concept of product-line engineering.

  In the first six-month project phase, the general structure of a reference process will be established whose primary function is to concretize the requirements of the four subprojects and to coordinate the project partners' activities.

  The results of the project are foreseen as comprising methods, notations, and tools to be used to implement the activities of the reference process and produce the artifacts. Outside the framework of the project, the matching of the reference process and the requirements of the application domain is also a validation and evaluation of the project results.

  In order to achieve the project goals, a realistic and pragmatic approach in relation to the processes to be supported is necessary. Therefore, it is of particular importance to forge a link between the software and systems development processes known from the domain of research and product establishment processes for electrical/electronic (E/E) systems that exist in the application domain.

  The present document outlines the rough draft of the VEIA reference process, the following aspects of which are to be scrutinized:
  the artifacts in the automotive E/E engineering process and their causal relationships, models to describe the artifacts, and the process phases based upon them with a focus on the general methodological and organizational framing conditions.},
