	Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for
	hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward
	5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above
	5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering,

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information.
	A 2D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treemap
	has already been proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et al. in 1992. In
	general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure.
	Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box, whose
	size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the
	node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice,
	some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap, ordered
	treemap and strip treemap. Furthermore, quantum treemap is a quantization
	version of these extensions. In this paper, the authors propose a
	new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube
	that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap. Especially, this
	paper shows its usefulness for browsing 3D multimedia data, i.e.,
	2D images, 3D shape models, motion data, etc., originally stored

	The explorative framework of our proposed interface consists of the
	navigation structure, a selection of hierarchical visualization techniques,
	and a set of interaction features. The navigation interface allows
	users to pursue arbitrary disaggregation paths within single data
	cubes and, more importantly, across multiple cubes. In the course

	chosen path and the options valid in the current context. Special

	mixed granularity) within hierarchical dimensions in a way transparent

	We propose a visual structure called Enhanced Decomposition Tree to

	step, whereas the nodes display the specified subset of measures,

	This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully

	All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional

	to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams,

	bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation.
	Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines,

	transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and

	reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective
	visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into
	relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of

	partially supported by current visualization techniques, which are
	mainly designed for browsing. We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system
	designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several
	hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of "guaranteed visibility",
	where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain
	visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for
	detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new
	nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node
	from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear
	Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the
	dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark
	visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result
	in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales
	both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display.
	We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of
	a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural
	details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is
	also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison
	is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization

	of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses
	a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout
	for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space.
	Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively
	positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization
	of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well
	as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure
	of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of
	EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses
	a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large
	hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context
	viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which
	is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically,
	it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers
	of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both
	context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These
	layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical

	a node-link diagram to present the entire hierarchical structure.
	To be able to handle the navigation of large hierarchies, we use
	a new hybrid viewing technique that combines two viewing methods,
	the modified semantic zooming and a focus+context technique. While
	the semantic zooming technique can enlarge a particular viewing area

  number = {1},
  abstract = {One of the main tasks in information visualisation research is creating
	visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex
	information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising
	such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has
	been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising
	large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties
	is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another
	is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest
	while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation
	technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains
	some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile
	or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed
	in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of
	all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently
	accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore
	it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC
	environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer
	file system structures and decision trees from data mining results.
	The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications
	are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable

	the first stage: given a list of nodes, an indication of the hierarchical
	relationship among them, and their shape and size, where should each
	node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect?
	
	This algorithm determines the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary
	general tree. It is the most desirable positioning with respect to
	certain widely-accepted heuristics. The positioning, specified in
	x, y co-ordinates, minimizes the width of the tree. In a general
	tree, there is no limit on the number of offspring per node; this
	contrasts with binary and ternary trees, for example, which are trees
	with a limit of two and three offspring per node. This algorithm
	operates in time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
	
	Previously, most tree drawings have been positioned by the sure hand
	of a human graphic designer. Many computer-generated positionings
	have been either trivial or contained irregularities. Earlier work
	by Wetherell and Shannon1 and Tilford,2 upon which this algorithm
	builds, failed to position the interior nodes of some trees correctly.
	The algorithm presented here correctly positions a tree's node using
	only two passes. It also handles several practical considerations:
	alternative orientations of the tree, variable node sizes and out-of-bounds
	conditions. Radack, also building on Tilford's work, has solved this
	same problem with a different algorithm which makes four passes.},
