Bibliography of Fox Project publications in BibTeX format

This is a bibliography of Fox Project publications.  Related work not
sponsored by the Fox Project is excluded.  An HTML formatted version
of this bibliography should be available under
<URL:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fox/publications.html>.

This, like any bibliography, is incomplete.  Any corrections, updates,
comments, suggestion, new entries, new URL's for papers, etc. are very
much appreciated.

I follow many of the conventions described in Frank Pfenning's Logical
Frameworks bibliography.  I use his tools for extracting entries by
keyword and to handle conversion to HTML.  I use Nelson H. F. Beebe's
bibclean tool for pretty-printing.

Keywords:
	til	  --- related to typed intermediate and assembly languages
	pcc	  --- related to proof-carrying code
	lf	  --- related to logical frameworks
	staged	  --- related to staged computation
	languages --- related to language design
	foxnet	  --- related to the FoxNet
	misc	  --- everything else
