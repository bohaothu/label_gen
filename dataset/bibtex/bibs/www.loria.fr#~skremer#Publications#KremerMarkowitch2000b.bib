  abstract =      {We present a multi-party non-repudiation protocol,
                   based on a group encryption scheme. We define
                   multi-party non-repudiation, compare it to
                   multi-party fair exchange and show some fundamental
                   differences between these two problems. This is the
                   first effort to generalize non-repudiation to the
                   multi-party case. Our definitions and the resulting
                   protocol are more general than the ones given in the
                   only comparable work, a multi-party certified mail
                   protocol. Finally we also give an example of a group
                   encryption scheme that can be used with our
                   protocol.},
