   ABSTRACT = {Timesheets.js is a JavaScript library for publishing
    multimedia web documents that take advantage of the new features
    of HTML5 and CSS3. The library allows web developers to extend
    their skills to synchronized multimedia contents.
    This technology has been experimented in a class where students
    had to implement an XSLT transformation for converting OpenOffice
    Impress presentations into web formats. The resulting slideshows
    run in web browsers thanks to the timesheets.js library.}

   ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we explore different ways to publish
    multimedia documents on the web. We propose a solution that
    takes advantage of the new multimedia features of web standards,
    namely HTML5 and CSS3. To avoid the usual development of
    complex scripts for handling timing, synchronization and user
    interaction, we propose to complement HTML5 and CSS3 with
    SMIL Timesheets. This is made possible by a Timesheets
    scheduler that runs in the browser. Various applications
    based on this solution illustrate the paper, ranging from
    media annotations to web documentaries.}

   ABSTRACT = {We consider a type algebra equipped with recursive, product,
    function, intersection, union, and complement types together with type
    variables and universal quantification over them. We define the
    subtyping relation between such type expressions, and prove its
    decidability. This solves an open problem that has recently attracted a
    considerable research effort. The novelty, originality and
    strength of our solution reside in introducing a logical modeling
    for the semantic subtyping framework. We model semantic subtyping
    in a tree logic and use a satisfiability-testing algorithm in order to
    decide subtyping. We show how the subtyping relation can be decided
    in EXPTIME. We report on practical experiments made with
    a full implementation of the system. This provides a powerful
    polymorphic type system aiming at maintaining full static type-safety of
    functional programs that manipulate trees, even with higher-order
    functions, which is particularly useful in the context of XML.}

    This language has been studied from different perspectives such
    as optimization and extension. One of its extensions, PSPARQL
    (Path SPARQL) provides queries with paths of arbitrary length.
    We study the static analysis of queries written in this language,
    in particular, containment of queries: determining whether,
    for any graph, the answers to a query are contained in those of
    another query. Our approach consists in encoding RDF graphs as
    transition systems and queries as \mu-calculus formulas and then
    reducing the containment problem to testing satisfiability in
    the logic.}

   ABSTRACT = {A major challenge of query language design is the
    combination of expressivity with effective static analyses such as
    query containment. In the setting of XML, documents are seen as
    finite trees, whose structure may additionally be constrained by
    type constraints such as those described by an XML schema.
    We consider the problem of query containment in the presence of
    type constraints for a class of regular path queries extended with
    counting and interleaving operators. The counting operator restricts
    the number of occurrences of children nodes satisfying a given logical
    property. The interleaving operator provides a succinct notation for
    describing the absence of order between nodes satisfying a logical
    property. We provide a logic-based framework supporting these
    operators, which can be used to solve common query reasoning
    problems such as satisfiability and containment of queries in
    exponential time.}

   ABSTRACT = {A challenge for the C2M project is to develop a document
    workflow for authoring and producing web multimedia documents with
    a special attention for the aesthetic quality of the final rendering.
    In this paper we discuss the requirements for advanced multimedia
    authoring services from a document engineering point of view.
    Our approach consists in providing a post-editing service to allow
    authors to adjust their multimedia presentation directly on the final
    form of the document. The first step of the proposal is to provide a
    web rendering en- gine based on the latest advances in web standards.
    For that purpose, we have developed timesheets.js, a JavaScript library
    for publishing multimedia web documents. It takes advan- tage of the new
    features of the HTML5 and CSS3 web standards and enables synchronization
    of multimedia contents. The second step consists in designing web-aware
    authoring tools based on this library, thus providing authors with direct
    editing services for producing high quality multimedia documents.}

   ABSTRACT = {We consider the problem of XML Schema evolution.
    In the ever-changing context of the web, XML schemas continuously
    change in order to cope with the natural evolution of entities
    they describe. Schema changes have important consequences.
    First, existing documents valid with respect to the original schema
    are no longer guaranteed to fulfill the constraints described by
    the evolved schema. Second, the evolution also impacts programs
    manipulating documents whose structure is described by the original
    schema.
    We propose a unifying framework for determining the effects of
    XML Schema evolution both on the validity of documents and on queries.
    The system is very powerful in analyzing various scenarios in which
    forward/backward compatibility of schemas is broken, and in which
    the result of a query may not be anymore what was expected.
    Specifically, the system offers a predicate language which allows
    one to formulate properties related to schema evolution. The system
    then relies on exact reasoning techniques to perform a fine-grained
    analysis. This yields either a formal proof of the property or a
    counter-example that can be used for debugging purposes.
    The system has been fully implemented and tested with real-world use
    cases, in particular with the main standard document formats used on
    the web, as defined by W3C. The system identifies precisely
    compatibility relations between document formats. In case these relations
    do not hold, the system can identify queries that must be reformulated
    in order to produce the expected results across successive schema
    versions.}

   URL = {http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00569058/},
   ABSTRACT = {Arithmetical constraints are widely used in formal languages
    like regular expressions, tree grammars and paths. In XML they are used
    to impose bounds on the number of occurrences described by content models
    of schema languages (XML Schema, RelaxNG). In query languages (XPath,
    XQuery), they allow selecting nodes that have a bounded number of nodes
    reachable by a given path expression. Counting types and paths are thus
    natural extensions of their countless counterparts already regarded as
    the core constructs in XML languages and type systems. One of the biggest
    challenges in XML is to develop automated techniques for ensuring static-type
    safety and optimization techniques. To this end, there is a need to solve
    some basic reasoning tasks that involve constructions such as counting XML
    schemas and XPath expressions. Every compiler of XML programs will have to
    routinely solve problems such as type and path type- checking, for ensuring
    at compile time that invalid documents can never arise as the output of XML
    processing code. This thesis studies efficient reasoning frameworks able to
    express counting constraints on tree structures. It was recently shown that
    the \mu-calculus, when extended with counting constraints on immediate
    successor nodes is undecid able over graphs. Here we show that, when
    interpreted over finite trees, the logic with counting constraints is decidable
    in single exponential time. Furthermore, this logic allows more general
    counting operators. For example, the logic can pose numerical constraints on
    number of ancestors or descendants. We also present linear translations of
    counting XPath expressions and XML schemas into the logic.}

   ABSTRACT = {A sound object can be defined as a time structure of audio
    chunks whose duration is on the time scale of 100 ms to several seconds.
    Sound objects have heterogeneous and time-varying properties. They are
    the basic elements of any format for Interactive Audio (IA). We have
    designed an XML language, A2ML, for Interactive Audio which offers,
    concerning the sequencing of sounds, a level of capabilities similar
    to that of iXMF, the interactive audio file format defined by the
    Interactive Audio Special Interest Group (IASIG). A2ML uses SMIL
    timing attributes to control the synchronization of sound objects and
    supports 3D sound rendering, DSP and positional parameters's animation,
    by embedding the SMIL animation module. Like in a traditional mixing
    console, mix groups can be used to regroup multiple sound objects and
    apply mix parameters to all of them at the same time. An API allows
    external control and dynamic instantiation of sound objects.
    As with graphics, a declarative language for interactive audio is much
    more powerful than a node-graph based approach implemented using an
    imperative language. The structured declarative model offers easier
    reuse, transformability, accessibility, interoperability and authoring.
    An XML declarative language for audio like A2ML could help to reach the
    goal of the IXMF workgroup, i.e. build a system by which composers and
    sound designers create an interactive soundtrack and audition it by
    simulating target application control input while working in the
    authoring environment.
    In this paper, we will show how an XML language for interactive audio
    can be used with SVG. After an introduction to the history of sound
    objects, we will use the example of a computational character with a
    simple orient behaviour to demonstrate the complementarity of SVG and
    A2ML. The best way to use these two languages is to synchronize them
    with a third one, a tag-value dispatching language. We will then
    present a complex application for which the use of both SVG and A2ML
    is natural, i.e. a navigation system for visually impaired people based
    on OpenStreetMap.}

   ABSTRACT = {Multimedia documents have to be played on multiple device types.
    Hence, usage and platform diversity requires document adaptation according to
    execution contexts, not generally predictable at design time. 
    In an earlier work, a semantic framework for multimedia document adaptation was
    proposed. In this framework, a multimedia document is interpreted as a set of
    potential executions corresponding to the author specification. 
    To each target device corresponds a set of possible executions complying with
    the device constraints. In this context, adapting requires to select an execution
    that satisfies the target device constraints and which is as close as possible
    from the initial composition. 
    This theoretical adaptation framework does not specifically consider the main
    multimedia document dimensions, i.e., temporal, spatial and hypermedia.  
    In this paper, we propose a concrete application of this framework on standard
    multimedia documents. For that purpose, we first define an abstract structure
    that captures the spatio-temporal and hypermedia dimensions of multimedia documents,
    and we develop an adaptation algorithm which transforms in a minimal way such a
    structure according to device constraints. 
    Then, we show how this can be used for adapting concrete multimedia documents
    in SMIL through converting the documents in the abstract structure, using the
    adaptation algorithm, and converting it back in SMIL. This can be used for other
    document formats without modifying the adaptation algorithm.}

    extended with virtual, geolocalized sound objects. We show that the
    authoring of an ARA scene can be done through an iterative process
    composed of two stages: in the first one the author has to move in
    the rendering zone to apprehend the audio spatialization and the
    chronology of the audio events and in the second one a textual
    editing of the sequencing of the sound sources and DSP acoustics
    parameters is done. This authoring process is based on the join use of
    two XML languages, OpenStreetMap for maps and A2ML for Interactive
    3D Audio. A2ML being a format for a cue-oriented interactive audio system,
    requests for interactive audio services are done through TCDL, a Tag-based
    Cue Dispatching language. This separation of modeling and audio rendering
    is similar to what is done for the web of documents with HTML and
    CSS style sheets.}

   ABSTRACT = {We present a tool for helping XML schema designers to obtain
    a high quality level for their specifications. The tool allows one to
    analyze relations between classes of XML documents and formally prove them.
    For instance, the tool can be used to check forward and backward
    compatibilities of recommendations. When such a relation does not hold,
    the tool allows one to identify the reasons and reports detailed
    counter-examples that exemplify the problem. For this purpose, the tool
    relies on recent advances in logic-based automated theorem proving
    techniques that allow for efficient reasoning on very large sets of XML
    documents. We believe this tool can be of great value for standardization
    bodies that define specifications using various XML type definition languages
    (such as W3C specifications), and are concerned with quality assurance for
    their normative recommendations.}

   ABSTRACT = {Regular tree grammars and regular path expressions constitute core
    constructs widely used in programming languages and type systems. Nevertheless,
    there has been little research so far on frameworks for reasoning about path
    expressions where node cardinality constraints occur along a path in a tree.
    We present a logic capable of expressing deep counting along paths which may
    include arbitrary recursive forward and backward navigation. The counting
    extensions can be seen as a generalization of graded modalities that count
    immediate successor nodes. While the combination of graded modalities,
    nominals, and inverse modalities yields undecidable logics over graphs,
    we show that these features can be combined in a decidable tree logic whose
    main features can be decided in exponential time. Our logic being closed
    under negation, it may be used to decide typical problems on XPath queries
    such as satisfiability, type checking with relation to regular types,
    containment, or equivalence.}

   ABSTRACT = {The diversity of presentation contexts for multimedia
    documents requires the adaptation of document specifications.
    In an earlier work, we have proposed a semantic adaptation
    framework for multimedia documents. This framework captures the
    semantics of the document composition and transforms the relations
    between multimedia objects according to adaptation constraints.
    In this paper, we show that relying on document composition alone
    for adaptation restricts the set of relevant candidate solutions
    and may even divert the adaptation from the authors intent. Hence,
    we propose to introduce functional annotations to guide the
    adaptation process. Theses annotations allow to refine the role of
    multimedia objects in the document. We show that SMIL documents
    could embed functional annotations encoded in RDF. These multimedia
    documents are then adapted thanks to an interactive adaptation tool.}

   ABSTRACT = {During the life cycle of an XML application, both schemas 
     and queries may change from one version to another. Schema evolutions
     may affect query results and potentially the validity of produced data.
     Nowadays, a challenge is to assess and accommodate the impact of these
     changes in evolving XML applications. Such questions arise naturally
     in XML static analyzers. These analyzers often rely on decision
     procedures such as inclusion between XML schemas, query containment
     and satisfiability. However, existing decision procedures cannot be
     used directly in this context. The reason is that they are unable to
     distinguish information related to the evolution from information
     corresponding to bugs. This paper proposes a predicate language within
     a logical framework that can be used to make this distinction. 
     We present a system for monitoring the effect of schema evolutions on
     the set of admissible documents and on the results of queries. The
     system is very powerful in analyzing various scenarios where the result
     of a query may not be anymore what was expected. Specifically, the
     system is based on a set of predicates which allow a fine-grained
     analysis for a wide range of forward and backward compatibility issues.
     Moreover, the system can produce counterexamples and witness documents
     which are useful for debugging purposes. The current implementation
     has been tested with realistic use cases, where it allows identifying
     queries that must be reformulated in order to produce the expected
     results across successive schema versions.}

   ABSTRACT = {This article proposes using search engine results
    data such as the number of results containing relevant terms,

    complex discipline which is at the intersection of the knowledge
    of several specialized fields like robotics, computer 
    science, psychology, and mathematics. It can also appear 
    as a new and emergent discipline due to the fact that many 
    promising haptic interfaces, which allow innovative multi- 
    modal applications in many fields, have become mature 
    only recently. The study presented in this article uses data 
    collected at different periods of time (in December 1999, 
    January 2004, January 2005, November 2006 and April 
    2007) on Web search engines from requests on three different 
    terminologies: haptique, haptik and haptics, taken respectively
    from French, German, and English languages. The 
    evolution of Haptics is seemingly reflected by to the online 
    frequency of these specific terms over time. This evolution 
    has been measured by considering the Internet community through
    search engines such as Google or Yahoo!.}

    a logic with converse for finite ordered trees whose time complexity
    is a simple exponential of the size of a formula. The logic corresponds
    to the alternation free modal \mu-calculus without greatest fixpoint,
    restricted to finite trees, and where formulas are cycle-free.
    Our proof method is based on two auxiliary results. First, XML regular
    tree types and XPath expressions have a linear translation to cycle-free
    formulas. Second, the least and greatest fixpoints are equivalent for
    finite trees, hence the logic is closed under negation. Building on
    these results, we describe a practical, effective system for solving
    the satisfiability of a formula. The system has been experimented with
    some decision problems such as XPath emptiness, containment, overlap,
    and coverage, with or without type constraints. The benefit of the
    approach is that our system can be effectively used in static analyzers
    for programming languages manipulating both XPath expressions and XML
    type annotations (as input and output types).}

    qualitative. Cette structure capture la sémantique des documents car elle
    est capable de couvrir chacune de ses exécutions potentielles. Dans ce    contexte, adapter va consister à calculer un ensemble d'exécutions le plus
    proche possible de ces exécutions potentielles qui satisfont les contraintes
    d'adaptation imposées par une plate-forme cible. À cet effet, les relations
    de la structure abstraite sont modifiées de sorte de satisfaire ces contraintes
    d'adaptation. Nous montrons, pour chaque dimension du document, comment réaliser
    ceci de manière réaliste.
    Afin de montrer l'applicabilité d'une telle approche, nous la développons dans
    un cadre adapté au standard SMIL pour lequel nous déclinons les adaptations
    spatiales, temporelles, spatio-temporelles et hypermédia. Nous sommes amenés à
    développer des techniques spécifiques pour les représentations spatiales et
    temporelles efficaces. Nous explorons aussi des approches impliquant la suppression
    d'objets.}

    queries can be translated into equivalent formulas in monadic second-order
    logic. Using this translation, we construct an optimized logical
    formulation of the containment problem, which is decided using tree
    automata. When the containment relation does not hold between two XPath
    expressions, a counter-example XML tree is generated. We provide practical
    experiments that illustrate the efficiency of the decision procedure for

    The game market for mobiles is clearly regarded as a market with a
    future, as the multiple investments carried out by the large world
    editors on this segment testify. The mobiles are true platforms of
    large and general public games: mobile games can be downloaded via
    the mobile operator's radio network, WLAN, bluetooth or USB connection.
    Mobiles phones give game developers a unique set of tools and behaviours
    and with a little creativity, game developers can make some really
    great games for this platform. The challenges posed by portable devices
    are numerous, but the biggest complaint of many in the industry is the
    lack of standards. It is necessary to adapt each game to the various
    models of existing terminals, which do not offer the same features
    (memory, processing power, keys...). Consequently, the number of
    different versions of a game rises to several hundreds. As we will see,
    Java Micro Edition (J2ME) attempts with some success to solve these
    problems.}

   ABSTRACT = {Due to obvious portability constraints, mobile technology
    excludes large electronic displays for visual immersion.
    On the contrary, sound heard over headphones is
    ideally suited for mobile applications. The use of stereo
    headphones or stereo speakers on mobile devices enables
    to take advantage of binaural technology which can provide
    an immersive sound experience for a variety of applications
    ranging from stereo widening of music (creating
    an out of the head listening experience) to full 3-D positional
    audio. Advances in audio are going to help bring in
    richer multimedia, increase quality of mobile music and
    help create more interactive and immersive audio applications.
    Interaction with sound in 3D audio space is no
    more limited to indoor environment [8]. In this paper,
    we report on an architecture for multimedia applications
    on mobile devices separating content creation (audio and
    graphics) from content manipulation. We have developed
    a markup format for interactive and spatialized audio on
    mobiles which can be used an interface between the sound
    designer and the application programmer. After presenting
    an overview of the key concepts in designing a format
    for interactive and spatialized audio and the methodology
    used to build the corresponding sound API , we describe
    its use in a mobile immersive music application for
    Copenhagen Channels where interactivity with the music
    is done through GPS waypoints.}

     we extend the proposed adaptation with this capability.
     Thanks to this extension, we present a method for summarizing

     as presentation contiguity. To validate our framework, we adapt

   ABSTRACT = {Web documents avalaible through the Internet are frequently
     supplied simply as poorly-written HTML or as plain text. Indeed, almost
     all of these Web documents are understandable only by humans, staying
     unexploitable by softwares and computers. The power of Semantic Web
     tools and XML technologies can only be deployed on documents having a
     minimum of formalism in their structure. This paper relates to the
     structuration process for Web documents that do not have a real structure
     through markup languages such as XML or definition of grammars for
     validing them. It deals with building of structure in documents when
     existing structure is insuficient or inexistant. This subject is
     closely related to the problems of automatic creation of XML schemas
     or templates. This work lies concretely within the scope of XML documents
     and their problems, related to the fact that their structure building and
     set up is time consuming for the user. Being based on techniques of data
     mining, information of structures is captured, clarifying and returning
     the names and the characteristics of structure elements, in particular
     their relationships, their constraints and their logical organization.
     This paper proposes a process which makes it possible to calculate
     automatically elements of structures (1) by applying methods of data
     mining on documents, (2) by building components of structure automatically,
     (3) by automatically proposing XML transformations on the final structured
     document. Initially, this work will use all the range of schemas going
     from XML schemas to templates.}

   ABSTRACT = {This thesis describes the theoretical and practical foundations
    of a system for the static analysis of XML processing languages. The
    system relies on a fixpoint temporal logic with converse, derived from
    the \mu-calculus, where models are finite trees. This calculus is
    expressive enough to capture regular tree types along with
    multi-directional navigation in trees, while having a single exponential
    time complexity. Specifically the decidability of the logic is proved
    in time $2^{O(n)}$ where $n$ is the size of the input formula. Major XML
    concepts are linearly translated into the logic: XPath navigation
    and node selection semantics, and regular tree languages (which include
    DTDs and XML Schemas). Based on these embeddings, several problems of
    major importance in XML applications are reduced to satisfiability of the
    logic. These problems include XPath containment, emptiness, equivalence,
    overlap, coverage, in the presence or absence of regular tree type
    constraints, and the static type-checking of an annotated query.
    The focus is then given to a sound and complete algorithm for deciding the
    logic, along with a detailed complexity analysis, and crucial
    implementation techniques for building an effective solver. Practical
    experiments using a full implementation of the system are presented.
    The system appears to be efficient in practice for several realistic
    scenarios. The main application of this work is a new class of static
    analyzers for programming languages using both XPath expressions and XML
    type annotations (input and output). Such analyzers allow to ensure at
    compile-time valuable properties such as type-safety and optimizations,
    for safer and more efficient XML processing.}

    returning a set of matching nodes. We present a sound and complete decision
    procedure for containment of XPath queries as well as other related XPath
    decision problems such as satisfiability, equivalence, overlap and
    coverage. The considered XPath fragment covers most of the language
    features used in practice. Specifically, we propose a unifying logic for
    XML, namely the alternation-free modal \mu-calculus with converse. We
    show how to translate major XML concepts such as XPath and regular XML
    types (including DTDs) into this logic. Based on these embeddings, we
    show how XPath decision problems, in the presence or the absence of XML
    types, can be solved using a decision procedure for \mu-calculus
    satisfiability. We provide a complexity analysis together with practical
    experiments of our system that illustrate the efficiency of the approach
    for realistic scenarios.}

    provide template-based authoring tools while keeping rich composition
    capabilities and smooth adaptability. It is based on a component-oriented
    approach integrating homogeneously logical, time and spatial structures.
    Templates are defined as constraints on these structures.}

   ABSTRACT = {XPath is the standard declarative language for navigating XML
    data and returning a set of matching nodes. In the context of XSLT/XQuery
    analysis, query optimization, and XML type checking, XPath decision
    problems arise naturally. They notably include XPath comparisons such as
    equivalence (whether two queries always return the same result), and
    containment (whether for any tree the result of a particular query is
    included in the result of a second one). XPath decision problems have
    attracted a lot of research attention, especially for studying the
    computational complexity of various XPath fragments. However, what is
    missing at present is the constructive use of an expressive logic which
    would allow capturing these decision problems, while providing
    practically effective decision procedures. In this paper, we propose a
    logic-based framework for the static analysis of XPath. Specifically, we
    propose the alternation free modal \mu-calculus with converse as the
    appropriate logic for effectively solving XPath decision problems. We
    present a translation of a large XPath fragment into \mu-calculus,
    together with practical experiments on the containment using a
    state-of-the-art EXPTIME decision procedure for \mu-calculus
    satisfiability. These preliminary experiments shed light, for the first
    time, on the cost of checking the containment in practice. We believe
    they reveal encouraging results for further static analysis of XML
    transformations.}

   ABSTRACT = {Microformats and semantic XHTML add semantics to web pages while
    taking advantage of the existing (X)HTML infrastructure. This approach
    enables new applications that can be deployed smoothly on the web. But
    there is currently no way to describe rigorously this type of markup and
    authors of web pages have very little help for creating and encoding
    semantic markup. A language that addresses these issues is presented in
    this paper. Its role is to specify semantically rich XML languages in terms
    of other XML languages, such as XHTML. The language is versatile enough to
    represent templates that can capture the overall structure of large
    documents as well as the fine details of a microformat. It is supported<
    markup language, still fully compatible with XHTML.}

    documents requires the adaptation of document specifications to the

    multimedia document adaptation which was temporally defined with regards
    to the Allen algebra of relations. This paper extends this framework to 
    the spatial dimension of SMIL documents. Our goal is to find a qualitative
    spatial representation that computes a set of adaptation solutions close
    to the initial document respecting the adaptation constraints. The quality
    of an adaptation can be regarded on two respects : expressiveness of
    adaptation solutions and computation speed. In this context, we
    characterize the adaptation quality of existing spatial representations.
    We show that these representations do not allow for optimal quality.
    Thus, we propose a new spatial representation which is sufficiently
    expressive to adapt SMIL documents faster.}

    objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen.
    2) Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages,
    in particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization.
    For example, SMIL components are used for integrating timing into XHTML
    and into SVG.
    3) Extend the functionalities contained in the SMIL 2.0 into new or

    électroniques, ainsi que les solutions actuelles apportées à ce domaine :
    outils existants, standards, prototypes de recherche.
    Tirant parti des possibilités offertes par ces techniques, nous étudions
    les besoins des utilisateurs à différents niveaux de la chaîne de
    production des présentations et montrons comment les outils répondent à
    ces attentes, en particulier en matière de pouvoir d'expression, de
    réutilisation et de facilité d'édition.
    Ce document est organisé en quatre grandes parties : une introduction
    générale sur la notion de documents multimédia et des domaines
    d'application concernés, l'étude des caractéristiques et des fonctions
    souhaitées pour la spécification de documents multimédia, l'étude
    détaillée du format standard SMIL et enfin la présentation de différents
    outils de présentation et d'édition de documents multimédia.}

   ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the main innovations of XML and considers
    their impact on the editing techniques for structured documents. Namespaces
    open the way to compound documents; well-formedness brings more freedom in
    the editing task; CSS allows style to be associated easily with structured
    documents. In addition to these innovative features, the wide deployment
    of XML introduces structured documents in many new applications,
    including applications where text is not the dominant content type. In
    languages such as SVG or SMIL, for instance, XML is used to represent
    vector graphics or multimedia presentations.
    This is a challenging situation for authoring tools. Traditional methods
    for editing structured documents are not sufficient to address the new
    requirements. New techniques must be developed or adapted to allow more
    users to efficiently create advanced XML documents. These techniques
    include multiple views, semantic-driven editing, direct manipulation,
    concurrent manipulation of style and structure, and integrated
    multi-language editing. They have been implemented and experimented in
    the Amaya editor and in some other tools.}

    theoreticaly studied. We aim at building a logical framework for formal
    study and     analysis of XPath and have to face the combinatorial
    complexity of formal proofs caused by XPath expressive power.
    We chose the Coq proof assistant
    and its powerful inductive constructions to rigorously investigate XPath
    peculiarities. We focus in this paper on a basic modeling of XPath syntax
    and semantics, and make two contributions. First, we propose a new formal
    semantics, which is an interpretation of paths as first order logic
    propositions that turned out to greatly simplify our formal proofs.
    Second, we formally prove that this new interpretation is equivalent to
    previously known XPath denotational semantics, opening perspectives for
    more ambitious mathematical characterizations. We illustrate our Coq
    based model through several examples and we develop a formal proof of a
    simple yet significant XPath property that compares quite favorably to a
    former informal proof.}

   ABSTRACT = {XML is becoming the de facto standard for information exchange.
    XML querying is a key component for structured information processing and
    plays a central role in the next generation world wide web, information
    management systems and databases. Applications relying on XML processing
    notably depend on XPath, the standard language for adressing parts of XML
    documents. Besides its fundamental functionality, reasons behind XPath
    suc- cess include being widely accepted by programmers and well-suited
    for formal treatments. With the growing volume of XML content and XML
    processing applications, our research is oriented toward efficiency of
    XML querying. Our approach relies on analysis and trans- formation of
    XPath expressions for optimization. This note presents current open
    issues with XPath, and introduces our preliminary results applied to
    streaming XPath processing. Moreover, it describes our methodology, which
    includes XPath modelisation using the Coq proof assistant, and future
    directions envisioned toward high performance XML querying.}

   ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, new devices such as palm computers,
    smart phones, pocket PCs became common components of the computing
    infrastructure.
    These devices allow multimedia information to be used on the Web at any
    time and anywhere. At the same time, the content of the Web has known an
    important revolution. Today, the Web includes continuous medias such as
    video, audio and 3D animations. The content is created in several formats
    with new functionalities. Usually, these formats are based on many
    structural dimensions: logical, spatial, temporal and hypermedia.
    In order to ensure universal access to Web content, with respect to the
    constraints of the current environment, it is necessary to design new
    systems that enable content delivery in different contexts. The objective
    of our work is to resolve the problems related to content adaptation and
    negotiation based on the limitations of the target devices and the
    heterogeneous environment. We propose a flexible architecture called NAC
    that includes different components for content negotiation and
    adaptation, and ensures an efficient framework in which these components
    cooperate and exchange negotiation-based information in order to reach
    the objective of the universal access.
    NAC allows several kinds of adaptations to be applied: structural
    adaptation, semantic adaptation and media resources adaptation. These
    adaptations satisfy different contexts of the clients. We also propose a
    description model of the environment context: UPS, a negotiation protocol
    and a rich collection of adaptation techniques. NAC concepts have
    contributed in W3C standardization efforts, in particular in the CC/PP
    framework and in work on Device Independence. This work includes
    performance evaluations in order to show the usability of our system in a
    practical framework.}

   ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of heterogeneous devices (desktop
    computers, personal digital assistants, phones), multimedia documents must
    be played under various constraints (small screens, low bandwidth). Taking
    these constraints into account with current document models is impossible.
    Hence, generic source documents must be transformed into documents
    compatible with the target contexts. Currently, the design of
    transformations is left to programmers. We propose here a semantic
    framework, which accounts for multimedia document adaptation in very
    general terms. A model of a multimedia document is a potential execution
    of this document and a context defines a particular class of models. The
    adaptation should then retain the source document models that belong to
    the class defined by the context if such models exist. Otherwise, the
    adaptation should produce a document whose models belong to this class
    and are "close" to those of the source documents. We focus on the
    temporal dimension of multimedia documents and show how adaptation can
    take advantage of temporal reasoning techniques. Several metrics are
    given for assessing the proximity of models.}

   ABSTRACT = {XPath is a simple query language for XML documents which allows
    navigating in XML trees and returning a set of matching nodes. It is used
    in XML Schema to define keys an in XLink and XPointer to reference
    portions of documents. XPath is a fundamental part of XSLT and XQuery
    languages as it allows to define matching expressions for patterns and
    provides node selectors to filter elements in the transformations.
    We propose to study the containment and equivalence of XPath expressions
    using an inference system combined with a rewriting system. The inference
    system allows to assert and prove properties on a class of expressions.
    In order to keep the proof system compact, we propose a re-writing
    architecture which allows to transform remaining expressions in a
    disjunctive normal form compatible with this class. In contrast with
    model based approaches, the inference and rewriting systems are applied
    to the XPath language directly. We believe this will help understanding
    the underlying issues of deciding containment on the language itself.}

    movie shot by shot. This paper introduces a framework for extracting
    structural units such as shots, scenes, actions and dialogs from the
    script, and aligning them to the movie based on the longest matching
    subsequence between them. We present experimental results and
    applications of the framework with a full-length movie and discuss its
    applicability to large-scale film repositories.}

   ABSTRACT = {This paper discusses a new approach of generating TV-like
    multimedia presentations that are adapted to the target user preferences
    and to limited devices. Three main points are discussed: 1) The encoding of
    video presentations from a SMIL specification 2) The adaptation of the
    video content based on the user preferences, and 3) The delivery of
    adapted multimedia presentations. The used architecture includes a
    content server, an adaptation proxy and a set of small devices in the
    form of personal device assistants (PDA). These devices request the
    content through a wireless network. In order to show how the system
    behaves regarding the user preferences and capabilities, two negotiation
    dimensions are considered: the user language and the memory capability of
    the device. The first dimension is used to generate a content that can be
    understood by the target user, e.g. a video with subtitles written in the
    preferred language. The second dimension is chosen to solve the problem
    of the system blocking that usually happens when limited devices access
    rich multimedia presentations over the network.}

   ABSTRACT = {In the current web infrastructure, access to content is achieved
    from a variety of terminals such as desktop PCs, smart phones, set top
    boxes and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The different capabilities of
    these terminals led to the development of a variety of parallel webs each
    one accommodating a particular device feature. This situation poses a
    serious problem to web designers and maintainers since every piece of
    information needs to be authored for every type of terminal with the
    associated protocols. Our research work in the WAM project at INRIA is an
    attempt to unify web access to information with a more flexible and
    negotiated approach.}

   ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we define a framework for media resources
    manipulation in an adaptive content delivery system. We discuss the media
    resources manipulation in an adaptation and negotiation architecture in
    terms of binary relationship definition using a so-called "related
    resources" approach, resources extraction, adaptation and delivery. We show
    how different resources can be related by predefined semantic relationships
    in order to help structural adaptation and content negotiation tasks. We
    give a simple recursive algorithm to extract media resources form an
    input tree structure. The media description is specified using an
    extensible CC/PP profile. In order to show the benefits of our approach,
    we give a practical application of media manipulation: an automatic
    adaptation of XHTML documents for mobile phones. We propose also a
    general mechanism for the content servers in order to deliver media
    resources according to client constraints or profile. The influence of
    media selection in the delivery of multimedia services is also described
    using evaluation formulae and measured with some experimentations.}

   ABSTRACT = {Le travail présenté dans ce rapport a pour objectif de
    contribuer au domaine de la présentation de documents multimédia. Nous nous
    intéressons tout particulièrement aux problèmes de conception des
    formateurs XML. En considérant le problème de la composition des
    formateurs, nous initialisons une nouvelle direction de recherche sur la
    conception des formateurs XML par composition. La complexité croissante des
    documents multimédia, la multiplication des environnements d'exécution et
    la diversification des attentes des utilisateurs et des auteurs de ces
    documents ont conduit a l'émergence de nombreux langages de présentation
    et d'outils de formatage associés (CSS, SVG, SMIL, XSL-FO).
    Malgré cette évolution vers des systèmes plus puissants et plus
    performants, les langages comme leurs formateurs sont restés très
    influencés par les méthodes de formatage de texte. Ils restent très
    rigides dans leur fonctionnement et donnent peu de solutions face aux
    nouveaux besoins actuels des documents multimédia. Depuis quelques temps,
    la communauté de recherche tente de combler ce fossé et a proposé, parmi
    d'autres, d'utiliser de nouvelles techniques à base de contraintes pour
    permettre d'étendre l'expressivité des langages de présentation. Cette
    approche offre une amélioration très intéressante du pouvoir d'expression
    offert aux auteurs mais les formateurs associés deviennent de plus en
    plus complexes et difficiles à mettre en oeuvre, et donc à étendre dans
    le futur.
    Dans ce stage, nous proposons une architecture logicielle pour un système
    de présentation multimédia qui permet le couplage d'un langage de
    présentation et des services de formatage associés avec des systèmes de
    formatage existants de langage standard comme SMIL ou XSL-FO. Nous
    voulons non seulement être capable d'intégrer ce langage dans les
    langages existants mais également de proposer des services de formatage
    visant à intégrer son traitement dans les formateurs existants. Dans ce
    cas, le formateur est obtenu par composition (assemblage) des formateurs
    des langages existants. Donc, Notre ambition est double : intégration des
    langages et intégration des traitements. Le but est de permettre une
    meilleure réutilisation des capacités de contrôle offertes par ces
    langages ainsi que de leurs formateurs.}

   ABSTRACT = {Recently, XML has brought a standard way to exchange structured
    data between applications. XML transformation is currently considered as a
    fundamental operation in the data processing sequence of structured data.
    XML transformation focuses on producing a target XML document from a
    source XML document with a different structure.
    A few XML transformation languages have been proposed. These languages
    were all created with a batch approach, where the full input document is
    transformed at once. The main limit of this approach is that once a large
    document has been transformed, when it is modified, a full transformation
    must be performed again in order to get the new target document.
    Another approach, called incremental transformation, consists in
    reflecting the changes of the source document to the target document in
    an optimal way, i.e. without performing again the full transformation
    since it has already been done before for a similar source document. This
    approach makes it possible to create dynamic applications based on the
    update of the target document.
    Incremental processing has been studied in many and various research
    areas, mainly in order to do optimization. We make a synthesis of the
    main methods successfully developed for incremental processing. This
    study leads to conditions that make a transformation model suitable for
    incremental transformation. We then propose a new transformation model
    based on a rewriting system. Our model is well suited for incremental
    processing of insertions of structured data in the source document.}

    component included in the Amaya Web client. The timeline view is a faithful
    representation of the temporal behavior of the document where the author
    can perform all editing operations related to animation or
    synchronization between media. The advantages of this authoring approach
    are shown through editing session excerpts performed with LimSee and the

   ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a SMIL content adaptation framework
    for embedded devices such as PDA, cellular phones, etc. This framework is
    based on a three-pier organization of the SMIL content access which
    allows decoupling two levels of performance: a wired network with
    abundant resources such as bandwidth and processing power and, a wireless
    network with variable bandwidth and limited resources. Clients are given
    access to content from a variety of terminals with different
    capabilities. In order to adapt the SMIL content to these devices, the
    content access traverses an intermediate entity called adaptation proxy
    where the adaptation occurs. An experimental implementation of this
    framework shows how to achieve SMIL content adaptation using client
    profiles descriptions, negotiation strategies, simple SMIL adaptation and
    media transcoding.}

   ABSTRACT = {This work proposes a new way to edit/present easily multimedia
    documents. It consists in modelling the contents of complex media (video,
    audio) as a structure of sub-elements (moving objects, shots, scenes).
    These internal media fragments can be associated with behaviors
    (hyperlinks) or spatial/temporal relations with other objects of the
    document. This enables richer multimedia presentations thanks to a finer
    synchronization between media. The difficulty of this work is to insure
    that this model remains consistent with the composition model of
    multimedia documents and that it covers the needs of the authors for
    multimedia fine-grained synchronization. The approach chosen consists in
    using description tools from MPEG-7 to describe media contents and in
    integrating these descriptions into an extension of the Madeus
    constraint-based composition model.}

   ABSTRACT = {The adoption of XML in a wide variety of domains for the
    representation of structured documents and data has made the processing of
    World Wide Web documents easier, by offering generic solutions for parsing
    and manipulating them. These operations are often achieved through document
    structure and content transformations, and play a key role in the
    document manipulation process. Most existing solutions for the
    transformation of XML documents rely on a textual language, and even if
    some tools offer a graphical user interface on top of languages such as
    XSLT, transformations are still specified textually. The goal of this
    work is to study the applicability of visual programming techniques with
    respect to the visualization and transformation of XML documents. It has
    led to the design of VXT (Visual XML Transformer), a visual programming
    language for the specification of XML document transformations.}
