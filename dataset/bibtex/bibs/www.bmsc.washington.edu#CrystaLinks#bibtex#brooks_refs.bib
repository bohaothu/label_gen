  abstract = {The high intensity of third-generation X-ray sources, along with the
	development of cryo-cooling of protein crystals at temperatures around
	100 K, have made it possible to extend the diffraction limit of crystals
	and to reduce their size. However, even with cryo-cooled crystals,
	radiation damage becomes a limiting factor. So far, the radiation
	damage has manifested itself in the form of a loss of overall diffracted
	intensity and an increase in the temperature factor. The structure
	of a protein (myrosinase) after exposure to different doses of X-rays
	in the region of 20 x 10(15) photons mm(-2) has been studied. The
	changes in the structure owing to radiation damage were analysed
	using Fourier difference maps and occupancy refinement for the first
	time. Damage was obvious in the form of breakage of disulfide bonds,
	decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues, a loss of hydroxyl
	groups from tyrosine and of the methylthio group of methionine. The
	susceptibility to radiation damage of individual groups of the same
	kind varies within the protein. The quality of the model resulting
	from structure determination might be compromised owing to the presence
	of radiolysis in the crystal after an excessive radiation dose. Radiation-induced
	structural changes may interfere with the interpretation of ligand-binding
	studies or MAD data. The experiments reported here suggest that there
	is an intrinsic limit to the amount of data which can be extracted
	from a sample of a given size.},

	are formidable multidisciplinary undertakings, requiring protein
	construct design, expression and purification, crystallization trials,

	methods can greatly facilitate these obligate tasks. Thus, mass spectrometry
	can be used to verify that the desired protein construct has been
	correctly expressed, to define compact domains in the target protein,
	to assess the components contained within the protein crystals, and
	to screen for successful incorporation of seleno-methionine and other
	heavy metal reagents used for phasing. In addition, mass spectrometry
	can be used to address issues of modeling, topology, and side-chain
	proximity. Here, we demonstrate how rational use of mass spectrometry
	assists and expedites high resolution X-ray structure determination

	Swiss-PdbViewer not only acts as a client for SWISS-MODEL, but also
	provides a large selection of structure analysis and display tools.
	In addition, we provide the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a database containing
	more than 3500 automatically generated protein models. By making

	to increase the use of protein structures and models in the process

	recognition, we investigate hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts
	and water-mediated bonds in 129 protein-DNA complex structures. DNA-backbone
	interactions are the most numerous, providing stability rather than
	specificity. For base interactions, there are significant base-amino
	acid type correlations, which can be rationalised by considering
	the stereochemistry of protein side chains and the base edges exposed
	in the DNA structure. Nearly two-thirds of the direct read-out of
	DNA sequences involves complex networks of hydrogen bonds, which
	enhance specificity. Two-thirds of all protein-DNA interactions comprise
	van der Waals contacts, compared to about one-sixth each of hydrogen
	and water-mediated bonds. This highlights the central importance
	of these contacts for complex formation, which have previously been
	relegated to a secondary role. Although common, water-mediated bonds
	are usually non-specific, acting as space-fillers at the protein-DNA
	interface. In conclusion, the majority of amino acid-base interactions
	observed follow general principles that apply across all protein-DNA
	complexes, although there are individual exceptions. Therefore, we
	distinguish between interactions whose specificities are 'universal'
	and 'context-dependent'. An interactive Web-based atlas of side chain-base
	contacts provides access to the collected data, including analyses
	and visualisation of the three-dimensional geometry of the interactions.},

  abstract = {Proteins that bind to DNA are found in all areas of genetic activity
	within the cell. To help understand how these proteins perform their
	various functions, it is useful to analyse which residues are involved
	in binding to the DNA and how they interact with the bases and sugar-phosphate
	backbone of nucleic acids. Here we describe a program called NUCPLOT
	which can automatically identify these interactions from the 3D atomic
	coordinates of the complex from a PDB file and generate a plot that
	shows all the interactions in a schematic manner. The program produces
	a PostScript output file representing hydrogen, van der Waals and
	covalent bonds between the protein and the DNA. The resulting diagram
	is both clear and simple and allows immediate identification of important
	interactions within the structure. It also facilitates comparison
	of binding found in different structures. NUCPLOT is a completely
	automatic program, which can be used for any protein-DNA complex
	and will also work for certain protein-RNA structures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure of biomacromolecules to ionising radiation results
	in damage that is initiated by free radicals and progresses through
	a variety of mechanisms. A widely used technique to study the three-dimensional
	structures of biomacromolecules is crystallography, which makes use
	of ionising X-rays. It is crucial to know to what extent structures
	determined using this technique might be biased by the inherent radiation
	damage. RESULTS: The consequences of radiation damage have been investigated
	for three dissimilar proteins. Similar results were obtained for
	each protein, atomic B factors increase, unit-cell volumes increase,
	protein molecules undergo slight rotations and translations, disulphide
	bonds break and decarboxylation of acidic residues occurs. All of
	these effects introduce non-isomorphism. The absorbed dose in these
	experiments can be reached during routine data collection at undulator
	beamlines of third generation synchrotron sources. CONCLUSIONS: X-rays
	can leave a 'fingerprint' on structures, even at cryogenic temperatures.
	Serious non-isomorphism can be introduced, thus hampering multiple
	isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion
	(MAD) phasing methods. Specific structural changes can occur before
	the traditional measures of radiation damage have signalled it. Care
	must be taken when assigning structural significance to features
	that might easily be radiation-damage-induced changes. It is proposed
	that the electron-affinic disulphide bond traps electrons that migrate
	over the backbone of the protein, and that the sidechains of glutamic
	acid and aspartic acid donate electrons to nearby electron holes
	and become decarboxylated successively. The different disulphide
	bonds in each protein show a clear order of susceptibility, which
	might well relate to their intrinsic stability.},

  abstract = {We examined the different steps necessary for the enzymatic digestion
	of proteins in the polyacrylamide matrix after gel electrophoresis.
	As a result, we developed an improved method for obtaining peptides
	for internal sequence analysis from 1-2 micrograms of in-gel-digested
	proteins. The long washing-lyophilization-equilibration steps necessary
	to eliminate the dye, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and other gel-associated
	contaminants that perturb protein digestion in Coomassie blue-stained
	gels have been replaced by washing for 40 min with 50\% acetonitrile,
	drying for 10 min at room temperature, and then rehydrating with
	a protease solution. The washing and drying steps result in a substantial
	reduction of the gel slice volume that, when next swollen in the
	protease solution, readily absorbs the enzyme, facilitating digestion.
	The Coomassie blue staining procedure has also been modified by reducing
	acetic acid and methanol concentrations in the staining solution
	and by eliminating acetic acid in the destaining solution. The peptides
	resulting from the in-gel digestion are easily recovered by passive
	elution, in excellent yields for structural characterization. This
	simple and rapid method has been successfully applied for the internal
	sequence analysis of membrane proteins from the rat mitochondria
	resolved in preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.},

	today. In 2002 the server computed 120 000 user requests for 3D protein

	amino acid sequence of a protein is submitted to build a 3D model.
	Template selection, alignment and model building are done completely
	automated by the server. In the 'alignment mode', the modeling process
	is based on a user-defined target-template alignment. Complex modeling
	tasks can be handled with the 'project mode' using DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer),
	an integrated sequence-to-structure workbench. All models are sent
	back via email with a detailed modeling report. WhatCheck analyses
	and ANOLEA evaluations are provided optionally. The reliability of
	SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated in the EVA-CM project. The

  abstract = {The recently developed technique of maximum-likelihood density modification
	[Terwilliger (2000), Acta Cryst. D56, 965-972] allows a calculation
	of phase probabilities based on the likelihood of the electron-density
	map to be carried out separately from the calculation of any prior
	phase probabilities. Here, it is shown that phase-probability distributions
	calculated from the map-likelihood function alone can be highly accurate
	and that they show minimal bias towards the phases used to initiate
	the calculation. Map-likelihood phase probabilities depend upon expected
	characteristics of the electron-density map, such as a defined solvent
	region and expected electron-density distributions within the solvent
	region and the region occupied by a macromolecule. In the simplest
	case, map-likelihood phase-probability distributions are largely
	based on the flatness of the solvent region. Though map-likelihood
	phases can be calculated without prior phase information, they are
	greatly enhanced by high-quality starting phases. This leads to the
	technique of prime-and-switch phasing for removing model bias. In
	prime-and-switch phasing, biased phases such as those from a model
	are used to prime or initiate map-likelihood phasing, then final
	phases are obtained from map-likelihood phasing alone. Map-likelihood
	phasing can be applied in cases with solvent content as low as 30\%.
	Potential applications of map-likelihood phasing include unbiased
	phase calculation from molecular-replacement models, iterative model
	building, unbiased electron-density maps for cases where 2F(o) -
	F(c) or sigma(A)-weighted maps would currently be used, structure
	validation and ab initio phase determination from solvent masks,
	non-crystallographic symmetry or other knowledge about expected electron

  abstract = {The prediction of protein secondary structure (alpha-helices, beta-sheets
	and coil) is improved by 9\% to 66\% using the information available
	from a family of homologous sequences. The approach is based both
	on averaging the Garnier et al. (1978) secondary structure propensities
	for aligned residues and on the observation that insertions and high
	sequence variability tend to occur in loop regions between secondary
	structures. Accordingly, an algorithm first aligns a family of sequences
	and a value for the extent of sequence conservation at each position
	is obtained. This value modifies a Garnier et al. prediction on the
	averaged sequence to yield the improved prediction. In addition,
	from the sequence conservation and the predicted secondary structure,
	many active site regions of enzymes can be located (26 out of 43)
	with limited over-prediction (8 extra). The entire algorithm is fully
	automatic and is applicable to all structural classes of globular
	proteins.},
