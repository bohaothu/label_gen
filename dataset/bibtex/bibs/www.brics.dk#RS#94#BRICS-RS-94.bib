  abstract = 	 "Domain theory is the mathematical theory
                  underlying denotational semantics. This thesis
                  presents a formalization of domain theory in
                  the Higher Order Logic (HOL) theorem proving
                  system along with a mechanization of proof
                  functions and other tools to support reasoning
                  about the denotations of functional programs.
                  By providing a fixed point operator for
                  functions on certain domains which have a
                  special undefined (bottom) element, this
                  extension of HOL supports the definition of
                  recursive functions which are not also
                  primitive recursive. Thus, it provides an
                  approach to the long-standing and important
                  problem of defining non-primitive recursive
                  functions in the HOL system.\bibpar
                  Our philosophy is that there must be a direct
                  correspondence between elements of complete
                  partial orders (domains) and elements of HOL
                  types, in order to allow the reuse of higher
                  order logic and proof infrastructure already
                  available in the HOL system. Hence, we are able
                  to mix domain theoretic reasoning with
                  reasoning in the set theoretic HOL world to
                  advantage, exploiting HOL types and tools
                  directly. Moreover, by mixing domain and set
                  theoretic reasoning, we are able to eliminate
                  almost all reasoning about the bottom element
                  of complete partial orders that makes the LCF
                  theorem prover, which supports a first order
                  logic of domain theory, difficult and tedious
                  to use. A thorough comparison with LCF is
                  provided.\bibpar
                  The advantages of combining the best of the
                  domain and set theoretic worlds in the same
                  system are demonstrated in a larger example,
                  showing the correctness of a unification
                  algorithm. A major part of the proof is
                  conducted in the set theoretic setting of
                  higher order logic, and only at a late stage of
                  the proof domain theory is introduced to give a
                  recursive definition of the algorithm, which is
                  not primitive recursive. Furthermore, a total
                  well-founded recursive unification function can
                  be defined easily in pure HOL by proving that
                  the unification algorithm (defined in domain
                  theory) always terminates; this proof is
                  conducted by a non-trivial well-founded
                  induction. In such applications, where
                  non-primitive recursive HOL functions are
                  defined via domain theory and a proof of
                  termination, domain theory constructs only
                  appear temporarily.",

                  spaces and continuous stable maps and observed
                  that the functor that forgets the linearity of
                  linear stable maps has a left adjoint. This
                  fundamental observation gave rise to the
                  discovery of Linear Logic. Since then, the
                  category of coherence spaces and linear stable
                  maps, with the comonad induced by the
                  adjunction, has been considered a canonical
                  model of Linear Logic. Now, the same phenomenon
                  is present if we consider the category of pre
                  dI domains and continuous stable maps, and the
                  category of dI domains and linear stable maps;
                  the functor that forgets the linearity has a
                  left adjoint. This gives an alternative model
                  of Intuitionistic Linear Logic. It turns out
                  that this adjunction can be factored in two
                  adjunctions yielding a model of Intuitionistic
                  Affine Logic; the category of pre dI domains
                  and affine stable functions. It is the goal of
                  this paper to show that this category is
                  actually a model of Intuitionistic Affine
                  Logic, and to show that this category moreover
                  has properties which make it possible to use it
                  to model convergence/divergence behaviour and

                  intensively studied in the literature. Ideally
                  one would like to separate these systems.
                  However this is generally expected to be a very
                  deep problem, closely related to some of the
                  most famous and open problems in complexity
                  theory.\bibpar
                  
                  In order to throw some light on the separation
                  problems, I consider the case where the
                  underlying language is enriched by extra
                  relation and function symbols. The paper
                  introduces a new type of results. These state
                  that the first three levels in the hierarchy
                  (i.e. $S^{1}_{2},T^{1}_{2}$ and $S^{2}_{2}$)
                  are never able to distinguish (in a precise
                  sense) the ``finite'' from the ``infinite''.
                  The fourth level (i.e. $T^{2}_{2}$) in some
                  cases can make such a distinction. More
                  precisely, elementary principles from
                  finitistical combinatorics (when expressed
                  solely by the extra relation and function
                  symbols) are only provable on the first three
                  levels if they are valid when considered as
                  principles of general (infinitistical)
                  combinatorics. I show that this does not hold
                  for the fourth level.\bibpar

                  recursion, and the resulting functional

                  a strong monad, and that recursion is modelled

  abstract = 	 "This article shows how individual Petri nets
                  form models of Girard's intuitionistic linear
                  logic. It explores questions of expressiveness
                  and completeness of linear logic with respect
                  to this interpretation. An aim is to use Petri
                  nets to give an understanding of linear logic
                  and give some appraisal of the value of linear
                  logic as a specification logic for Petri nets.
                  This article might serve as a tutorial,
                  providing one in-road into Girard's linear
                  logic via Petri nets. With this in mind we have
                  added several exercises and their solutions. We
                  have made no attempt to be exhaustive in our
                  treatment, dedicating our treatment to one
                  semantics of intuitionistic linear
                  logic.\bibpar
                  
                  Completeness is shown for several versions of
                  Girard's linear logic with respect to Petri
                  nets as the class of models. The strongest
                  logic considered is intuitionistic linear
                  logic, with $\otimes$, $-\!\raise+.3ex\hbox
                  {\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\circ$}$,
                  $\vphantom{\oplus}\raisebox{-1.15pt}{\rm\&}$,
                  $\oplus$ and the exponential ${!}$ (``of
                  course''), and forms of quantification. This
                  logic is shown sound and complete with respect
                  to {\em atomic nets} (these include nets in
                  which every transition leads to a nonempty
                  multiset of places). The logic is remarkably
                  expressive, enabling descriptions of the kinds
                  of properties one might wish to show of nets;
                  in particular, negative properties, asserting
                  the impossibility of an assertion, can also be
                  expressed. A start is made on decidability
                  issues.",

                  is the minimum possible complexity of its
                  determinisation. The entropy of a
                  nondeterministic function, $F$, is minus the
                  logarithm of the ratio between the number of
                  determinisations of $F$ and the number of all
                  deterministic functions.\bibpar
                  
                  
                  We obtain an upper bound on the complexity of a
                  nondeterministic function with restricted
                  entropy for the worst case.\bibpar
                  
                  
                  These bounds have strong applications in the
                  problem of algorithm derandomization. A lot of
                  randomized algorithms can be converted to
                  deterministic ones if we have an effective
                  hitting set with certain parameters (a set is
                  hitting for a set system if it has a nonempty
                  intersection with any set from the
                  system).\bibpar
                  
                  
                  Linial, Luby, Saks and Zuckerman (1993)
                  constructed the best effective hitting set for
                  the system of $k$-value, $n$-dimensional
                  rectangles. The set size is polynomial in
                  $k(\log n)/\epsilon $.\bibpar
                  
                  
                  Our bounds of nondeterministic functions
                  complexity offer a possibility to construct an
                  effective hitting set for this system with
