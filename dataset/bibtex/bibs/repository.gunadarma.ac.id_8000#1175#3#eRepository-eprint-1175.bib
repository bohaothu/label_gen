        abstract = {Images made the Internet popular. Since many mobile devices become
capable to take photos and digital cameras become wide-spread one can expect a
large ?ood of private images in the Internet showing all interesting locations of
the world. However, ?nding images of a certain location still remains tedious to
impossible. Searching for keywords works hardly as information is rarely added
manually. Geographical information about where a photo was taken would overcome
this lack.
This paper shows how to inject geographical information automatically as early
as possible, i.e. at the moment when a mobile device takes a photo. A service is
developed to add geographical information belated to existing images. Having a large
number of geographically injected images allows us to build the World Photo Album.}
