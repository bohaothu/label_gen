A CAPTCHA is a computer-based security test used to distinguish human users from artificial users, preventing automated abuse of networked resources. As mobile network services improve, we can anticipate that future mobile network services will come under attack from automated programs. Importantly, while CAPTCHA techniques have existed for Internet services for some time, only limited work has been carried out to establish CAPTCHAs suitable for mobile device interfaces. The Drawing CAPTCHA (2006) is one of the most well known systems of this type. Unfortunately, though it is straightforward, it is not secure. To demonstrate this, an image-processing technique is newly proposed that breaks the Drawing CAPTCHA. A new CAPTCHA approach is then introduced here which is intended specifically for mobile devices. Experimental results suggest that this new CAPTCHA design is user-friendly as well as secure.}",

representation has been largely abandoned though, due to its susceptibility to premature termination of progress caused by local minima. 
We seek to encourage the reopening of research into this method by introducing a new approach called Forward Chaining. This technique 
avoids premature termination of progress by dynamically reshaping the potential field using subgoals which chain forwards towards the 
goal. A number of increasingly competent and robust navigation heuristics yielding efficient paths are demonstrated. Various avenues for 
future research are given.}",

	year= "{2005}",
	abstract = "{A key ability for any real world robotic agent and for many simulated agents in virtual environments is the ability to navigate successfully to goal positions within their world. It is often necessary to do this in the presence of obstacles that limit access to parts of the agent's world. 

This thesis addresses the problem of agent navigation in the situation where an agent is seeking a goal in the presence of obstacle configurations. Potential fields are used to model the navigational problems, and purely potential field based heuristics are given as solutions. 

Existing potential field based techniques and alternative navigation approaches are shown to lack certain desirable properties that might allow them to be considered completely successful. 

The general problem of potential field navigation is addressed here using subgoal chaining. A series of novel potential field based subgoal selection heuristics are developed that guide the agent to success in the presence of the stated problem conditions. Development of the heuristic begins by modelling a solution for the simplest two dimensional environments, and then extending it to solutions for problems of greater complexity. 

The techniques developed here are shown to be successful on a wide variety of problems. Applications for these solutions are suggested in robotics, animation and computer games as well as in other areas of potential field research such as neural networks. Suggestions are given for ways in which competing techniques within navigation can be augmented by applying the results of this research. The remaining problems for potential field based agent navigation are highlighted for future study.}",
