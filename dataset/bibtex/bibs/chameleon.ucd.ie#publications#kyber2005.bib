  abstract =     {In investing energy in developing reasoning
                  machines of the future, one must abstract away
                  from the specific solutions to specific problems
                  and ask what are the fundamental research questions
                  that should be addressed. This paper aims to
                  revisit some fundamental perspectives and promote
                  new approaches to reasoning machines and their
                  associated form and function.},
