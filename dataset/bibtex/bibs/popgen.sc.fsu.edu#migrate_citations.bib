Abstract = {{Phylogeographic methods facilitate inference of the geographical
   history of genetic lineages. Recent examples explore human migration
   and the origins of viral pandemics. There is longstanding disagreement
   over the use and validity of certain phylogeographic inference
   methodologies. In this paper, we highlight three distinct frameworks
   for phylogeographic inference to give a taste of this disagreement.
   Each of the three approaches presents a different viewpoint on
   phylogeography, most fundamentally on how we view the relationship
   between the inferred history of a sample and the history of the
   population the sample is embedded in. Satisfactory resolution of this
   relationship between history of the tree and history of the population
   remains a challenge for all but the most trivial models of
   phylogeographic processes. Intriguingly, we believe that some recent
   methods that entirely avoid inference about the history of the
   population will eventually help to reach a resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of barriers to dispersal and gene flow is often inferred to
   be the primary cause of lineage divergence and phylogeographic
   structure in terrestrial organisms. In particular, the Mississippi
   River has been implicated as a barrier to gene flow in many species,
   including aquatic taxa. However, if barriers are permeable to
   organisms, then phylogeographic structure may be difficult to detect
   due to gene flow between lineages. Using time-calibrated Bayesian
   phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA, and phylogeographic coalescent
   simulations, we determine if the Mississippi River operates as a
   barrier to gene flow in the aquatic diamond-backed watersnake (Nerodia
   rhombifer). The phylogenetic analyses support a basal division within
   N. rhombifer mtDNA lineages that coincides with populations generally
   east and west of the Mississippi River. These results, and that of the
   divergence dating analyses, therefore suggest that the river was a
   significant barrier to gene flow in the Pleistocene similar to 1.4
   million years ago, presumably during an interglacial period when the
   river was much wider. However, we also detect western haplotypes in the
   eastern clade, and vice versa, thereby indicating that this barrier has
   not been complete. Nonetheless, the coalescent simulations that account
   for limited migration suggest that the Mississippi River was an
   important feature that shaped the phylogeographic history of this
   aquatic snake in the USA despite limited gene flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Explosive speciation in ancient lakes has fascinated biologists for
   centuries and has inspired classical work on the tempo and modes of
   speciation. Considerable attention has been directed towards the
   extrinsic forces of speciation-the geological, geographical and
   ecological peculiarities of ancient lakes. Recently, there has been a
   resurgence of interest in the intrinsic nature of these radiations, the
   biological characteristics conducive to speciation. While new species
   are thought to arise mainly by the gradual enhancement of reproductive
   isolation among geographically isolated populations, ancient lakes
   provide little evidence for a predominant role of geography in
   speciation. Recent phylogenetic work provides strong evidence that
   multiple colonization waves were followed by parallel intralacustrine
   radiations that proceeded at relatively rapid rates despite long-term
   gene flow through hybridization and introgression. Several studies
   suggest that hybridization itself might act as a key evolutionary
   mechanism by triggering major genomic reorganization/revolution and
   enabling the colonization of new ecological niches in ancient lakes.
   These studies propose that hybridization is not only of little
   impediment to diversification but could act as an important force in
   facilitating habitat transitions, promoting postcolonization
   adaptations and accelerating diversification. Emerging ecological
   genomic approaches are beginning to shed light on the long-standing
   evolutionary dilemma of speciation in the face of gene flow. We propose
   an integrative programme for future studies on speciation in ancient
   lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical work focused on microsatellite variation has produced a
   number of important results, including the expected distribution of
   repeat sizes and the expected squared difference in repeat size between
   two randomly selected samples. However, closed-form expressions for the
   sampling distribution and frequency spectrum of microsatellite
   variation have not been identified. Here, we use coalescent simulations
   of the stepwise mutation model to develop gamma and exponential
   approximations of the microsatellite allele frequency spectrum, a
   distribution central to the description of microsatellite variation
   across the genome. For both approximations, the parameter of biological
   relevance is the number of alleles at a locus, which we express as a
   function of theta, the population-scaled mutation rate, based on
   simulated data. Discovered relationships between theta, the number of
   alleles, and the frequency spectrum support the development of three
   new estimators of microsatellite theta. The three estimators exhibit
   roughly similar mean squared errors (MSEs) and all are biased. However,
   across a broad range of sample sizes and theta values, the MSEs of
   these estimators are frequently lower than all other estimators tested.
   The new estimators are also reasonably robust to mutation that includes
   step sizes greater than one. Finally, our approximation to the
   microsatellite allele frequency spectrum provides a null distribution
   of microsatellite variation. In this context, a preliminary analysis of
   the effects of demographic change on the frequency spectrum is
   performed. We suggest that simulations of the microsatellite frequency
   spectrum under evolutionary scenarios of interest may guide
   investigators to the use of relevant and sometimes novel summary

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Past and current range or spatial expansions have important
   consequences on population genetic structure. Habitat-use expansion,
   i.e. changing habitat associations, may also influence genetic
   population parameters, but has been less studied. Here we examined the
   genetic population structure of a Palaeartic woodland butterfly Pararge
   aegeria (Nymphalidae) which has recently colonized agricultural
   landscapes in NW-Europe. Butterflies from woodland and agricultural
   landscapes differ in several phenotypic traits (including morphology,
   behavior and life history). We investigated whether phenotypic
   divergence is accompanied by genetic divergence between populations of
   different landscapes along a 700 km latitudinal gradient.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Populations (23) along the latitudinal
   gradient in both landscape types were analyzed using microsatellite and
   allozyme markers. A general decrease in genetic diversity with latitude
   was detected, likely due to post-glacial colonization effects. Contrary
   to expectations, agricultural landscapes were not less diverse and no
   significant bottlenecks were detected. Nonetheless, a genetic signature
   of recent colonization is reflected in the absence of clinal genetic
   differentiation within the agricultural landscape, significantly lower
   gene flow between agricultural populations (3.494) than between
   woodland populations (4.183), and significantly higher genetic
   differentiation between agricultural (0.050) than woodland (0.034)
   pairwise comparisons, likely due to multiple founder events. Globally,
   the genetic data suggest multiple long distance dispersal/colonization
   events and subsequent high intra-and inter-landscape gene flow in this
   species. Phosphoglucomutase deviated from other enzymes and
   microsatellite markers, and hence may be under selection along the
   latitudinal gradient but not between landscape types. Phenotypic
   divergence was greater than genetic divergence, indicating directional
   selection on some flight morphology traits.
   Main Conclusions/Significance: Clinal differentiation characterizes the
   population structure within the original woodland habitat. Genetic
   signatures of recent habitat expansion remain, notwithstanding high
   gene flow. After differentiation through drift was excluded, both
   latitude and landscape were significant factors inducing spatially
   variable phenotypic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Microsatellite markers were used to characterize the structure of
   genetic diversity in natural Moroccan Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis
   Mill.) populations, the most southwesterly marginal populations of the
   species in the Mediterranean Basin. Twenty-two natural populations and
   one artificial population, located in four regions covering most of the
   natural range of P. halepensis in the country, were sampled. Across
   this range, towards the south and west (and towards high altitudes) the
   populations become increasingly discrete and discontinuous. The nuclear
   microsatellite marker analysis suggests that a large proportion of the
   Aleppo pines in Morocco have derived from a single genetic lineage,
   represented by a central group of 11 of the examined populations
   located in the High and Middle Atlas Mountains. In addition, two
   smaller groups, represented by the marginal southwestern High Atlas
   populations, and three still smaller north / northeastern groups of
   populations located in the Rif and northeast Middle Atlas Mountains,
   could be genetically distinguished. Further, coalescence analysis of
   historical demographic population patterns suggests that ancient
   bottlenecks occurred in all of the natural populations. However, the
   population differentiation and genetic diversity levels we found were
   good (F-st = 15.47), presumably because of the species' good potential

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The idea that molecular data should contain information on the recent
   evolutionary history of populations is rather old. However, much of the
   work carried out today owes to the work of the statisticians and
   theoreticians who demonstrated that it was possible to detect
   departures from equilibrium conditions (e. g., panmictic
   population/mutation-drift equilibrium) and interpret them in terms of
   deviations from neutrality or stationarity. During the last 20 years
   the detection of population size changes has usually been carried out
   under the assumption that samples were obtained from populations that
   can be approximated by a Wright-Fisher model (i.e., assuming panmixia,
   demographic stationarity, etc.). However, natural populations are
   usually part of spatial networks and are interconnected through gene
   flow. Here we simulated genetic data at mutation and migration-drift
   equilibrium under an n-island and a stepping-stone model. The simulated
   populations were thus stationary and not subject to any population size
   change. We varied the level of gene flow between populations and the
   scaled mutation rate. We also used several sampling schemes. We then
   analyzed the simulated samples using the Bayesian method implemented in
   MSVAR, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation program, to detect and
   quantify putative population size changes using microsatellite data.
   Our results show that all three factors (genetic differentiation/gene
   flow, genetic diversity, and the sampling scheme) play a role in
   generating false bottleneck signals. We also suggest an ad hoc method
   to counter this effect. The confounding effect of population structure
   and of the sampling scheme has practical implications for many
   conservation studies. Indeed, if population structure is creating
   ``spurious'' bottleneck signals, the interpretation of bottleneck
   signals from genetic data might be less straightforward than it would
   seem, and several studies may have overestimated or incorrectly
   detected bottlenecks in endangered species.}},

   Variability was surveyed at nuclear loci with allozyme, microsatellite,

   diversity were detected for allozymes (H = 0.080), microsatellites (H =

   Hardy-Weinberg proportions, except for some microsatellite loci, for
   which null-allele frequencies of 0.02 to 0.34 were estimated. No

Title = {{Bayesian random local clocks, or one rate to rule them all}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time dating
   and ``relaxed phylogenetic{''} inference, in which a time tree is
   estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a
   new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock
   using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging
   over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the
   problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local
   molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full
   phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a
   possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new
   one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the
   unconstrained model results, there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate
   models available for averaging with 1, 2, ... , 2n - 2 different rate
   categories.
   Results: We propose an efficient method to sample this model space
   while simultaneously estimating the phylogeny. The new method
   conveniently allows a direct test of the strict molecular clock, in
   which one rate rules them all, against a large array of alternative
   local molecular clock models. We illustrate the method's utility on
   three example data sets involving mammal, primate and influenza
   evolution. Finally, we explore methods to visualize the complex
   posterior distribution that results from inference under such models.
   Conclusions: The examples suggest that large sequence datasets may only
   require a small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile their
   branch lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses described here
   are implemented in the open access software package BEAST 1.5.4

Abstract = {{The Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) is one of the most threatened
   amphibians in the Pacific Northwest. Here we analyzed data from 13
   microsatellite loci and 298 bp of mitochondrial DNA in frogs collected
   from 23 of the remaining R. pretiosa populations in order to (1) assess
   levels of genetic diversity within populations of R. pretiosa, (2)
   identify the major genetic groups in the species, (3) estimate levels
   of genetic differentiation and gene flow among populations within each
   major group, and (4) compare the pattern of differentiation among R.
   pretiosa populations with that among populations of R. cascadae, a
   non-endangered congener that also occurs in Oregon and Washington.
   There is a strong, hierarchical genetic structure in R. pretiosa. That
   structure includes six major genetic groups, one of which is
   represented by a single remaining population. R. pretiosa populations
   have low genetic diversity (average H (e) = 0.31) compared to R.
   cascadae (average H (e) = 0.54) and to other ranid frogs. Genetic
   subdivision among populations is much higher in R. pretiosa than in R.
   cascadae, particularly over the largest geographic distances (hundreds
   of kilometers). A joint analysis of migration rates among populations
   and of effective sizes within populations (using MIGRATE) suggests that
   both species have extremely low migration rates, and that R. pretiosa
   have slightly smaller effective sizes. However, the slight difference
   in effective sizes between species appears insufficient to explain the
   large difference in genetic diversity and in large-scale genetic
   structure. We therefore hypothesize that low connectivity among the
   more widely-spaced R. pretiosa populations (owing to their patchier
   habitat), is the main cause of their lower genetic diversity and higher
   among-population differentiation. Conservation recommendations for R.
   pretiosa include maintaining habitat connectivity to facilitate gene
   flow among populations that are still potentially connected, and either
   expanding habitat or founding additional `backup' populations to
   maintain diversity in the isolated populations. We recommend that
   special consideration be given to conservation of the Camas Prairie
   population in Northern Oregon. It is the most geographically isolated
   population, has the lowest genetic diversity (H (e) = 0.14) and appears
   to be the only remaining representative of a major genetic group that
   is now almost extinct. Finally, because the six major groups within R.
   pretiosa are strongly differentiated, occupy different habitat types,
   and are geographically separate, they should be recognized as
   evolutionarily significant units for purposes of conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{P>Recently, there has been a debate about whether the temperate forests

   phylogeographical studies of the temperate-deciduous walnut tree,
   Juglans mandshurica (Juglandaceae) in northern and northeastern China,
   as well as Japan and Korea.
   We assessed the genetic structure of 33 natural populations using 10
   nuclear microsatellite loci and seven chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments.
   The cpDNA data showed the complete fixation of two different haplotype
   lineages in northeastern vs northern populations. This pronounced

   data, but there were disparities regarding individual populations.
   Among those populations fixed for haplotype A (the northeastern group),
   three were clustered in the northern group and four showed evidence of
   mixed ancestry based on microsatellite data.
   Our results support the hypothesis that two independent refugia were
   maintained across the range of J. mandshurica in the north of China
   during the last glacial maximum, contrary to the inference that all
   temperate forests migrated to the south (25-30 degrees N). The

   agricultural experiments can be analyzed in many different ways using
   different models. The most commonly used models are the linear model
   and the generalized linear model. The maximum likelihood method is
   often used for data analysis. However, this method may not be able to
   handle complicated models, especially multiple level hierarchical
   models. The Bayesian method partitions complicated models into simple
   components, each of which may be formulated analytically. Therefore,
   the Bayesian method is capable of handling very complicated models. The
   Bayesian method itself may not be more complicated than the maximum
   likelihood method, but the analysis is time consuming, because
   numerical integration involved in Bayesian analysis is almost
   exclusively accomplished based on Monte Carlo simulations, the so
   called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Although the MCMC
   algorithm is intuitive and straightforward to statisticians, it may not
   be that simple to agricultural scientists, whose main purpose is to
   implement the method and interpret the results. In this review, we
   provide the general concept of Bayesian analysis and the MCMC algorithm

Abstract = {{Characterization of the fine-scale population dynamics of the mosquito
   Aedes taeniorhynchus is needed to improve our understanding of its role
   as a disease vector in the Galapagos Islands. We used microsatellite
   data to assess the genetic structure of coastal and highland mosquito
   populations and patterns of gene flow between the two habitats through
   time on Santa Cruz Island. In addition, we assessed possible
   associations of mosquito abundance and genetic diversity with
   environmental variables. The coastal and highland mosquito populations
   were highly differentiated from each other all year round, with some
   gene flow detected only during periods of increased precipitation. The
   results support the hypothesis that selection arising from ecological
   differences between habitats is driving adaptation and divergence in A.
   taeniorhynchus, and maintaining long-term genetic differentiation of
   the populations against gene flow. The highland and lowland populations
   may constitute an example of incipient speciation in progress. Highland
   populations were characterized by lower observed heterozygosity and
   allelic richness, suggesting a founder effect and/or lower breeding
   site availability in the highlands. A lack of reduction in genetic
   diversity over time in highland populations suggests that they survive
   dry periods as dormant eggs. Association between mosquito abundance and
   precipitation was strong in the highlands, whereas tide height was the
   main factor affecting mosquito abundance on the coast. Our findings
   suggests differences in the infection dynamics of mosquito-borne
   parasites in the highlands compared to the coast, and a higher risk of
   mosquito-driven disease spread across these habitats during periods of
   increased precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal and subtidal communities of the western and eastern coasts
   of the North Atlantic Ocean were greatly affected by Pleistocene
   glaciations, with some taxa persisting on both coasts, and others
   recolonizing after being extirpated on one coast during the Last
   Glacial Maximum. In the original spirit of comparative phylogeography,
   we conducted a comparative analysis using mtDNA sequence data and a
   hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for
   testing these two scenarios across 12 intertidal and subtidal coastal
   invertebrates spanning the North Atlantic to determine the temporal
   dynamics of species membership of these two ephemeral communities.
   Conditioning on a low gene-flow model, our results suggested that a
   colonization or mitochondrial selective sweep history was predominant
   across all taxa, with only the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis showing a
   history of trans-Atlantic persistence. Conditioning on a high gene-flow
   model weakened the support for this assemblage-level demographic
   history. The predominance of a colonization-type history also
   highlights concerns about analyses based on single-locus data where
   genetic hitchhiking may be incorrectly inferred as colonization. In
   conclusion, driving factors in shifting species range distributions and
   membership of ephemeral coastal communities could be species-specific
   environmental tolerances, species interactions, and/or stochastic
   demographic extinction. Through a re-examination of a long-standing
   question of North Atlantic phylogeography, we highlight the flexibility
   and statistical honesty of using a model-based ABC approach.}},

   evolutionary relationships of a polymorphic raptor, Buteo jamaicensis
   harlani}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Phenotypic and molecular genetic data often provide
   conflicting patterns of intraspecific relationships confounding
   phylogenetic inference, particularly among birds where a variety of
   environmental factors may influence plumage characters. Among diurnal
   raptors, the taxonomic relationship of Buteo jamaicensis harlani to
   other B. jamaicensis subspecies has been long debated because of the
   polytypic nature of the plumage characteristics used in subspecies or
   species designations.
   Results: To address the evolutionary relationships within this group,
   we used data from 17 nuclear microsatellite loci, 430 base pairs of the
   mitochondrial control region, and 829 base pairs of the melanocortin 1
   receptor (Mc1r) to investigate molecular genetic differentiation among
   three B. jamaicensis subspecies (B. j. borealis, B. j. calurus, B. j.
   harlani). Bayesian clustering analyses of nuclear microsatellite loci
   showed no significant differences between B. j. harlani and B. j.
   borealis. Differences observed between B. j. harlani and B. j. borealis
   in mitochondrial and microsatellite data were equivalent to those found
   between morphologically similar subspecies, B. j. borealis and B. j.
   calurus, and estimates of migration rates among all three subspecies
   were high. No consistent differences were observed in Mc1r data between
   B. j. harlani and other B. jamaicensis subspecies or between light and
   dark color morphs within B. j. calurus, suggesting that Mc1r does not
   play a significant role in B. jamaicensis melanism.
   Conclusions: These data suggest recent interbreeding and gene flow
   between B. j. harlani and the other B. jamaicensis subspecies examined,
   providing no support for the historical designation of B. j. harlani as
   a distinct species.}},

   Flow cytometry analyses detected ploidy polymorphisms of 2x and 4x in
   Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. kamchatica of Taiwan. Genomic divergence
   between species/subspecies was estimated based on 98 randomly chosen
   nuclear genes. Multilocus analyses revealed a mosaic genome in diploid

   lyrata-like alleles.
   Coalescent analyses suggest that the segregation of ancestral
   polymorphisms alone cannot explain the high inconsistency between gene
   trees across loci, and that gene introgression via diploid A. l.
   kamchatica likely distorts the molecular phylogenies of Arabidopsis
   species. However, not all genes migrated across species freely. Gene
   ontology analyses suggested that some nonmigrating genes were
   constrained by natural selection.
   High levels of estimated ancestral polymorphisms between A. halleri and
   A. lyrata suggest that gene flow between these species has not

Abstract = {{Differences in larval developmental mode are predicted to affect
   ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from gene flow and
   population bottlenecks to rates of population recovery from
   anthropogenic disturbance and capacity for local adaptation. The most
   powerful tests of these predictions use comparisons among species to
   ask how phylogeographic patterns are correlated with the evolution and
   loss of prolonged planktonic larval development. An important and
   largely untested assumption of these studies is that interspecific
   differences in population genetic structure are mainly caused by
   differences in dispersal and gene flow (rather than by differences in
   divergence times among populations or changes in effective population
   sizes), and that species with similar patterns of spatial genetic
   variation have similar underlying temporal demographic histories.
   Teasing apart these temporal and spatial patterns is important for
   understanding the causes and consequences of evolutionary changes in
   larval developmental mode. New analytical methods that use the
   coalescent history of allelic diversity can reveal these temporal
   patterns, test the strength of traditional population-genetic
   explanations for variation in spatial structure based on differences in
   dispersal, and identify strongly supported alternative explanations for
   spatial structure based on demographic history rather than on gene flow
   alone. We briefly review some of these recent analytical developments,

   demographic history, and spatial genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The Frullania tamarisci complex includes eight
   Holarctic liverwort species. One of these, F. asagrayana, is
   distributed broadly throughout eastern North America from Canada to the
   Gulf Coast. Preliminary genetic data suggested that the species
   includes two groups of populations. This study was designed to test
   whether the two groups are reproductively isolated biological species.
   Methods: Eighty-eight samples from across the range of F. asagrayana,
   plus 73 samples from one population, were genotyped for 13
   microsatellite loci. Sequences for two plastid loci and nrITS were
   obtained from 13 accessions. Genetic data were analyzed using
   coalescent models and Bayesian inference.
   Key results: Frullania asagrayana is sequence-invariant at the two
   plastid loci and ITS2, but two clear groups were resolved by
   microsatellites. The two groups are largely reproductively isolated,
   but there is a low level of gene flow from the southern to the northern
   group. No gene flow was detected in the other direction. A local
   population was heterogeneous but displayed strong genetic structure.
   Conclusions: The genetic structure of F. asagrayana in eastern North
   America reflects morphologically cryptic differentiation between
   reproductively isolated groups of populations, near-panmixis within
   groups, and clonal propagation at local scales. Reproductive isolation
   between groups that are invariant at the level of nucleotide sequences
   shows that caution must be exercised in making taxonomic and
   evolutionary inferences from reciprocal monophyly (or lack thereof)
   between putative species.}},

Abstract = {{Most methods for studying divergence with gene flow rely upon data from
   many individuals at few loci. Such data can be useful for inferring
   recent population history but they are unlikely to contain sufficient
   information about older events. However, the growing availability of
   genome sequences suggests a different kind of sampling scheme, one that
   may be more suited to studying relatively ancient divergence. Data sets
   extracted from whole-genome alignments may represent very few
   individuals but contain a very large number of loci. To take advantage
   of such data we developed a new maximum-likelihood method for genomic
   data under the isolation-with-migration model. Unlike many
   coalescent-based likelihood methods, our method does not rely on Monte
   Carlo sampling of genealogies, but rather provides a precise
   calculation of the likelihood by numerical integration over all
   genealogies. We demonstrate that the method works well on simulated
   data sets. We also consider two models for accommodating mutation rate
   variation among loci and find that the model that treats mutation rates
   as random variables leads to better estimates. We applied the method to
   the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans and detected
   a low, but statistically significant, signal of gene flow from D.

Abstract = {{For many biological investigations, groups of individuals are

   locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We
   describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order
   structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling
   locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing
   unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of
   inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of
   the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method
   used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified
   thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are
   compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the
   harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic
   integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the
   marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not
   influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal
   likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with
   the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced
   and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal
   likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the

Abstract = {{An emerging pattern is that population densities of generalist rodents
   are higher in small compared to large forest patches in fragmented

   patches to test two dispersal-based hypotheses for this negative
   density-area relationship: (1) emigration rates from small patches
   should be relatively lower compared to large patches ({''}inhibited
   dispersal hypothesis''), or (2) immigration rates should be higher into
   small than large patches ({''}immigration hypothesis''). Neither
   hypothesis was supported using data on dispersal inferred from eight
   microsatellite loci for 12 populations of Peromyscus leucopus in six
   small (1.3-2.7 ha) and six large (8-150 ha) forest patches. Emigration
   rates were not lower from and immigration rates were not higher into
   small than large patches. In fact, contrary to both hypotheses,
   emigration rates were higher from populations of P. leucopus in small
   compared to large patches. Based on a combination of genetic and field
   data, we speculate that higher reproduction in smaller patches resulted
   in higher densities which led to higher emigration rates from those
   patches. Rates of reproduction (presumably driven by better habitat
   conditions in smaller patches), rather than dispersal, seems to drive
   density differences in forest patches. We conclude that smaller forest
   patches within an agricultural matrix act as a source of individuals,

Abstract = {{Marine species frequently show weak and/or complex genetic structuring

   individually feature weak chaotic patchiness, we demonstrate that
   combining inferences across species and incorporating environmental
   data can greatly improve the predictive value of marine population
   genetics studies on small spatial scales. Significant correlations in
   genetic patterns of microsatellite markers among three species, kelp
   bass Paralabrax clathratus, Kellet's whelk Kelletia kelletii and
   California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus, in the Southern
   California Bight suggest that slight differences in diversity and
   pairwise differentiation across sampling sites are not simply noise or
   chaotic patchiness, but are ecologically meaningful. To test whether
   interspecies correlations potentially result from shared environmental
   drivers of genetic patterns, we assembled data on kelp bed size, sea
   surface temperature and estimates of site-to-site migration probability
   derived from a high resolution multi-year ocean circulation model.
   These data served as predictor variables in linear models of genetic
   diversity and linear mixed models of genetic differentiation that were
   assessed with information-theoretic model selection. Kelp was the most
   informative predictor of genetics for all three species, but ocean
   circulation also played a minor role for kelp bass. The shared patterns
   suggest a single spatial marine management strategy may effectively
   protect genetic diversity of multiple species. This study demonstrates
   the power of environmental and ecological data to shed light on weak

Abstract = {{The concept of effective population size (N-e) is based on an elegantly
   simple idea which, however, rapidly becomes very complex when applied
   to most real-world situations. In natural populations, spatial and
   temporal stratifications create different classes of individuals with
   different vital rates, and this in turn affects (generally reduces) N-e
   in complex ways. I consider how these natural stratifications influence
   our understanding of effective size and how to estimate it, and what
   the consequences are for conservation and management of natural
   populations. Important points that emerge include the following:
   The relative influences of local vs metapopulation N-e depend on a
   variety of factors, including the time frame of interest.
   Levels of diversity in local populations are strongly influenced by
   even low levels of migration, so these measures are not reliable
   indicators of local N-e.
   For long-term effective size, obtaining a reliable estimate of mutation
   rate is the most important consideration; unless this is accomplished,
   estimates can be biased by orders of magnitude.
   At least some estimators of contemporary N-e appear to be robust to
   relatively high (approximately 10\%) equilibrium levels of migration,
   so under many realistic scenarios they might yield reliable estimates
   of local N-e.
   Age structure probably has little effect on long-term estimators of N-e
   but can strongly influence contemporary estimates.
   More research is needed in several key areas: (i) to disentangle
   effects of selection and drift in metapopulations connected by
   intermediate levels of migration; (ii) to elucidate the relationship
   between N-b (effective number of breeders per year) and N-e per
   generation in age-structured populations; (iii) to perform rigorous
   sensitivity analyses of new likelihood and coalescent-based methods for
   estimating demographic and evolutionary histories.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying population structure is one of the most common and

   Population structure is detected either by rejecting the null

   a result of either high ongoing migration or historic high migration
   but no current, ongoing migration. We direct attention to recent
   developments in the use of the tempo-spatial distribution of closely
   related individuals to detect population structure or estimate current
   migration rates. These `kinship-based' approaches complement more
   traditional population-based genetic inference methods by providing a
   means to detect population structure and estimate current migration
   rates when genetic divergence is low. However, for kinship-based
   methods to become widely adopted, formal estimation procedures
   applicable to a range of species life histories are needed.}},

Abstract = {{`No-take' marine protected areas (MPAs) are successful in protecting
   populations of many exploited fish species, but it is often unclear
   whether networks of MPAs are adequately spaced to ensure connectivity
   among reserves, and whether there is spillover into adjacent exploited
   areas. Such issues are particularly important in species with low
   dispersal potential, many of which exist as genetically distinct
   regional stocks. The roman, Chrysoblephus laticeps, is an
   overexploited, commercially important sparid endemic to South Africa.
   Post-recruits display resident behavior and occupy small home ranges,
   making C. laticeps a suitable model species to study genetic structure
   in marine teleosts with potentially low dispersal ability. We used
   multilocus data from two types of highly variable genetic markers
   (mitochondrial DNA control region and seven microsatellite markers) to
   clarify patterns of genetic connectivity and population structure in C.
   laticeps using samples from two MPAs and several moderately or severely
   exploited regions. Despite using analytical tools that are sensitive to
   detect even subtle genetic structure, we found that this species exists
   as a single, well-mixed stock throughout its core distribution. The
   high levels of connectivity identified among sites support the findings
   of previous studies that have indicated that inshore MPAs are an
   adequate tool for managing overexploited temperate reef fishes. Even
   though dispersal of adult C. laticeps out of MPAs is limited, the fact
   that the large adults in these reserves produce exponentially more
   offspring than their smaller counterparts in exploited areas makes MPAs
   a rich source of recruits. We nonetheless caution against concluding
   that the lack of structure identified in C. laticeps and several other
   southern African teleosts can be considered to be representative of
   marine teleosts in this region in general. Many such species are
   represented in more than one marine biogeographic province and may be
   comprised of regionally adapted stocks that require individual
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Population structure in many Arctic marine mammal species reflects a

   mtDNA and eight microsatellite markers to investigate population
   structure and demographic history in beluga whales in the North

   Differentiation was also recorded between Atlantic belugas and two
   previously studied populations in the North Pacific, the Beaufort Sea
   and Gulf of Alaska. However, Bayesian cluster analysis of the nDNA data
   identified two population clusters that did not correspond to the
   respective ocean basins, as predicted, but to: (1) Arctic
   (Svalbard-White Sea-Greenland-Beaufort Sea) and (2) Subarctic (Gulf of

Abstract = {{Genetic data are often used to assess `population connectivity' because
   it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales.
   Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number
   of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity
   depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of
   dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of
   residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on
   genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on
   demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is
   clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from
   stable or positive population growth to negative population growth.
   Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic
   connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest
   management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic
   interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of
   demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates
   and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight
   on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic
   rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success
   of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and
   limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three
   concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary
   criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and
   adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches
   for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of
   combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other
   direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal

Abstract = {{Historical records suggest that the petrels of Round Island (near

   Island in the South Atlantic. Using nine microsatellite loci, patterns

Abstract = {{Geographic range differences among species may result from differences
   in their physiological tolerances. In the intertidal zone, marine and
   terrestrial environments intersect to create a unique habitat, across
   which physiological tolerance strongly influences range. Traits to cope
   with environmental extremes are particularly important here because
   many species live near their physiological limits and environmental
   gradients can be steep. The snail Melampus bidentatus occurs in coastal
   salt marshes in the western Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. We used
   sequence data from one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear markers
   (histone H3 and a mitochondrial carrier protein, MCP) to identify three
   cryptic species within this broad-ranging nominal species, two of which
   have partially overlapping geographic ranges. High genetic diversity,
   low population structure, and high levels of migration within these two
   overlapping species suggest that historical range limitations do not
   entirely explain their different ranges. To identify microhabitat
   differences between these two species, we modelled their distributions
   using data from both marine and terrestrial environments. Although
   temperature was the largest factor setting range limits, other
   environmental components explained features of the ranges that
   temperature alone could not. In particular, the interaction of
   precipitation and salinity likely sets physiological limits that lead
   to range differences between these two cryptic species. This suggests
   that the response to climatic change in these snails will be mediated

Abstract = {{Identifying biological trends and threats to organisms that make long

   highly vagile seabirds, foraging throughout the North Pacific Ocean.
   Despite mark-recapture data indicating natal philopatry, Laysan
   albatross recently re-colonized several anthropogenically extirpated
   breeding locations. At the same time, a breeding population in the
   north-western Hawaiian Islands was lost to erosion and it was
   hypothesized that the colonization events were due to displacement
   rather than dispersal. Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were used in a
   range wide survey to test whether natal philopatry corresponded to
   population structure in Laysan albatross, and to determine whether
   recent colonization events were a result of displacement from vanishing
   breeding habitat. Five microsatellite loci found little population
   structure (F-ST=0.01, P=0.001), and sequences from the mitochondrial
   control region revealed low population structure (pi(ST)=0.05, P <

   contributions from multiple source populations, which contradicted the

   supported species-wide dispersal from all source colonies. High genetic

Abstract = {{Aim
   We examined genetic structure and long-distance gene flow in two
   lichenized ascomycetes, Flavocetraria cucullata and Flavocetraria
   nivalis, which are widespread in arctic and alpine tundra.
   Location
   Circumpolar North.
   Methods
   DNA sequences were obtained for 90 specimens (49 for F. cucullata and
   41 for F. nivalis) collected from various locations in Europe, Asia and
   North America. Sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) + 5.8S ribosomal subunit gene region were generated for 89
   samples, and supplemented by beta-tubulin (BTUB) and translation
   elongation factor 1-alpha gene (EF1) sequences for a subset of F.
   cucullata specimens. Phylogenetic, nonparametric permutation methods
   and coalescent analyses were used to assess population divergence and
   to estimate the extent and direction of migration among continents.
   Results
   Both F. cucullata and F. nivalis were monophyletic, supporting their
   morphology-based delimitation, and had high and moderately high
   intraspecific genetic diversity, respectively. Clades within each
   species contained specimens from both North America and Eurasia. We
   found only weak genetic differentiation among North American and
   Eurasian populations, and evidence for moderate to high transoceanic
   gene flow.
   Main conclusions
   Our results suggest that both F. cucullata and F. nivalis have been
   able to migrate over large distances in response to climatic
   fluctuations. The high genetic diversity observed in the Arctic
   indicates long-term survival at high latitudes, whereas the estimated
   migration rates and weak geographic population structure suggest a
   continuing long-distance gene flow between continents that has
   prevented pronounced genetic differentiation. The mode of long-distance
   dispersal is unknown, but wind dispersal of conidia and/or ascospores
   is probably important in the open arctic landscapes. The high genetic
   diversity and efficient long-distance dispersal capability of F.
   cucullata and F. nivalis suggest that these species, and perhaps other
   arctic lichens as well, will be able to track their potential niche in
   the changing Arctic.}},

Title = {{Rapid sympatric ecological differentiation of crater lake cichlid
   fishes within historic times}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: After a volcano erupts, a lake may form in the cooled
   crater and become an isolated aquatic ecosystem. This makes fishes in
   crater lakes informative for understanding sympatric evolution and
   ecological diversification in barren environments. From a geological
   and limnological perspective, such research offers insight about the
   process of crater lake ecosystem establishment and speciation. In the
   present study we use genetic and coalescence approaches to infer the
   colonization history of Midas cichlid fishes (Amphilophus cf.
   citrinellus) that inhabit a very young crater lake in Nicaragua-the ca.
   1800 year-old Lake Apoyeque. This lake holds two sympatric, endemic
   morphs of Midas cichlid: one with large, hypertrophied lips (similar to
   20\% of the total population) and another with thin lips. Here we test
   the associated ecological, morphological and genetic diversification of
   these two morphs and their potential to represent incipient speciation.
   Results: Gene coalescence analyses {[}11 microsatellite loci and
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences] suggest that crater lake Apoyeque
   was colonized in a single event from the large neighbouring great lake
   Managua only about 100 years ago. This founding in historic times is
   also reflected in the extremely low nuclear and mitochondrial genetic
   diversity in Apoyeque. We found that sympatric adult thin-and
   thick-lipped fishes occupy distinct ecological trophic niches. Diet,
   body shape, head width, pharyngeal jaw size and shape and stable
   isotope values all differ significantly between the two lip-morphs. The
   eco-morphological features pharyngeal jaw shape, body shape, stomach
   contents and stable isotopes (delta N-15) all show a bimodal
   distribution of traits, which is compatible with the expectations of an
   initial stage of ecological speciation under disruptive selection.
   Genetic differentiation between the thin-and thick-lipped population is
   weak at mtDNA sequence (F-ST = 0.018) and absent at nuclear
   microsatellite loci (F-ST < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence of
   eco-morphological differentiation occurring very quickly after the
   colonization of a new and vacant habitat. Exceptionally low levels of
   neutral genetic diversity and inference from coalescence indicates that
   the Midas cichlid population in Apoyeque is much younger (ca. 100 years
   or generations old) than the crater itself (ca. 1 800 years old). This
   suggests either that the crater remained empty for many hundreds of
   years after its formation or that remnant volcanic activity prevented
   the establishment of a stable fish population during the early life of
   the crater lake. Based on our findings of eco-morphological variation
   in the Apoyeque Midas cichlids, and known patterns of adaptation in
   Midas cichlids in general, we suggest that this population may be in a
   very early stage of speciation (incipient species), promoted by
   disruptive selection and ecological diversification.}},

Abstract = {{The South American tern Sterna hirundinacea is a migratory species for
   which dispersal, site fidelity and migratory routes are largely
   unknown. Here, we used five microsatellite loci and 799 bp partial
   mitochondrial DNA sequences (Cytochrome b and ND2) to investigate the
   genetic structure of South American terns from the South Atlantic Ocean
   (Brazilian and Patagonian colonies). Brazilian and Patagonian colonies
   have two distinct breeding phenologies (austral winter and austral
   summer, respectively) and are under the influence of different
   oceanographic features (e.g. Brazil and Falklands/Malvinas ocean
   currents, respectively), that may promote genetic isolation between
   populations. Results show that the Atlantic populations are not
   completely panmictic, nevertheless, contrary to our expectations, low
   levels of genetic structure were detected between Brazilian and
   Patagonian colonies. Such low differentiation (despite temporal
   isolation of the colonies) could be explained by demographic history of
   these populations coupled with ongoing levels of gene flow.
   Interestingly, estimations of gene flow through Maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian approaches has indicated asymmetrical long term and
   contemporary gene flow from Brazilian to Patagonian colonies,
   approaching a source-sink metapopulation dynamic. Genetic analysis of
   other South American tern populations (especially those from the
   Pacific coast and Falklands-Malvinas Islands) and other seabird species
   showing similar geographical distribution (e.g. royal tern Thalasseus
   maximus), are fundamental in gaining a better understanding of the main
   processes involved in the diversification of seabirds in the southern
   hemisphere.}},

Abstract = {{Coalescent model based methods for phylogeny estimation force
   systematists to confront issues related to the identification of
   species boundaries. Unlike conventional phylogenetic analysis, where
   species membership can be assessed qualitatively after the phylogeny is
   estimated, the phylogenies that are estimated under a coalescent model
   treat aggregates of individuals as the operational taxonomic units and
   thus require a priori definition of these sets because the models
   assume that the alleles in a given lineage are sampled from a single
   panmictic population. Fortunately, the use of coalescent model based
   approaches allows systematists to conduct probabilistic tests of
   species limits by calculating the probability of competing models of
   lineage composition. Here, we conduct the first exploration of the
   issues related to applying such tests to a complex empirical system.
   Sequence data from multiple loci were used to assess species limits and
   phylogeny in it elide of North American Myotis bats. After estimating
   gene trees at each locus, the likelihood of models representing all
   hierarchical permutations of lineage composition was calculated and
   Akaike information criterion scores were computed. Metrics borrowed
   from information theory suggest that there is strong support for
   several models that include multiple evolutionary lineages within the
   currently described species Myotis lucifugus and M. evotis. Although
   these results are preliminary, they illustrate the practical importance
   of coupled species delimitation and phylogeny estimation.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effects of altitude on the level and structure of genetic
   diversity, a genetic survey was conducted in 12 populations of sessile
   oak (Quercus petraea) located between 130 and 1660 m in two parallel
   valleys on the northern side of the Pyrenees Mountains. Genetic
   diversity was monitored at 16 nuclear microsatellite loci and 5
   chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers. The cpDNA survey suggested that extant
   populations in both valleys shared the same source populations from the
   plain. There was no visible trend of nuclear genetic diversity along
   altitude, even if indirect estimates of effective population sizes
   revealed a consistent reduction at higher altitudes. Population
   differentiation, although low, was mostly present among populations of
   the same valleys and reached similar levels than differentiation across
   the range of distribution of sessile oak. Contribution to the overall
   differentiation in the valleys was mostly due to the genetic divergence
   of the highest populations and the altitudinal variation of allelic
   frequencies at a few loci. Bayesian inference of migration between
   groups of populations showed that gene flow is preferentially
   unidirectional from lower altitudes in one valley to other groups of
   populations. Finally, we found evidence of clonal reproduction in high
   altitude populations. The introgression of Quercus robur and Quercus
   pubescens was also more frequent at the altitudinal margin suggesting
   that this mechanism may have contributed to the present migration and
   adaptation of Q. petraea and may also facilitate its future upslope
   shift in the context of climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Viral strain evolution and disease emergence are influenced by
   anthropogenic change to the environment. We investigated viral
   characteristics, host ecology, and landscape features in the
   rabies-striped skunk disease system of the central Great Plains to
   determine how these factors interact to influence disease emergence. We
   amplified portions of the N and G genes of rabies viral RNA from 269
   samples extracted from striped skunk brains throughout the distribution
   of two different rabies strains for which striped skunks were the
   reservoir. Because the distribution of these two strains overlapped on
   the landscape and were present in the same host population, we could
   evaluate how viral properties influenced epidemiological patterns in
   the area of sympatry. We found that South Central Skunk rabies (SCSK)
   exhibited intense purifying selection and high infectivity, which are
   both characteristics of an epizootic virus. Conversely, North Central
   Skunk rabies (NCSK) exhibited relaxed purifying selection and
   comparatively lower infectivity, suggesting the presence of an enzootic
   virus. The host population in the area of sympatry was highly admixed,
   and skunks among allopatric and sympatric areas had similar effective
   population sizes. Spatial analysis indicated that landscape features
   had minimal influence on NCSK movement across the landscape, but those
   same features were partial barriers to the spread of SCSK. We conclude
   that NCSK and SCSK have different epidemiological properties that
   interact differently with both host and landscape features to influence
   rabies spread in the central Great Plains. We suggest a holistic
   approach for future studies of emerging infectious diseases that

Abstract = {{The repeated formation and loss of land-bridges during the Pleistocene
   have had lasting impacts on population genetic structure. In the
   tropics, where island populations persisted through multiple glacial
   cycles, alternating periods of isolation and contact are expected to
   have driven population and taxonomic divergence. Here, we combine
   mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data with microsatellites to dissect
   the impact of Pleistocene climate change on intra-specific
   diversification in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis. This taxon
   shows considerable morphological and acoustic variation: two parapatric
   subspecies (himalayanus and macrurus) occur on mainland China and a
   third (hainanus) on Hainan Island. Our phylogeographic reconstruction
   and coalescent analyses suggest the island subspecies formed from an
   ancestral population of himalayanus via two colonization events c. 800
   000 years before present. R. a. hainanus then recolonized the mainland,
   forming macrurus and thus a secondary contact zone with himalayanus.
   Finally, macrurus recolonized Hainan following the LGM. We found that
   all three biological events corresponded to known periods of
   land-bridge formation. Evidence of introgression was detected between
   macrurus and both its sister taxa, with geographical proximity rather
   than length of separation appearing to be the biggest determinant of
   subsequent genetic exchange. Our study highlights the important role of
   climate-mediated sea level changes have had in shaping current
   processes and patterns of population structure and taxonomic

Abstract = {{Detecting small amounts of genetic subdivision across geographic space
   remains a persistent challenge. Often a failure to detect genetic
   structure is mistaken for evidence of panmixia, when more powerful
   statistical tests may uncover evidence for subtle geographic
   differentiation. Such slight subdivision can be demographically and
   evolutionarily important as well as being critical for management
   decisions. We introduce here a method, called spatial analysis of
   shared alleles (SAShA), that detects geographically restricted alleles
   by comparing the spatial arrangement of allelic co-occurrences with the
   expectation under panmixia. The approach is allele-based and spatially
   explicit, eliminating the loss of statistical power that can occur with
   user-defined populations and statistical averaging within populations.
   Using simulated data sets generated under a stepping-stone model of
   gene flow, we show that this method outperforms spatial autocorrelation
   (SA) and UST under common real-world conditions: at relatively high
   migration rates when diversity is moderate or high, especially when
   sampling is poor. We then use this method to show clear differences in
   the genetic patterns of 2 nearshore Pacific mollusks, Tegula funebralis
   (5 Chlorostoma funebralis) and Katharina tunicata, whose overall
   patterns of within-species differentiation are similar according to
   traditional population genetics analyses. SAShA meaningfully
   complements UST/FST, SA, and other existing geographic genetic analyses
   and is especially appropriate for evaluating species with high gene
   flow and subtle genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The global migration patterns of influenza viruses have profound

Abstract = {{Studies on genetic connectivity are essential for the design of

   obtained nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial control region for
   117 individuals. Measures of haplotype diversity were relatively high.
   Pairwise population differentiation (F (ST)) was low, but not always
   non-significant. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed genetic
   differentiation between groups, when the data was partitioned into two
   groups consisting of samples from Mauritius and Tanzania in one group,
   and samples from Kenya and Seychelles in another group. Direction of
   gene flow was estimated using a Bayesian approach. Migration was
   sometimes asymmetric or directional, coinciding with the flow of major
   oceanic and coastal currents in the region. Mismatch distributions,
   based on the observed number of differences among haplotype pairs,
   produced a unimodal distribution, indicative of recent demographic
   expansion. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three clades without any
   geographic structure, suggesting recent migration between historically
   isolated lineages. We reconstructed the historical demography of S.
   ghobban and examined it in the context of Pleistocene climate stages

Abstract = {{Aim
   To elucidate the historical phylogeography of the dusky pipefish
   (Syngnathus floridae) in the North American Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
   ocean basins.
   Location
   Southern Atlantic Ocean and northern Gulf of Mexico within the
   continental United States.
   Methods
   A 394-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and a 235-bp
   fragment of the mitochondrial control region were analysed from
   individuals from 10 locations. Phylogenetic reconstruction, haplotype
   network, mismatch distributions and analysis of molecular variance were
   used to infer population structure between ocean basins and time from
   population expansion within ocean basins. Six microsatellite loci were
   also analysed to estimate population structure and gene flow among five
   populations using genetic distance methods (F-ST, Nei's genetic
   distance), isolation by distance (Mantel's test), coalescent-based
   estimates of genetic diversity and migration patterns, Bayesian cluster
   analysis and bottleneck simulations.
   Results
   Mitochondrial analyses revealed significant structuring between ocean
   basins in both cytochrome b (Theta(ST) = 0.361, P < 0.0001; Theta(CT) =
   0.312, P < 0.02) and control region (Theta(ST) = 0.166, P < 0.0001;
   Theta(CT) = 0.128, P < 0.03) sequences. However, phylogenetic
   reconstructions failed to show reciprocal monophyly in populations
   between ocean basins. Microsatellite analyses revealed significant
   population substructuring between all locations sampled except for the
   two locations that were in closest proximity to each other (global F-ST
   value = 0.026). Bayesian analysis of microsatellite data also revealed
   significant population structuring between ocean basins.
   Coalescent-based analyses of microsatellite data revealed low migration
   rates among all sites. Mismatch distribution analysis of mitochondrial
   loci supports a sudden population expansion in both ocean basins in the
   late Pleistocene, with the expansion of Atlantic populations occurring
   more recently.
   Main conclusions
   Present-day populations of S. floridae do not bear the mitochondrial
   DNA signature of the strong phylogenetic discontinuity between the
   Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America commonly observed in other
   species. Rather, our results suggest that Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
   populations of S. floridae are closely related but nevertheless exhibit
   local and regional population structure. We conclude that the
   present-day phylogeographic pattern is the result of a recent
   population expansion into the Atlantic in the late Pleistocene, and
   that life-history traits and ecology may play a pivotal role in shaping
   the realized geographical distribution pattern of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Most native red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the western contiguous United
   States appear to be climatically restricted to colder regions in the
   major mountain ranges and, in some areas, have suffered precipitous
   declines in abundance that may be linked to warming trends. However,
   another population of unknown origin has occurred in arid habitats in
   the Sacramento Valley of California well outside this narrow
   bioclimatic niche since at least 1880. If native, this population would
   be ecologically distinct among indigenous North American red foxes. We
   used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers from historical and
   modern samples (modes: 1910-1930 and 2000-2008, respectively) obtained
   throughout the western United States to determine the origins of the
   Sacramento Valley red fox, and assess the historical and modern
   connectivity and genetic effective population sizes of Sacramento
   Valley and montane red foxes. We found clear and consistent evidence
   supporting the indigenous origin of the Sacramento Valley population,
   including the phylogenetic positioning of the dominant, endemic mtDNA
   clade and microsatellite clustering of the Sacramento Valley population
   with the nearest montane population. Based on both mitochondrial and
   microsatellite AMOVAs, connectivity among Western populations of red
   foxes declined substantially between historical and modern time
   periods. Estimates based on temporal losses in gene diversity for both
   marker types suggest that both the Sierra Nevada (including the
   Southern Cascades population) and the Sacramento Valley populations
   have small genetic effective population sizes. Significant heterozygote
   excesses also indicate the occurrence of recent bottlenecks in these
   populations. Both substitutions distinguishing the 2 endemic Sacramento
   Valley haplotypes from the dominant montane haplotype were in the
   coding region and nonsynonymous, consistent with adaptive differences.
   These findings along with previously reported body size distinctions
   between Sacramento Valley and montane red foxes argue for distinct
   subspecific status for the Sacramento Valley red fox, for which we
   propose the designation V. v. patwin n. subsp. The small genetic
   effective population size estimates for the Sierra Nevada red fox and
   Sacramento Valley red fox are cause for concern, as is the possibility
   of genetic introgression into the latter population from an adjacent,
   recently established nonnative population.}},

Abstract = {{Population loss is often a harbinger of species extinction, but few
   opportunities exist to follow a species' demography and genetics
   through both time and space while this occurs. Previous research has
   shown that the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) was extirpated
   from most of its range over the past 200-800 years and that some of the
   extirpated populations had unique life history strategies. In this
   study, widespread availability of subfossils in the eastern Pacific
   allowed us to examine temporal changes in spatial genetic structure
   during massive population range contraction and partial recovery. We
   sequenced the mitochondrial control region from 40 ancient and 365
   modern samples and analyzed them through extensive simulations within a
   serial Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. These analyses
   suggest that the species maintained a high abundance, probably in
   subarctic refugia, that dispersal rates are likely 85\% per generation
   into new breeding colonies, and that population structure was not
   higher in the past. Despite substantial loss of breeding range, this
   species' high dispersal rates and refugia appear to have prevented a
   loss of genetic diversity. High dispersal rates also suggest that
   previous evidence for divergent life history strategies in ancient
   populations likely resulted from behavioral plasticity. Our results
   support the proposal that panmictic, or nearly panmictic, species with
   large ranges will be more resilient to future disturbance and
   environmental change. When appropriately verified, evidence of low
   population structure can be powerful information for conservation
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity at the S-locus controlling self-incompatibility (SI)
   is often high because of negative frequency-dependent selection. In
   species with highly patchy spatial distributions, genetic drift can
   overwhelm balancing selection and cause stochastic loss of S-alleles.
   Natural selection may favor the breakdown of SI in populations with few
   S-alleles because low S-allele diversity constrains the seed production
   of self-incompatible plants. We estimated S-allele diversity, effective
   population sizes, and migration rates in Leavenworthia alabamica, a
   self-incompatible mustard species restricted to discrete habitat
   patches in rocky glades. Patterns of polymorphism were investigated at
   the S-locus and 15 neutral microsatellites in three large and three
   small populations with 100-fold variation in glade size. Populations on
   larger glades maintained more S-alleles, but all populations were
   estimated to harbor at least 20 S-alleles, and mate availabilities
   typically exceeded 0.80, which is consistent with little mate
   limitation in nature. Estimates of the effective size (N-e) in each
   population ranged from 600 to 1600, and estimated rates of migration
   (m) ranged from 3 x 10-4 to nearly 1 x 10-3. According to theoretical
   models, there is limited opportunity for genetic drift to reduce
   S-allele diversity in populations with these attributes. Although
   pollinators or resources limit seed production in small glades, limited
   S-allele diversity does not appear to be a factor promoting the
   incipient breakdown of SI in populations of this species that were

Abstract = {{Ecological divergence may result when populations experience different
   selection regimes, but there is considerable discussion about the role
   of migration at the beginning stages of divergence before reproductive
   isolating mechanisms have evolved. However, detection of past migration
   is difficult in current populations and tools to differentiate genetic
   similarities due to migration versus recent common ancestry are only
   recently available. Using past volcanic eruption times as a framework,
   we combine morphological analyses of traits important to reproduction
   with a coalescent-based genetic analysis of two proximate sockeye
   salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations. We find that this is the most
   recent (similar to 500 years, 100 generations) natural ecological
   divergence recorded in a fish species, and report that this divergence
   is occurring despite migration. Although studies of fish divergence
   following the retreat of glaciers (10,000-15,000 years ago) have
   contributed extensively to our understanding of speciation, the
   Aniakchak system of sockeye salmon provides a rare example of the

Title = {{Nuclear gene phylogeography using PHASE: dealing with unresolved
   genotypes, lost alleles, and systematic bias in parameter estimation}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is
   to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate
   which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common
   practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the
   implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the
   haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of
   phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five
   non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular
   approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three
   key issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of
   inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations
   that drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of
   omitting unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic
   diversity and the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses.
   Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives
   (i.e., a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were
   incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with
   high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset,
   and genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were
   disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The
   standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream
   analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic
   diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with
   larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this
   causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic
   parameters.
   Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches
   for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic
   applications is essential. We outline practical approaches to
   mitigating potential impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction
   on phylogeographic inferences. With targeted application of laboratory
   procedures that enable unambiguous phase determination via physical
   isolation of alleles from diploid PCR products, relatively little
   investment of time and effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.}},

Abstract = {{The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is one of the
   most controversial threatened subspecies ever listed under the US
   Endangered Species Act. Despite protection of its remaining forest
   habitat, recent field studies show continued declines of northern
   spotted owls. One potential threat to northern spotted owls which has
   not yet been shown is loss of genetic variation from population
   bottlenecks. Bottlenecks can increase the probability of mating among
   related individuals, potentially causing inbreeding depression, and can
   decrease adaptive potential. Here we report evidence for recent
   bottlenecks in northern spotted owls using a large genetic dataset (352
   individuals and 10 microsatellite loci). The signature of bottlenecks
   was strongest in the Washington Cascade Mountains, in agreement with
   field data. Our results provide independent evidence that northern
   spotted owls have recently declined, and suggest that loss of genetic
   variation is an emerging threat to the subspecies' persistence. Reduced
   effective population size (N (e)) shown here in addition to field
   evidence for demographic decline highlights the increasing
   vulnerability of this bird to extinction.}},

Abstract = {{The sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, is a large, cosmopolitan,
   coastal species. Females are thought to show philopatry to nursery
   grounds while males potentially migrate long distances, creating an
   opportunity for male-mediated gene flow that may lead to discordance in
   patterns revealed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers.
   While this dynamic has been investigated in elasmobranchs over small
   spatial scales, it has not been examined at a global level. We examined
   patterns of historical phylogeography and contemporary gene flow by
   genotyping 329 individuals from nine locations throughout the species'
   range at eight nuclear microsatellite markers and sequencing the
   complete mtDNA control region. Pairwise comparisons often resulted in
   fixation indices and divergence estimates of greater magnitude using
   mtDNA sequence data than microsatellite data. In addition, multiple
   methods of estimation suggested fewer populations based on
   microsatellite loci than on mtDNA sequence data. Coalescent analyses
   suggest divergence and restricted migration among Hawaii, Taiwan,
   eastern and western Australia using mtDNA sequence data and no
   divergence and high migration rates, between Taiwan and both Australian
   sites using microsatellite data. Evidence of secondary contact was
   detected between several localities and appears to be discreet in time
   rather than continuous. Collectively, these data suggest complex
   spatial/temporal relationships between shark populations that may
   feature pulses of female dispersal and more continuous male-mediated
   gene flow.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jolis is a dominant fucoid seaweed
   occurring along sheltered, rocky shores throughout the North Atlantic
   (but not in the Pacific), where it is a foundational species of the
   intertidal community. Its large size and vulnerability to ice-scour
   have led to the hypothesis that contemporary populations in the
   north-west Atlantic may be the result of de novo recolonization from
   the north-east Atlantic since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (c. 20
   ka). We tested this hypothesis.
   Location
   Temperate North Atlantic rocky intertidal between c. 42 and 65 degrees
   N latitude.
   Methods
   More than 1300 individuals from 28 populations were sampled from across
   the entire range of A. nodosum and genotyped for six microsatellite
   loci, and > 500 individuals were genotyped for two mitochondrial loci,
   an intergenic spacer (IGS) and the tRNA (W) gene (trnW). Population
   structure and historical demography were analysed in a standard
   population genetics and coalescence framework.
   Results
   Based on the presence of private alleles and haplotypes, we found that
   A. nodosum has survived on both sides of the Atlantic (since before the
   LGM, dating back to at least the penultimate Eemian interglacial) with
   similar effective population sizes and divergence times (1.2 and 0.8
   Ma). Dispersal has been predominantly from Europe to North America, and
   there is very weak present-day population differentiation across the
   North Atlantic. Diversity measures provided additional support for
   determining the location of refugia.
   Main conclusions
   Ascophyllum nodosum was apparently little affected by the LGM, although
   contemporary climate change is likely to have major effects on its
   latitudinal distribution on both sides of the North Atlantic. It is a
   very long-lived species, analogous in virtually all demographic aspects
   to a tree - resistant to extinction but vulnerable to catastrophic
   events. The Brittany peninsula is a hotspot of genetic diversity worthy
   of conservation.}},

   Morphological and molecular analyses reveal separations among

   oceanic populations of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) occur in
   the southern East China Sea. The distributions of the larval stages of
   these populations provide a bases for subdividing anchovy into 3
   spatiotemporal stocks for the management of local Taiwanese fisheries:
   spring coastal (sprW) and oceanic (sprE) stocks respectively in the
   western and eastern seas of Taiwan, and an autumn stock (autE) in Ilan
   Bay, northeastern Taiwan. Using larval morphological analyses to
   evaluate population similarities, we found subtle differences between
   the sprE and sprW geographic stocks, but strong intra-geographic
   differences between sprE and autE seasonal stocks. Molecular analyses,
   based on fragments of 740 bp (positions 200-939) of the mitochondrial
   DNA cytochrome b gene, revealed a substantial amount of genetic
   variations among populations. Analysis of molecular variance indicated
   significant differences among stocks, primarily due to the sympatric
   contrast between sprE and autE (F-ST = 0.073, p < 0.001), rather than
   due to geographic subdivisions, such as sprE vs. sprW (F-ST = 0.039) or
   sprW vs. autE (F-ST = 0.007). These results indicate the presence of a
   unique oceanic stock in eastern Taiwan in spring that is separated from
   the other populations. This spatiotemporal heterogeneity suggests a
   dynamic state of larval recruitment along the coast of northern Taiwan.
   We propose a dispersal route for larval anchovy from the Taiwan Strait
   to the northern coast, or active migration by adult anchovies in
   accordance with oceanographic patterns in the southern East China Sea.

Abstract = {{Understanding the influence of habitat alteration on population
   structure and persistence is critical for effective conservation
   strategies. Timber harvest and wildfire are two of the most prevalent
   disturbances across temperate forests, yet the long-term effects of
   these two forces on population connectivity have rarely been studied.
   We studied populations of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus
   montanus) across landscapes that have experienced either timber harvest
   or broad scale fires. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs generally require
   forested habitat, and are a species of concern in managed forests. We
   used landscape genetic techniques to test the explanatory power of
   alternative paths of connectivity across both burned and harvested
   forests and identified topographical and climatic variables that
   significantly influenced gene flow. We found that timber harvest and
   fire led to different patterns of genetic connectivity. Widespread
   terrestrial gene flow was maintained across previously burned areas and
   connectivity was primarily limited by solar radiation. In contrast,
   gene flow among populations in managed forests followed riparian
   corridors, presumably to avoid the loss of cover due to timber harvest.
   Gene flow along riparian corridors in Rocky Mountain tailed frogs
   differs from a population of the closely related coastal tailed frog
   (Ascaphus truei), for which gene flow appears to occur primarily over
   land. These results suggest management of Rocky Mountain tailed frogs
   should focus on maintaining riparian buffer zones, which may be less
   effective for the coastal species. Thus, consideration of landscape
   differences is essential even for conservation of closely related,
   morphologically similar species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Mediterranean basin}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite its key location between the rest of the continent
   and Europe, research on the phylogeography of north African species
   remains very limited compared to European and North American taxa. The
   Mediterranean land mollusc Cornu aspersum (= Helix aspersa) is part of
   the few species widely sampled in north Africa for biogeographical
   analysis. It then provides an excellent biological model to understand
   phylogeographical patterns across the Mediterranean basin, and to
   evaluate hypotheses of population differentiation. We investigated here
   the phylogeography of this land snail to reassess the evolutionary
   scenario we previously considered for explaining its scattered
   distribution in the western Mediterranean, and to help to resolve the
   question of the direction of its range expansion ( from north Africa to
   Europe or vice versa). By analysing simultaneously individuals from 73
   sites sampled in its putative native range, the present work provides
   the first broad-scale screening of mitochondrial variation (cyt b and
   16S rRNA genes) of C. aspersum.
   Results: Phylogeographical structure mirrored previous patterns
   inferred from anatomy and nuclear data, since all haplotypes could be
   ascribed to a B ( West) or a C ( East) lineage. Alternative migration
   models tested confirmed that C. aspersum most likely spread from north
   Africa to Europe. In addition to Kabylia in Algeria, which would have
   been successively a centre of dispersal and a zone of secondary
   contacts, we identified an area in Galicia where genetically distinct
   west and east type populations would have regained contact.
   Conclusions: Vicariant and dispersal processes are reviewed and
   discussed in the light of signatures left in the geographical
   distribution of the genetic variation. In referring to Mediterranean
   taxa which show similar phylogeographical patterns, we proposed a
   parsimonious scenario to account for the ``east-west{''} genetic
   splitting and the northward expansion of the western ( B) clade which
   roughly involves (i) the dispersal of ancestral ( eastern) types
   through Oligocene terranes in the Western Mediterranean (ii) the Tell
   Atlas orogenesis as gene flow barrier between future west and east
   populations, (iii) the impact of recurrent climatic fluctuations from
   mid-Pliocene to the last ice age, (iv) the loss of the eastern lineage
   during Pleistocene northwards expansion phases.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Yakuts contrast strikingly with other populations from
   Siberia due to their cattle- and horse-breeding economy as well as
   their Turkic language. On the basis of ethnological and linguistic
   criteria as well as population genetic studies, it has been assumed
   that they originated from South Siberian populations. However, many
   questions regarding the origins of this intriguing population still
   need to be clarified ( e. g. the precise origin of paternal lineages
   and the admixture rate with indigenous populations). This study
   attempts to better understand the origins of the Yakuts by performing
   genetic analyses on 58 mummified frozen bodies dated from the 15(th) to
   the 19(th) century, excavated from Yakutia ( Eastern Siberia).
   Results: High quality data were obtained for the autosomal STRs,
   Y-chromosomal STRs and SNPs and mtDNA due to exceptional sample
   preservation. A comparison with the same markers on seven museum
   specimens excavated 3 to 15 years ago showed significant differences in
   DNA quantity and quality. Direct access to ancient genetic data from
   these molecular markers combined with the archaeological evidence,
   demographical studies and comparisons with 166 contemporary individuals
   from the same location as the frozen bodies helped us to clarify the
   microevolution of this intriguing population.
   Conclusion: We were able to trace the origins of the male lineages to a
   small group of horse-riders from the Cis-Baikal area. Furthermore,
   mtDNA data showed that intermarriages between the first settlers with
   Evenks women led to the establishment of genetic characteristics during
   the 15(th) century that are still observed today.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of contemporary populations can be shaped by both

   differentiation in northern European nine-spined sticklebacks
   (Pungitius pungitius), using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 12
   nuclear microsatellite and insertion/deletion loci. The mtDNA analyses
   identified - and microsatellite analyses supported - the existence of
   two historically distinct lineages (eastern and western). The analyses
   of nuclear loci among 51 European sites revealed clear historically
   influenced and to minor degree habitat dependent, patterns of genetic
   diversity and differentiation. While the effect of habitat type on the
   levels of genetic variation (coastal > freshwater) and differentiation
   (freshwater > coastal) was clear, the levels of genetic variability and
   differentiation in the freshwater sites were independent of habitat
   type (viz. river, lake and pond). However, levels of genetic
   variability, together with estimates of historical effective population
   sizes, decreased dramatically and linearly with increasing latitude.
   These geographical patterns of genetic variability and differentiation
   suggest that the contemporary genetic structure of freshwater
   nine-spined sticklebacks has been strongly impacted by the founder
   events associated with postglacial colonization and less by current
   ecological conditions (cf. habitat type). In general, the results
   highlight the strong and persistent effects of postglacial colonization
   history on genetic structuring of northern European fauna and provide
   an unparalleled example of latitudinal trends in levels of genetic

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that limit recombination in bacteria is
   critical in order to better understand and assess its effects on
   genetic variation and bacterial population genetic structure.
   Transformation in the naturally competent bacterium, Streptococcus
   pneumoniae, is regulated by a polymorphic competence (com) apparatus.
   It has been suggested that polymorphic types, called pherotypes,
   generate and maintain subpopulation genetic structure within this
   species. We test predictions stemming from this hypothesis using a
   cosmopolitan sample of clinical pneumococcal isolates. We sequenced the
   locus encoding the peptide that induces competence (comC) to assign
   clones to each known pherotype class and then used multilocus sequence
   typing to determine whether there is significant genetic
   differentiation between pherotypes subgroups. We find two dominant
   pherotypes within our sample, and both are maintained at high
   frequencies (CSP1 74\%, CSP2 26\%). Our analyses fail to detect
   significant genetic differentiation between pherotype groups and find
   strong evidence, from a coalescent analysis, for interpherotype
   recombination. In addition, our analyses indicate that positive
   selection may account for the maintenance of the fixed polymorphism in
   this locus (comC). Altogether, these results fail to support the
   prediction that the polymorphism in the competence system acts to limit
   recombination within S. pneumoniae populations. We discuss why this
   result is expected given the mechanism underlying transformation and
   outline a scenario to explain the evolution of polymorphism in the

Abstract = {{Species delimitation has long been a difficult and controversial
   process, and different operational criteria often lead to different
   results. In particular, investigators using phenotypic vs. molecular
   data to delineate species may recognize different boundaries,
   especially if morphologically or ecologically differentiated
   populations have only recently diverged. Here we examine the genetic
   relationship between the widespread sunflower species Helianthus
   petiolaris and its narrowly distributed sand dune endemic sister
   species H. neglectus using sequence data from nine nuclear loci. The
   two species were initially described as distinct based on a number of
   minor morphological differences, somewhat different ecological
   tolerances, and at least one chromosomal rearrangement distinguishing
   them; but detailed molecular data has not been available until now. We
   find that, consistent with previous work, H. petiolaris is
   exceptionally genetically diverse. Surprisingly, H. neglectus harbors
   very similar levels of genetic diversity (average diversity across loci
   is actually slightly higher in H. neglectus). It is extremely unlikely
   that such a geographically restricted species could maintain these
   levels of genetic variation in isolation. In addition, the two species
   show very little evidence of any genetic divergence, and estimates of
   interspecific gene flow are comparable to gene flow estimates among
   regions within H. petiolaris. These results indicate that H. petiolaris
   and H. neglectus likely do not represent two distinct, isolated gene
   pools; H. neglectus is probably more accurately thought of as a
   geographically restricted, morphologically and ecologically distinct
   subspecies of H. petiolaris rather than a separate species.}},

   bottlenecks with associated founder effects, probably due to cold
   winter environments in Europe that limit reproduction to a short part

   probably dependent on immigration from other areas, including Africa.
   South African populations have low but measurable gene flow with Europe

   inappropriate for the analysis of phylogeographic data. These papers
   further argue that Nested Clade Phylogeographic Analysis (NCPA) offers
   the best approach in statistical phylogeography. In order to remove the
   confusion and misconceptions introduced by these papers, we justify and
   explain the reasoning behind model-based inference. We argue that ABC
   is a statistically valid approach, alongside other computational
   statistical techniques that have been successfully used to infer
   parameters and compare models in population genetics. We also examine
   the NCPA method and highlight numerous deficiencies, either when used
   with single or multiple loci. We further show that the ages of clades
   are carelessly used to infer ages of demographic events, that these
   ages are estimated under a simple model of panmixia and population
   stationarity but are then used under different and unspecified models
   to test hypotheses, a usage the invalidates these testing procedures.
   We conclude by encouraging researchers to study and use model-based
   inference in population genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Although the sexual transfer of genetic material between species (i.e.
   introgression) has been documented in many groups of plants and
   animals, genome-wide patterns of introgression are poorly understood.
   Is most of the genome permeable to interspecific gene flow, or is
   introgression typically restricted to a handful of genomic regions?
   Here, we assess the genomic extent and direction of introgression
   between three sunflowers from the south-central USA: the common
   sunflower, Helianthus annuus ssp. annuus; a near-endemic to Texas,
   Helianthus debilis ssp. cucumerifolius; and their putative hybrid
   derivative, thought to have recently colonized Texas, H. annuus ssp.
   texanus. Analyses of variation at 88 genetically mapped microsatellite
   loci revealed that long-term migration rates were high, genome-wide and
   asymmetric, with higher migration rates from H. annuus texanus into the
   two parental taxa than vice versa. These results imply a longer history
   of intermittent contact between H. debilis and H. annuus than
   previously believed, and that H. annuus texanus may serve as a bridge
   for the transfer of alleles between its parental taxa. They also
   contradict recent theory suggesting that introgression should
   predominantly be in the direction of the colonizing species. As in
   previous studies of hybridizing sunflower species, regions of genetic
   differentiation appear small, whether estimated in terms of FST or
   unidirectional migration rates. Estimates of recent immigration and
   admixture were inconsistent, depending on the type of analysis. At the
   individual locus level, one marker showed striking asymmetry in
   migration rates, a pattern consistent with tight linkage to a
   Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{Methods developed over the past decade have made it possible to
   estimate molecular demographic parameters such as effective population
   size, divergence time, and gene flow with unprecedented accuracy and
   precision. However, they make simplifying assumptions about certain
   aspects of the species' histories and the nature of the genetic data,
   and it is not clear how robust they are to violations of these
   assumptions. Here, we use simulated data sets to examine the effects of
   a number of violations of the ``Isolation with Migration{''} (IM)
   model, including intralocus recombination, population structure, gene
   flow from an unsampled species, linkage among loci, and divergent
   selection, on demographic parameter estimates made using the program
   IMA. We also examine the effect of having data that fit a nucleotide
   substitution model other than the two relatively simple models
   available in IMA. We find that IMA estimates are generally quite robust
   to small to moderate violations of the IM model assumptions, comparable
   with what is often encountered in real-world scenarios. In particular,
   population structure within species, a condition encountered to some
   degree in virtually all species, has little effect on parameter
   estimates even for fairly high levels of structure. Likewise, most
   parameter estimates are robust to significant levels of recombination
   when data sets are pared down to apparently nonrecombining blocks,
   although substantial bias is introduced to several estimates when the
   entire data set with recombination is included. In contrast, a poor fit
   to the nucleotide substitution model can result in an increased error
   rate, in some cases due to a predictable bias and in other cases due to
   an increase in variance in parameter estimates among data sets
   simulated under the same conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of genetic variation of Albinaria caerulea, a land snail that
   was probably transported by humans to Vravrona (Attica, Greece), were
   analysed using the mitochondrial ATPase8 gene. The analysis of
   molecular variance indicated significant local differentiation at the
   subpopulation level. This considerable population subdivision and
   genetic differentiation in a short time is possibly related to life
   history and population structure of the species. The population
   structure and demographic history suggest a recent single colonization
   event, by a single or a few lineages, at the first site inhabited by
   humans in Vravrona (about 5,000 years before present). This was
   followed by population expansion and subsequent intra-colonization
   events (accompanied by bottlenecks) to more recently inhabited sites.
   The estimated small effective population size/census population size
   ratio further implies considerable population fluctuations. Bayesian
   inference and statistical parsimony analyses indicate that the
   population of Vravrona is associated with a species subgroup which

Abstract = {{In heterogeneous landscapes, divergent selection can favor the
   evolution of locally adapted ecotypes, especially when interhabitat
   gene flow is minimal. However, if habitats differ in size or quality,
   source-sink dynamics can shape evolutionary trajectories. Upland and
   bottomland forests of the southeastern USA differ in water table depth,
   light availability, edaphic conditions, and plant community. We
   conducted a multiyear reciprocal transplant experiment to test whether
   Elliott's blueberry (Vaccinium elliottii) is locally adapted to these
   contrasting environments. Additionally, we exposed seedlings and
   cuttings to prolonged drought and flooding in the greenhouse to assess
   fitness responses to abiotic stress. Contrary to predictions of local
   adaptation, V. elliottii families exhibited significantly higher
   survivorship and growth in upland than in bottomland forests and under
   drought than flooded conditions, regardless of habitat of origin.
   Neutral population differentiation was minimal, suggesting widespread
   interhabitat migration. Population density, reproductive output, and
   genetic diversity were all significantly greater in uplands than in
   bottomlands. These disparities likely result in asymmetric gene flow
   from uplands to bottomlands. Thus, adaptation to a marginal habitat can
   be constrained by small populations, limited fitness, and immigration
   from a benign habitat. Our study highlights the importance of
   demography and genetic diversity in the evolution of local
   (mal)adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{We used demographic, spatial, and microsatellite data to assess
   fine-scale genetic structure in Ethiopian wolves found in the Bale
   Mountains and evaluated the impact of historical versus recent
   demographic processes on genetic variation. We applied several
   analytical methods, assuming equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions,
   to assess demography and genetic structure. Genetic variation (H-E =
   0.584-0.607, allelic richness = 4.2-4.3) was higher than previously
   reported for this species and genetic structure was influenced by
   geography and social structure. Statistically significant F-ST values
   (0.06-0.08) implied differentiation among subpopulations. STRUCTURE
   analyses showed that neighbouring packs often have shared coancestry
   and spatial autocorrelation showed higher genetic similarity between
   individuals within packs and between individuals in neighbouring packs
   compared to random pairs of individuals. Recent effective population
   sizes were lower than 2n (where n is the number of packs) and lower
   than the number of breeding individuals with Ne/N ratios near 0.20. All
   subpopulations have experienced bottlenecks, one occurring due to a
   rabies outbreak in 2003. Nevertheless, differentiation among these
   subpopulations is consistent with long-term migration rates and
   fragmentation at the end of the Pleistocene. Enhanced drift due to
   population bottlenecks may be countered by higher migration into
   disease-affected subpopulations. Contemporary factors such as social
   structure and population bottlenecks are clearly influencing the level

Abstract = {{The Yarkand hare, Lepus yarkandensis, is an endemic, endangered species
   restricted to the Tarim Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
   China. The Yarkand hare is distributed in scattered oases which are
   physically isolated by the desert. Its natural fragmentation habitat
   makes it an ideal object for studying effect of habitat fragmentation
   on its genetic structure. To evaluate the effects of habitat
   fragmentation on genetic diversity of the species, we assessed genetic
   diversity for 20 sampling populations based on control region and Cytb
   markers. Relatively low levels of gene diversity are found in most of
   isolated populations in the southern margin of the Taklamakan Desert.
   Furthermore, a positive correlation is found between gene diversity and
   the size of historical effective population. Significant genetic
   differentiation is detected among most populations by pairwise F-ST
   analyses, which is characterized by an isolation by distance pattern.
   Additionally, the AMOVA results show highly significant population
   structure among seven geographical groups. High migration rates are
   found among continuous populations, while very low levels of migration
   rates are found among the relatively isolated populations, suggesting
   that the desert may make an effective barrier against gene flow.
   Finally, the control region shows four clades by the phylogenetic
   analyses, three of which are present in nearly all sampling
   populations. The observed pattern of the lineage mixing, also shown by
   the Cytb data, may be caused by extensive gene flow among populations,
   and could be explained by possible demographical expansion of the
   Yarkand hare during the late Pleistocene interglacial period.}},

Abstract = {{Sharp declines in population size, known as genetic bottlenecks,

   threatening population sustainability in both short- and long-term. We
   evaluated the presence, severity and approximate time of bottlenecks in
   34 European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) populations covering the
   majority of the species distribution using microsatellite markers. We
   identified footprints of population decline in all grayling populations
   using the M ratio test. In contrast to earlier simulation studies
   assuming isolated populations, forward simulations allowing low levels
   of migration demonstrated that bottleneck footprints measured using the
   M ratio can persist within small populations much longer (up to
   thousands of generations) than previously anticipated. Using a
   coalescence approach, the beginning of population reduction was dated
   back to 1,000-10,000 years ago which suggests that the extremely low M
   ratio in European grayling is most likely caused by the last glaciation
   and subsequent post-glacial recolonization processes. In contrast to
   the M ratio, two alternative methods for bottleneck detection
   identified more recent bottlenecks in six populations and thus, from a
   conservation perspective, these populations warrant future monitoring.
   Based on a single time-point analysis using approximate Bayesian
   computation methodology, all grayling populations exhibited very small
   effective population sizes with the majority of Ne estimates below 50.
   Taken together, our results demonstrate the predominate role of genetic

   emphasize the importance of gene flow counteracting the effects of
   genetic drift and loss of variation over longer evolutionary timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Security infrastructure along international boundaries threatens to
   degrade connectivity for wildlife. To explore potential effects of a
   fence under construction along the U.S.-Mexico border on wildlife, we
   assessed movement behavior of two species with different life histories
   whose regional persistence may depend on transboundary movements. We
   used radiotelemetry to assess how vegetation and landscape structure
   affect flight and natal dispersal behaviors of Ferruginous Pygmy-Owls
   (Glaucidium brasilianum), and satellite telemetry, gene-flow estimates,
   and least-cost path models to assess movement behavior and
   interpopulation connectivity of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis
   mexicana). Flight height of Pygmy-Owls averaged only 1.4 m (SE 0.1)
   above ground, and only 23\% of flights exceeded 4 m. Juvenile
   Pygmy-Owls dispersed at slower speeds, changed direction more, and had
   lower colonization success in landscapes with larger vegetation
   openings or higher levels of disturbance (p <= 0.047), which suggests
   large vegetation gaps coupled with tall fences may limit transboundary
   movements. Female bighorn sheep crossed valleys up to 4.9 km wide, and
   microsatellite analyses indicated relatively high levels of gene flow
   and migration (95\% CI for F-ST = 0.010-0.115, Nm = 1.9-24.8, M =
   10.4-15.4) between populations divided by an 11-km valley. Models of
   gene flow based on regional topography and movement barriers suggested
   that nine populations of bighorn sheep in northwestern Sonora are
   linked by dispersal with those in neighboring Arizona. Disruption of
   transboundary movement corridors by impermeable fencing would isolate
   some populations on the Arizona side. Connectivity for other species
   with similar movement abilities and spatial distributions may be
   affected by border development, yet mitigation strategies could address
   needs of wildlife and humans.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the impact of history on selection and genetic structure at

   complex (MHC) variability in two sympatric species of ctenomyid rodents
   with different demographic backgrounds. Although Ctenomys talarum has
   experienced a stable demographic history, Ctenomys australis has
   undergone a recent demographic expansion. Accordingly, we predicted
   that MHC allele frequency distributions should be more skewed,
   differences between coding and noncoding regions should be less
   pronounced, and evidence of current selection on MHC loci should be
   reduced in C. australis relative to C. talarum. To test these
   predictions, we compared variation at the MHC class II DRB and DQA
   genes with that at multiple neutral markers, including DQA intron 2,
   the mitochondrial control region, and 8-12 microsatellite loci. These
   analyses supported the first two of our predictions but indicated that
   estimates of selection (based on omega-values) were greater for C.
   australis. Further exploration of these data, however, revealed
   differences in the time frames over which selection appears to have
   acted on each species, with evidence of contemporary selection on MHC
   loci being limited to C. talarum. Collectively, these findings indicate
   that demographic history can substantially influence genetic structure
   at functional loci and that the effects of history on selection may be

Abstract = {{Approximately 20 years ago, Avise and colleagues proposed the
   integration of phylogenetics and population genetics for investigating
   the connection between micro- and macroevolutionary phenomena. The new
   field was termed phylogeography. Since the naming of the field, the
   statistical rigor of phylogeography has increased, in large part due to
   concurrent advances in coalescent theory which enabled model-based
   parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The next phase will
   involve phylogeography increasingly becoming the integrative and
   comparative multi-taxon endeavor that it was originally conceived to
   be. This exciting convergence will likely involve combining
   spatially-explicit multiple taxon coalescent models, genomic studies of
   natural selection, ecological niche modeling, studies of ecological
   speciation, community assembly and functional trait evolution. This
   ambitious synthesis will allow us to determine the causal links between
   geography, climate change, ecological interactions and the evolution
   and composition of taxa across whole communities and assemblages.
   Although such integration presents analytical and computational
   challenges that will only be intensified by the growth of genomic data

   approximate Bayesian methods should permit parameter estimation and
   hypotheses testing using complex evolutionary demographic models and
   genomic phylogeographic data. We first review the conceptual beginnings
   of phylogeography and its accomplishments and then illustrate how it

   rise of coalescent theory. Subsequently, we discuss ways in which
   model-based phylogeography can interface with various subfields to
   become one of the most integrative fields in all of ecology and

Abstract = {{Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic
   diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North
   America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity
   have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Pleistocene for the
   Qinghai-Tibetan (Tibetan) plateau, a region where glaciation was not
   synchronous with the North Hemisphere ice sheet maxima, remains poorly
   understood. Here, we compared the phylogeographical patterns of five
   avian species on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau by three mitochondrial DNA
   fragments: the Tibetan snow finch (Montifringilla adamsi), the
   Blanford's snow finch (Pyrgilauda blanfordi), the horned lark
   (Eremophila alpestris), the twite (Carduelis flavirostris) and the
   black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). Our results revealed the three
   species mostly distributed on the platform region of the plateau that
   experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive
   glaciation period (0.5-0.175 Ma). These results are at odds with the
   results from avian species of Europe and North America, where
   population expansions occurred after Last Glacial Maximum (LGM,
   0.023-0.018 Ma). A single refugium was identified in a restricted
   semi-continuous area around the eastern margin of the plateau, instead
   of multiple independent refugia for European and North American
   species. For the other two species distributed on the edges of the
   plateau (the twite and black redstart), populations were maintained at
   stable levels. Edge areas are located on the eastern margin, which
   might have had little or no ice cover during the glaciation period.
   Thus, milder climate may have mitigated demographic stresses for edge
   species relative to the extremes experienced by platform counterparts,
   the present-day ranges of which were heavily ice covered during the
   glaciation period. Finally, various behavioural and ecological
   characteristics, including dispersal capacities, habitat preference and
   altitude specificity along with evolutionary history might have helped
   to shape different phylogeographical structures appearing in these five
   species.}},

   significant vicariance-driven structuring and occasional admixture
   within this taxon. In eastern lowland gorillas, the high frequency of
   hybrid phenotypes is surprising, suggesting that this region represents
   a zone of introgression between eastern gorillas and migrants from the
   west, and underscoring the conservation priority of this critically
   endangered group. These results highlight the complex nature of
   evolutionary divergence in this genus, indicate that historical gene
   flow has played a major role in structuring gorilla diversity, and
   demonstrate that our understanding of the evolutionary processes
   responsible for shaping biodiversity can benefit immensely from
   consideration of morphological and molecular data in conjunction.}},

Title = {{A simple method for estimating genetic diversity in large populations
   from finite sample sizes}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sample size is one of the critical factors affecting the
   accuracy of the estimation of population genetic diversity parameters.
   Small sample sizes often lead to significant errors in determining the
   allelic richness, which is one of the most important and commonly used
   estimators of genetic diversity in populations. Correct estimation of
   allelic richness in natural populations is challenging since they often
   do not conform to model assumptions. Here, we introduce a simple and
   robust approach to estimate the genetic diversity in large natural
   populations based on the empirical data for finite sample sizes.
   Results: We developed a non-linear regression model to infer genetic
   diversity estimates in large natural populations from finite sample
   sizes. The allelic richness values predicted by our model were in good
   agreement with those observed in the simulated data sets and the true
   allelic richness observed in the source populations. The model has been
   validated using simulated population genetic data sets with different
   evolutionary scenarios implied in the simulated populations, as well as
   large microsatellite and allozyme experimental data sets for four
   conifer species with contrasting patterns of inherent genetic diversity
   and mating systems. Our model was a better predictor for allelic
   richness in natural populations than the widely-used Ewens sampling
   formula, coalescent approach, and rarefaction algorithm.
   Conclusions: Our regression model was capable of accurately estimating
   allelic richness in natural populations regardless of the species and
   marker system. This regression modeling approach is free from
   assumptions and can be widely used for population genetic and
   conservation applications.}},

   Asia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Venturia inaequalis is an ascomycete fungus responsible for apple scab,
   a disease that has invaded almost all apple growing regions worldwide,
   with the corresponding adverse effects on apple production. Monitoring
   and predicting the effectiveness of intervention strategies require
   knowledge of the origin, introduction pathways, and population biology
   of pathogen populations. Analysis of the variation of genetic markers
   using the inferential framework of population genetics offers the
   potential to retrieve this information. Methodology/Principal Findings.
   Here, we present a population genetic analysis of microsatellite
   variation in 1,273 strains of V. inaequalis representing 28 orchard
   samples from seven regions in five continents. Analysis of molecular
   variance revealed that most of the variation (88\%) was distributed
   within localities, which is consistent with extensive historical
   migrations of the fungus among and within regions. Despite this shallow
   population structure, clustering analyses partitioned the data set into
   separate groups corresponding roughly to geography, indicating that
   each region hosts a distinct population of the fungus. Comparison of
   the levels of variability among populations, along with coalescent
   analyses of migration models and estimates of genetic distances, was
   consistent with a scenario in which the fungus emerged in Central Asia,
   where apple was domesticated, before its introduction into Europe and,
   more recently, into other continents with the expansion of apple
   growing. Across the novel range, levels of variability pointed to
   multiple introductions and all populations displayed signatures of
   significant post-introduction increases in population size. Most
   populations exhibited high genotypic diversity and random association
   of alleles across loci, indicating recombination both in native and
   introduced areas. Conclusions/Significance. Venturia inaequalis is a
   model of invasive phytopathogenic fungus that has now reached the
   ultimate stage of the invasion process with a broad geographic
   distribution and well-established populations displaying high genetic
   variability, regular sexual reproduction, and demographic expansion.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Natural populations of known detailed past demographic history are
   extremely valuable to evaluate methods of historical inference, yet are
   extremely rare. As an alternative approach, we have generated multiple
   replicate microsatellite data sets from laboratory-cultured populations
   of a gonochoric free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis remanei, that were
   constrained to pre-defined demographic histories featuring different
   levels of migration among populations or bottleneck events of different
   magnitudes. These data sets were then used to evaluate the performances
   of two recently developed population genetics methods, BAYESASS+, that
   estimates recent migration rates among populations, and BOTTLENECK,
   that detects the occurrence of recent bottlenecks. Migration rates
   inferred by BAYESASS+ were generally over-estimates, although these
   were often included within the confidence interval. Analyses of data
   sets simulated in-silico, using a model mimicking the laboratory
   experiments, produced less biased estimates of the migration rates, and
   showed increased efficiency of the program when the number of loci and
   sampled genotypes per population was higher. In the replicates for
   which the prebottleneck laboratory-cultured populations did not
   significantly depart from a mutation/drift equilibrium, an important
   assumption of the program BOTTLENECK, only a portion of the bottleneck
   events were detected. This result was confirmed by in-silico
   simulations mirroring the laboratory bottleneck experiments. More
   generally, our study demonstrates the feasibility, and highlights some
   of the limits, of the approach that consists in generating molecular
   genetic data sets by controlling the evolution of laboratory-reared
   nematode populations, for the purpose of validating methods inferring
   population history.}},

   Mammal, the Large Treeshrew (Tupaia tana)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Female-biased dispersal (FBD) is predicted to occur in
   monogamous species due to local resource competition among females, but
   evidence for this association in mammals is scarce. The predicted
   relationship between FBD and monogamy may also be too simplistic, given
   that many pair-living mammals exhibit substantial extra-pair paternity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: I examined whether dispersal and gene
   flow are female-biased in the large treeshrew (Tupaia tana) in Borneo,
   a behaviorally monogamous species with a genetic mating system
   characterized by high rates (50\%) of extra-pair paternity. Genetic
   analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for
   FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for
   adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci,
   indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants.
   Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs.
   Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of
   migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic
   markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana. The
   effective number of migrants between populations estimated from
   mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number
   estimated using autosomal microsatellites.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results provide the first evidence of
   FBD in a behaviorally monogamous species without mating fidelity. I
   argue that competition among females for feeding territories creates a
   sexual asymmetry in the costs and benefits of dispersal in treeshrews.}},

   Genetic Diversity and Differentiation Can Fuel Conservation Programs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is the largest Neotropical
   bird of prey and is threatened by human persecution and habitat loss
   and fragmentation. Current conservation strategies include local
   education, captive rearing and reintroduction, and protection or
   creation of trans-national habitat blocks and corridors. Baseline
   genetic data prior to reintroduction of captive-bred stock is essential
   for guiding such efforts but has not been gathered previously.
   Methodology/Findings: We assessed levels of genetic diversity,
   population structure and demographic history for harpy eagles using
   samples collected throughout a large portion of their geographic
   distribution in Central America (n = 32) and South America (n = 31).
   Based on 417 bp of mitochondrial control region sequence data,
   relatively high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were
   estimated for both Central and South America, although haplotype
   diversity was significantly higher for South America. Historical
   restriction of gene flow across the Andes (i.e. between our Central and
   South American subgroups) is supported by coalescent analyses, the
   haplotype network and significant F-ST values, however reciprocally
   monophyletic lineages do not correspond to geographical locations in
   maximum likelihood analyses. A sudden population expansion for South
   America is indicated by a mismatch distribution analysis, and further
   supported by significant (p<0.05) negative values of Fu and Li's D-F
   and F, and Fu's F-S. This expansion, estimated at approximately 60 000
   years BP (99 000-36 000 years BP 95\% CI), encompasses a transition
   from a warm and dry time period prior to 50 000 years BP to an interval
   of maximum precipitation (50 000-36 000 years BP). Notably, this time
   period precedes the climatic and habitat changes associated with the
   last glacial maximum. In contrast, a multimodal distribution of
   haplotypes was observed for Central America suggesting either
   population equilibrium or a recent decline.
   Significance: High levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity in
   combination with genetic differentiation among subgroups within regions
   and between regions highlight the importance of local population
   conservation in order to preserve maximal levels of genetic diversity
   in this species. Evidence of historically restricted female-mediated
   gene flow is an important consideration for captive-breeding programs.}},

Abstract = {{We compared morphology and sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial genes
   from 11 populations of a previously genetically unstudied ``Baja
   California disjunct{''} species, the diamond turbot (Hypsopsetta
   guttulata). This species exhibits very limited adult movement and
   restriction to soft-bottom habitats but has a moderately long pelagic
   larval duration. Therefore, if pelagic larval duration is correlated
   with gene flow between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we
   expect a reduced level of genetic and morphological differentiation.
   However, if adult habitat and ecology have more effect on gene flow, we
   expect the populations in the two bodies of water to be more highly
   differentiated. We used logistic regression to compare morphological
   features and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to compare
   nucleotide sequence data. Gulf of California H. guttulata are different
   from Pacific populations in morphology and both mitochondrial and
   nuclear gene sequences. MtDNA shows reciprocal monophyly, and nuclear
   sequences from the Gulf of California formed a monophyletic group.
   Population genetic analyses also suggest further population subdivision
   within the Pacific and within the Gulf of California. We argue that
   adult ecology has a significant effect on migration rates among
   populations in the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California.}},

Abstract = {{The marine environment provides an opportunity to examine population
   structure in species with high dispersal capabilities and often no
   obvious barriers to genetic exchange. In coastal waters of the western
   North Atlantic, common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, are a
   highly mobile species with a continuous distribution from New York to

   geographic barriers to movement in this region result in a large
   panmictic population. Mitochondrial control region sequences and 18
   microsatellite loci indicate dolphins are partitioning the habitat both
   latitudinally and longitudinally. A minimum of five genetically
   differentiated populations were identified among 404 samples collected
   in the range of New Jersey to northern Florida using both genetic
   marker types, some inhabiting nearshore coastal waters and others
   utilizing inshore estuarine waters. The genetic results reject the
   hypothesis of a single stock of coastal bottlenose dolphins put forth
   after the 1987-1988 epizootic that caused a large-scale die-off of
   dolphins and suggest instead the disease vector was transferred from
   one population to the next as a result of seasonal migratory movements

   significantly from bottlenose dolphin samples collected in coastal

Abstract = {{Although range expansions have Occurred recurrently in the history of

   Theoretical studies show that range expansions are quite different from

   unexpected and fascinating results about genetic patterns emerging

   allele frequency gradients, promote the surfing of rare variants into
   newly occupied territories, induce the structuring of newly colonized
   areas into distinct sectors of low genetic diversity, or lead to
   massive introgression of local genes into the genome of an invading

Abstract = {{We studied 1616 bp of mtDNA sequence in plateau pika Ochotona curzoniae

   haplotypes in 245 individuals. Mismatch analyses detected rapid
   population expansion in nine regional groups. Long-term estimates of
   gene flow revealed a unidirectional manner from peripheral groups
   towards central plateau groups. In contrast, gene flow among central
   plateau groups was bidirectional. Our results indicate that the
   population expansion of most groups occurred 0.24-0.03 Mya, which
   mostly coincides with the interglacial period before the last glacial
   maximum. Gene flow of O. curzoniae was closely related to the different
   effects of the extensive glacial period (EGP) and the last glacial
   period (LGP) on the species. The EGP had caused extinction of all
   central populations, while the LGP had very limited influence on the
   populations that recolonized the central region. However, the glaciers
   in the relatively humid areas surrounding the interior of the plateau
   during the LGP were substantial and had prevented or greatly reduced
   the `counter' gene flow from the central populations to the edge
   populations, resulting in a unidirectional gene flow. A hierarchical
   analysis of molecular variance showed that 55.1\% of the total variance
   was explained by among-groups structuring while 34.2\% was explained by
   the differences among individuals within populations. Compared with
   other endemic species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, O. curzoniae has
   a moderate level of the population genetic structure, which is higher

Abstract = {{Patiria miniata, a broadcast-spawning sea star species with high
   dispersal potential, has a geographic range in the intertidal zone of
   the northeast Pacific Ocean from Alaska to California that is
   characterized by a large range gap in Washington and Oregon. We
   analyzed spatial genetic variation across the P. miniata range using
   multilocus sequence data (mtDNA, nuclear introns) and multilocus
   genotype data (microsatellites). We found a strong phylogeographic
   break at Queen Charlotte Sound in British Columbia that was not in the
   location predicted by the geographical distribution of the populations.
   However, this population genetic discontinuity does correspond to
   previously described phylogeographic breaks in other species. Northern
   populations from Alaska and Haida Gwaii were strongly differentiated
   from all southern populations from Vancouver Island and California.
   Populations from Vancouver Island and California were undifferentiated
   with evidence of high gene flow or very recent separation across the
   range disjunction between them. The surprising and discordant spatial
   distribution of populations and alleles suggests that historical
   vicariance (possibly caused by glaciations) and contemporary dispersal
   barriers (possibly caused by oceanographic conditions) both shape
   population genetic structure in this species.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 669 isolates of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen
   responsible for Sudden Oak Death, were collected from 34 Californian
   forests and from the ornamental plant-trade. Seven microsatellite
   markers revealed 82 multilocus genotypes (MGs) of which only three were
   abundant (> 10\%). Iteratively collapsing based upon minimum Theta(ST),
   yielded five meta-samples and five singleton populations. Populations
   in the same meta-sample were geographically contiguous, with one
   exception, possibly explained by the trade of infected plants from the
   same source into different locations. Multidimensional scaling
   corroborated this clustering and identified nursery populations as
   genetically most distant from the most recent outbreaks. A
   minimum-spanning network illustrated the evolutionary relationships
   among MGs, with common genotypes at the centre and singletons at the
   extremities; consistent with colonization by a few common genotypes
   followed by local evolution. Coalescent migration analyses used the
   original data set and a data set in which local genotypes were
   collapsed into common ancestral genotypes. Both analyses suggested that
   meta-samples 1 (Santa Cruz County) and 3 (Sonoma and Marin Counties),
   act as sources for most of the other forests. The untransformed data
   set best explains the first phases of the invasion, when the role of
   novel genotypes may have been minimal, whereas the second analysis best
   explains migration patterns in later phases of the invasion, when
   prevalence of novel genotypes was likely to have become more
   significant. Using this combined approach, we discuss possible
   migration routes based on our analyses, and compare them to historical
   and field observations from several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative genetic structure of hosts and their parasites has

   novaezealandensis (n = 269) and Philophthalmus sp. (n = 246), using
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences. Snails and
   trematodes were examined from 11 collection sites representing three
   regions on the South Island of New Zealand. Zeacumantus subcarinatus
   displayed low genetic diversity per geographic locality, strong genetic
   structure following an isolation by distance pattern, and low migration
   rates at the scale of the study. In contrast, M. novaezealandensis
   possessed high genetic diversity, genetic homogeneity among collection
   sites and high migration rates. Genetic diversity and migration rates
   were typically lower for Philophthalmus sp. compared to M.
   novaezealandensis and it displayed weak to moderate genetic structure.
   The observed patterns likely result from the limited dispersal ability
   of the direct developing snail and the utilization of bird definitive

Abstract = {{Genome assemblies are now available for nine primate species, and
   large-scale sequencing projects are underway or approved for six
   others. An explicitly evolutionary and phylogenetic approach to
   comparative genomics, called phylogenomics, will be essential in
   unlocking the valuable information about evolutionary history and
   genomic function that is contained within these genomes. However, most
   phylogenomic analyses so far have ignored the effects of variation in
   ancestral populations on patterns of sequence divergence. These effects
   can be pronounced in the primates, owing to large ancestral effective
   population sizes relative to the intervals between speciation events.
   In particular, local genealogies can vary considerably across loci,
   which can produce biases and diminished power in many phylogenomic
   analyses of interest, including phylogeny reconstruction, the
   identification of functional elements, and the detection of natural
   selection. At the same time, this variation in genealogies can be
   exploited to gain insight into the nature of ancestral populations. In
   this Perspective, I explore this area of intersection between
   phylogenetics and population genetics, and its implications for primate
   phylogenomics. I begin by ``lifting the hood'' on the conventional
   tree-like representation of the phylogenetic relationships between
   species, to expose the population-genetic processes that operate along
   its branches. Next, I briefly review an emerging literature that makes
   use of the complex relationships among coalescence, recombination, and
   speciation to produce inferences about evolutionary histories,
   ancestral populations, and natural selection. Finally, I discuss
   remaining challenges and future prospects at this nexus of
   phylogenetics, population genetics, and genomics.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial scale of dispersal in coral reef fishes eludes ecologists
   despite the importance of this parameter for understanding the dynamics
   of ecological and evolutionary processes. Genetic isolation by distance
   (IBD) has been used to estimate dispersal in coral reef fishes, but its
   application in marine systems has been limited by insufficient sampling
   at different spatial scales and a lack of information regarding
   population density. Here, we present an analysis of IBD in the barred
   hamlet (Hypoplectrus puella, Serranidae) at spatial scales ranging from
   10 to 3200 km complemented with SCUBA surveys of population densities
   covering 94 000 m(2) of reef. We used 10 hypervariable DNA markers to
   genotype 854 fish from 15 locations, and our results establish that IBD
   in H. puella emerges at a spatial scale of 175 km and is preserved up
   to the regional scale (3200 km). Assuming a normal or a Laplace
   dispersal function, our data are consistent with mean dispersal
   distances in H. puella that range between 2 and 14 km. Such small mean
   dispersal distances is a surprising result given the three-week pelagic
   larval duration of H. puella and the low level of genetic structure at
   the Caribbean scale (Wright's fixation index, F-ST, estimate = 0.005).
   Our data reinforce the importance of considering population density

   sampling at local scales, even when genetic structure is weak at the

   region. The population expansion associated with this invasion was
   estimated to have taken place 15,000 years before present (95\% c.f.

Abstract = {{Estimating dispersal distances from population genetic data provides an
   important alternative to logistically taxing methods for directly
   observing dispersal. Although methods for estimating dispersal rates
   between a modest number of discrete demes are well developed, methods
   of inference applicable to ``isolation-by-distance{''} models are much
   less established. Here, we present a method for estimating rho
   sigma(2), the product of population density (rho) and the variance of
   the dispersal displacement distribution (sigma(2)). The method is based
   on the assumption that low-frequency alleles are identical by descent.
   Hence, the extent of geographic clustering of such alleles, relative to
   their frequency in the population, provides information about rho
   sigma(2). We show that a novel likelihood-based method can infer this
   composite parameter with a modest bias in a lattice model of
   isolation-by-distance. For calculating the likelihood, we use an
   importance sampling approach to average over the unobserved
   intraallelic genealogies, where the intraallelic genealogies are
   modeled as a pure birth process. The approach also leads to a
   likelihood-ratio test of isotropy of dispersal, that is, whether
   dispersal distances on two axes are different. We test the performance
   of our methods using simulations of new mutations in a lattice model

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recently introduced, exotic plant pathogens may exhibit low genetic
   diversity and be limited to clonal reproduction. However, rapidly
   mutating molecular markers such as microsatellites can reveal genetic
   variation within these populations and be used to model putative
   migration patterns. Phytophthora ramorum is the exotic pathogen,
   discovered in the late 1990s, that is responsible for sudden oak death
   in California forests and ramorum blight of common ornamentals. The
   nursery trade has moved this pathogen from source populations on the
   West Coast to locations across the United States, thus risking
   introduction to other native forests. We examined the genetic diversity
   of P. ramorum in United States nurseries by microsatellite genotyping
   279 isolates collected from 19 states between 2004 and 2007. Of the
   three known P. ramorum clonal lineages, the most common and genetically
   diverse lineage in the sample was NA1. Two eastward migration pathways
   were revealed in the clustering of NA1 isolates into two groups, one
   containing isolates from Connecticut, Oregon, and Washington and the
   other isolates from California and the remaining states. This finding
   is consistent with trace forward analyses conducted by the US
   Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   At the same time, genetic diversities in several states equaled those
   observed in California, Oregon, and Washington and two-thirds of
   multilocus genotypes exhibited limited geographic distributions,
   indicating that mutation was common during or subsequent to migration.
   Together, these data suggest that migration, rapid mutation, and
   genetic drift all play a role in structuring the genetic diversity of
   P. ramorum in US nurseries. This work demonstrates that fast-evolving
   genetic markers can be used to examine the evolutionary processes
   acting on recently introduced pathogens and to infer their putative
   migration patterns, thus showing promise for the application of
   forensics to plant pathogens.}},

   Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) breeding on 12 barrier
   islands in the western Beaufort Sea, Alaska, using molecular markers
   and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data. Common Eider populations were
   genetically structured on a microgeographic scale. Regional comparisons
   between populations breeding on island groups separated by 90 km

   The CMR data (n = 34) did not indicate female dispersal between island
   groups. Concordance between genetic and CMR data indicates that females
   breeding in the western Beaufort Sea are strongly philopatric to island
   groups rather than to a particular island. Despite the apparent high
   site fidelity of females, coalescence-based models of gene flow suggest
   that asymmetrical western dispersal occurs between island groups and is
   likely mediated by Mikkelsen Bay females stopping early on spring
   migration at Simpson Lagoon to breed. Alternatively, late-arriving
   females may be predisposed to nest in Simpson Lagoon because of the
   greater availability and wider distribution of nesting habitat. Our
   results indicate that genetic discontinuities, mediated by female
   philopatry, can exist at microgeographic scales along established

   more isolated. English Channel patterns of connectivity indicated high
   dispersal and gene flow along the French coast, from Normandy to the

Title = {{Accurate and fast methods to estimate the population mutation rate from
   error prone sequences}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The population mutation rate (theta) remains one of the
   most fundamental parameters in genetics, ecology, and evolutionary
   biology. However, its accurate estimation can be seriously compromised
   when working with error prone data such as expressed sequence tags, low
   coverage draft sequences, and other such unfinished products. This
   study is premised on the simple idea that a random sequence error due
   to a chance accident during data collection or recording will be
   distributed within a population dataset as a singleton (i.e., as a
   polymorphic site where one sampled sequence exhibits a unique base
   relative to the common nucleotide of the others). Thus, one can avoid
   these random errors by ignoring the singletons within a dataset.
   Results: This strategy is implemented under an infinite sites model
   that focuses on only the internal branches of the sample genealogy
   where a shared polymorphism can arise (i.e., a variable site where each
   alternative base is represented by at least two sequences). This
   approach is first used to derive independently the same new Watterson
   and Tajima estimators of theta, as recently reported by Achaz {[}1] for
   error prone sequences. It is then used to modify the recent, full,
   maximum-likelihood model of Knudsen and Miyamoto {[}2], which
   incorporates various factors for experimental error and design with
   those for coalescence and mutation. These new methods are all accurate
   and fast according to evolutionary simulations and analyses of a real
   complex population dataset for the California seahare.
   Conclusion: In light of these results, we recommend the use of these
   three new methods for the determination of theta from error prone
   sequences. In particular, we advocate the new maximum likelihood model
   as a starting point for the further development of more complex
   coalescent/mutation models that also account for experimental error and
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife on isolated oceanic islands is highly susceptible to the
   introduction of pathogens. The recent establishment in the Galapagos
   Islands of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector for diseases
   such as avian malaria and West Nile fever, is considered a serious risk
   factor for the archipelago's endemic fauna. Here we present evidence
   from the monitoring of aeroplanes and genetic analysis that C.
   quinquefasciatus is regularly introduced via aircraft into the
   Galapagos Archipelago. Genetic population structure and admixture
   analysis demonstrates that these mosquitoes breed with, and integrate
   successfully into, already-established populations of C.
   quinquefasciatus in the Galapagos, and that there is ongoing movement
   of mosquitoes between islands. Tourist cruise boats and inter-island
   boat services are the most likely mechanism for transporting Culex
   mosquitoes between islands. Such anthropogenic mosquito movements
   increase the risk of the introduction of mosquito-borne diseases novel
   to Galapagos and their subsequent widespread dissemination across the
   archipelago. Failure to implement and maintain measures to prevent the
   human-assisted transport of mosquitoes to and among the islands could
   have catastrophic consequences for the endemic wildlife of Galapagos.}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how and why
   populations differentiate, both genetically and phenotypically, as they
   invade a novel habitat. A classical example of adaptation is the pale
   colour of beach mice, relative to their dark mainland ancestors, which
   colonized the isolated sandy dunes and barrier islands on Florida's
   Gulf Coast. However, much less is known about differentiation among the
   Gulf Coast beach mice, which comprise five subspecies linearly arrayed
   on Florida's shoreline. Here, we test the role of selection in
   maintaining variation among these beach mouse subspecies at multiple
   levels-phenotype, genotype and the environments they inhabit. While all
   beach subspecies have light pelage, they differ significantly in colour
   pattern. These subspecies are also genetically distinct: pair-wise
   F-ST-values range from 0.23 to 0.63 and levels of gene flow are low.
   However, we did not find a correlation between phenotypic and genetic
   distance. Instead, we find a significant association between the
   average `lightness' of each subspecies and the brightness of the
   substrate it inhabits: the two most genetically divergent subspecies
   occupy the most similar habitats and have converged on phenotype,
   whereas the most genetically similar subspecies occupy the most
   different environments and have divergent phenotypes. Moreover, allelic
   variation at the pigmentation gene, Mc1r, is statistically correlated
   with these colour differences but not with variation at other genetic
   loci. Together, these results suggest that natural selection for
   camouflage-via changes in Mc1r allele frequency-contributes to pigment
   differentiation among beach mouse subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{One of the original goals of phylogeography was to use genetic data to
   identify historical events that might contribute to breaks among
   communities. In this study, we examine the phylogeography of a common
   livebearing fish (Poecilia gillii) from Costa Rica. Our goal was to
   determine if phylogeographical breaks in this species were congruent
   with previously defined boundaries among four fish community provinces.
   We hypothesized that if abiotic factors influence both community
   boundaries and genetic structuring in P. gillii then we might find four
   clades within our focal species that were geographically separated
   along community boundary lines. Similarly, we expected to find most of
   the genetic variation in P. gillii partitioned among these four
   geographical regions. We generated DNA sequence data (mitochondrial
   cytochrome b and nuclear S7 small ribosomal subunit) for 260
   individuals from 42 populations distributed across Costa Rica. We
   analysed these data using phylogenetic (parsimony and likelihood) and
   coalescent approaches to estimate phylogenetic relationships among
   haplotypes, patterns of gene flow and effective population size.
   Contrary to our expectations, we did not find four monophyletic groups
   that mapped cleanly to our geographical community provinces. However,
   one of our clades was restricted to a single province, suggesting that
   common earth history events could be responsible for both genetic
   structuring in P. gillii and fish community composition in this area.
   However, our results show a complex pattern of gene flow throughout
   other regions in Costa Rica where genetic structuring is not predicted
   by community province boundaries.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recentyears approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods have
   become popular in population genetics as an alternative to
   full-likelihood methods to make inferences under complex demographic
   models. Most ABC methods rely on the choice of a set of summary
   statistics to extract information from the data. In this article we
   tested the use of the full allelic distribution directly in an ABC
   framework. Although the ABC techniques are becoming more widely used,
   there is still uncertainty over how they perform in comparison with
   full-likelihood methods. We thus conducted a simulation Study and
   provide a detailed examination of ABC in comparison with kill
   likelihood in the case of a model of admixture. This model assumes that
   two parental populations mixed at a certain time in the past, creating
   a hybrid population, and that the three populations then evolve under
   pure drift. Several aspects of ABC methodology, were investigated, such
   as the effect of the distance metric chosen to measure the similarity
   between simulated and observed data sets. Results show that in general
   ABC provides good approximations to the posterior distributions
   obtained with the full-likelihood method. This suggests that it is
   possible to apply ABC using allele frequencies to make inferences in
   cases where it is difficult to select a set of suitable summary
   statistics and when the complexity of the model or the size of the data
   set makes it computationally prohibitive to use full-likelihood methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report novel data on mitochondrial DNA in two of the
   largest eastern Bantu-speaking populations, the Shona from Zimbabwe and
   the Hutu from Rwanda. The goal is to evaluate the genetic relationships
   of these two ethnic groups with other Bantu-speaking populations.
   Moreover, by comparing our data with those from other Niger-Congo
   speaking populations, we aim to clarify some aspects of evolutionary
   and demographic processes accompanying the spread of Bantu languages in
   sub-Saharan Africa and to test if patterns of genetic variation fit
   with models of population expansion based on linguistic and
   archeological data. The results indicate that the Shona and Hutu are
   closely related to the other Bantu-speaking populations. However, there
   are some differences in haplogroup composition between the two
   populations, mainly due to different genetic contributions from
   neighboring populations. This result is confirmed by estimates of
   migration rates which show high levels of gene flow not only between
   pairs of Bantu-speaking populations, but also between Bantu and
   non-Bantu speakers. The observed pattern of genetic variability (high
   genetic homogeneity and high levels of gene flow) supports a linguistic
   model suggesting a gradual spread of Bantu-speakers, with strong
   interactions between the different lines of Bantu-speaker descent, and
   is also in agreement with recent archeological findings. In conclusion,
   our data emphasize the role that population admixture has played at
   different times and to varying degrees in the dispersal of Bantu

Abstract = {{Environmental variables can strongly influence a variety of intra- and
   inter-population processes, including demography, population structure
   and gene flow. When environmental conditions are particularly harsh for
   a certain species, investigating these effects is important to
   understanding how populations persist under difficult conditions.
   Furthermore, species inhabiting challenging environments present
   excellent opportunities to examine the effects of complex landscapes on
   population processes because these effects will often be more
   pronounced. In this study, I use 16 microsatellite loci to examine
   population structure, gene flow and demographic history in the black
   toad, Bufo exsul, which has one of the most restricted natural ranges
   of any amphibian. Bufo exsul inhabits four springs in the Deep Springs
   Valley high desert basin and has never been observed more than several
   meters from any source of water. My results reveal limited gene flow
   and moderately high levels of population structure (F-ST = 0.051-0.063)
   between all but the two closest springs. I found that the geographic
   distance across the arid scrub habitat between springs is significantly
   correlated with genetic structure when distance accounts for topography
   and barriers to dispersal. I also found very low effective population
   sizes (N-e = 7-30) and substantial evidence for historical population
   bottlenecks in all four populations. Together, these results suggest
   that the desert landscape and B. exsul's high habitat specificity
   contribute significantly to population structure and demography in this
   species and emphasize the importance of considering behavioural and
   landscape data in conservation genetic studies of natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{The use of sequence polymorphism from individual mitochondrial genes to
   infer past demography has recently proved controversial because of the
   recurrence of selective sweeps acting over genes and the need for
   unlinked multilocus data sets. However, comparative analyses using
   several species for one gene and/or multiple genes for one species can
   serve as a test for potential selective effects and clarify our
   understanding of historical demographic effects. This study compares
   nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I across
   seven deep-sea hydrothermal vent species that live along the
   volcanically active East Pacific Rise. Approximate Bayesian Computation
   (ABC) method, developed to trace shared vicariant events across species
   pairs, indicates the occurrence of two across species divergence times,
   and suggests that the present geographical patterns of genetic
   differentiation may be explained by two periods of significant
   population isolation. The oldest period dates back 11.6 Ma and is
   associated with the vent limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, while the most
   recent period of isolation is 1.3 Ma, which apparently affected all
   species examined and coincides with a transition zone across the
   equator. Moreover, significant negative Tajima's D and star-like
   networks were observed for all southern lineages, suggesting that these
   lineages experienced a concomitant demographic and geographical
   expansion about 100 000-300 000 generations ago. This expansion may
   have initiated from a wave of range expansions during the secondary
   colonization of new sites along the Southern East Pacific Rise (founder
   effects below the equator) or recurrent bottleneck events because of
   the increase of eruptive phases associated with the higher spreading
   rates of the ridge in this region.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we compare the genetic structure of a flooded

   villosum in the lower Rio Negro region and test the hypothesis that the
   Rio Negro, the largest tributary on the left bank of the Amazon River,
   has been acting as a geographical barrier to gene flow between
   populations from the left and right banks. Seventeen adult individuals
   on the left bank and 27 on the right bank of Rio Negro were sampled for
   C. microcarpum, whereas 27 on the left and 20 on the right bank were
   sampled for C. villosum. Two chloroplast DNA regions were sequenced:
   the intron of trnL gene and the intergenic region between psbA and trnH
   genes; and all individuals were genotyped using ten microsatellite
   loci. The trnL intron and psbA-trnH intergenic spacer generated
   fragments of 459 bp and 424 bp, respectively. For C. microcarpum, six
   haplotypes were identified for trnL and seven for psbA-trnH. By
   contrast, only one haplotype was found for C. villosum for both
   sequences. The results obtained showed that the Rio Negro has not been
   a barrier to gene flow by pollen and seeds for either species. No
   genetic differentiation and a high migration rate between populations
   from the left and right banks of the Rio Negro were detected for the
   chloroplast sequences and nuclear microsatellites, for both C. villosum
   and C. microcarpum. Although the two analysed sequences showed a sharp
   topology difference, both indicated that multiple lineages may have
   contributed to the origin of C. microcarpum populations in the Rio
   Negro basin. Nevertheless, for C. villosum, from terra firme, the
   results obtained may provide evidence of a recent expansion of one
   maternal lineage from an ancient relic population surviving in one of
   the few moist forest refuges of the Guiana Shield during extended

Abstract = {{In organisms with haploid-dominant life cycles, natural selection is
   expected to be especially effective because genetic variation is
   exposed directly to selection. However, in spore-producing plants with
   high dispersal abilities, among-population migration may counteract
   local adaptation by continuously redistributing genetic variability. In
   this study, we tested for adaptation at the molecular level by
   comparing nucleotide polymorphism in two genes (GapC and Rpb2) in 10
   European populations of the peatmoss species, Sphagnum fimbriatum with
   variability at nine microsatellite loci assumed to be selectively
   neutral. in line with previous results, the GapC and Rpb2 genes showed
   strikingly different patterns of nucleotide polymorphism. Neutrality
   tests and comparison of population differentiation based on the GapC
   and Rpb2 genes with neutrally evolving microsatellites using coalescent
   simulations supported non-neutral evolution in GapC, but neutral
   evolution in the Rpb2 gene. These observations and the positions of the
   replacement mutations in the GAPDH enzyme (coded by GapC) indicate a
   significant impact of replacement mutations on enzyme function.
   Furthermore, the geographic distribution of alternate GapC alleles

Abstract = {{Conventionally, Lepus capensis is considered to range across large
   parts of Africa, the Middle East., Central and Far East Asia. However,
   a recent morphological study restricts cape hares tentatively to a
   small range in the Western Cape Region of South Africa and groups all
   other L. capensis- type hares from South Africa into a new species: L.
   centralis. Here, we studied molecular relationships among L.
   capensis-type hares from South Africa. Phenotypically and
   morphologically the individuals matched either the newly described L.
   capensis or L. centralis. We examined 66 hares for allelic variation at
   13 microsatellite loci and for sequence variation of the hypervariable
   domain I of the mitochondrial control region. All tree-generating
   analyses of the currently obtained sequences and all South African cape
   hare sequences downloaded from GenBank revealed monophyly when compared
   to sequences of various other Lepus species. A network analysis
   indicated close evolutionary relationships between hares of the ``L.
   capensis-phenotype{''} and the ``L. centralis-phenotype{''} (according
   to Palacios et al. 2008) from the southwest of the Western Cape,
   relative to their pronounced evolutionary divergence from all other
   more central, northern, and north-eastern L. capensis-type hares.
   F-statistics, a Bayesian admixture STRUCTURE model, as well as a
   principal coordinate of microsatellite data indicated close genetic
   relationships among all South African L. capensis-type hares analysis I
   presently. A coalescence model-based migration analysis for
   microsatellite alleles indicated gene flow between most of the
   considered subspecies of cape hare, including L. capensis capensis and
   L. capensis centralis, theoretically sufficient to balance stochastic
   drift effects. Concordantly, AMOVA models revealed only little effects
   of partitioning microsatellite variation into the two suggested
   morpho-species ``L. capensis{''} and ``L. centralis{''}. Under an
   ``Interbreeding Species Concept{''} (e.g. a strict or relaxed
   Biological Species Concept), the current molecular data demonstrate
   conspecificity of the two proposed morpho-species ``L. capensis{''} and
   ``L. centralis{''}. Based on the present molecular data the
   differentiation of subspecies of cape hares from southern Africa is
   discussed. (C) 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published

Abstract = {{Sheath blight disease (SBD) on rice, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-1
   IA, is one of the most devastating rice diseases on a global basis,
   including China (in Eastern Asia), the world's largest rice-growing
   country. We analyzed the population genetics of nine rice-infecting
   populations from China using nine microsatellite loci. One allopatric
   population from India (Southern Asia) was included in the analyses. In
   total, 300 different multilocus genotypes were found among 572 fungal
   isolates. Clonal fractions within rice fields were 16 to 95\%,
   suggesting that sclerotia were a major source of primary inoculum in
   some fields. Global Phi(ST) statistics (Phi(ST) = 42.49; P <= 0.001)
   were consistent with a relatively high level of differentiation among
   populations overall; however, pairwise comparisons gave nonsignificant
   R-ST values, consistent with contemporary gene flow among five of the
   populations. Four of these populations were located along the Yangtze
   River tributary network. Gene flow followed an isolation-by-distance
   model consistent with restricted long-distance migration. Historical
   migration rates were reconstructed and yielded values that explained
   the current levels of population subdivision. Except for one population
   which appeared to be strictly clonal, all populations showed evidence
   of a mixed reproductive mode, including both asexual and sexual
   reproduction. One population had a strictly recombining structure (all
   loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) but the remaining populations
   from China and the one from India exhibited varying degrees of sexual
   reproduction. Six populations showed significant F-IS values consistent
   with inbreeding.}},

   Our findings narrow the gap between haplotypes recorded in feeding

   structure show a strong maternal isolation, with Calabria and east
   Turkey displaying far more diversity than expected considering their
   census size. These observations suggest that recurrent female founder
   effects from sources yet to be identified in the Atlantic or in the

Abstract = {{The Yellow Sea, located between the Korean Peninsula and mainland

   We studied patterns of genetic variation in a marine red alga to

   In total, 53 specimens of the red alga Ceramium japonicum were
   collected in Korea and Japan. We examined the geographic distribution
   of haplotypes and patterns of migration using mitochondrial cox1 and
   plastid rbcL. From the specimens collected, 22 cox1 haplotypes and
   eight rbcL haplotypes were identified. The network and neutrality tests
   for cox1 support three clusters (which are geographically grouped into
   east, south, and west coast populations) and provide evidence for
   population expansion on the west coast. The levels of gene flow were
   high in the south coast T west coast direction. Analysis of molecular
   variation in two protein-coding genes revealed significant genetic
   structure among the three coasts. The results support the concept that

Abstract = {{Despite only limited Pleistocene glacial activity in the southern
   hemisphere, temperate forest species experienced complex distributional
   changes resulting from the combined effects of glaciation, sea level
   change and increased aridity. The effects of these historical processes
   on population genetic structure are now overlain by the effects of
   contemporary habitat modification. In this study, 10 microsatellites
   and 629 bp of the mitochondrial control region were used to assess the
   effects of historical forest fragmentation and recent anthropogenic
   habitat change on the broad-scale population genetic structuring of a
   southern temperate marsupial, the Tasmanian pademelon. A total of 200
   individuals were sampled from seven sites across Tasmania and two
   islands in Bass Strait. High mitochondrial and nuclear genetic
   diversity indicated the maintenance of large historical population
   sizes. There was weak phylogeographical structuring of haplotypes,
   although all King Island haplotypes and three Tasmanian haplotypes
   formed a divergent clade implying the mid-Pleistocene isolation of a
   far northwestern population. Both the mitochondrial and nuclear data
   indicated a division of Tasmanian populations into eastern and western
   regions. This was consistent with a historical barrier resulting from
   increased aridity in the lowland `midlands' region during glacial
   periods, and with a contemporary barrier resulting from recent habitat
   modification in that region. In Tasmania, gene flow appears to have
   been relatively unrestricted during glacial maxima in the west, while
   in the east there was evidence for historical expansion from at least
   one large glacial refuge and recolonization of Flinders Island.}},

   individuals from across the range of the three species showed
   substantial introgression between geographically proximal populations

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lane snappers (Lutjanus synagris), sampled from eight localities in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and one locality along the Atlantic
   coast of Florida, were assayed for allelic variation at 14
   nuclear-encoded microsatellites and for sequence variation in a 590
   base-pair fragment of the mitochondrially encoded ND-4 gene (mtDNA).
   Significant heterogeneity among the nine localities in both
   microsatellite allele and genotype distributions and mtDNA haplotype
   distributions was indicated by exact tests and by analysis of molecular
   variance (AMOVA). Exact tests between pairs of localities and spatial
   analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) for both microsatellites and
   mtDNA revealed two genetically distinct groups: a Western Group that
   included six localities from the northwestern and northcentral Gulf and
   an Eastern Group that included three localities, one from the west
   coast of Florida, one from the Florida Keys, and one from the east
   (Atlantic) coast of Florida. The between-groups component of molecular
   variance was significant for both microsatellites (I broken vertical
   bar (CT) = 0.016, P = 0.009) and mtDNA (I broken vertical bar (CT) =
   0.208, P = 0.010). Exact tests between pairs of localities within each
   group and spatial autocorrelation analysis did not reveal genetic
   heterogeneity or an isolation-by-distance effect among localities
   within either group. MtDNA haplotype diversity was significantly less
   (P < 0.0001) in the Western Group than in the Eastern Group;
   microsatellite allelic richness and gene diversity also were
   significantly less in the Western Group (P = 0.015 and 0.013,
   respectively). The difference in genetic variability between the two
   groups may reflect reduced effective population size in the Western
   Group and/or asymmetric rates of genetic migration. The relative
   difference in variability between the two groups was substantially
   greater in mtDNA and may reflect one or more mtDNA selective sweeps;
   tests of neutrality of the mtDNA data were consistent with this
   possibility. Bayesian analysis of genetic demography indicated that
   both groups have experienced a historical decline in effective
   population size, with the decline being greater in the Western Group.
   Maximum-likelihood analysis of microsatellite data indicated
   significant asymmetry in average, long-term migration rates between the
   two groups, with roughly twofold greater migration from the Western
   Group to the Eastern Group. The difference in mtDNA variability and the
   order-of-magnitude difference in genetic divergence between mtDNA and
   microsatellites may reflect different demographic events affecting
   mtDNA disproportionately and/or a sexual and/or spatial bias in gene
   flow and dispersal. The spatial discontinuity among lane snappers in
   the region corresponds to a known zone of vicariance in other marine
   species. The evidence of two genetically distinct groupings (stocks)
   has implications for management of lane snapper resources in the
   northern Gulf.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics is an important framework for investigating the
   influence of spatial pattern on ecological process. Nevertheless, the
   standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty
   evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We
   use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative
   contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic
   connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and
   contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in
   naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the
   approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect
   estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx
   temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the
   genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the
   reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified
   landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate
   sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic
   model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative
   hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more
   information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic
   landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in
   dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from
   genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary
   landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity
   facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary
   deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to
   logrunner dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{To date, little is still known about how alpine species occurring in

   oscillations. Here, by using variations of the chloroplast trnT-L, we
   examined the genetic distribution pattern of 101 individuals of
   Potentilla glabra, comprising both the interior QTP and the plateau
   edge. Phylogenetic and network analyses of 31 recovered haplotypes
   identified three tentative clades (A, B and C). Analysis of molecular
   variance (amova) revealed that most of the genetic variability was
   found within populations (0.693), while differentiations between
   populations were obviously distinct (F-st = 0.307). Two independent
   range expansions within clades A and B occurring at approximately 316
   and 201 thousand years ago (kya) were recovered from the hierarchical
   mismatch analysis, and these two expansions were also confirmed by Fu's
   F-S values and `g' tests. However, distant distributions of clade C and
   private haplotypes from clades A and B suggest that they had survived
   the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and previous glaciers in situ since

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the dispersal rate in an
   organism assumed to be confined to tree stands with unbroken
   continuity. We used the lichen-forming ascomycete Cliostomum
   corrugatum, which is largely confined to old oak stands. Five
   populations, with pairwise distances ranging from 6.5 to 83 km, were
   sampled in Ostergotland, south-eastern Sweden. DNA sequence data from
   an intron in the small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene was obtained
   from 85 samples. Nearly all molecular variance (99.6\%) was found
   within populations and there were no signs of isolation-by-distance.
   The absolute number of immigrants per population per generation
   (estimated to 30 years), inferred by Bayesian MCMC, was found to be
   between 1 and 5. Altogether, evidence suggests abundant gene flow in
   the history of our sample. A simulation procedure demonstrated that we
   cannot know whether effective dispersal is ongoing or if it ceased at
   the time when oaks started to decrease dramatically around 400 years
   BP. However, a scenario where effective dispersal ceased already at the
   time when the postglacial reinvasion of oak had reached the region
   around 6000 years BP is unlikely. Vegetation history suggests that the
   habitat of C. corrugatum was patchily distributed in the landscape
   since the early Holocene. Combined with the high dispersal rate
   estimate, this suggests that the species has been successful at
   frequently crossing distances of at least several kilometres and
   possibly that it has primarily been limited by the availability of
   habitat rather than by dispersal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   locus. It is based on the idea that the expected minimum genetic
   distance between sequences from two species is smaller for some
   hybridization events than for incomplete lineage sorting scenarios.
   When applied to empirical data sets, distributions can be generated for
   the minimum interspecies distances expected under incomplete lineage
   sorting using coalescent simulations. If the observed distance between
   sequences from two species is smaller than its predicted distribution,
   incomplete lineage sorting can be rejected and hybridization inferred.
   We demonstrate the power of the method using simulations and illustrate
   its application on New Zealand alpine buttercups (Ranunculus). The
   method is robust and complements existing approaches. Thus it should
   allow biologists to assess with greater accuracy the importance of
   hybridization in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly found that effective population sizes of natural
   populations are much smaller than census sizes of plants and animals.
   However, theoretical studies have shown that factors rarely
   investigated empirically, like seed banks in plants and diapause in
   animals, may have profound influence on effective sizes. Here we
   investigate whether the presence of seed banks can explain the
   relatively high genetic variability observed in northern European
   Arabidopsis thaliana populations with small census sizes. We have
   genotyped three above- and below- ground cohorts in 27 Norwegian
   populations using single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Although the
   populations varied extensively in levels of variability within and
   between cohorts, standard genetic population measures were comparable
   to those obtained in previous studies on above-ground cohorts using
   microsatellite markers. Estimated effective population sizes are larger
   for total populations (containing both seed bank and above-ground
   cohorts for 1 year) compared to each of the cohorts considered
   separately. Using a conservative approach, we find that the effective
   sizes are larger than census sizes of local populations, and that the
   effective generation time is higher than 1 year (3-4 years, on
   average), making A. thaliana a perennial semelparous plant at many
   northern European localities.}},

Abstract = {{In historical biogeography, phylogenetic trees have long been used as

   approaches that use parametric models to forge such links will
   stimulate integration and propel hypothesis-driven biogeographical
   inquiry in new directions. We highlight here two such approaches and
   describe how they represent early steps towards a more general
   framework for model-based historical biogeography that is based on
   likelihood as an optimality criterion, rather than having the
   traditional reliance on parsimony. The development of this framework

Abstract = {{Adaptive population divergence is often driven by divergent natural
   selection, but can be constrained by the homogenizing effect of gene
   flow between populations. Indeed, a common pattern in nature is an
   inverse correlation between the degree of adaptive phenotypic
   divergence between populations and levels of gene flow between
   populations. However, there is essentially no experimental data on
   whether this correlation arises because gene flow constrains adaptation
   or, conversely, because adaptive divergence causes barriers to gene
   flow (ecological speciation). Here, I report increased adaptive
   divergence in cryptic color pattern between a pair of Timema insect
   populations following an experimental reduction in between-population
   gene flow. The reduction in gene flow arose due to a natural
   experiment, and thus was not replicated at a second site. However,
   temporal replication of the trends among six generations of data,
   coupled with a lack of increased adaptive divergence for two other
   population pairs where gene flow was not manipulated (i.e., control
   sites), argues that the results did not arise by chance. Estimates of
   dispersal ability and population size further support reduced gene
   flow, rather than increased genetic drift, as the cause of divergence.
   Thus, the findings provide experimental evidence that gene flow
   constrains adaptation in nature.}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis is an indigenous and
   economically important species in China, but can also be found as
   invasive species in Europe and America. Mitten crabs have been
   exploited extensively as a food resource since the 1990s. Despite its
   ecological and economic importance, the genetic structure of native
   mitten crab populations is not well understood. In this paper, we
   investigated the genetic structure of mitten crab populations in China
   by screening samples from ten locations covering six river systems at
   six microsatellite loci. Our results provide further evidence that
   mitten crabs from the River Nanliujiang in Southern China are a
   genetically differentiated population within the native range of
   Eriocheir, and should be recognized as a separate taxonomic unit. In
   contrast, extremely low levels of genetic differentiation and no
   significant geographic population structure were found among the
   samples located north of the River Nanliujiang. Based on the
   reproductive biology of mitten crabs and the geography of their habitat
   we argue that both natural and human-mediated gene flow are unlikely to
   fully account for the similar allele frequency distributions at
   microsatellite loci. Large population sizes of mitten crabs suggest
   instead that a virtual absence of genetic drift and significant
   homoplasy of microsatellite alleles have contributed to the observed
   pattern. Furthermore, a coalescent-based maximum likelihood method
   indicated a more than two-fold lower effective population size of the
   Southern population compared to the Northern Group and low but
   significant levels of gene flow between both areas.}},

Abstract = {{Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii (Gray, 1864)) in Alaska are
   currently treated as three distinct management stocks. Previous genetic

   differentiated genetically. We studied populations in Glacier Bay (GB;
   Southeast Alaska Stock), where harbor seals are declining, and Prince
   William Sound (PWS; Gulf of Alaska Stock), where the population has
   recently stabilized. Using six pairs of hypervariable microsatellite
   primers, we determined that these populations are a single panmictic
   unit with estimated migration rates of 22 animals/generation (PWS to
   GB) and 63 animals/generation (GB to PWS). The asymmetrical gene flow
   between GB and PWS is likely driven in part by a recent increase in
   competitors and predators of seals in GB. In contrast with males,
   emigration of females from PWS to GB (8.3 seals/generation) is higher
   than emigration of females from GB to PWS (3.3 seals/generation),
   likely because females use glacial ice as pupping habitat. Despite the
   high gene flow, the number of migrants per year (0.02\% of the Gulf of

   harbor seals in PWS, and the two populations may best be managed as

Abstract = {{Analyses of historical samples can provide invaluable information on
   changes to the genetic composition of natural populations resulting

   historical (archived scales from 1927 to 1956) and contemporary samples
   of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from six neighbouring rivers in Denmark,
   to compare the genetic structure of wild populations before and after
   population declines and stocking with nonlocal strains of hatchery
   trout. We show that all populations have been strongly affected by
   stocking, with admixture proportions ranging from 14 to 64\%.
   Historical population genetic structure was characterized by isolation
   by distance and by positive correlations between historical effective
   population sizes and habitat area within river systems. Contemporary
   population genetic structure still showed isolation by distance, but
   also reflected differences among populations in hatchery trout
   admixture proportions. Despite significant changes to the genetic
   composition within populations over time, dispersal rates among
   populations were roughly similar before and after stocking. We also
   assessed whether population declines or introgression by hatchery
   strain trout should be the most significant conservation concern in
   this system. Based on theoretical considerations, we argue that
   population declines have had limited negative effects for the
   persistence of adaptive variation, but admixture with hatchery trout
   may have resulted in reduced local adaptation. Collectively, our study

   seaway across the Baja California peninsula north of La Paz, although
   the estimated divergence time (1.84 million years ago) is more recent

Abstract = {{Alternaria spp. form a heterogeneous group of saprophytic and

   Alternaria spp. The interaction of Alternaria solani populations with
   potato and tomato plants is an interesting case study for addressing
   questions related to molecular evolution of an asexual fungus. Gene
   genealogies based on the coalescent process were used to infer
   evolutionary processes that shape the A. solani population. Sequences
   of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the genes
   which encode the allergenic protein alt a 1 (Alt a 1) and
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd) were used to estimate
   haplotype and nucleotide diversity as well as for the coalescent
   analyses. The highest number of parsimony informative sites (n = 14),
   nucleotide diversity (0.007), and the average number of nucleotide
   differences (3.20) were obtained for Alt a 1. Although the highest
   number of haplotypes (n = 7) was generated for ITS, haplotype diversity
   was the lowest (0.148) for this region. Recombination was not detected.
   Subdivision was inferred from populations associated with hosts but
   there was no evidence of geographic subdivision, and gene flow is
   occurring among subpopulations. In the analysis of the Alt a 1,
   balancing selection and population expansion or purifying selection
   could have occurred in A. solani subpopulations associated with potato
   and tomato plants, respectively. There is strong evidence that the
   subpopulation of A. solani that causes early blight in potato is
   genetically distinct from the subpopulation that causes early blight in
   tomato. The population of A. solani is clonal, and gene flow and

Abstract = {{An evaluation of genetic structuring and morphometric variation within

   Africa suggests two main population assemblages. Maximum likelihood
   (ML), Parsimony, Bayesian and phenetic analyses of mitochondrial
   cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data recovered two well-supported
   clades corresponding to two biogeographically distinct populations.
   Canonical variates (discriminant) analysis (CVA) also showed evidence
   of two phenetic assemblages that correspond to the genetically
   delineated groups. Libanasidus vittatus is the recognized species
   occurring within an eastern population in South Africa (Mpumalanga and
   Eastern Cape Provinces), while a possible novel species occurs within a
   north-western population in South Africa (Limpopo and Gauteng
   Provinces). Using a molecular clock estimate of 2.0\% divergence per
   million years, suggests isolation of the two populations at approx.
   1.65 million years ago, possibly due to the formation of isolating
   forest pockets during the dry Pleistocene Epoch. The average genetic
   divergence of 3.3\% between the two populations, and low migration rate
   estimates corresponding to less than one female migration per
   generation further support the presence of two cryptic tusked king

Abstract = {{Postglacial colonization has created the main phylogeographical
   structures in the endemic species of the Tibetan plateau; however,
   patterns of diversification are species idiosyncratic and indicative of
   variations in geographic divergence. Here we compare the
   phylogeographical structures of two endemic birds of the Tibetan
   plateau, the white-rumped snow finch (Onychostruthus taczanowskii) and
   the Hume's ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis), both of which are
   commonly associated with alpine meadow habitats. our results suggested
   that these two species experienced rapid population expansion at times
   estimated as 0.05-0.16 million years ago (Ma). These expansion periods
   were congruent with the retreat of the last extensive glacial period
   (0.5-0.175 Ma). Whereas O. taczanowskii populations were derived from a
   single more widely distributed refugium that existed along the east
   margin of the Tibetan plateau, P. humilis expanded from independent
   refugia that were located within both the northeast and southeast
   margin of the Tibetan plateau. While both birds experienced similar
   colonization events, their phylogeographical structures are quite
   contrasting. No trace of geographical divergence is found in O.
   taczanowskii, suggesting that considerable gene flow occurred after the
   postglacial colonization. in contrast, a geographic separation can be
   detected between two refugia populations of P. humilis, specifically
   the higher altitude platform and lower altitude edge regional groups.
   The gene flow between these two regions is restricted (M = 0.43). We
   estimate the divergence time as approximately 0.361 Ma, dating to the
   extensive glacial period. Potential explanations for the different
   phylogeographical structures of these two sympatric birds may include
   variance in dispersal ability, altitude specific and independent or
   semicontinuous refugia. While a combination of high flight ability and
   semicontinuous refugium may have promoted gene flow in O. taczanowskii
   populations, weak dispersal coupled with separated refugia may have
   sufficiently isolated populations such to facilitate genetic divergence
   in P. humilis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All Fights reserved.}},

   Migration rates across all loci are less than ine migrant
   pergeneration. We found evidence of growth in several populations and
   on the islands of Molokai and Maui, which supports population expansion
   associated with the formation of Maui Nui during the last glacial

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of development mode on the spatial and

   sequences were obtained for one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b (Cyt
   b), and for up to two nuclear genes, heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and
   aminopeptidase N intron (APN54). We found that the mean level of
   genetic diversity and long-term effective population sizes (N-e) were
   significantly greater for two species, Littorina scutulata and L.
   plena, that had a planktotrophic larval stage than for two species,
   Littorina sitkana and L. subrotundata, that laid benthic egg masses
   which hatched directly into crawl-away juveniles. Predictably, two
   poorly dispersing species, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata, showed
   significant spatial genetic structure at an 11- to 65-km geographical
   scale that was not observed in the two planktotrophic species.
   Conversely, the two planktotrophic species had more temporal genetic
   structure over a 10-year interval than did the two direct-developing
   species and showed highly significant temporal structure for spatially
   pooled samples. The greater temporal genetic variation of the two
   planktotrophic species may have been caused by their high fecundity,
   high larval dispersal, and low but spatially correlated early
   survivorship. The sweepstakes-like reproductive success of the
   planktotrophic species could allow a few related females to populate
   hundreds of kilometres of coastline and may explain their substantially
   larger temporal genetic variance but lower spatial genetic variance
   relative to the direct-developing species.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic composition of a population reflects several aspects of the
   organism and its environment. The Icelandic Arctic fox population
   exceeds 8000 individuals and is comprised of both coastal and inland
   foxes. Several factors may affect within-population movement and
   subsequent genetic population structure. A narrow isthmus and
   sheep-proof fences may prevent movement between the north-western and
   central part and glacial rivers may reduce movement between the eastern
   and central part of Iceland. Moreover, population density and habitat
   characteristics can influence movement behaviour further. Here, we
   investigate the genetic structure in the Icelandic Arctic fox
   population (n = 108) using 10 microsatellite loci. Despite large
   glacial rivers, we found low divergence between the central and eastern
   part, suggesting extensive movement between these areas. However, both
   model- and frequency-based analyses suggest that the north-western part
   is genetically differentiated from the rest of Iceland (F-ST = 0.04,
   D-S = 0.094), corresponding to 100-200 generations of complete
   isolation. This suggests that the fences cannot be the sole cause of
   divergence. Rather, the isthmus causes limited movement between the
   regions, implying that protection in the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve

Abstract = {{Northern South America presents a diverse array of nonforest or

   glacial-interglacial cycles; yet, the relevance of climatically driven
   vicariance events to the diversification of nonforest Amazonian
   vertebrates remains poorly known. We analyzed karyologic and
   mitochondrial DNA sequence data of the genus Zygodontomys, a small
   cricetid rodent distributed throughout nonforest habitats of northern
   Amazonia. Samples analyzed represented 4 Brazilian Amazonian localities
   and 2 French Guiana localities. Karyologic variation among Amazonian
   Brazilian Zygodontomys populations is high, with, at least, 3
   karyomorphotypes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses recovered 3 major
   clades congruent with known karyotypes, a finding that suggests the

   Guiana and Suruma clade, identified as Zygodontomys brevicauda

Abstract = {{Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have found widespread use in
   many fields of study to estimate the average properties of complex
   systems, and for posterior inference in a Bayesian framework. Existing
   theory and experiments prove convergence of well-constructed MCMC
   schemes to the appropriate limiting distribution under a variety of
   different conditions. In practice, however this convergence is often
   observed to be disturbingly slow. This is frequently caused by an
   inappropriate selection of the proposal distribution used to generate
   trial moves in the Markov Chain. Here we show that significant
   improvements to the efficiency of MCMC simulation can be made by using
   a self-adaptive Differential Evolution learning strategy within a
   population-based evolutionary framework. This scheme, entitled
   Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis or DREAM, runs multiple
   different chains simultaneously for global exploration, and
   automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal
   distribution in randomized subspaces during the search. Ergodicity of
   the algorithm is proved, and various examples involving nonlinearity,
   high-dimensionality, and multimodality show that DREAM is generally
   Superior to other adaptive MCMC sampling approaches. The DREAM scheme
   significantly enhances the applicability of MCMC simulation to Complex,

   this study, we consider patterns of neutral (microsatellite) and
   quantitative genetic variation in traits in three species of Drosophila

   rainforest-restricted Drosophila birchii, there was evidence of
   selection for increased desiccation and starvation resistance towards
   the southern border, and a reduction in genetic diversity in
   desiccation resistance at this border. No such patterns existed for
   Drosophila bunnanda, which has an even more restricted distribution. In
   the habitat generalist Drosophila serrata, there was evidence for
   geographic selection for wing size and development time, although
   clinal patterns for increased cold and starvation resistance towards
   the southern border could not be differentiated from neutral
   expectations. These findings suggest that borders in these species are

Abstract = {{The persistence of plants inhabiting restricted alpine areas under
   climate change will depend upon many factors including levels of
   genetic variation in adaptive traits, population structure, and
   breeding system.
   Using microsatellite markers, the genetic structure of populations of a
   relatively common alpine grass, Poa hiemata, is examined across three
   altitudinal gradients within the restricted Australian alpine zone
   where this species has previously been shown to exhibit local
   adaptation across a narrow altitudinal gradient.
   Genetic variation across six microsatellite markers revealed genetic
   structuring along altitudinal transects, and a reduction in genetic
   variation at high and low altitude extremes relative to sites central
   within transects. There was less genetic variation among transect sites
   compared with altitudinal gradients within transects, even though
   distances among transects were relatively larger. Central sites within
   transects were less differentiated than those at extremes.
   These patterns suggest higher rates of gene flow among sites at similar
   altitudes than along transects, a process that could assist altitudinal
   adaptation. Patterns of spatial autocorrelation and isolation by
   distance changed with altitude and may reflect altered patterns of
   dispersal via pollen and/or seed. There was evidence for selfing and
   clonality in neighbouring plants. Levels of gene flow along transects
   were insufficient to prevent adaptive changes in morphological traits,

Abstract = {{We investigated potential microgeographical population structure among

   revealed significant spatial (p = 0.04) and temporal (p = 0.02)
   variance when including samples of juveniles and the microsatellite Gmo
   132, which is known to be subject to selection. However, neither
   spatial nor temporal variance components were significant (p = 0.15 and
   0.23, respectively) after exclusion of juvenile samples and Gmo 132.
   Patterns of genetic differentiation showed a similar sensitivity to the
   sampling of loci. No apparent pattern was identified when only using
   suspected neutral microsatellites. In contrast, analysis of Gmo132
   alone revealed a clear isolation of 2 samples collected at Viking and
   pairwise grouping of temporal adult samples from the same location. On
   a northeast Atlantic regional scale, inferences on local populations

   demonstrate that, without cautious consideration of biased samples of
   individuals and loci, apparent microgeographical patterns of spatial
   genetic differentiation could be caused by sampling non-randomly
   distributed individuals of hitch-hiking selection at presumed neutral
   marker loci. However, while loci subject to selection may provide
   biased results in relation to identifying populations based on an

   abundant fish species on the Antarctic continental shelves of the
   Scotia Arc, and Bouvet Island. We genotyped 11 microsatellite loci in
   C. aceratus population samples from South Orkney, southern South
   Shetlands, and Elephant Island (northern South Shetlands) collected in
   2002 and 2006. This investigation further develops a previous study on
   the species reporting the presence of one panmittic population in
   southern South Shetlands and Elephant Island, with genetic
   differentiation between year classes. Our results reveal a more complex
   pattern of differentiation than shown previously, as genetic
   differences occur both at the temporal level at Elephant Island and at
   the geographic scale between southern South Shetland-Elephant Islands
   and South Orkney population samples. In particular, the magnitude of
   genetic differentiation at the temporal scale, the relatively high
   effective population size (N-e) and high gene flow indicate that
   genetic differentiation is not only driven by geographic distance. At
   present, our results should be taken into account when defining
   conservation measures and management boundaries in regions where
   fishery is still open or where other Antarctic fish species are still
   exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Alien species have profound ecological and evolutionary impacts on
   native species. In this study, we used microsatellite loci to evaluate
   the impact of grazing on Crossosoma californicum on the California
   Channel Islands to predict future threats to this species and to assess
   the origin of a mainland population. San Clemente Island supports
   populations of one to seven individuals, whereas Santa Catalina Island
   supports populations of 30 - 50 individuals. We hypothesize that these
   demographic differences are due to variable grazing pressures, and as a
   result, the islands will differ in genetic structure. We found a strong
   correlation between population size and genetic variation, with Santa
   Catalina populations more variable (p = 85.9, A = 3.2) than San
   Clemente populations (p = 49.7, A = 1.7). We also found evidence for
   ancient but not recent bottlenecks, indicating that C. californicum may
   have historically maintained small populations. The islands are similar
   in total genetic variation, suggesting that while grazing reduced the
   number of plants, it did not deplete genetic variation. Simulation
   studies predict substantial declines in allelic diversity within the
   next 50 yr. Thus, conservation measures should seek to establish
   sustainable populations, especially on San Clemente. The mainland
   population of C. californicum was equally divergent from island
   populations and likely represents insular colonization to the mainland.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional phylogeographic studies, historical demographic
   processes are elucidated from the geographical distribution of

   different genealogies. Likewise, the same gene trees can arise under
   different demographic models. This problem has led to the emergence of
   many statistical methods for making phylogeographic inferences. A
   popular phylogeographic approach based on nested clade analysis is
   challenged by the fact that a certain amount of the interpretation of
   the data is left to the subjective choices of the user, and it has been
   argued that the method performs poorly in simulation studies. More
   rigorous statistical methods based on coalescence theory have been

Abstract = {{We present a novel and straightforward method for estimating recent
   migration rates between discrete populations using multilocus genotype
   data. The approach builds upon a two-step sampling design, where
   individual genotypes are sampled before and after dispersal. We develop
   a model that estimates all pairwise backwards migration rates (m(ij),
   the probability that an individual sampled in population i is a migrant
   from population j) between a set of populations. The method is
   validated with simulated data and compared with the methods of BayesAss
   and Structure. First, we use data for an island model and then we
   consider more realistic data simulations for a metapopulation of the
   greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula). We show that the
   precision and bias of estimates primarily depend upon the proportion of
   individuals sampled in each population. Weak sampling designs may
   particularly affect the quality of the coverage provided by 95\%
   highest posterior density intervals. We further show that it is
   relatively insensitive to the number of loci sampled and the overall
   strength of genetic structure. The method can easily be extended and
   makes fewer assumptions about the underlying demographic and genetic
   processes than currently available methods. It allows backwards
   migration rates to be estimated across a wide range of realistic

Abstract = {{Japanese goshawk was classified as a vulnerable species in the Red Data
   Book. There have been possibilities of a decrease of genetic diversity
   accompanied by habitat loss and genetic pollution due to hybridization
   with escaping imported goshawks. In this paper, genetic diversity, gene
   flow and conservation of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Japan
   are discussed and compared with that in Central Asia. We used 11 newly
   developed microsatellite markers and also adopted six previously
   published markers. Genetic diversity was shown to be maintained with
   0.58 as mean heterozygosity and 3.95 as mean allelic richness. The
   degree of genetic differentiation across all populations was low (Nei's
   genetic differentiation index = 0.036, Wright's genetic differentiation
   index = 0.039), possibly due to gene flow via adjacent regions (average
   number of migrants = 4.26; 0.68-20.30). However, it is possible that
   slight differentiation resulted from the short divergence time and/or
   inflow of escaping imported individuals. We recommend that goshawks in
   eastern Japan should be managed as a single unit. They do not appear to
   be under threat genetically at present, but there is the potential for
   rapid loss of genetic diversity. For future conservation,
   investigations of dispersal routes and actual conditions of gene flow
   are also recommended. To prevent further inflow of escaping goshawks

Abstract = {{In recent years, genetic studies have been used to investigate mating
   systems of marine turtles, but to date no such research has been
   conducted on the flatback turtle (Natator depressus). This study
   investigates paternity of flatback turtle clutches at two rookeries in
   Queensland, Australia; Peak Island (Keppel Bay), and Mon Repos
   (Bundaberg). In the 2004-2005 nesting season, tissue samples were taken
   from either single or multiple clutches (n = 16) of nesting females (n
   = 8) representing a sampling effort ranging from 25\% to 50\% offspring
   per nest. Determination of the extent of multiple paternity was done
   using a comparative approach that included initial inferences based on
   observed alleles, Chi-square tests for deviations from Mendelian
   expectations, and three software programs (PARENTAGE1.0, GERUD2.0 and
   MER3.0). Results varied depending on the approach, but by calculating a
   consensus value of the output from these different methods, the null
   hypothesis of single paternity could be rejected in at least 11 of the
   16 clutches (69\%). Multiple paternity was thus observed in the
   clutches of six of nine females (67\%), with two or three fathers being
   the most likely outcome. Analyses of successive clutches illustrated
   that paternal contribution to clutch fertilization can vary through
   time, as observed for two females. This first evidence regarding the
   mating system of flatback turtles indicates that multiple paternity is
   common in this species and that the observed frequency of multiple
   paternity is among the higher values reported in marine turtle species.
   Application of these results to estimates of effective population size
   (N (e)) suggests that population size may have been relatively stable
   over long periods. Continued monitoring of population dynamics is
   recommended to ensure that future changes in the east coast can be
   detected.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation and maintenance of connectivity among local populations

   Bayesian statistics and coalescent theory to estimate short- and
   long-term directional gene flow among subpopulations for two reptiles
   that occur in Canada as peripheral populations that are geographically
   disjunct from the core of their respective species' ranges: the black
   ratsnake and the Blanding's turtle. Estimates of directional gene flow
   were used to examine population connectivity and potential genetic
   source-sink dynamics. For both species, our estimates of directional
   short- and long-term gene flow were consistently lower than estimates
   inferred previously from F (ST) measures. Short- and long-term gene
   flow estimates were discordant in both species, suggesting that
   population dynamics have varied temporally in both species. These
   estimates of directional gene flow were used to identify specific
   subpopulations in both species that may be of high conservation value
   because they are net exporters of individuals to other subpopulations.
   Overall, our results show that the use of more sophisticated methods to
   evaluate population genetic data can provide valuable information for
   the conservation of species at risk, including bidirectional estimates
   of subpopulation connectivity that rely on fewer assumptions than more
   traditional analyses. Such information can be used by conservation
   practitioners to better understand the geographic scope required to

Pages = {{544-561}},
Abstract = {{Due to lack of an adequate statistical framework, biologists studying
   phylogeography are abandoning traditional methods of estimating
   phylogeographic history in favor of statistical methods designed to
   test a priori hypotheses. These new methods may, however, have limited
   descriptive utility. Here, we develop a new statistical framework that
   can be used to both test a priori hypotheses and estimate
   phylogeographic history of a gene (and the statistical confidence in
   that history) in the absence of such hypotheses. The statistical
   approach concentrates on estimation of geographic locations of the
   ancestors of a set of sampled organisms. Assuming a spatially explicit
   random walk model of migration, we derive an equation describing the
   likelihood of the geographic coordinates of the individuals represented
   by internal nodes on a tree (the parameters of interest) and the mean
   per-generation dispersal distance (which can be estimated as a nuisance
   parameter), given the geographic coordinates of the individuals
   represented by tips on the tree (topology and branch lengths are
   assumed to be known). Using a maximum likelihood approach, which is
   implemented in the new program PhyloMapper, we apply this statistical
   framework to a 246-taxon mitochondrial genealogy of North American
   chorus frogs, focusing in detail on one of these species. We
   demonstrate three lines of evidence for recent northward expansion of
   the mitochondrion of the coastal clade of Pseudacris feriarum: higher
   per-generation dispersal distance in the recently colonized region, a
   noncentral ancestral location, and directional migration. After
   illustrating one method of accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty, we
   conclude by discussing how extensions of this framework could function
   to incorporate a priori ecological and geological information into
   phylogeographic analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative phylogeography is a powerful method for testing hypotheses
   of evolutionary diversification in ecological communities. Caribbean
   lizards of the genus Anolis are a species-rich group and a well-known
   example of adaptive radiation. In 1983, Ernest Williams suggested that
   species of Anolis that belong to the same `climate type' (taxa that
   occur sympatrically in either xeric, mesic or very wet habitats)
   probably evolved under similar ecological conditions, and thus have
   experienced a parallel evolutionary history. This hypothesis implies
   that the phylogeographical patterns of such species can be expected to
   be concordant, a prediction that has not been tested. We conducted a
   comparative phylogeographical and population genetic study of Anolis
   poncensis and Anolis cooki, two sympatric lizards restricted to the
   aridlands of southwestern Puerto Rico, to determine whether there are
   similarities in the genetic architecture of the two anoles that may
   have resulted from a parallel response to the same historical events,
   or whether each taxon displays a distinct pattern of geographical
   distribution of intraspecific genealogical lineages. Our dataset
   consisted of approximately 2120 base pairs of the ND2 and cytochrome b
   genes from specimens from the known extant populations of the two
   species. The average haplotype diversity in A. poncensis (0.36) was
   considerably lower than that in A. cooki (0.62), whereas the average
   nucleotide diversity in A. cooki was ten times higher than that in A.
   poncensis. Both anoles showed pronounced phylogeographical structure,
   with no shared haplotypes among populations. The gene genealogy of A.
   poncensis recovered three strongly supported clades: the westernmost
   population, the easternmost deme and the three intermediate
   populations. In A. cooki, the populations from the western part of the
   species' range formed a well-supported group, to the exclusion of the
   eastern demes. Pairwise F-ST values revealed significant genetic
   differentiation among all conspecific populations of both anoles.
   Coalescent simulations indicated that A. poncensis could have evolved
   under a scenario of simple population fragmentation during the
   Pleistocene, but that A. cooki did not. The estimate of the effective
   population size of A. cooki was an order of magnitude larger than that
   of A. poncensis. Because time to the most recent common ancestor is
   dependent on effective population size, this tenfold difference implies
   that the time to the most recent common ancestor of A. cooki is much
   longer than that of A. poncensis, which indicates that A. cooki
   diversified earlier than A. poncensis. Collectively, these findings
   suggest that, although A. poncensis and A. cooki are syntopic
   throughout much of their current distribution, intraspecific
   diversification in the two species has not proceeded in parallel, which
   does not support the hypothesis that Anolis lizards that occupy the
   same climate-type region possess spatially and temporally congruent
   genetic architectures. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London,

   in springs - highly isolated habitats that are relatively unaffected by
   anthropogenic influences. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses
   based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA sequence data were conducted
   in 458 specimens from 142 populations occurring throughout Europe. The
   study provides evidence that most Bythinella spp. survived the
   Pleistocene in restricted northern glacial refugia that largely
   correspond to refugia previously recognized for other European biota.
   However, survival of Bythinella spp. in extensive permafrost areas
   outside of refugia can likely be rejected. Low dispersal ability and
   the isolation and fragmentation of spring habitats, as well as the
   distribution of perennial springs within permafrost regions, may
   account for this result. Tests involving a total of 29 nominal species
   showed that phylogenetically closely related Bythinella species did not
   occupy similar refugia. This lack of phylogenetic concordance could
   possibly be explained by the stochasticity of survival and dispersal in
   spring snails.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) shared by avian Z and W sex chromosomes
   are typically small homologous regions within which recombination still
   occurs and are hypothesized to share the properties of autosomes. We
   capitalized on the unusual structure of the sex chromosomes of emus,
   Dromaius novaehollandiae, which consist almost entirely of PAR shared
   by both sex chromosomes, to test this hypothesis. We compared
   recombination, linkage disequilibrium (LD), GC content, and nucleotide
   diversity between pseudoautosomal and autosomal loci derived from 11
   emu bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that were mapped to
   chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Nucleotide diversity
   (pi = 4N(e)mu) was not significantly lower in pseudoautosomal loci (14
   loci, 1.9 +/- 2.4 x 10(-3)) than autosomal loci (8 loci, 4.2 +/- 6.1 x
   10(-3)). By contrast, recombination per site within BAC-end sequences
   (rho = 4Nc) (pseudoautosomal, 3.9 +/- 6.9 x 10(-2); autosomal, 2.3 +/-

   0.2 x 10(-1); autosomal, 4.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(-1)) slightly lower in
   pseudoautosomal sequences. We also report evidence of deviation from a
   simple neutral model in the PAR and in autosomal loci, possibly caused
   by departures from demographic equilibrium, such as population growth.
   This study provides a snapshot of the population genetics of avian sex

Abstract = {{Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed macaque (Macaca
   fascicularis) are the 2 most commonly used primate model species in
   biomedical sciences. Although morphological studies have revealed a
   weak hybridization at the interspecific contact zone, in the north of
   Indochina, a molecular study has suggested an ancient introgression
   from rhesus to long-tailed macaque into the Indo-Chinese peninsula.
   However, the gene flow between these 2 taxa has never been quantified
   using genetic data and theoretical models. In this study, we have
   examined genetic variation within and between the parapatric Chinese
   rhesus macaque and Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque populations, using
   13 autosomal, 5 sex-linked microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA
   sequence data. From these data, we assessed genetic structure and
   estimated gene flow using a Bayesian clustering approach and the
   ``Isolation with Migration{''} model. Our results reveal a weak
   interspecific genetic differentiation at both autosomal and sex-linked
   loci, suggesting large population sizes and/or gene flow between
   populations. According to the Bayesian clustering, Chinese rhesus
   macaque is a highly homogeneous gene pool that contributes strongly to
   the current Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque genetic makeup, whether or
   not current admixture is assumed. Coalescent simulations, which
   integrated the characteristics of the loci, pointed out 1) a higher
   effective population size in rhesus macaque, 2) no mitochondrial gene
   flow, and 3) unilateral and male-mediated nuclear gene flow of similar
   to 10 migrants per generation from rhesus to long-tailed macaque. These
   patterns of genetic structure and gene flow suggest extensive ancient
   introgression from Chinese rhesus macaque into the Indo-Chinese
   long-tailed macaque population.}},

Abstract = {{Moose (Alces alces) are highly mobile mammals that occur across
   arboreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Alaskan moose
   (Alces alces gigas) range across much of Alaska and are primary
   herbivore consumers, exerting a prominent influence on ecosystem
   structure and functioning. Increased knowledge gained from population
   genetics provides insights into their population dynamics, history, and
   dispersal of these unique large herbivores and can aid in conservation
   efforts. We examined the genetic diversity and population structure of
   moose (n = 141) with 8 polymorphic microsatellites from 6 regions
   spanning much of Alaska. Expected heterozygosity was moderate (H-E =
   0.483-0.612), and private alleles ranged from 0 to 6. Both F-ST and
   R-ST indicated significant population structure (P < 0.001) with F-ST <
   0.109 and R-ST < 0.125. Results of analyses from STRUCTURE indicated 2
   prominent population groups, a mix of moose from the Yakutat and Tetlin
   regions versus all other moose, with slight substructure observed among
   the second population. Estimates of dispersal differed between
   analytical approaches, indicating a high level of historical or current
   gene flow. Mantel tests indicated that isolation-by-distance partially
   explained observed structure among moose populations (R-2 = 0.45, P <
   0.01). Finally, there was no evidence of bottlenecks either at the
   population level or overall. We conclude that weak population structure
   occurs among moose in Alaska with population expansion from interior
   Alaska westward toward the coast.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of demographic analyses, perturbation analysis and

   population models and guide population management. Perturbation
   analysis studies how the perturbation of demographic parameters
   (survival, growth, and reproduction parameters) may affect the
   population projection, while uncertainty analysis evaluates how much
   uncertainty there is in population dynamic predictions and where the
   uncertainty comes from. Previously, both perturbation analysis and
   uncertainty analysis were conducted on the long-term population growth
   rate. However, the population may not reach its equilibrium state,
   especially when there is management by harvesting or hunting. Recently,
   there has been an increased interest in short-term transient dynamics,
   which can differ from asymptotic long-term dynamics. There are
   currently techniques to conduct perturbation analyses of short-term
   transient dynamics, but no techniques have been proposed for
   uncertainty analysis of such dynamics. In this study, we introduced an
   uncertainty analysis technique, the general Fourier Amplitude
   Sensitivity Test (FAST), to study uncertainties in transient population

   uncertainty in transient dynamics and contributions by different
   demographic parameters. We applied the general FAST to a mountain goat

   Balearic Islands, Spain.
   We analysed mitochondrial DNA (2382 bp sequence from eight genes) from
   118 individuals and characterized the relationships among haplotypes
   using parsimony networks, as well as phylogenetic inference. Analyses
   of historical gene flow and population growth were used to provide
   further insights into population histories.
   Four unconnected parsimony networks were obtained that mirrored the
   main clades in the phylogenetic tree: (I) all Menorcan populations,
   (II) Dragonera, Malgrats and Toro islands (Western Mallorca) (III and
   IV) and the remaining populations from Cabrera and Mallorca. Two major
   haplotype groups were detected in Menorca (I) and these provided
   signatures of a demographic expansion and asymmetrical historical gene
   flow, respectively, concordant with the expected direction of
   colonization from south to north of the island. Populations from
   western Mallorca (II) showed evidence of historical allopatric
   fragmentation events following isolation around the start of the
   Pleistocene. In networks III and IV, Cabreran populations appear to
   have become isolated from north and south Mallorca quite recently, with
   asymmetric gene flow indicating a northwards dispersal direction.
   P. lilfordi is a genetically diverse species that shows substantial
   mtDNA structuring both between regions and, at a finer scale, between
   some islet populations within regions. The precarious state of some
   islet populations shown here to be quite divergent (e.g. Toro island in
   western Mallorca) means that conservation of this intraspecific
   biodiversity requires urgent action.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: QoI fungicides or quinone outside inhibitors (also called
   strobilurins) have been widely used to control agriculturally important
   fungal pathogens since their introduction in 1996. Strobilurins block
   the respiration pathway by inhibiting the cytochrome bc1 complex in
   mitochondria. Several plant pathogenic fungi have developed field
   resistance. The first QoI resistance in Mycosphaerella graminicola
   (Fuckel) Schroter was detected retrospectively in UK in 2001 at a low
   frequency in QoI-treated plots. During the following seasons,
   resistance reached high frequencies across northern Europe. The aim of
   this study was to identify the main evolutionary forces driving the
   rapid emergence and spread of QoI resistance in M. graminicola
   populations.
   RESULTS: The G143A mutation causing QoI resistance was first detected
   during 2002 in all tested populations and in eight distinct mtDNA
   sequence haplotypes. By 2004, 24 different mtDNA haplotypes contained
   the G143A mutation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strobilurin
   resistance was acquired independently through at least four recurrent
   mutations at the same site of cytochrome b. Estimates of directional
   migration rates showed that the majority of gene flow in Europe had
   occurred in a west-to-east direction.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that recurring mutations
   independently introduced the QoI resistance allele into different
   genetic and geographic backgrounds. The resistant haplotypes then
   increased in frequency owing to the strong fungicide selection and
   spread eastward through wind dispersal of ascospores. (C) 2008 Society

   reciprocally monophyletic clade of C. kobomugi. The North American C.
   macrocephala and C. kobomugi clade form a sister clade with a lineage
   of Asian C. macrocephala, thereby forming a paraphyletic C.
   macrocephala species. Not only does the phylogenetic hypothesis suggest
   C. macrocephala is paraphyletic, but it also suggests that the two
   lineages which share a partially overlapping distribution, Asian C.
   macrocephala and C. kobomugi, are not the most closely related. To test
   these relationships, we used coalescent-based population genetic models
   to infer divergence time for each lineage pair within the species
   complex. The coalescent-based models account for the stochastic forces
   which drive population divergence, and can account for the lineage
   sorting that occurs prior to lineage divergence. A drawback to
   phylogenetic-based phylogeographical analyses is that they do not
   account for stochastic lineage sorting that occurs between gene
   divergence and lineage divergence. By comparing the relative divergence
   time of the three main lineages within this group, Asian C.
   macrocephala, North American C. macrocephala, and C. kobomugi, we
   concluded that the phylogenetic hypothesis is incorrect, and the
   divergence between these lineages occurred during the Late Pleistocene
   epoch.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of past climatic events on species may
   facilitate predictions of how species will respond to future climate
   change. To this end, we sampled populations of the common pond snail
   Radix balthica over the entire species range (northwestern Europe).
   Using a recently developed analytical framework that employs ecological
   niche modelling to obtain hypotheses that are subsequently tested with
   statistical phylogeography, we inferred the range dynamics of R.
   balthica over time. A Maxent modelling for present-day conditions was
   performed to infer the climate envelope for the species, and the
   modelled niche was used to hindcast climatically suitable range at the
   last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 21 000 years ago. Ecological niche
   modelling predicted two suitable areas at the LGM within the present
   species range. Phylogeographic model selection on a COI mitochondrial
   DNA data set confirmed that R. balthica most likely spread from these
   two disjunct refuges after the LGM. The match observed between the
   potential range of the species at the LGM given its present climatic
   requirements and the phylogeographically inferred refugial areas was a
   clear argument in favour of niche conservatism in R. balthica, thus
   allowing to predict the future range. The subsequent projection of the
   potential range under a global change scenario predicts a moderate
   pole-ward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of
   areas currently occupied in France, western Great Britain and southern

   Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. (Combretaceae), of Central
   America.
   Mangrove forests of Costa Rica and Panama.
   Sequences of elongation factor alpha (EFA), beta tubulin (BTUB) and
   nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were
   obtained from 54 collections of D. caperata collected from Caribbean
   and Pacific L. racemosa forests in Central America. Measures of
   haplotype and nucleotide diversity, nested clade analyses and
   coalescent analyses were used to estimate the direction and extent of
   migration of the fungus, and the factors promoting population
   divergence. We also conducted phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian
   estimation to test whether putative D. caperata collected from L.
   racemosa was conspecific with D. caperata colonizing other hosts from
   diverse Neotropical forests.
   Our results demonstrate that there is genetic isolation between D.
   caperata populations from Caribbean mangroves and those from Pacific
   mangroves. Our data suggest that the best explanation for the observed
   haplotype distribution is a recent range expansion from the Caribbean
   to the Pacific coasts, with subsequent isolation. This is supported by
   the infrequent overlap of haplotypes, unidirectional migration
   estimates from the Caribbean to the Pacific and the older estimated age
   of mutations in the Caribbean low-copy BTUB and EFA loci. In addition,
   our data suggest that D. caperata from mangroves are not conspecific
   with collections from other hosts found in diverse Neotropical forests.
   The low frequency of shared haplotypes between coasts, coupled with the
   incomplete lineage sorting after cessation of gene flow, is consistent
   with isolation during the last Pleistocene glaciation. We hypothesize
   that the greater haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the Pacific
   occurs either because larger effective population sizes of D. caperata
   are maintained in Pacific mangroves or because D. caperata populations
   underwent a significant bottleneck as a result of local extinction
   followed by recolonization. In addition, we found that D. caperata
   found on L. racemosa was not conspecific with D. caperata from
   non-mangrove hosts and suggest that D. caperata found on L. racemosa
   may be a host specialist.}},

Abstract = {{The advent and maturation of algorithms for estimating species
   trees-phylogenetic trees that allow gene tree heterogeneity and whose
   tips represent lineages, populations and species, as opposed to
   genes-represent an exciting confluence of phylogenetics,
   phylogeography, and population genetics, and ushers in a new generation
   of concepts and challenges for themolecular systematist. In this essay
   I argue that to better deal with the large multilocus datasets brought
   on by phylogenomics, and to better align the fields of phylogeography
   and phylogenetics, we should embrace the primacy of species trees, not
   only as a new and useful practical tool for systematics, but also as a
   long-standing conceptual goal of systematics that, largely due to the
   lack of appropriate computational tools, has been eclipsed in the past
   few decades. I suggest that phylogenies as gene trees are a ``local
   optimum{''} for systematics, and review recent advances that will bring
   us to the broader optimum inherent in species trees. In addition to
   adopting new methods of phylogenetic analysis (and ideally reserving
   the term ``phylogeny{''} for species trees rather than gene trees), the
   new paradigm suggests shifts in a number of practices, such as sampling
   data to maximize not only the number of accumulated sites but also the
   number of independently segregating genes; routinely using coalescent
   or other models in computer simulations to allow gene tree
   heterogeneity; and understanding better the role of concatenation in
   influencing topologies and confidence in phylogenies. By building on
   the foundation laid by concepts of gene trees and coalescent theory,
   and by taking cues from recent trends in multilocus phylogeography,
   molecular systematics stands to be enriched. Many of the challenges and
   lessons learned for estimating gene trees will carry over to the
   challenge of estimating species trees, although adopting the species
   tree paradigm will clarify many issues (such as the nature of
   polytomies and the star tree paradox), raise conceptually new
   challenges, or provide new answers to old questions.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{372}},
Pages = {{87-96}},
Abstract = {{Beginning in the 1930s, eelgrass meadows declined throughout the Wadden
   Sea, leaving populations susceptible to extinction through patchiness,
   low density and isolation. Additional anthropogenic impacts have
   altered current regimes, nutrients and turbidity-all of which affect
   eelgrass. Recent abiotic modeling studies suggest that poor recovery is
   the result of a regime shift caused by the loss of positive feedbacks
   between seagrass meadows and their capacity to mediate turbidity.
   Additionally, it is hypothesized that genetic and demographic
   factors-in particular, the loss of genetic diversity and patch
   connectivity-have contributed to lower fitness of eelgrass, thereby
   further diminishing recovery potential. We assessed genetic diversity
   and connectivity of Zostera marina among 19 locations, covering some
   950 km of coastline between Zeeland, Netherlands and Langholmen,
   Sweden. Both allelic and genotypic diversity were high. A Bayesian
   analysis of population structure revealed 6 significant clusters of
   subpopulations that are connected by varying degrees of dispersal.
   Although population divergence was significant at as little as 5 km,
   isolation by distance was very weak, indicating high connectivity at
   scales of 1.50 km. A demographic interpretation of these data suggests
   that realized gene flow is strong and predominantly northward, leaving
   the western Wadden Sea relatively isolated. The failure of eelgrass to
   recover in the western Wadden Sea is, therefore, due to both unsuitable
   physical conditions and low incoming gene flow, Nonetheless, the
   greater Wadden Sea can be considered a seed transfer zone providing
   source material for restoration efforts in any areas where abiotic
   conditions are more favorable.}},

   African endemic, Caffrogobius caffer (Teleostei: Gobiidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Oceanography and life-history characteristics are known to
   influence the genetic structure of marine species, however the relative
   role that these factors play in shaping phylogeographic patterns
   remains unresolved. The population genetic structure of the endemic,
   rocky shore dwelling Caffrogobius caffer was investigated across a
   known major oceanographic barrier, Cape Agulhas, which has previously
   been shown to strongly influence genetic structuring of South African
   rocky shore and intertidal marine organisms. Given the variable and
   dynamic oceanographical features of the region, we further sought to
   test how the pattern of gene flow between C. caffer populations is
   affected by the dominant Agulhas and Benguela current systems of the
   southern oceans.
   Results: The variable 5' region of the mtDNA control region was
   amplified for 242 individuals from ten localities spanning the
   distributional range of C. caffer. Fifty-five haplotypes were recovered
   and in stark contrast to previous phylogeographic studies of South
   African marine species, C. caffer showed no significant population
   genetic structuring along 1300 km of coastline. The parsimony haplotype
   network, AMOVA and SAMOVA analyses revealed panmixia. Coalescent
   analyses reveal that gene flow in C. caffer is strongly asymmetrical
   and predominantly affected by the Agulhas Current. Notably, there was
   no gene flow between the east coast and all other populations, although
   all other analyses detect no significant population structure,
   suggesting a recent divergence. The mismatch distribution suggests that
   C. caffer underwent a population expansion at least 14 500 years ago.
   Conclusion: We propose several possible life-history adaptations that
   could have enabled C. caffer to maintain gene flow across its
   distributional range, including a long pelagic larval stage. We have
   shown that life-history characteristics can be an important
   contributing factor to the phylogeography of marine species and that
   the effects of oceanography do not necessarily suppress its influence
   on effective dispersal.}},

   butterfly, Lampides boeticus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evolutionary genetics provides a rich theoretical framework
   for empirical studies of phylogeography. Investigations of
   intraspecific genetic variation can uncover new putative species while
   allowing inference into the evolutionary origin and history of extant
   populations. With a distribution on four continents ranging throughout
   most of the Old World, Lampides boeticus ( Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) is
   one of the most widely distributed species of butterfly. It is placed
   in a monotypic genus with no commonly accepted subspecies. Here, we
   investigate the demographic history and taxonomic status of this
   widespread species, and screen for the presence or absence of the
   bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia.
   Results: We performed phylogenetic, population genetic, and
   phylogeographic analyses using 1799 bp of mitochondrial sequence data
   from 57 specimens collected throughout the species' range. Most of the
   samples(> 90\%) were nearly genetically identical, with uncorrected
   pairwise sequence differences of 0 0.5\% across geographic distances >
   9,000 km. However, five samples from central Thailand, Madagascar,
   northern Australia and the Moluccas formed two divergent clades
   differing from the majority of samples by uncorrected pairwise
   distances ranging from 1.79-2.21\%. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that
   L. boeticus is almost certainly monophyletic, with all sampled genes
   coalescing well after the divergence from three closely related taxa
   included for outgroup comparisons. Analyses of molecular diversity
   indicate that most L. boeticus individuals in extant populations are
   descended from one or two relatively recent population bottlenecks.
   Conclusion: The combined analyses suggest a scenario in which the most
   recent common ancestor of L. boeticus and its sister taxon lived in the
   African region approximately 7 Mya; extant lineages of L. boeticus
   began spreading throughout the Old World at least 1.5 Mya. More
   recently, expansion after population bottlenecks approximately 1.4 Mya
   seem to have displaced most of the ancestral polymorphism throughout
   its range, though at least two early-branching lineages still persist.
   One of these lineages, in northern Australia and the Moluccas, may have
   experienced accelerated differentiation due to infection with the
   bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, which affects reproduction.
   Examination of a haplotype network suggests that Australia has been
   colonized by the species several times. While there is little evidence
   for the existence of morphologically cryptic species, these results
   suggest a complex history affected by repeated dispersal events.}},

Abstract = {{Previous genetic studies suggest Cape Cod, MA, as a phylogenetic break
   for benthic marine invertebrates; however, diffuse sampling in this
   area has hindered fine-scale determination of the break's location and

   different places, and others exhibit no breaks in this region. We
   analyze the phylogeographic patterns of 2 mitochondrial genes from 10
   populations of the bamboo worm Clymenella torquata (Annelida:
   Maldanidae) focused around Cape Cod but extending from the Bay of
   Fundy, Canada, to New Jersey. A common invertebrate along the US coast,
   C. torquata, possesses life-history characteristics that should make it
   sensitive to factors such as dispersal barriers, bottlenecks, and
   founder events. As an inhabitant of soft sediments, C. torquata offers
   a unique contrast to existing research dominated by organisms dwelling
   on hard substrates. Our genetic data show a clear phylogenetic break
   and a cline of haplotype frequencies from north to south. Fine-scale
   sampling of populations on Cape Cod, combined with other sampled
   populations, confirm that this distinct break is not on the Cape Cod
   peninsula itself but to the south near a boundary of oceanic water
   masses. Low levels of gene flow occur in these populations, in an

Abstract = {{Incomplete lineage sorting has been documented across a diverse set of
   taxa ranging from song birds to conifers. Such patterns are expected
   theoretically for species characterized by certain life history
   characteristics (e.g. long generation times) and those influenced by
   certain historical demographic events (e.g. recent divergences). A
   number of methods to estimate the underlying species phylogeny from a
   set of gene trees have been proposed and shown to be effective when
   incomplete lineage sorting has occurred. The further effects of gene
   flow on those methods, however, remain to be investigated. Here, we
   focus on the performance of three methods of species tree inference,
   ESP-COAL, minimizing deep coalescence (MDC), and concatenation, when
   incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow jointly confound the
   relationship between gene and species trees. Performance was
   investigated using Monte Carlo coalescent simulations under four models
   (n-island, stepping stone, parapatric, and allopatric) and three
   magnitudes of gene flow (N(e)m = 0.01, 0.10, 1.00). Although results
   varied by the model and magnitude of gene flow, methods incorporating
   aspects of the coalescent process (ESP-COAL and MDC) performed well,
   with probabilities of identifying the correct species tree topology
   typically increasing to greater than 0.75 when five more loci are
   sampled. The only exceptions to that pattern included gene flow at
   moderate to high magnitudes under the n-island and stepping stone
   models. Concatenation performs poorly relative to the other methods. We
   extend these results to a discussion of the importance of species and
   population phylogenies to the fields of molecular systematics and

Abstract = {{The endemic fauna of the Comoro Archipelago is composed of a mixture of
   taxa originating from Africa and Madagascar. Bats are the only native
   land dwelling mammals on this archipelago, but the biogeographical
   origins for the vast majority of species within this group are
   ambiguous. We report here genetic analyses based on two mitochondrial
   DNA markers to infer the origin of Comorian bats belonging to a reputed
   species complex of Miniopterus that is further distributed across
   Africa and Madagascar. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that east
   African M. minor are not closely related to the insular Miniopterus of
   Madagascar and the Comoros (Grande Comore and Anjouan). The latter
   cluster into two distinct, monophyletic clades (Clade 1 and Clade 2).
   Representatives of these clades occur sympatrically both on the Comoros
   and on Madagascar, and are distinguished by a large genetic distance
   (K2P: 9.9\% for cytochrome b). No haplotypes are shared between any
   islands, suggesting the absence of contemporary gene flow. Populations
   of the widespread Clade 1 are furthermore characterized by a
   significant inter-island structure (Phi(CT) = 0.249), and by high
   haplotype and nucleotide diversities (h = 0.90-0.98, pi = 0.04-0.06).
   Demographic analyses of Clade 1 suggest secondary contact between two
   distinct phylogroups (Subclade 1 A and 1B) that reached Grande Comore
   and Anjouan, and a large, stable population with a long evolutionary
   history on Madagascar. These results and the current distribution of
   related lineages suggest that the Comoros were colonized independently
   at least two or three times by ancestors from Madagascar.}},

   material of the haplotype lineages invasive in Europe and Asia, where
   only tetraploid plants occur. To do this, we sequenced 1275 bp of
   chloroplast intergenic spacer DNA in 268 individuals from 57
   populations. In addition, we performed a crossing experiment, which
   supported the hypothesis that chloroplast inheritance in this species
   is maternal. The phylogeographical analysis showed a complex pattern of
   20 haplotypes of diploid and tetraploid plants. In North America, we
   found significant differentiation among regions, private haplotypes,
   and isolation by distance. Ploidy levels were more differentiated in
   the northern regions than in the South. The haplotype network was
   shallow and included one tetraploid-only, star-shaped cluster of
   haplotypes that were particularly successful colonizers. Post-glacial

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence suggest that recent long-distance dispersal
   may have been important in the evolution of intercontinental
   distribution ranges of bryophytes. However, the absolute rate of
   intercontinental migration and its relative role in the development of
   certain distribution ranges is still poorly understood. To this end,
   the genetic structure of intercontinental populations of six peatmoss
   species showing an amphi-Atlantic distribution was investigated using
   microsatellite markers. Methods relying on the coalescent were applied
   (im and migrate) to understand the evolution of this distribution
   pattern in peatmosses. Intercontinental populations of the six peatmoss
   species were weakly albeit significantly differentiated (average F-ST =
   0.104). This suggests that the North Atlantic Ocean is acting as a
   barrier to gene flow even in bryophytes adapted to long-range
   dispersal. The im analysis suggested a relatively recent split of
   intercontinental populations dating back to the last two glacial
   periods (9000-289 000 years ago). In contrast to previous hypotheses,
   analyses indicated that both ongoing migration and ancestral
   polymorphism are important in explaining the intercontinental genetic
   similarity of peatmoss populations, but their relative contribution
   varies with species. Migration rates were significantly asymmetric
   towards America suggesting differential extinction of genotypes on the
   two continents or invasion of the American continent by European
   lineages. These results indicate that low genetic divergence of
   amphi-Atlantic populations is a general pattern across numerous
   flowering plants and bryophytes. However, in bryophytes, ongoing
   intercontinental gene flow and retained shared ancestral polymorphism
   must both be considered to explain the genetic similarity of
   intercontinental populations.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a pivotal tool in molecular ecology,
   evolutionary and population genetics. The power of mtDNA analyses
   derives from a relatively high mutation rate and the apparent
   simplicity of mitochondrial inheritance (maternal, without
   recombination), which has simplified modelling population history
   compared to the analysis of nuclear DNA. However, in biology things are
   seldom simple, and advances in DNA sequencing and polymorphism
   detection technology have documented a growing list of exceptions to
   the central tenets of mitochondrial inheritance, with paternal leakage,
   heteroplasmy and recombination now all documented in multiple systems.
   The presence of paternal leakage, recombination and heteroplasmy can
   have substantial impact on analyses based on mtDNA, affecting
   phylogenetic and population genetic analyses, estimates of the
   coalescent and the myriad of other parameters that are dependent on
   such estimates. Here, we review our understanding of mtDNA inheritance,
   discuss how recent findings mean that established ideas may need to be
   re-evaluated, and we assess the implications of these new-found
   complications for molecular ecologists who have relied for decades on
   the assumption of a simpler mode of inheritance. We show how it is
   possible to account for recombination and heteroplasmy in evolutionary
   and population analyses, but that accurate estimates of the frequencies
   of biparental inheritance and recombination are needed. We also suggest
   how nonclonal inheritance of mtDNA could be exploited, to increase the
   ways in which mtDNA can be used in analyses.}},

Abstract = {{A suite of 10 microsatellite loci was used to examine genetic
   divergence between two sympatric morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus
   alpinus ('dark' and `pale') inhabiting Gander Lake, Newfoundland.
   Results can be summarized as follows: (1) the morphs are strongly
   reproductively isolated - gene flow-migration estimates were
   consistently low in long and short-term evolutionary timescales of
   analysis; (2) intermorph divergence based on allele size (R-ST) was
   significantly larger than those based on allele state (theta) implying
   a cumulative effect of stepwise-like mutations; (3) historical
   (coalescent) and current (linkage disequilibrium) point estimates of
   effective population size (N-e) were consistently higher for dark than
   for pale S. alpinus. The first and second findings lend support to the
   hypothesis that divergence between forms may have preceded the last
   glacial period (ending c. 12 000 years bp). The third finding argues
   for significant differences in habitat quantity and quality between
   morphs, which were emphasized in a previous study. Overall, these

Abstract = {{By providing new approaches to the investigation of demographic and
   evolutionary dynamics of wild populations, molecular genetics has led
   to fundamental changes in our understanding of marine ecology. In
   particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in
   three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the
   discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine
   species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine
   populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant
   differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive
   adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the
   resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive
   change in many populations underlies recent concerns about
   fisheries-induced evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A
   compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective
   population sizes that are 2-6 orders of magnitude smaller than census
   sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species
   than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate
   these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications
   of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the
   management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An
   important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for
   adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to
   be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental
   consequences for the resilience to environmental change - a key
   consideration for sustainable fisheries management.}},

Abstract = {{Clinus cottoides is a fish endemic to the coast of South Africa,
   predominantly inhabiting rock pools. All South African clinids are
   viviparous, but probably breed throughout the year; as such, their
   dispersal may be limited, unlike species with pelagic larval stages. We
   analysed 343 fish from 14 localities on the west, south and east coasts
   using two mitochondrial genes and the second intron of the S7 ribosomal
   gene. Mitochondrial DNA analyses recovered significant genetic
   differentiation between fish populations from the east coast and other
   sampling locations, with a second break found between Gansbaai and Cape
   Agulhas on the south coast. Nuclear DNA recovered shallower, but
   significant, levels of population structure. Coalescent analyses
   suggested remarkably asymmetrical gene flow between sampling locations,
   suggesting that the cold Atlantic Benguela Current and Indian Ocean
   Agulhas counter-current play important roles in facilitating dispersal.
   There was no gene flow between the east coast and the other sites,
   suggesting that these populations are effectively isolated. Divergence
   times between them were estimated to at least 68 000 years. Neutrality
   tests and mismatch distributions suggest recent population expansions,
   with the exception of peripheral western and eastern populations
   (possibly a consequence of environmental extremes at the edge of the
   species distribution). Analyses of the current South African marine

Abstract = {{Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) is a species of conservation
   concern that has experienced significant habitat loss and population
   decline. This, coupled with previous observations that the species
   exhibits strong fidelity to breeding grounds, suggests that breeding
   populations may be genetically differentiated and possibly suffer from
   reduced genetic variation associated with relatively small population
   sizes. A previous genetic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences
   of plovers in Montana and Colorado found high levels of genetic
   variability and very little genetic differentiation among breeding
   locales. Because mitochondrial DNA can track only female movements and
   is sampled from only one locus, we used 14 nuclear microsatellite loci
   to further examine population structure, thereby both documenting male
   movements and providing a more comprehensive view of genetic structure.
   We found no significant differences among breeding populations. The
   most likely number of unique genetic clusters was one, suggesting that
   all sampled breeding locations comprise a single relatively homogenous
   gene pool. Levels of genetic diversity were similar across all four
   populations, with the greatest diversity in the southern plains
   population. We speculate that the lack of detectable genetic
   differentiation among populations is due to sufficient gene flow among
   breeding populations that might ensue if at least some pair bonds are
   formed when birds form mixed flocks on wintering grounds. This study
   corroborates and expands upon the findings of a previous mitochondrial

Title = {{A highly polymorphic insertion in the Y-chromosome amelogenin gene can
   be used for evolutionary biology, population genetics and sexing in
   Cetacea and Artiodactyla}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The early radiation of the Cetartiodactyla is complex, and
   unambiguous molecular characters are needed to clarify the positions of
   hippotamuses, camels and pigs relative to the remaining taxa (Cetacea
   and Ruminantia). There is also a need for informative genealogic
   markers for Y-chromosome population genetics as well as a sexing method
   applicable to all species from this group. We therefore studied the
   sequence variation of a partial sequence of the evolutionary conserved
   amelogenin gene to assess its potential use in each of these fields.
   Results and discussion: We report a large interstitial insertion in the
   Y amelogenin locus in most of the Cetartiodactyla lineages (cetaceans
   and ruminants). This sex-linked size polymorphism is the result of a
   460-465 bp inserted element in intron 4 of the amelogenin gene of
   Ruminants and Cetaceans. Therefore, this polymorphism can easily be
   used in a sexing assay for these species.
   When taking into account this shared character in addition to
   nucleotide sequence, gene genealogy follows sex-chromosome divergence
   in Cetartiodactyla whereas it is more congruent with zoological history
   when ignoring these characters. This could be related to a loss of
   homology between chromosomal copies given the old age of the insertion.
   The 1 kbp Amel-Y amplified fragment is also characterized by high
   nucleotide diversity (64 polymorphic sites spanning over 1 kbp in seven
   haplotypes) which is greater than for other Y-chromosome sequence
   markers studied so far but less than the mitochondrial control region.
   Conclusion: The gender-dependent polymorphism we have identified is
   relevant not only for phylogenic inference within the Cetartiodactyla
   but also for Y-chromosome based population genetics and gender
   determination in cetaceans and ruminants. One single protocol can
   therefore be used for studies in population and evolutionary genetics,
   reproductive biotechnologies, and forensic science.}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the
   non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) have been extensively
   used in order to measure the maternally and paternally inherited
   genetic structure of human populations, and to infer sex-specific
   demography and history. Most studies converge towards the notion that
   among populations, women are genetically less structured than men. This
   has been mainly explained by a higher migration rate of women, due to
   patrilocality, a tendency for men to stay in their birthplace while
   women move to their husband's house. Yet, since population
   differentiation depends upon the product of the effective number of
   individuals within each deme and the migration rate among demes,
   differences in male and female effective numbers and sex-biased
   dispersal have confounding effects on the comparison of genetic
   structure as measured by uniparentally inherited markers. In this
   study, we develop a new multi-locus approach to analyze jointly
   autosomal and X-linked markers in order to aid the understanding of
   sex-specific contributions to population differentiation. We show that
   in patrilineal herder groups of Central Asia, in contrast to bilineal
   agriculturalists, the effective number of women is higher than that of
   men. We interpret this result, which could not be obtained by the
   analysis of mtDNA and NRY alone, as the consequence of the social
   organization of patrilineal populations, in which genetically related
   men (but not women) tend to cluster together. This study suggests that
   differences in sex-specific migration rates may not be the only cause
   of contrasting male and female differentiation in humans, and that
   differences in effective numbers do matter.}},

Abstract = {{Source-sink dynamics have been suggested to characterize the population
   structure of many species, but the prevalence of source-sink systems in
   nature is uncertain because of inherent challenges in estimating
   migration rates among populations. Migration rates are often difficult
   to estimate directly with demographic methods, and indirect genetic
   methods are subject to a variety of assumptions that are difficult to
   meet or to apply to evolutionary timescales. Furthermore, such methods
   cannot be rigorously applied to high-gene-flow species. Here, we employ
   genetic parentage assignments in conjunction with demographic
   simulations to infer the level of immigration into a putative sink
   population. We use individual-based demographic models to estimate
   expected distributions of parent offspring dyads under competing sink
   and closed-population models. By comparing the actual number of
   parent-offspring dyads (identified from multilocus genetic profiles) in
   a random sample of individuals taken from a population to expectations
   under these two contrasting demographic models, it is possible to
   estimate the rate of immigration and test hypotheses related to the
   role of immigration on population processes on an ecological timescale.
   The difference in the expected number of parent-offspring dyads between
   the two population models was greatest when immigration into the sink
   population was high, indicating that unlike traditional population
   genetic inference models, the highest degree of statistical power is
   achieved for the approach presented here when migration rates are high.
   We used the proposed genetic parentage approach to demonstrate that a
   threatened population of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmotus)
   appears to be supplemented by a low level of immigration (similar to
   2-6\% annually) from other populations.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the evolutionary and ecological effects of
   dispersal, there is growing emphasis on the need to integrate direct
   data on movement behaviour into landscape-scale analyses. However,
   little is known about the general link between movement behaviour and
   large-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow. Likewise, although
   recent studies suggest that nonrandom, directionally biased movement
   and dispersal can promote evolutionary divergence, the generality of
   this mechanism is unknown. We test the hypothesis that directionally
   biased movement and dispersal by plethodontid salamanders interact with
   the topography of headwater areas to affect genetic and phenotypic
   divergence. Movements by Gyrinophilus porphyriticus and Eurycea
   bislineata show contrasting directional biases: upstream bias in G.
   porphyriticus and downstream bias in E. bislineata. Consistent with
   predictions of how these biases interact with slope to affect dispersal
   and gene flow, genetic distance increased with slope in G.
   porphyriticus and decreased with slope in E. bislineata over a
   standardized distance of 1 km along six headwater streams. In both
   species, phenotypic divergence in relative trunk length was positively
   related to genetic divergence. These results indicate that
   landscape-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow are closely related
   to movement behaviour in G. porphyriticus and E. bislineata, and
   underscore the value of information on movement behaviour for
   predicting and interpreting patterns of dispersal and gene flow in
   complex landscapes. This study also provides new evidence that
   directionally biased movement and dispersal can be important sources of
   intra- and interspecific variation in population divergence, and
   highlights the value of explicit, a priori predictions in landscape
   genetic studies.}},

   dynamics in a direct developing coral reef fish using 283 individuals
   from 15 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We employed a
   hierarchical sampling design to test genetic models of population
   structure at multiple geographical scales including among regions,
   among shelf position and reefs within regions. Predictions from island,
   isolation-by-distance and meta-population models, including the
   potential for asymmetric migration, local extinction and patterns of
   re-colonisation were examined.
   Results: Acanthochromis polyacanthus displayed strong genetic structure
   among regions (Phi(ST) = 0.81, P < 0.0001) that supported an
   equilibrium isolation-by-distance model (r = 0.77, P = 0.001).
   Significant structuring across the continental shelf was only evident
   in the northern region (Phi(ST) = 0.31, P < 0.001) and no evidence of
   isolation-by-distance was found within any region. Pairwise Phi(ST)
   values indicated overall strong but variable genetic structure (mean
   Phi(ST) among reefs within regions = 0.28, 0.38, 0.41), and asymmetric
   migration rates among reefs with low genetic structure. Genetic
   differentiation among younger reefs was greater than among older reefs
   supporting a meta-population propagule-pool colonisation model.
   Variation in genetic diversities, demographic expansion and population
   growth estimates indicated more frequent genetic bottlenecks/founder
   effects and subsequent population expansion in the central and southern
   regions compared to the northern one.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide genetic evidence for meta-population
   dynamics in a direct developing coral reef fish and we reject the
   equilibrium island and isolation-by distance models at local spatial
   scales. Instead, strong non-equilibrium genetic structure appears to be
   generated by genetic bottlenecks/founder effects associated with
   population reductions/extinctions and asymmetric
   migration/(re)-colonisation of such populations. These meta-population
   dynamics varied across the geographical range examined with edge
   populations exhibiting lower genetic diversities and higher rates of
   population expansion than more central populations. Therefore, coral
   reef species may experience local population reductions/extinctions
   that promote overall meta-population genetic differentiation.}},

Title = {{Genetic structuring and migration patterns of Atlantic bigeye tuna,
   Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Large pelagic fishes are generally thought to have little
   population genetic structuring based on their cosmopolitan
   distribution, large population sizes and high dispersal capacities.
   However, gene flow can be influenced by ecological (e. g. homing
   behaviour) and physical (e. g. present-day ocean currents, past changes
   in sea temperature and levels) factors. In this regard, Atlantic bigeye
   tuna shows an interesting genetic structuring pattern with two highly
   divergent mitochondrial clades (Clades I and II), which are assumed to
   have been originated during the last Pleistocene glacial maxima. We
   assess genetic structure patterns of Atlantic bigeye tuna at the
   nuclear level, and compare them with mitochondrial evidence.
   Results: We examined allele size variation of nine microsatellite loci
   in 380 individuals from the Gulf of Guinea, Canary, Azores, Canada,
   Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. To investigate temporal stability of
   genetic structure, three Atlantic Ocean sites were re-sampled a second
   year. Hierarchical AMOVA tests, R-ST pairwise comparisons, isolation by
   distance (Mantel) tests, Bayesian clustering analyses, and
   coalescence-based migration rate inferences supported unrestricted gene
   flow within the Atlantic Ocean at the nuclear level, and therefore
   interbreeding between individuals belonging to both mitochondrial
   clades. Moreover, departures from HWE in several loci were inferred for
   the samples of Guinea, and attributed to a Wahlund effect supporting
   the role of this region as a spawning and nursery area. Our
   microsatellite data supported a single worldwide panmictic unit for
   bigeye tunas. Despite the strong Agulhas Current, immigration rates
   seem to be higher from the Atlantic Ocean into the Indo-Pacific Ocean,
   but the actual number of individuals moving per generation is
   relatively low compared to the large population sizes inhabiting each
   ocean basin.
   Conclusion: Lack of congruence between mt and nuclear evidences, which
   is also found in other species, most likely reflects past events of
   isolation and secondary contact. Given the inferred relatively low
   number of immigrants per generation around the Cape of Good Hope, the
   proportions of the mitochondrial clades in the different oceans may
   keep stable, and it seems plausible that the presence of individuals
   belonging to the mt Clade I in the Atlantic Ocean may be due to
   extensive migrations that predated the last glaciation.}},

Abstract = {{Disentangling the relative contributions of selective and neutral
   processes underlying phenotypic and genetic variation under natural,
   environmental conditions remains a central challenge in evolutionary
   ecology. However, much of the variation that could be informative in
   this area of research is likely to be cryptic in nature; thus, the
   identification of wild populations suitable for study may be
   problematic. We use a landscape genetics approach to identify such
   populations of three-spined stickleback inhabiting the Saint Lawrence
   River estuary. We sampled 1865 adult fish over multiple years.
   Individuals were genotyped for nine microsatellite loci, and
   georeferenced multilocus data were used to infer population groupings,
   as well as locations of genetic discontinuities, under a Bayesian model
   framework (GENELAND). We modelled environmental data using
   nonparametric multiple regression to explain genetic differentiation as
   a function of spatio-ecological effects. Additionally, we used genotype
   data to estimate dispersal and gene flow to parameterize a simple model
   predicting adaptive vs. plastic divergence between demes. We
   demonstrate a bipartite division of the genetic landscape into
   freshwater and maritime zones, independent of geographical distance.
   Moreover, we show that the greatest proportion of genetic variation
   (31.5\%) is explained by environmental differences. However, the
   potential for either adaptive or plastic divergence between demes is
   highly dependent upon the strength of migration and selection.
   Consequently, we highlight the utility of landscape genetics as a tool
   for hypothesis generation and experimental design, to identify focal
   populations and putative selection gradients, in order to distinguish
   between phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary viability of an endangered species depends upon gene
   flow among subpopulations and the degree of habitat patch connectivity.
   Contrasting population connectivity over ecological and evolutionary
   timescales may provide novel insight into what maintains genetic
   diversity within threatened species. We employed this integrative
   approach to evaluating dispersal in the critically endangered Coahuilan
   box turtle (Terrapene coahuila) that inhabits isolated wetlands in the
   desert-spring ecosystem of Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. Recent wetland
   habitat loss has altered the spatial distribution and connectivity of
   habitat patches; and we therefore predicted that T. coahuila would
   exhibit limited movement relative to estimates of historic gene flow.
   To evaluate contemporary dispersal patterns, we employed mark-recapture
   techniques at both local (wetland complex) and regional (intercomplex)
   spatial scales. Gene flow estimates were obtained by surveying genetic
   variation at nine microsatellite loci in seven subpopulations located
   across the species' geographical range. The mark-recapture results at
   the local spatial scale reveal frequent movement among wetlands that
   was unaffected by interwetland distance. At the regional spatial scale,
   dispersal events were relatively less frequent between wetland
   complexes. The complementary analysis of population genetic
   substructure indicates strong historic gene flow (global F-ST = 0.01).
   However, a relationship of genetic isolation by distance across the
   geographical range suggests that dispersal limitation exists at the
   regional scale. Our approach of contrasting direct and indirect
   estimates of dispersal at multiple spatial scales in T. coahuila
   conveys a sustainable evolutionary trajectory of the species pending
   preservation of threatened wetland habitats and a range-wide network of
   corridors.}},

Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-46}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Mayr's best recognized scientific contributions include the biological
   species concept and the theory of geographic speciation. In the latter,
   reproductive isolation evolves as an incidental by-product of genetic
   divergence between allopatric populations. Mayr noted that divergent
   natural selection could accelerate speciation, but also argued that
   gene flow so strongly retards divergence that, even with selection,
   non-allopatric speciation is unlikely. However, current theory and data
   demonstrate that substantial divergence, and even speciation, in the
   face of gene flow is possible. Here, I attempt to connect some opposing
   views about speciation by integrating Mayr's ideas about the roles of
   ecology and geography in speciation with current data and theory. My
   central premise is that the speciation process (i.e. divergence) is
   often continuous, and that the opposing processes of selection and gene
   flow interact to determine the degree of divergence (i.e. the degree of
   progress towards the completion of speciation). I first establish that,
   in the absence of gene flow, divergent selection often promotes
   speciation. I then discuss how population differentiation in the face
   of gene flow is common when divergent selection occurs. However, such
   population differentiation does not always lead to the evolution of
   discontinuities, strong reproductive isolation, and thus speciation per
   se. I therefore explore the genetic and ecological circumstances that
   facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow. For example, particular
   genetic architectures or ecological niches may tip the balance between
   selection and gene flow strongly in favour of selection. The
   circumstances allowing selection to overcome gene flow to the extent
   that a discontinuity develops, and how often these circumstances occur,
   are major remaining questions in speciation research. (C) 2008 The

   parrots of the Crimson Rosella Platycercus elegans complex to
   understand the history and present genetic structure of the ring they

   reject that a continuous circular distribution has been involved in the

   genetics parameters in one of these isolates was accompanied by
   geographical range expansion, secondary contact and hybridization on
   the eastern and western sides of the ring. Pleistocene landscape and
   sea-level and habitat changes then established the birds' current

   polymorphism may indicate that Arctic warbler has a unique and complex
   phylogeographic history that differs significantly from other species
   with similar ranges. Our analyses of complete mtDNA ND2 sequences of 88

   A proliferation of different approaches, sequences, and genomes have
   provided for the integration of a `biogeography of the Late Neogene'
   with other Earth and biological sciences under the rubrics of
   phylogeography, landscape genetics, and phylochronology. Approaches

Abstract = {{Spalacopus cyanus is a subterranean rodent inhabiting coastal and
   mountain habitats. Individuals from mountain populations are larger
   than individuals from the coast, and mountain populations have a more
   limited geographic range. To investigate the genetic structure and
   biogeography of this species, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA control
   region sequences. We found low levels of nucleotide diversity in
   comparison with other subterranean rodents. Coastal populations had
   higher nucleotide diversity and effective population size than mountain
   populations. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum parsimony and a
   haplotype network generated using statistical parsimony recognized 3
   groups of haplotypes: northern coastal and mountain populations,
   central coastal populations, and southern coastal population.
   Consistent with the presence of unshared haplotypes, migration rates
   were practically 0, except from Valparaiso to Ventanas and from La
   Parva to Huentelauquen. We observed asymmetric migration rates from
   mountain to coastal populations, suggesting that this species
   originated in the Andean mountains. A likelihood ration test could not
   reject the null hypothesis of a stable population when all sequences
   were grouped into a single population and when coastal populations were
   analyzed separately. However, a negative exponential growth parameter
   was estimated for mountain populations,suggesting that these
   populations have undergone recent demographic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Genealogy based methods were used to estimate phylogeographic history

   (Hook. f.) Quinn). DNA from trees in eight populations was sequenced
   using three chloroplast primers (trnS-trnT, trnD-trnT, and psbC-trnS).
   Mean nucleotide diversity was low (pi = 0.00093 +/- 0.00006) from 892
   base pairs of sequence, but varied in stands from 0.0 to 0.001 15. Two
   of the five haplotypes were widely distributed, but the most frequently
   occurring haplotype Was found only in the western portion of the range.
   Population Structure was highly significant among populations overall
   (G(ST) = 0.261, where G(ST) is the coefficient of gene differentiation,
   and p <= 0.0001), and there were indications of significant isolation
   by distance (p <= 0.022). Populations exhibited the highest levels of
   differentiation between the Southeastern and northwestern watersheds.
   Estimates of migration between Populations obtained using both
   parametric and nonparametric methods indicated levels of gene flow

   demonstrated a pattern of genetic diversity in Huon pine that is
   consistent with a history of range expansion. The exceptionally low
   level of nucleotide diversity, haplotype distribution. and

Abstract = {{Aim contractions of species ranges, with accompanying fragmentation and
   population bottlenecks, which are evidenced by spatial variation in
   genetic structure of populations. We examine here hypotheses concerning
   dispersal and vicariance in response to historical geoclimatic change
   and potential isolation produced by mountains and water barriers.
   Location The temperate rain forest of southern South America, which is
   distributed from coastal Chile, including the large continental island
   of Chiloe, across the Andes into Argentina.
   Methods We investigated our hypotheses in the phylogenetically and
   biogeographically relictual marsupial Dromiciops gliroides. We examined
   56 specimens, which resulted from field samples and museum study skins
   from 21 localities. We evaluated the influence of two major barriers,
   the Andean cordillera and the waterway between the mainland and the
   large island of Chiloe, by performing Bayesian and maximum-likelihood
   phylogenetic analyses on sequences of 877 base pairs of mitochondrial
   DNA. We further tested the contribution of the proposed geographical
   barriers using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). We also
   evaluated the responses of populations to historical north-south shifts
   of habitat associated with glacial history and sea-level change.
   Results Our analyses revealed a phylogeny with three clades, two of
   which are widespread and contain nearly all the haplotypes: a northern
   clade (36-39 degrees S) and a southern clade (40-43 degrees S). These
   two clades contain forms from both sides of the Andes. Within the
   southern clade, island and mainland forms were not significantly
   differentiated. Tests of recent demographic change revealed that
   southern populations have experienced recent expansion, whereas
   northern populations exhibit long-term stability. The direction of
   recent gene flow and range expansion is predominantly from Chile to
   Argentina, with a modest reciprocal exchange across the Andes. Recent
   gene flow from the island of Chiloe to the mainland is also supported.
   Main conclusions The genetic structure of contemporary D. gliroides
   populations suggests recent gene flow across the Andes and between the
   mainland and the island of Chiloe. Differences in demographic history
   that we detected between northern and southern populations have
   resulted from historical southward shifts of habitat associated with
   glacial recession in South America. Our results add to a growing
   literature that demonstrates the value of genetic data to illuminate
   how environmental history shapes species range and population structure.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2080-2091}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are
   available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single
   statement of phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple alleles
   are sampled from individual species, it becomes more challenging to
   estimate relationships at the level of species, either because
   concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts among individual
   gene trees, or because the species from which multiple alleles have
   been sampled may not form monophyletic groups in the estimated tree. We
   propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees from
   multipleallele, multilocus sequence data, building on a recently
   proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele
   multilocus data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
   is adopted to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree.
   The model is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species
   trees for two multiple-allele datasets-yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds
   (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our method
   are consistent with those inferred from other methods and genetic
   markers, but in contrast to other species tree methods, it provides
   credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach described
   here provides a powerful framework for statistical testing and
   integration of population genetics and phylogenetics.}},

Abstract = {{The Basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG)-1 IA
   is a major pathogen of soybean in Brazil, where the average yield
   losses have reached 30 to 60\% in some states in Northern Brazil. No
   information is currently available concerning levels of genetic
   diversity and population structure for this pathogen in Brazil. A total
   of 232 isolates of R. solani AG1 IA were collected from five soybean
   fields in the most important soybean production areas in
   central-western, northern, and northeastern Brazil. These isolates were
   genotyped using 10 microsatellite loci. Most of the multilocus
   genotypes (MLGTs) were site-specific, with few MLGTs shared among
   populations. Significant population subdivision was evident. High
   levels of admixture were observed for populations from Mato Grosso and
   Tocantins. After removing admixed genotypes, three out of five field
   populations (Maranhao, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins), were in
   Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium, consistent with sexual recombination.
   HW and gametic disequilibrium were found for the remaining
   soybean-infecting populations. The findings of low genotypic diversity,
   departures from HW equilibrium, gametic disequilibrium, and high degree
   of population subdivision in these R. solani AG-1 IA populations from
   Brazil are consistent with predominantly asexual reproduction,
   short-distance dispersal of vegetative propagules (mycelium or
   sclerotia), and limited long-distance dispersal, possibly via
   contaminated seed. None of the soybean-infecting populations showed a
   reduction in population size (bottleneck effect). We detected
   asymmetric historical migration among the soybean-infecting
   populations, which could explain the observed levels of subdivision.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-based differences in dispersal distances can affect critical

   are most diverse and abundant in the tropics, few tropical reptiles
   have been studied in this respect. We combine data from a long-term
   (10-year) mark-recapture study with genetic information (based on nine
   microsatellite markers) on slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus,
   Colubridae) in the Australian wet-dry tropics. Males attain larger body
   sizes than females, and both genetic and mark-recapture data show that
   males also disperse further than females. Recapture records show that
   hatchling males dispersed away from their release points whereas
   hatchling females did not, and adult males moved further than adult
   females. In the genetic analysis, males contributed less to overall
   F-ST and relatedness than did females (F-STm = 0.0025, F-STf = 0.0275,

   autocorrelation analyses within the largest population revealed a

   31 localities in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand. A nested clade
   analysis was performed to detect and evaluate any geographical patterns
   in the observed variation and to identify genetic subpopulations or
   clades. Coalescent simulations were used to compare different
   historical biogeographical hypotheses for N. aperta and S. mekongi. A
   coalescent based method was also used to provide maximum likelihood
   estimates (MLEs) for effective populations sizes and historical growth
   and migration rates. Dates were also estimated for phylogenetic events
   on the gene tree reconstructed for the sampled haplotypes (e.g. the
   time to most recent common ancestor). N. aperta was found to be divided
   into two monophyletic clades, a spring-dwelling form of northern Lao
   PDR and a more widespread larger-river dwelling form of southern Lao
   PDR and Cambodia: this divergence was dated at 9.3 Ma. The populations

Abstract = {{Question: How do post-glacial colonization history and current

   Study system: Eleven populations of lacustrine threespine sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from a single watershed, and two adjacent
   marine populations of G. aculeatus as outgroups.
   Methods: Individuals were genotyped using six microsatellite loci and
   several population genetic parameters were calculated (including
   genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, migration, and divergence
   time). We regressed population genetic parameters against environmental
   variables such as stream gradient and length, distance from the mouth
   of the watershed, and lake area.
   Results: Genetic differentiation was highest between lakes separated by
   high-gradient streams, but was unaffected by stream length. Estimated
   divergence times between adjoining populations declined from >10,000
   years ago for lake pairs close to the ocean to less than 5000 years for
   lake pairs near the top of the watershed. Genetic diversity declined as
   a function of geographic distance from the mouth of the watershed but
   was positively correlated with lake area,
   Conclusions: Our findings confirm expectations that landscape features
   such as stream gradient and stream branching structure strongly
   influence patterns of genetic divergence. However, in contrast to
   previous studies, we found no significant relationship between
   geographic distance and genetic divergence among lake pairs. We present
   novel evidence that post-glacial colonization occurred gradually over a

Abstract = {{We revisited a classic study of morphological variation in the oldfield
   mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) to estimate the strength of selection
   acting on pigmentation patterns and to identify the underlying genes.
   We measured 215 specimens collected by Francis Sumner in the 1920s from
   eight populations across a 155-km, environmentally variable transect
   from the white sands of Florida's Gulf coast to the dark, loamy soil of
   southeastern Alabama. Like Sumner, we found significant variation among
   populations: mice inhabiting coastal sand dunes had larger feet, longer
   tails, and lighter pigmentation than inland populations. Most striking,
   all seven pigmentation traits examined showed a sharp decrease in
   reflectance about 55 km from the coast, with most of the phenotypic
   change occurring over less than 10 km. The largest change in soil
   reflectance occurred just south of this break in pigmentation.
   Geographic analysis of microsatellite markers shows little
   interpopulation differentiation, so the abrupt change in pigmentation
   is not associated with recent secondary contact or reduced gene flow
   between adjacent populations. Using these genetic data, we estimated
   that the strength of selection needed to maintain the observed
   distribution of pigment traits ranged from 0.0004 to 21\%, depending on
   the trait and model used. We also examined changes in allele frequency
   of SNPs in two pigmentation genes, Mc1r and Agouti, and show that
   mutations in the cis-regulatory region of Agouti may contribute to this
   cline in pigmentation. The concordance between environmental variation
   and pigmentation in the face of high levels of interpopulation gene
   flow strongly implies that natural selection is maintaining a steep
   cline in pigmentation and the genes underlying it.}},

   Phylogenetic analyses, Bayesian clustering, and phylogeographical
   analyses of statistical parsimony haplotype network consistently
   divided the populations into three clades: a central China (CC) clade,
   a northern plus northeastern China (NN) clade and a southwestern China

   N(e)m values estimated using a coalescent-based method were small (< 2

   results imply that the genetic differentiation of this borer, which is
   approximately in accordance with its observed number of generations per

   to climatic and/or geological events (e.g. the last glacial maximum)

   analyses identify the Caribbean population of C. multilineata as the
   oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the
   circum-Atlantic radiation of this species. However, some Caribbean
   haplotypes in this species were derived from Brazilian lineages,
   indicating that mtDNA diversity has not only originated but also
   accumulated in the Greater Caribbean. Data from the wrasses and
   parrotfishes indicate an origin in the Greater Caribbean in one case,
   Caribbean origin plus accumulation in another, and accumulation in the
   remaining two.
   Conclusion: Our analyses indicate that the Greater Caribbean marine
   biodiversity hotspot did not arise through the action of a single mode
   of evolutionary change. Reef fish distributions at the boundaries
   between Caribbean and Brazilian provinces (the SE Caribbean and NE
   Brazil, respectively) indicate that the microevolutionary patterns we
   detected in C. multilineata and other reef fishes translate into
   macroevolutionary processes and that origin and accumulation have acted
   in concert to form the Greater Caribbean biodiversity hotspot.}},

Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adaptive radiation within fishes of the Coregonus lavaretus
   complex has created numerous morphs, posing significant challenges for
   taxonomy and conservation priorities. The highly endangered North Sea
   houting (C. oxyrhynchus; abbreviated NSH) has been considered a
   separate species from European lake whitefish (C. lavaretus;
   abbreviated ELW) due to morphological divergence and adaptation to
   oceanic salinities. However, its evolutionary and taxonomic status is
   controversial. We analysed microsatellite DNA polymorphism in nine
   populations from the Jutland Peninsula and the Baltic Sea, representing
   NSH (three populations, two of which are reintroduced) and ELW (six
   populations). The objectives were to: 1) analyse postglacial
   recolonization of whitefish in the region; 2) assess the evolutionary
   distinctiveness of NSH, and 3) apply several approaches for defining
   conservation units towards setting conservation priorities for NSH.
   Results: Bayesian cluster analyses of genetic differentiation
   identified four major groups, corresponding to NSH and three groups of
   ELW (Western Jutland, Central Jutland, Baltic Sea). Estimates of
   historical migration rates indicated recolonization in a north-eastern
   direction, suggesting that all except the Baltic Sea population
   predominantly represent postglacial recolonization via the ancient Elbe
   River. Contemporary gene flow has not occurred between NSH and ELW,
   with a divergence time within the last 4,000 years suggested from
   coalescence methods. NSH showed interbreeding with ELW when brought
   into contact by stocking. Thus, reproductive isolation of NSH was not
   absolute, although possible interbreeding beyond the F1 level could not
   be resolved.
   Conclusion: Fishes of the C. lavaretus complex in the Jutland Peninsula
   originate from the same recolonization event. NSH has evolved recently
   and its species status may be questioned due to incomplete reproductive
   isolation from ELW, but it was shown to merit consideration as an
   independent conservation unit. Yet, application of several approaches
   for defining conservation units generated mixed outcomes regarding its
   conservation priority. Within the total species complex, it remains one
   among many recently evolved unique forms. Its uniqueness and high
   conservation priority is more evident at a local geographical scale,
   where conservation efforts will also benefit populations of a number of
   other endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the genetic structure of Atlantic cod have focused on
   small geographical scales. In the present study, the genetic structure
   of cod sampled on spawning grounds in the North Atlantic was examined
   using eight microsatellite loci and the Pan I locus. A total of 954 cod
   was collected from nine different regions: the Baltic Sea, the North
   Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and Icelandic waters during spring
   2002 and spring 2003, from Norwegian waters and the Faroe Islands
   (North and West spawning grounds) in spring 2003, and from Canadian
   waters in 1998. Temporal stability among spawning grounds was observed
   in Icelandic waters and the Celtic Sea, and no significant difference
   was observed between the samples from the Baltic Sea and between the
   samples from Faroese waters. F-statistics showed significant
   differences between most populations and a pattern of
   isolation-by-distance was described with microsatellite loci. The Pan I
   locus revealed the presence of two genetically distinguishable basins,
   the North-west Atlantic composed of the Icelandic and Canadian samples
   and the North-east Atlantic composed of all other samples. Permutation
   of allele sizes at each microsatellite locus among allelic states
   supported a mutational component to the genetic differentiation,
   indicating a historical origin of the observed variation. Estimation of
   the time of divergence was approximately 3000 generations, which places
   the origin of current genetic pattern of cod in the North Atlantic in
   the late Weichselian (Wisconsinian period), at last glacial maximum.

Abstract = {{Agriculture played a significant role in increasing the number of
   pathogen species and in expanding their geographic range during the
   last 10,000 years. We tested the hypothesis that a fungal pathogen of
   cereals and grasses emerged at the time of domestication of cereals in
   the Fertile Crescent and subsequently speciated after adaptation to its
   hosts. Rhynchosporium secalis, originally described from rye, causes an
   important disease on barley called scald, although it also infects
   other species of Hordeum and Agropyron. Phylogenetic analyses based on
   four DNA sequence loci identified three host-associated lineages that
   were confirmed by cross-pathogenicity tests. Bayesian analyses of
   divergence time suggested that the three lineages emerged between
   similar to 1200 to 3600 years before present (B.P.) with a 95\% highest
   posterior density ranging from 100 to 12,000 years B.P. depending on
   the implemented clock models. The coalescent inference of demographic
   history revealed a very recent population expansion for all three
   pathogens. We propose that Rhynchosporium on barley, rye, and Agropyron
   host species represent three cryptic pathogen species that underwent
   independent evolution and ecological divergence by host-specialization.
   We postulate that the recent emergence of these pathogens followed host
   shifts. The subsequent population expansions followed the expansion of
   the cultivated host populations and accompanying expansion of the weedy
   Agropyron spp. found in fields of cultivated cereals. Hence,
   agriculture played a major role in the emergence of the scald diseases,
   the adaptation of the pathogens to new hosts and their worldwide
   dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of a broad hybrid zone involving three

   the hybrid zone. Samples from 24 populations within parental ranges and
   the hybrid zone were analyzed for variation at microsatellite and
   intersimple sequence repeat loci. The results indicated that genetic
   variability was similar among parental and hybrid populations,
   indicating no evident increased diversity in the hybrid zone. Most
   hybrid individuals were genetically more similar to A. sylvatica than
   to the other two species, and the overall genetic structure of the
   hybrid zone is asymmetrically biased toward A. sylvatica. Our analyses
   supported occasional recurrent long-distant gene flow from A. pavia and
   frequent gene flow from A. sylvatica into the hybrid zone, agreeing
   with results of a previous allozyme study. Collectively, the data from
   our study and previous allozyme and chloroplast DNA studies indicate

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Faced with sudden environmental changes, animals must either adapt to
   novel environments or go extinct. Thus, study of the mechanisms
   underlying rapid adaptation is crucial not only for the understanding
   of natural evolutionary processes but also for the understanding of
   human-induced evolutionary change, which is an increasingly important
   problem {[}1-8]. In the present study, we demonstrate that the
   frequency of completely plated threespine stickleback fish
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has increased in an urban freshwater lake
   (Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington) within the last 40 years. This
   is a dramatic example of ``reverse evolution,{''} {[}9] because the
   general evolutionary trajectory is toward armor-plate reduction in
   freshwater sticklebacks {[}10]. On the basis of our genetic studies and
   simulations, we propose that the most likely cause of reverse evolution
   is increased selection for the completely plated morph, which we
   suggest could result from higher levels of trout predation after a
   sudden increase in water transparency during the early 1970s. Rapid
   evolution was facilitated by the existence of standing allelic
   variation in Ectodysplasin (Eda), the gene that underlies the major
   plate-morph locus {[}11]. The Lake Washington stickleback thus provides
   a novel example of reverse evolution, which is probably caused by a
   change in allele frequency at the major plate locus in response to a
   changing predation regime.}},

Title = {{GENOMEPOP: A program to simulate genomes in populations}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are several situations in population biology research
   where simulating DNA sequences is useful. Simulation of biological
   populations under different evolutionary genetic models can be
   undertaken using backward or forward strategies. Backward simulations,
   also called coalescent-based simulations, are computationally
   efficient. The reason is that they are based on the history of lineages
   with surviving offspring in the current population. On the contrary,
   forward simulations are less efficient because the entire population is
   simulated from past to present. However, the coalescent framework
   imposes some limitations that forward simulation does not. Hence, there
   is an increasing interest in forward population genetic simulation and
   efficient new tools have been developed recently. Software tools that
   allow efficient simulation of large DNA fragments under complex
   evolutionary models will be very helpful when trying to better
   understand the trace left on the DNA by the different interacting
   evolutionary forces. Here I will introduce GenomePop, a forward
   simulation program that fulfills the above requirements. The use of the
   program is demonstrated by studying the impact of intracodon
   recombination on global and site-specific dN/dS estimation.
   Results: I have developed algorithms and written software to
   efficiently simulate, forward in time, different Markovian nucleotide
   or codon models of DNA mutation. Such models can be combined with
   recombination, at inter and intra codon levels, fitness-based selection
   and complex demographic scenarios.
   Conclusion: GenomePop has many interesting characteristics for
   simulating SNPs or DNA sequences under complex evolutionary and
   demographic models. These features make it unique with respect to other
   simulation tools. Namely, the possibility of forward simulation under
   General Time Reversible (GTR) mutation or GTR x MG94 codon models with
   intra-codon recombination, arbitrary, user-defined, migration patterns,
   diploid or haploid models, constant or variable population sizes, etc.
   It also allows simulation of fitness-based selection under different
   distributions of mutational effects. Under the 2-allele model it allows
   the simulation of recombination hot-spots, the definition of different
   frequencies in different populations, etc. GenomePop can also manage
   large DNA fragments. In addition, it has a scaling option to save
   computation time when simulating large sequences and population sizes
   under complex demographic and evolutionary situations. These and many
   other features are detailed in its web page {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary trajectories of codistributed taxa with comparable
   ecological preferences and dispersal abilities may be similarly
   impacted by historical landscape-level processes. Species' responses to

   molecular data, temporal contrasts of congruence among taxa with
   respect to these responses can be made. Such contrasts provide insights
   into the relative influence of ancient versus more recent climatic (and
   other) impacts on genetic structuring. Using phylogenetic, allele
   frequency, and genotypic data from two low-mobility,
   rotting-log-adapted (saproxylic) springtail species (Collembola) from
   an isolated 100-km-long section of the Great Dividing Range in
   southeastern Australia, we tested the concerted-response hypothesis
   over three timescales. Tests of phylogeographic, demographic, and
   contemporary population-genetic congruence were performed using an
   integrative approach that draws on both direct (pattern-based) and
   indirect (scenario-based) analyses. Our data revealed a general pattern
   of broad-scale similarities in species' responses to the interaction
   between Pleistocene climatic cycles and landscape setting, overlaid
   with some species-specific differences on local geographic and more
   recent temporal scales. This general pattern of phylogeographic

Abstract = {{Adaptive diversification is driven by selection in ecologically
   different environments. In absence of geographical barriers to
   dispersal, this adaptive divergence (AD) may be constrained by gene
   flow (GF). And yet the reverse may also be true, with AD constraining
   GF (i.e. `ecological speciation'). Both of these causal effects have
   frequently been inferred from the presence of negative correlations
   between AD and GF in nature - yet the bi-directional causality warrants
   caution in such inferences. We discuss how the ability of correlative
   studies to infer causation might be improved through the simultaneous
   measurement of multiple ecological and evolutionary variables. On the
   one hand, inferences about the causal role of GF can be made by
   examining correlations between AD and the potential for dispersal. On
   the other hand, inferences about the causal role of AD can be made by
   examining correlations between GF and environmental differences.
   Experimental manipulations of dispersal and environmental differences
   are a particularly promising approach for inferring causation. At
   present, the best studies find strong evidence that GF constrains AD
   and some studies also find the reverse. Improvements in empirical
   approaches promise to eventually allow general inferences about the

Abstract = {{The localization of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refugia is crucial
   information to understand a species' history and predict its reaction
   to future climate changes. However, many phylogeographical studies
   often lack sampling designs intensive enough to precisely localize
   these refugia. The hairy land snail Trochulus villosus has a small
   range centred on Switzerland, which could be intensively covered by
   sampling 455 individuals from 52 populations. Based on mitochondrial
   DNA sequences (COI and 16S), we identified two divergent lineages with
   distinct geographical distributions. Bayesian skyline plots suggested
   that both lineages expanded at the end of the LGM. To find where the
   origin populations were located, we applied the principles of ancestral
   character reconstruction and identified a candidate refugium for each
   mtDNA lineage: the French Jura and Central Switzerland, both ice-free
   during the LGM. Additional refugia, however, could not be excluded, as
   suggested by the microsatellite analysis of a population subset.
   Modelling the LGM niche of T. villosus, we showed that suitable
   climatic conditions were expected in the inferred refugia, but
   potentially also in the nunataks of the alpine ice shield. In a model
   selection approach, we compared several alternative recolonization
   scenarios by estimating the Akaike information criterion for their
   respective maximum-likelihood migration rates. The `two refugia'
   scenario received by far the best support given the distribution of
   genetic diversity in T. villosus populations. Provided that fine-scale
   sampling designs and various analytical approaches are combined, it is
   possible to refine our necessary understanding of species responses to

Abstract = {{The morphological features of pollen and seed of Araucaria angustifolia
   have led to the proposal of limited gene dispersal for this species. We
   used nuclear microsatellite and AFLP markers to assess patterns of
   genetic variation in six natural populations at the intra- and
   inter-population level, and related our findings to gene dispersal in
   this species. Estimates of both fine-scale spatial genetic structure
   (SGS) and migration rate suggest relatively short-distance gene
   dispersal. However, gene dispersal differed among populations, and
   effects of more efficient dispersal within population were observed in
   at least one stand. In addition, even though some seed dispersal may be
   aggregated in this principally barochorous species, reasonable
   secondary seed dispersal, presumably facilitated by animals, and
   overlap of seed shadows within populations is suggested. Overall, no
   correlation was observed between levels of SGS and inbreeding, density
   or age structure, except that a higher level of SGS was revealed for
   the population with a higher number of juvenile individuals. A low
   estimate for the number of migrants per generation between two
   neighbouring populations implies limited gene flow. We expect that
   stepping-stone pollen flow may have contributed to low genetic
   differentiation among populations observed in a previous survey. Thus,
   strategies for maintenance of gene flow among remnant populations
   should be considered in order to avoid degrading effects of population
   fragmentation on the evolution of A. angustifolia.}},

Abstract = {{To assess genetic diversity in the blue-listed purple martin (Progne
   subis) population in British Columbia, we analysed mitochondrial
   control region sequences of 93 individuals from British Columbia and
   121 individuals collected from seven localities of the western and
   eastern North American subspecies P. s. arboricola and P. s. subis,
   respectively. Of the 47 haplotypes we detected, 34 were found
   exclusively in western populations, and 12 were found only in eastern
   populations. The most common eastern haplotype (25) was also found in
   three nestlings in British Columbia and one in Washington. Another
   British Columbia nestling had a haplotype (35) that differed by a C to
   T transition from haplotype 25. Coalescent analysis indicated that
   these five nestlings are probably descendents of recent immigrants
   dispersing from east to the west, because populations were estimated to
   have diverged about 200,000-400,000 ybp, making ancestral polymorphism
   a less likely explanation. Maximum likelihood estimates of gene flow
   among all populations detected asymmetrical gene flow into British
   Columbia not only of rare migrants from the eastern subspecies in
   Alberta but also a substantial number of migrants from the adjacent
   Washington population, and progressively lower numbers from Oregon in
   an isolation-by distance pattern. The influx of migrants from different
   populations is consistent with the migrant-pool model of recolonization
   which has maintained high genetic diversity in the small recovering
   population in British Columbia. Thus, the risk to this population is
   not from genetic erosion or inbreeding following a severe population
   crash, but from demographic stochasticity and extinction in small
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Lebanon is an eastern Mediterranean country inhabited by approximately
   four million people with a wide variety of ethnicities and religions,
   including Muslim, Christian, and Druze. In the present study, 926
   Lebanese men were typed with Y-chromosomal SNP and STR markers, and
   unusually, male genetic variation within Lebanon was found to be more
   strongly structured by religious affiliation than by geography. We
   therefore tested the hypothesis that migrations within historical times
   could have contributed to this situation. Y-haplogroupJ{*}(xJ2) was
   more frequent in the putative Muslim source region (the Arabian
   Peninsula) than in Lebanon, and it was also more frequent in Lebanese
   Muslims than in Lebanese non-Muslims. Conversely, haplogroup R1b was
   more frequent in the putative Christian source region (western Europe)
   than in Lebanon and was also more frequent in Lebanese Christians than
   in Lebanese non-Christians. The most common R1b STR-haplotype in
   Lebanese Christians was otherwise highly specific for western Europe
   and was unlikely to have reached its current frequency in Lebanese
   Christians without admixture. We therefore suggest that the Islamic
   expansion from the Arabian Peninsula beginning in the seventh century
   CE introduced lineages typical of this area into those who subsequently
   became Lebanese Muslims, whereas the Crusader activity in the
   11(th)-13(th) centuries CE introduced western European lineages into
   Lebanese Christians.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic technologies developed in the last 20 years have lead to novel
   and exciting methods to identify genes and specific nucleotides within
   genes that control phenotypes in field collected organisms. In this
   review we define and explain two of these methods: linkage
   disequilibrium (D) mapping and quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN)
   mapping. The power to detect valid genotype-phenotype associations with
   LD or QTN mapping depends critically on the extent to which segregating
   sites in a genome assort independently. LD mapping depends on markers
   being in disequilibrium with the genes that condition expression of the
   phenotype. In contrast, QTN mapping depends critically upon most
   proximal loci being at equilibrium. We show that both patterns actually
   exist in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, the most important malaria
   vector in sub-Saharan Africa while segregating sites appear to be
   largely in equilibrium throughout the genome of Aedes aegypti, the
   vector of Dengue and Yellow fever flaviviruses. We discuss additional
   approaches that will be needed to identify genes and nucleotides that

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent findings are consistent with a slow but constant shift towards
   reduced sensitivity of Mycosphaerella graminicola to azole fungicides,
   which target the CYP51 gene. The goal of this study was to elucidate
   the evolutionary mechanisms through which CYP51-based mutations
   associated with altered sensitivity have evolved in M. graminicola over
   space and time. To accomplish this, we sequenced and compared a portion
   of the CYP51 gene encompassing the main mutations associated with
   altered sensitivity towards demethylation inhibitor fungicides. The
   CYP51 gene showed an extraordinary dynamic shift consistent with a
   selective haplotype replacement both in space and in time. No mutations
   associated with increased resistance to azoles were found in
   non-European populations. These mutations were also absent in the
   oldest collections from Europe, whereas they dominated in the recent
   European populations. Intragenic recombination was identified as an
   important evolutionary process in populations affected by high
   fungicide selection, suggesting the creation of novel alleles among
   existing mutations as a potential source of novel resistance alleles.
   We propose that CYP51 mutations giving resistance in M. graminicola
   arose only locally (perhaps in Denmark or the UK) and were then spread
   eastward across Europe through wind-dispersed ascospores. We conclude
   that recurring cycles of recombination coupled with selection due to
   the widespread use of azole fungicides will increase the frequency of
   novel mutants or recombinants with higher resistance. Long-distance
   gene flow due to wind dispersal of ascospores will move the resulting
   new alleles to new areas following the prevailing wind directions. A
   selective replacement favouring haplotypes with various coding
   mutations at the target site for azole fungicides during the last 5-10
   years is the most likely cause of the decrease in sensitivity reported
   for many azole fungicides in the same period.}},

Abstract = {{Phrynocephalus vlangalii is restricted to dry sand or Gobi desert
   highlands between major mountain ranges in the Qinghai (Tibetan)
   Plateau. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence (partial ND2, tRNA(Trp) and
   partial tRNA(Ala)) was obtained from 293 Phrynocephalus sampled from 34
   sites across the plateau. Partitioned Bayesian and maximum parsimony
   phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. vlangalii and two other proposed
   species (P. erythrus and P. putjatia) together form a monophyletic
   mtDNA clade which, in contrast with previous studies, does not include
   P. theobaldi and P. zetangensis. The main P. vlangalli clade comprises
   seven well-supported lineages that correspond to distinct geographical
   areas with little or no overlap, and share a most recent common
   ancestor at 5.06 +/- 0.68 million years ago (mya). This is much older
   than intraspecific lineages in other Tibetan animal groups. Analyses of
   molecular variance indicated that most of the observed genetic
   variation occurred among populations/regions implying long-term
   interruption of maternal gene flow. A combined approach based on tests
   of population expansion, estimation of node dates, and significance
   tests on clade areas indicated that phylogeographical structuring has
   been primarily shaped by three main periods of plateau uplift during
   the Pliocene and Pleistocene, specifically 3.4 mya, 2.5 mya and 1.7
   mya. These periods corresponded to the appearance of several mountain
   ranges that formed physical barriers between lineages. Populations from
   the Qaidam Basin are shown to have undergone major demographic and
   range expansions in the early Pleistocene, consistent with colonization
   of areas previously covered by the huge Qaidam palaeolake, which
   desiccated at this time. The study represents one of the most detailed
   phylogeographical analyses of the Qinghai Plateau to date and shows how
   geological events have shaped current patterns of diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Claviceps purpurea is an important pathogen of grasses and source of
   novel chemical compounds. Three groups within this species (G1, G2 and
   G3) have been recognized based on habitat association, sclerotia and
   conidia morphology, as well as alkaloid production. These groups have
   further been supported by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers,
   suggesting this species may be more accurately described as a species
   complex. However, all divergent ecotypes can coexist in sympatric
   populations with no obvious physical barriers to prevent gene flow. In
   this study, we used both phylogenetic and population genetic analyses
   to test for speciation within C. purpurea using DNA sequences from ITS,
   a RAS-like locus, and a portion of beta-tubulin. The G1 types are
   significantly divergent from the G2/G3 types based on each of the three
   loci and the combined dataset, whereas the G2/G3 types are more
   integrated with one another. Although the G2 and G3 lineages have not
   diverged as much as the G1 lineage based on DNA sequence data, the use
   of three DNA loci does reliably separate the G2 and G3 lineages.
   However, the population genetic analyses strongly suggest little to no
   gene flow occurring between the different ecotypes, and we argue that
   this process is driven by adaptations to ecological habitats; G1
   isolates are associated with terrestrial grasses, G2 isolates are found
   in wet and shady environments, and G3 isolates are found in salt marsh
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea share geological
   histories and display great faunal affinities. The majority of the
   Mediterranean species have Atlantic origins, with a few species with
   tropical affinities. These include the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense
   and the wrasse Thalassoma pavo that are restricted to the subtropical
   northeastern Atlantic, the Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira,
   and Canaries) and the southern Mediterranean. The Pleistocene
   glaciations have been described as having different effects on the
   fauna of the two regions. During glacial peaks, Mediterranean waters
   remained warmer than those of the adjacent Atlantic. Within the eastern
   Atlantic, the effects of Pleistocene glaciations were differentiated.
   Here, we perform a comparative analysis focusing on T. pavo and S.
   cretense populations from the northeastern Atlantic and the
   Mediterranean to assess the effects of Pleistocene glaciations in these
   two species. Sequences from the mitochondrial control region were
   obtained and analyzed combining phylogeographic and demographic
   approaches. Gene flow between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations
   was shown to be very high. The Mediterranean populations of T. pavo and
   S. cretense showed high levels of genetic diversity, even in the
   eastern basin, pointing to an ancient colonization event. This suggests
   that both species must have been able to persist in the Mediterranean
   during the cold Pleistocene periods. Historical migration estimates
   revealed a Mediterranean towards Atlantic trend in the case of T. pavo,
   which may reflect the re-colonization of areas in the Atlantic by fish
   that survived the cold phases in relatively warmer Mediterranean
   refugia. Our data also showed that within the Macaronesian
   Archipelagos, migrations occurred from Madeira towards the Azores, for
   both T. pavo and S. cretense, thus supporting a post-glacial
   colonization of the Azores by fish that persisted in the warmer region
   of Madeira. Similar geographic distributions, thermal affinities, and
   means of dispersion for T. pavo and S. cretense resulted in a similar
   response to the effects of Pleistocene glaciations, as evidenced by
   identical phylogeographic patterns.}},

   frog, we examined individual movement patterns and gene flow among four
   subpopulations of the Neotropical glassfrog, Centrolene prosoblepon, at
   a mid-elevation cloud forest site at E1 Cope, Panama. We measured male
   movement directly during a two year mark-recapture study, and
   indirectly with gene flow estimates from mitochondrial DNA sequences
   (mtDNA). Individuals of this species showed strong site fidelity: over
   two years, male frogs in all four headwater streams moved very little
   (mean = 2.33 m; mode = 0 m). Nine individuals changed streams within
   one or two years, moving 675-1 108 in. For those males moving more than
   10 in, movement was biased upstream (p < 0.001). Using mtDNA ND1 gene
   sequences, we quantified gene flow within and among headwater streams
   at two spatial scales: among headwater streams within two adjacent
   watersheds (2.5 km) and among streams within a longitudinal gradient
   covering 5.0 km(2). We found high gene flow among headwater streams

Abstract = {{Population augmentation with translocated individuals has been shown to
   alleviate the effects of bottlenecks and drift. The first step to
   determine whether restoration for genetic considerations is warranted
   is to genetically monitor reintroduced populations and compare results
   to those from the source. To assess the need for genetic restoration,
   we evaluated genetic diversity and structure of reintroduced (n = 3)
   and captive populations of the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela
   nigripes). We measured genotypic changes among populations using seven
   microsatellite markers and compared phenotypic changes with eight
   morphometric characters. Results indicated that for the population
   which rapidly grew post-reintroduction, genetic diversity was
   equivalent to the captive, source population. When growth languished,
   only the population that was augmented yearly maintained diversity.
   Without augmentation, allelic diversity declined precipitously and
   phenotypic changes were apparent. Ferrets from the genetically
   depaupertate population had smaller limbs and smaller overall body size
   than ferrets from the two populations with greater diversity.
   Population divergence (F-ST = 0.10 +/- 0.01) was surprisingly high
   given the common source of populations. Thus, it appears that 5-10
   years of isolation resulted in both genotypic divergence and phenotypic
   changes to populations. We recommend translocation of 30-40 captive
   individuals per annum to reintroduction sites which have not become
   established quickly. This approach will maximize the retention of
   genetic diversity, yet maintain the beneficial effects of local
   adaptation without being swamped by immigration.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Azores are an archipelago located in the North Atlantic
   Ocean (parallel 38) composed of nine islands, dispersed over three
   geographical groups: The Eastern group (Sao Miguel and Santa Maria),
   the Central group (Terceira, Graciosa, Pico, Sao Jorge and Faial) and
   the Western group (Flores and Corvo). Taking into consideration the
   geographical and settlement history differences of the archipelago, the
   genetic diversity pattern and the internal migration of the Azorean
   population were assessed, based on the analysis of 15 STR loci in 592
   unrelated individuals.
   Results: The results of this evaluation reveal that Terceira displays
   the highest value of gene diversity (0.7979) and Corvo the lowest
   (0.7717). Gene flow analysis indicates that Corvo has the lowest value
   for migration, 23.35, where as Sao Miguel and Terceira have the highest
   values for emigration, 108.14 and 87.66, respectively. Taken together,
   the data demonstrate that, despite settlement diversity, no genetic
   difference between the populations of the nine islands is observable
   today. This may be explained by internal migration.
   Conclusion: Overall, the Azorean population can be analysed as a
   homogeneous genetic group, which consequently, would present, possibly,
   the same drug-reaction profile. In terms of genomic medicine, these

Abstract = {{Knowledge of DNA evolution is central to our understanding of
   biological history, but how fast does DNA change? Previously, pedigree
   and ancient DNA studies-focusing on evolution in the short term-have
   yielded molecular rate estimates substantially faster than those based
   on deeper phylogenies. It has recently been suggested that short-term,
   elevated molecular rates decay exponentially over 1-2 Myr to long-term,
   phylogenetic rates, termed ``time dependency of molecular rates.{''}
   This transition has potential to confound molecular inferences of
   demographic parameters and dating of many important evolutionary
   events. Here, we employ a novel approach-geologically dated changes in
   river drainages and isolation of fish populations-to document rates of
   mitochondrial DNA change over a range of temporal scales. This method
   utilizes precise spatiotemporal disruptions of linear freshwater
   systems and hence avoids many of the limitations associated with
   typical DNA calibration methods involving fossil data or island
   formation. Studies of freshwater-limited fishes across the South Island
   of New Zealand have revealed that genetic relationships reflect past,
   rather than present, drainage connections. Here, we use this link
   between drainage geology and genetics to calibrate rates of molecular
   evolution across nine events ranging in age from 0.007 Myr (Holocene)
   to 5.0 Myr (Pliocene). Molecular rates of change in galaxiid fishes
   from calibration points younger than 200 kyr were faster than those
   based on older calibration points. This study provides conclusive
   evidence of time dependency in molecular rates as it is based on a
   robust calibration system that was applied to closely related taxa, and
   analyzed using a consistent and rigorous methodology. The time
   dependency observed here appears short-lived relative to previous
   suggestions (1-2 Myr), which has bearing on the accuracy of molecular
   inferences drawn from processes operating within the Quaternary and
   mechanisms invoked to explain the decay of rates with time.}},

Title = {{Deep genetic divergences among Indo-Pacific populations of the coral
   reef sponge Leucetta chagosensis (Leucettidae): Founder effects,
   vicariance, or both?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: An increasing number of studies demonstrate that genetic
   differentiation and speciation in the sea occur over much smaller
   spatial scales than previously appreciated given the wide distribution
   range of many morphologically defined coral reef invertebrate species
   and the presumed dispersal-enhancing qualities of ocean currents.
   However, knowledge about the processes that lead to population
   divergence and speciation is often lacking despite being essential for
   the understanding, conservation, and management of marine biodiversity.
   Sponges, a highly diverse, ecologically and economically important
   reef-invertebrate taxon, exhibit spatial trends in the Indo-West
   Pacific that are not universally reflected in other marine phyla. So
   far, however, processes generating those unexpected patterns are not
   understood.
   Results: We unraveled the phylogeographic structure of the widespread
   Indo-Pacific coral reef sponge Leucetta chagosensis across its known
   geographic range using two nuclear markers: the rDNA internal
   transcribed spacers (ITS 1\&2) and a fragment of the 28S gene, as well
   as the second intron of the ATP synthetase beta subunit-gene
   (ATPSb-iII). This enabled the detection of several deeply divergent
   clades congruent over both loci, one containing specimens from the
   Indian Ocean ( Red Sea and Maldives), another one from the Philippines,
   and two other large and substructured NW Pacific and SW Pacific clades
   with an area of overlap in the Great Barrier Reef/Coral Sea.
   Reciprocally monophyletic populations were observed from the
   Philippines, Red Sea, Maldives, Japan, Samoa, and Polynesia,
   demonstrating long-standing isolation. Populations along the South
   Equatorial Current in the south-western Pacific showed
   isolation-by-distance effects. Overall, the results pointed towards
   stepping-stone dispersal with some putative long-distance exchange,
   consistent with expectations from low dispersal capabilities.
   Conclusion: We argue that both founder and vicariance events during the
   late Pliocene and Pleistocene were responsible to varying degrees for
   generating the deep phylogeographic structure. This structure was
   perpetuated largely as a result of the life history of L. chagosensis,
   resulting in high levels of regional isolation. Reciprocally
   monophyletic populations constitute putative sibling ( cryptic)
   species, while population para- and polyphyly may indicate incipient
   speciation processes. The genetic diversity and biodiversity of
   tropical Indo-Pacific sponges appears to be substantially
   underestimated since the high level of genetic divergence is not
   necessarily manifested at the morphological level.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of population genetics research is to identify the
   relative influences of historical and contemporary processes that serve
   to structure genetic variation. Most population genetic models assume
   that populations exist in a state of migration-drift equilibrium.
   However, in the past this assumption has rarely been verified, and is
   likely rarely achieved in natural populations. We assessed the
   equilibrium status at both local and regional scales of the Atlantic
   killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. This species is a model organism for
   the study of adaptive clinal variation, but has also experienced a
   complicated history of range expansion and secondary contact following
   allopatric divergence, potentially obscuring the influence of
   contemporary evolutionary processes. Presumptively neutral genetic
   markers (microsatellites) demonstrated zones of secondary
   intergradation among coastal populations centred around northern New
   Jersey and the Chesapeake Bay region. Analysis of genetic variation
   indicated isolation by distance among some populations and provided
   supporting evidence that the Delaware Bay, but not the Chesapeake Bay,
   has acted as a barrier to dispersal among coastal populations. Bayesian
   estimates indicated large effective population sizes and low migration
   rates, and were in good agreement with empirically derived estimates of
   population and neighbourhood size from mark-recapture studies. These
   data indicate that populations are not in migration-drift equilibrium
   at a regional scale, and suggest that contributing factors include
   large population size combined with relatively low migration rates.
   These conditions should be considered when interpreting the
   evolutionary significance of the distribution of genetic variation
   among F. heteroclitus populations.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change during the late Quaternary has been implicated as the
   cause of both massive range shifts and extinction events. We combined
   molecular marker data and previously published fossil data to
   reconstruct the late Quaternary history of a grassland-dependent
   species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and to determine
   whether populations from Pleistocene refugia in the Columbia Basin,
   eastern Beringia, and Great Plains persisted into the Holocene and
   Recent eras. Using DNA extracted from 97 museum specimens of extirpated
   populations, we amplified 309 bp of the mtDNA control region, and 8
   microsatellite markers from the nuclear genome. Overall haplotype
   diversity from 309 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control
   region was low (5 haplotypes, nucleotide diversity = 0.001 +/- 0.001
   SD) and was contained within a single phylogenetic clade. The star
   phylogeny and unimodal mismatch distribution indicated that a rapid
   range expansion from a single Pleistocene refugium occurred.
   Microsatellite data corroborated this genetic pattern: populations from
   the mixed grasslands of the Great Plains had significantly higher
   expected heterozygosity and allelic richness than populations to the
   west (HE = 0.66 versus 0.41, AR = 4.3 versus 2.7, respectively), and 0,
   a measure of relative population size, was substantially greater in the
   east than west (2.4 versus 0.7). We infer from these data that
   black-footed ferrets rapidly colonized western ecoregions in a stepwise
   fashion from the Great Plains to the intermountain regions of the Rocky
   Mountains and the Colorado Plateau after the last ice age. It appears
   that glacial retreat and global warming caused both range expansion and
   localized extinction in this North American mustelid species.}},

Pages = {{1103-U6}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Predators typically avoid dangerous species, and batesian mimicry
   evolves when a palatable species ( the `mimic') co- opts a warning
   signal from a dangerous species ( the `model') and thereby deceives its
   potential predators(1,2). Because predators would not be under
   selection to avoid the model and any of its look- alikes in areas where
   the model is absent ( that is, allopatry)(2-5), batesian mimics should
   occur only in sympatry with their model. However, contrary to this
   expectation, batesian mimics often occur in allopatry(6-8). Here we
   focus on one such example - a coral snake mimic(3,8). Using indirect
   DNA- based methods, we provide evidence suggesting that mimics migrate
   from sympatry, where mimicry is favoured(3,9), to allopatry, where it
   is disfavoured(10). Such gene flow is much stronger in nuclear genes
   than in maternally inherited mitochondrial genes, indicating that
   dispersal by males may explain the presence of mimetic phenotypes in
   allopatry. Despite this gene flow, however, individuals from allopatry
   resemble the model less than do individuals from sympatry. We show that
   this breakdown of mimicry probably reflects predator- mediated
   selection acting against individuals expressing the more conspicuous
   mimetic phenotype in allopatry. Thus, although gene flow may explain
   why batesian mimics occur in allopatry, natural selection may often
   override such gene flow and promote the evolution of non- mimetic
   phenotypes in such areas.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-evolutionary processes that underpin genetic and morphological
   variation in highly mobile pelagic vertebrates are virtually unknown.
   Previous findings preferentially invoke vicariant isolation due to
   large-scale physical barriers such as continental landmasses, followed
   by genetic drift. However increasingly, evidence for divergence by
   non-random processes (e.g. selection, plasticity) is being presented.
   Wedge-tailed shearwaters are wide-ranging seabirds with breeding
   colonies located such that they experience a variety of environmental
   pressures and conditions. Previous work on this species has provided
   evidence of inter-colony divergence of adult morphology and foraging
   modes, as well as chick developmental patterns, suggesting that
   reinforcement among colonies is possible. In order to evaluate the
   micro-evolutionary processes driving this observed variation, our study
   compared patterns of gene flow with morphological and environmental
   variation among four colonies of wedge-tailed shearwater breeding
   within the Indo-Pacific Ocean basin. Estimates of gene flow differed
   according to the genetic marker used; most likely, this is a function
   of different mutation rates. Nuclear introns suggest that gene flow
   among wedge-tailed shearwater breeding colonies within the Indo-Pacific
   Ocean basin is substantial, however microsatellite markers imply that
   gene flow is reduced. In general, levels of genetic divergence were
   relatively low and did not correlate with geographic distance,
   morphological distance or environmental differences (sea-surface
   temperature and chlorophyll a concentration) among colonies. We suggest
   that genetic drift alone is unlikely to be the major source of
   morphological variation seen in this species. Instead, we propose that
   non-random processes (selection, plasticity) underpin morphological
   diversity seen in this and possibly other seabird species.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Oceanic islands represent a special challenge to historical
   biogeographers because dispersal is typically the dominant process
   while most existing methods are based on vicariance. Here, we describe
   a new Bayesian approach to island biogeography that estimates island
   carrying capacities and dispersal rates based on simple Markov models
   of biogeographical processes. This is done in the context of
   simultaneous analysis of phylogenetic and distributional data across
   groups, accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty and making parameter
   estimates more robust. We test our models on an empirical data set of
   published phylogenies of Canary Island organisms to examine overall
   dispersal rates and correlation of rates with explanatory factors such
   as geographic proximity and area size.
   Location Oceanic archipelagos with special reference to the Atlantic
   Canary Islands.
   Methods The Canary Islands were divided into three island-groups,
   corresponding to the main magmatism periods in the formation of the
   archipelago, while non-Canarian distributions were grouped into a
   fourth `mainland-island'. Dispersal between island groups, which were
   assumed constant through time, was modelled as a homogeneous,
   time-reversible Markov process, analogous to the standard models of DNA
   evolution. The stationary state frequencies in these models reflect the
   relative carrying capacity of the islands, while the exchangeability
   (rate) parameters reflect the relative dispersal rates between islands.
   We examined models of increasing complexity: Jukes-Cantor (JC),
   Equal-in, and General Time Reversible (GTR), with or without the
   assumption of stepping-stone dispersal. The data consisted of 13
   Canarian phylogenies: 954 individuals representing 393 taxonomic
   (morphological) entities. Each group was allowed to evolve under its
   own DNA model, with the island-model shared across groups. Posterior
   distributions on island model parameters were estimated using Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, as implemented in MrBayes 4.0, and
   Bayes Factors were used to compare models.
   Results The Equal-in step, the GTR, and the GTR step dispersal models
   showed the best fit to the data. In the Equal-in and GTR models, the
   largest carrying capacity was estimated for the mainland, followed by
   the central islands and the western islands, with the eastern islands
   having the smallest carrying capacity. The relative dispersal rate was
   highest between the central and eastern islands, and between the
   central and western islands. The exchange with the mainland was rare in
   comparison.
   Main conclusions Our results confirm those of earlier studies
   suggesting that inter-island dispersal within the Canary Island
   archipelago has been more important in explaining diversification
   within lineages than dispersal between the continent and the islands,
   despite the close proximity to North Africa. The low carrying capacity
   of the eastern islands, uncorrelated with their size or age, fits well
   with the idea of a historically depauperate biota in these islands but
   more sophisticated models are needed to address the possible influence
   of major recent extinction events. The island models explored here can
   easily be extended to address other problems in historical
   biogeography, such as dispersal among areas in continental settings or
   reticulate area relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The Black and Caspian Seas have experienced alternating periods of

   Climate-induced habitat changes have indisputably had profound impacts

   remain about the relative roles of isolation and dispersal in the
   response of species shared between the Black and Caspian Sea basins. We
   examined these issues using phylogeographical analysis of an anadromous
   cyprinid fish Rutilus frisii. Bayesian coalescence analyses of sequence
   variation at two nuclear and one mitochondrial genes suggest that the
   Black and Caspian Seas supported separate populations of R. frisii
   during the last glaciation. Parameter estimates from the fitted
   isolation-with-migration model showed that their separation was not
   complete, however, and that the two populations continued to exchange
   genes in both directions. These analyses also suggested that majority
   of migrations occurred during the Pleistocene, showing that the
   variation shared between the Black and Caspian Seas is the result of
   ancient dispersal along the temporary natural connections between the
   basins, rather than of incomplete lineage sorting or recent
   human-mediated dispersal. Gene flow between the refugial populations
   was therefore an important source of genetic variation, and we suggest

Abstract = {{Individuals of many species show high levels of fidelity to natal
   populations, often due to reliance on patchily distributed habitat
   features. In many of these species, the negative impacts of inbreeding
   are mitigated through specialized behaviours such as seasonal mating
   dispersal. Quantifying population structure for species with these
   characteristics can potentially elucidate social and environmental
   factors that interact to affect mating behaviour and population
   connectivity. In the northern part of their range, timber rattlesnakes
   are communal hibernators with high natal philopatry. Individuals
   generally recruit to the same hibernaculum as their mother and remain
   faithful to that hibernaculum throughout their lives. We examined the
   genetic structure of Crotalus horridus hibernacula in the northeastern
   USA using microsatellite loci. Sampled hibernacula exhibited only
   modest levels of differentiation, indicating a significant level of
   gene flow among them. We found no significant correlation between
   genetic differentiation and geographical distance, but did find
   significant positive correlation between genetic differentiation and a
   cost-based distance metric adjusted to include the amount of potential
   basking habitat between hibernacula. Therefore, thermoregulation sites
   may increase gene flow by increasing the potential for contact among
   individuals from different populations. Parentage analyses confirmed
   high levels of philopatry of both sexes to their maternal hibernaculum;
   however, approximately one-third of paternity assignments involved
   individuals between hibernacula, confirming that gene flow among
   hibernacula occurs largely through seasonal male mating dispersal. Our
   results underscore the importance of integrating individual-level
   behaviours and landscape features with studies of fine-scale population
   genetics in species with high fidelity to patchily distributed habitats.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 10 years, an increasing number of studies have explored
   evolutionary aspects of biological invasions. It is becoming
   increasingly clear that evolutionary processes play an important role
   during the establishment of non-native species. Genetic drift during
   the colonization process followed by strong selection imposed through a
   change in biotic conditions and co-evolutionary disequilibrium set the
   conditions for rapid evolutionary change in introduced populations.
   Different hypotheses, which have been proposed to explain how
   evolutionary and genetic processes, can facilitate invasiveness are
   explored and their relevance for fish invasions is discussed. Empirical
   evidence increasingly suggests that admixture after multiple
   introductions, hybridization between native and non-native species and
   enemy release can all catalyse the evolution of invasiveness. A number
   of studies also suggest that genetic bottlenecks might represent less
   of genetic paradox than previously thought. Much of the theoretical
   developments and empirical evidence concerning the importance of
   evolution during biological invasions has been provided from studies on
   invasive plants. Despite their prominence, fish invasions have received
   little attention from evolutionary biologists. Recent advances in
   population genetic analysis such as non-equilibrium methods and genomic

   genetic differentiation, which are the result of both historical
   processes and present day gene flow. Comparative multilocus analyses
   based on both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers are probably
   the most efficient and informative approach to discerning the relative
   role of historical events and life-history traits in shaping genetic
   heterogeneity. The European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is a small
   pelagic fish with a relatively high migratory capability that is
   expected to show low levels of genetic differentiation among
   populations. Previous genetic studies based on meristic and
   mitochondrial control region haplotype frequency data supported the
   existence of two sardine subspecies ( S. p. pilchardus and S. p.
   sardina). Results: We investigated genetic structure of sardine among
   nine locations in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea using
   allelic size variation of eight specific microsatellite loci. Bayesian
   clustering and assignment tests, maximum likelihood estimates of
   migration rates, as well as classical genetic-variance-based methods (
   hierarchical AMOVA test and R-ST pairwise comparisons) supported a
   single evolutionary unit for sardines. These analyses only detected
   weak but significant genetic differentiation, which followed an
   isolation-by-distance pattern according to Mantel test. Conclusion: We
   suggest that the discordant genetic structuring patterns inferred based
   on mitochondrial and microsatellite data might indicate that the two
   different classes of molecular markers may be reflecting different and
   complementary aspects of the evolutionary history of sardine.
   Mitochondrial data might be reflecting past isolation of sardine
   populations into two distinct groupings during Pleistocene whereas
   microsatellite data reveal the existence of present day gene flow among
   populations, and a pattern of isolation by distance.}},

Abstract = {{We estimate parameters of a general isolation-with-migration model
   using resequence data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the Y chromosome,
   and two loci on the X chromosome in samples of 25-50 individuals from
   each of 10 human populations. Application of a coalescent-based Markov
   chain Monte Carlo technique allows simultaneous inference of divergence
   times, rates of gene flow, as well as changes in effective population
   size. Results from comparisons between sub-Saharan African and Eurasian
   populations estimate that 1500 individuals founded the ancestral
   Eurasian population similar to 40 thousand years ago (KYA).
   Furthermore, these small Eurasian founding populations appear to have
   grown much more dramatically than either African or Oceanian
   populations. Analyses of sub-Saharan African populations provide little
   evidence for a history, of population bottlenecks and suggest that
   die), began diverging from one another upward of 50 KYA. We surmise
   that ancestral African populations had already been geographically
   structured prior to the founding of ancestral Eurasian populations.
   African populations are shown to experience low levels of mitochondrial
   DNA gene flow, but high levels of Y chromosome gene flow. In
   particular, Y chromosome gene flow appears to be asymmetric, i.e., from
   the Bantu-speaking population into other African populations.
   Conversely, mitochondrial gene flow is more extensive between
   non-African populations, but appears to be absent between European and
   Asian Populations.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the performance of maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of
   allele frequency data in a linear array of populations. The parameters
   are a mutation rate and either the dispersal rate in a stepping stone
   model or a dispersal rate and a scale parameter in a geometric
   dispersal model. An approximate procedure known as maximum product of
   approximate conditional (PAC) likelihood is found to perform as well as
   ML. Mis-specification biases may occur because the importance sampling
   algorithm is formally defined in term of mutation and migration rates
   scaled by the total size of the population, and this size may differ
   widely in the statistical model and in reality. As could be expected,
   ML generally performs well when the statistical model is correctly
   specified. Otherwise, mutation rate estimates are much closer to
   mutation probability scaled by number of demes in the statistical model
   than scaled by number of demes in reality when mutation probability is
   high and dispersal is most limited. This mis-specification bias
   actually has practical benefits. However, opposite results are found in
   opposite conditions. Migration rate estimates show roughly similar
   trends, but they may not always be easily interpreted as low-bias
   estimates of dispersal rate under any scaling. Estimation of the
   dispersal scale parameter is also affected by mis-specification of the
   number of demes, and the different biases compensate each other in such
   a way that good estimation of the so-called neighborhood size (or more
   precisely the product of population density and mean-squared
   parent-offspring dispersal distance) is achieved. Results congruent
   with these findings are found in an application to a damselfly data set.}},

Abstract = {{Common raven (Corvus corax) populations in Mojave Desert regions of
   southern California and Nevada have increased dramatically over the
   past five decades. This growth has been attributed to increased human
   development in the region, as ravens have a commensal relationship with
   humans and feed extensively at landfills and on road-killed wildlife.
   Ravens, as a partially subsidized predator, also represent a problem
   for native desert wildlife, in particular threatened desert tortoises
   (Gopherus agassizii). However, it is unclear whether the more than
   15-fold population increase is due to in situ population growth or to
   immigration from adjacent regions where ravens have been historically
   common. Ravens were sampled for genetic analysis at several local sites
   within five major areas: the West Mojave Desert (California), East
   Mojave Desert (southern Nevada), southern coastal California, northern
   coastal California (Bay Area), and northern Nevada (Great Basin).
   Analyses of mtDNA control region sequences reveal an increased
   frequency of raven `Holarctic clade' haplotypes from south to north
   inland, with `California clade' haplotypes nearly fixed in the
   California populations. There was significant structuring among regions
   for mtDNA, with high F-ST values among sampling regions, especially
   between the Nevada and California samples. Analyses of eight
   microsatellite loci reveal a mostly similar pattern of regional
   population structure, with considerably smaller, but mostly
   significant, values. The greater mtDNA divergences may be due to lower
   female dispersal relative to males, lower N-e, or effects of high
   mutation rates on maximal values of F-ST. Analyses indicate recent
   population growth in the West Mojave Desert and a bottleneck in the
   northern California populations. While we cannot rule out in situ
   population growth as a factor, patterns of movement inferred from our
   data suggest that the increase in raven populations in the West Mojave
   Desert resulted from movements from southern California and the Central
   Valley. Ravens in the East Mojave Desert are more similar to ones from
   northern Nevada, indicating movement between those regions. If this
   interpretation of high gene flow into the Mojave Desert is correct,
   then efforts to manage raven numbers by local control may not be
   optimally effective.}},

Abstract = {{The bay scallop Argopecten irradians concentricus Say is a commercially
   and recreationally important species along the East Coast of the US
   that consistently shows evidence of recruitment limitation. To
   determine if limited planktonic larval exchange between populations
   inhabiting lagoonal basins or sounds contributes to recruitment
   limitation in central North Carolina, a hypervariable portion of mtDNA
   (885 bp) was sequenced from 219 adults from 4 sounds (Topsail, Bogue,
   Back, and Pamlico), 3 of which (Bogue, Back, and Pamlico) are connected
   by inshore waterways. Although the largest sound (Pamlico) harbored the
   greatest genetic diversity, diversity was high in all 4 sounds, with no
   evidence of recent bottlenecks. An analysis of molecular variance
   indicates significant genetic structure among sounds (phi(CT) = 0.
   0069, p = 0.023); all pairwise comparisons among sounds were
   significant, with the exception of those involving Pamlico Sound.
   Despite being connected by a short (3 km) inshore waterway, adjacent
   Bogue and Back Sounds were highly significantly differentiated
   (phi(CT)=0.0145, p = 0.000). Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow
   indicated that most sounds exchange <= 4 migrants each generation.
   Bogue and Back Sound populations, which were heavily impacted by a
   localized red tide outbreak in 1983 and which subsequently experienced
   a recruitment failure, each receive <4 migrants each generation from
   all other sounds combined. Dynamic physical processes in the vicinity
   of Beaufort Inlet can explain such limited larval exchange between
   Bogue and Back Sounds, but if dispersal is primarily controlled by
   tidally dominated surface flow, net dispersal distances may be limited
   throughout the region. Therefore, patterns of gene flow and genetic
   differentiation are consistent with the hypothesis that individual
   sounds are demographically independent and are closed with respect to
   fishery management issues.}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background. Theoretical work suggests that data from multiple nuclear
   loci provide better estimates of population genetic parameters than do
   single loci, but just how many loci are needed and how much sequence is
   required from each has been little explored. Methodology/Principle
   Findings. To investigate how much data is required to estimate the
   population genetic parameter theta (4N(e)mu) accurately under ideal
   circumstances, we simulated datasets of DNA sequences under three
   values of theta per site (0.1, 0.01, 0.001), varying in both the total
   number of base pairs sequenced per individual and the number of
   equal-length loci. From these datasets we estimated theta using the
   maximum likelihood coalescent framework implemented in the computer
   program MIGRATE. Our results corroborated the theoretical expectation
   that increasing the number of loci impacted the accuracy of the
   estimate more than increasing the sequence length at single loci.
   However, when the value of theta was low (0.001), the per-locus
   sequence length was also important for estimating theta accurately,
   something that has not been emphasized in previous work.
   Conclusions/Significance. Accurate estimation of theta required data
   from at least 25 independently evolving loci. Beyond this, there was
   little added benefit in terms of decreasing the squared coefficient of
   variation of the coalescent estimates relative to the extra effort
   required to sample more loci.}},

Title = {{Combining Phylogeography with Distribution Modeling: Multiple

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Phylogenetic and geographic evidence suggest that many parthenogenetic
   organisms have evolved recently and have spread rapidly. These patterns
   play a critical role in our understanding of the relative merits of
   sexual versus asexual reproductive modes, yet their interpretation is
   often hampered by a lack of detail. Here we present a detailed
   phylogeographic study of a vertebrate parthenogen, the Australian gecko
   Heteronotia binoei, in combination with statistical and biophysical
   modeling of its distribution during the last glacial maximum.
   Parthenogenetic H. binoei occur in the Australian arid zone and have
   the widest range of any known vertebrate parthenogen. They are broadly
   sympatric with their sexual counterparts, from which they arose via
   hybridization. We have applied nested clade phylogeographic, effective
   migration, and mismatch distribution analyses to mitochondrial DNA (
   mtDNA) sequences obtained for 319 individuals sampled throughout the
   known geographic ranges of two parthenogenetic mitochondrial lineages.
   These analyses provide strong evidence for past range expansion events
   from west to east across the arid zone, and for continuing eastward
   range expansion. Parthenogen formation and range expansion events date
   to the late Pleistocene, with one lineage expanding from the northwest
   of its present range around 240,000 years ago and the second lineage
   expanding from the far west around 70,000 years ago. Statistical and
   biophysical distribution models support these inferences of recent
   range expansion, with suitable climatic conditions during the last
   glacial maximum most likely limited to parts of the arid zone north and
   west of much of the current ranges of these lineages. Combination of
   phylogeographic analyses and distribution modeling allowed considerably
   stronger inferences of the history of this complex than either would in
   isolation, illustrating the power of combining complementary analytical
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the genetic structure of tropical bird populations is
   important for assessing potential genetic effects of future habitat
   fragmentation and for testing hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms
   promoting diversification. Here we used 10 microsatellite DNA loci to
   describe levels of genetic differentiation for five populations of the
   lek-mating blue manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata), sampled along a 414-km
   transect within the largest remaining continuous tract of the highly
   endangered Atlantic Forest habitat in southeast Brazil. We found small
   but significant levels of differentiation between most populations.
   F-ST values varied from 0.0 to 0.023 (overall F-ST = 0.012) that
   conformed to a strong isolation by distance relationship, suggesting
   that observed levels of differentiation are a result of migration-drift
   equilibrium. N(e)m values estimated using a coalescent-based method
   were small (<= 2 migrants per generation) and close to the minimum
   level required to maintain genetic similarity between populations. An
   implication of these results is that if future habitat fragmentation
   reduces dispersal between populations to even a small extent, then
   individual populations may undergo a loss of genetic diversity due to
   an increase in the relative importance of drift, since inbreeding
   effective population sizes are relatively small (N-e similar to 1000).
   Our findings also demonstrate that population structuring can occur in
   a tropical bird in continuous habitat in the absence of geographical
   barriers possibly due to behavioural features of the species.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical rainforests, insects show especially high species richness
   and local endemism of species relative to vertebrates. One possible
   cause is that insects respond to historical fluctuations of rainforests
   on a smaller spatial scale than do vertebrates. To evaluate this
   hypothesis, we combine environmental niche models and mitochondrial DNA
   phylogeography for two pairs of sister species of the dung beetle genus
   Temnoplectron (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans and T. politulum-T. reyi)
   from the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where climate-driven
   rainforest fluctuations in the Quaternary have strongly influenced
   genetic and species diversity of vertebrates. Within both species
   pairs, the bioclimatic niche was conserved, but the T. aeneopiceum-T.
   subvolitans species pair had the narrower environmental range, and thus
   more restricted potential distribution. Coalescent analyses indicated
   Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene divergences for both species pairs,
   and earlier speciation in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) than in (T.
   politulum-T. reyi). Phylogeographic structure in (T. aeneopiceum-T.
   subvolitans) was more pronounced than in (T. politulum-T. reyi), with
   significant isolation-by-distance in the former species-pair only.
   Nested clade and coalescence analyses indicated local range expansions
   for the T. aeneopiceum-subvolitans species pair and range-wide
   expansion for both T. politulum and T. reyi. We suggest that stronger
   phylogeographic structure and earlier divergence in (T. aeneopiceum-T.
   subvolitans) than in (T. politulum-T. reyi) reflects a stronger
   influence of environmental barriers to gene flow under the present
   climate and greater sensitivity to warmer and drier periods of the
   Quaternary. The two species pairs evidently responded to Quaternary
   rainforest fluctuations at spatial scales similar to those seen within
   low-vagility species of vertebrate. Despite this similarity of scale,
   these insect lineages are reproductively isolated at parapatric
   boundaries, whereas analogous lineages of vertebrates often are not. We
   suggest that rapid evolution of genitalia may facilitate geographic
   speciation in rainforest beetles.}},

   patterns of, and factors limiting, introgressive hybridization between
   sympatric Ohomopterus ground beetles in central Japan using
   mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene sequences. We
   sampled 17 local assemblages that consisted of two to five species and
   estimated levels of interspecific gene flow using the genetic distance,
   D-A, and maximum-likelihood estimates of gene flow. Sharing of
   haplotypes or haplotype lineages was detected between six of seven
   species that occurred in the study areas, indicating mitochondrial
   introgression. The intensity and direction of mitochondrial gene flow

   interspecific DA and five independent variables: difference in body
   size, difference in genital size, phylogenetic relatedness (nuclear
   gene sequence divergence), habitat difference, and species richness of
   the assemblage. Body and genital size differences contributed
   significantly to preventing gene flow. Thus, mechanical isolation

   Rhizoctonia solani AG-3 based on sequence analysis of two nuclear DNA
   loci}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 3
   (AG-3) is an important pathogen of cultivated plants in the family
   Solanaceae. Isolates of R. solani AG-3 are taxonomically related based
   on the composition of cellular fatty acids, phylogenetic analysis of
   nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and beta-tubulin gene sequences, and
   somatic hyphal interactions. Despite the close genetic relationship
   among isolates of R. solani AG-3, field populations from potato and
   tobacco exhibit comparative differences in their disease biology,
   dispersal ecology, host specialization, genetic diversity and
   population structure. However, little information is available on how
   field populations of R. solani AG-3 on potato and tobacco are shaped by
   population genetic processes. In this study, two field populations of
   R. solani AG-3 from potato in North Carolina (NC) and the Northern USA;
   and two field populations from tobacco in NC and Southern Brazil were
   examined using sequence analysis of two cloned regions of nuclear DNA
   (pP42F and pP89).
   Results: Populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato were genetically
   diverse with a high frequency of heterozygosity, while limited or no
   genetic diversity was observed within the highly homozygous tobacco
   populations from NC and Brazil. Except for one isolate (TBR24), all NC
   and Brazilian isolates from tobacco shared the same alleles. No alleles
   were shared between potato and tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3,
   indicating no gene flow between them. To infer historical events that
   influenced current geographical patterns observed for populations of R.
   solani AG-3 from potato, we performed an analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) and a nested clade analysis (NCA). Population differentiation
   was detected for locus pP89 (Phi(ST) = 0.257, significant at P < 0.05)
   but not for locus pP42F (Phi(ST) = 0.034, not significant). Results
   based on NCA of the pP89 locus suggest that historical restricted gene
   flow is a plausible explanation for the geographical association of
   clades. Coalescent-based simulations of genealogical relationships
   between populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco were used
   to estimate the amount and directionality of historical migration
   patterns in time, and the ages of mutations of populations. Low rates
   of historical movement of genes were observed between the potato and
   tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3.
   Conclusion: The two sisters populations of the basidiomycete fungus R.
   solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco represent two genetically distinct
   and historically divergent lineages that have probably evolved within
   the range of their particular related Solanaceae hosts as sympatric
   species.}},

Abstract = {{For more than a century, archaeologists have studied the cultural and

   ``Hopewell Moundbuilders.{''} While many aspects of the Hopewell
   phenomenon are now well understood, questions still remain about the
   genetic makeup, burial practices, and social structure of Hopewell
   communities. To help answer these questions, we extracted mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) from the skeletal remains of 39 individuals buried at the
   Pete Klunk Mound Group in Illinois. The pattern of mtDNA variation at
   this site suggests that matrilineal relationships did not strongly
   influence burial practices. Because different forms of mortuary
   activity were not associated with distinct genetic lineages, this study
   provides no evidence of a maternally inherited or ascribed status
   system in this society. The genetic data collected here also help
   clarify another aspect of Illinois Hopewell social structure by
   suggesting a matrilocal system of post-marital residence. Finally, when
   these data were considered in conjunction with mtDNA data previously
   collected from the Hopewell Mound Group in Ohio (Mills 2003), they
   demonstrated that migration and gene flow did accompany the cultural
   exchange between Hopewell communities in the Illinois and Ohio Valleys.}},

Abstract = {{Metapopulation dynamics are increasingly invoked in management and
   conservation of endangered species. In this context, asymmetrical gene
   flow patterns can be density dependent, with migration occurring mainly
   from larger into smaller populations, which may depend on it for their
   persistence. Using genetic markers, such patterns have recently been
   documented for various organisms including salmonids, suggesting this
   may be a more general pattern. However, metapopulation theory does not
   restrict gene flow asymmetry to `source-sink' structures, nor need
   these patterns be constant over longer evolutionary timescales. In
   anadromous salmonids, gene flow can be expected to be shaped by various
   selective pressures underlying homing and dispersal ('straying')
   behaviours. The relative importance of these selective forces will vary
   spatially and for populations of different census size. Furthermore,
   the consequences of life-history variation among populations for
   dispersal and hence gene flow remain poorly quantified. We examine
   population structure and connectivity in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
   L.) from Newfoundland and Labrador, a region where populations of this
   species are relatively pristine. Using genetic variation at 13
   microsatellite loci from samples (N = 1346) collected from a total of
   20 rivers, we examine connectivity at several regional and temporal
   scales and test the hypothesis that the predominant direction of gene
   flow is from large into small populations. We reject this hypothesis
   and find that the directionality of migration is affected by the
   temporal scale over which gene flow is assessed. Whereas large
   populations tend to function as sources of dispersal over contemporary
   timescales, such patterns are often changed and even reversed over
   evolutionary, coalescent-derived timescales. These patterns of
   population structure furthermore vary between different regions and are
   compatible with demographic and life-history attributes. We find no
   evidence for sex-biased dispersal underlying gene flow asymmetry. Our
   findings caution against generalizations concerning the directionality
   of gene flow in Atlantic salmon and emphasize the need for detailed
   regional study, if such information is to be meaningfully applied in
   conservation and management of salmonids.}},

Abstract = {{We studied population genetic variation and structure in the fire ant
   Solenopsis invicta using nuclear genotypic and mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) sequence data obtained from samples collected throughout its
   native range. Geographic populations are strongly differentiated at
   both genomes, with such structure more pronounced in Brazil than in
   Argentina. Higher-level regional structure is evident from the
   occurrence of isolation-by-distance patterns among populations, the
   recognition of clusters of genetically similar, geographically adjacent
   populations by ordination analysis, and the detection of an mtDNA
   discontinuity between Argentina and Brazil coinciding with a previously
   identified landform of biogeographical relevance. Multiple lines of
   evidence from both genomes suggest that the ancestors of the ants we
   studied resembled extant northern Argentine S. invicta, and that
   existing Brazilian populations were established more recently by serial
   long-distance colonizations and/or range expansions. The most
   compelling evidence for this is the corresponding increase in F-K (a
   measure of divergence from a hypothetical ancestor) and decrease in
   genetic diversity with distance from the Corrientes population in
   northern Argentina. Relatively deep sequence divergence among several
   mtDNA clades, coupled with geographical partitioning of many of them,
   suggests prolonged occupation of South America by S. invicta in
   more-or-less isolated regional populations. Such populations appear, in
   some cases, to have come into secondary contact without regaining the
   capacity to freely interbreed. We conclude that nominal S. invicta in
   its native range comprises multiple entities that are sufficiently
   genetically isolated and diverged to have embarked on independent
   evolutionary paths.}},

Abstract = {{Within its distribution range in the northeastern Atlantic, the stalked
   barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes shows a well-defined pattern of genetic
   variation, comprising (a) a subtropical/temperate northern assemblage,
   made up of populations distributed between 47 degrees N and 28 degrees
   N along the French, Iberian, North African and Canary Islands
   coastlines, and (b) a single isolated and highly divergent tropical
   population in the Cape Verde Islands (16 degrees N), at the
   southernmost limit of the species' distribution. However, within the
   northern assemblage several populations show a level of genetic
   differentiation that allows rejection of the hypothesis of genetic
   homogeneity. The congruence observed between genetic and hydrographic
   patterns suggests a crucial role of hydrodynamics, and of the dispersal
   of the planktonic larvae, in the determination of population structure.
   Along the southern European Atlantic coast, the Iberian Poleward
   Current and mesoscale hydrographic structures are, respectively,
   facilitating gene flow at the regional level and genetic
   differentiation at the local level. On the Atlantic coast of North
   Africa, the homogenizing equatorward flow of the Canary Current does
   not extend as far as the Cape Verde Islands. A demographic expansion is
   dated to the late Pleistocene, preceding the Eemian interglacial, and
   is oldest in the case of the long-standing Cape Verde population,
   sustained by a stable tropical habitat. The divergence between the Cape
   Verde population and the remaining populations is thus ancient, and
   suggests that oceanic current patterns may constitute a generalized
   physical barrier to the dispersal of marine organisms between Cape
   Verde and the rest of Macaronesia.}},

   Affiliation of haplotypes to major west Eurasian haplogroups was

Abstract = {{The impact of gene flow and population size fluctuations in shaping
   genetic variation during adaptive radiation, at both the genome-wide
   and gene-specific levels, is very poorly understood. To examine how
   historical population size and gene flow patterns within and between
   loci have influenced lineage divergence in the Hawaiian silversword
   alliance, we have investigated the nucleotide sequence diversity and
   divergence patterns of four floral regulatory genes (ASAP1-A, ASAP1-B,
   ASAP3-A, ASAP3-B) and a structural gene (ASCAB9). Levels and patterns
   of molecular divergence across these five nuclear loci were estimated
   between two recently derived species (Dubautia ciliolata and Dubautia
   arborea) which are presumed to be sibling species. This multilocus
   analysis of genetic variation, haplotype divergence and historical
   demography indicates that population expansion and differential gene
   flow occurred subsequent to the divergence of these two lineages.
   Moreover, contrasting patterns of allele- sharing for regulatory loci
   vs. a structural locus between these two sibling species indicate
   alternative histories of genetic variation and partitioning among loci
   where alleles of the floral regulatory loci are shared primarily from
   D. arborea to D. ciliolata and alleles of the structural locus are
   shared in both directions. Taken together, these results suggest that
   adaptively radiating species can exhibit contrasting allele migration
   rates among loci such that allele movement at specific loci may
   supersede genetic divergence caused by drift and that lineage
   divergence during adaptive radiation can be associated with population
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic differentiation is generally assumed to be low in highly mobile
   species, but this simplistic view may obscure the complex conditions
   and mechanisms allowing genetic exchanges between specific populations.
   Here, we combined data from satellite-tracked migratory caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus), microsatellite markers, and demographic
   simulations to investigate gene flow mechanisms between seven caribou
   herds of eastern Canada. Our study included one montane, two migratory,
   and four sedentary herds. Satellite-tracking data indicated
   possibilities of high gene flow between migratory herds: overlap of
   their rutting ranges averaged 10\% across years and 9.4\% of females
   switched calving sites at least once in their lifetime. Some migratory
   individuals moved into the range of the sedentary herds, suggesting
   possibilities of gene flow between these herds. Genetic differentiation
   between herds was weak but significant (F-ST = 0.015): migratory and
   montane herds were not significantly distinct (F-ST all <= 0.005),
   whereas sedentary herds were more differentiated (F-ST = 0.018-0.048).
   Geographical distances among sedentary herds limited gene flow.
   Historical estimates of gene flow were higher from migratory herds into
   sedentary herds (4Nm all > 9) than vice-versa (4Nm all < 5), which
   suggests migratory herds had a demographic impact on sedentary herds.
   Demographic simulations showed that an effective immigration rate of
   0.0005 was sufficient to obtain the empirical F-ST of 0.015, while a
   null immigration rate increased the simulated F-ST to > 0.6. In
   conclusion, the weak genetic differentiation between herds cannot be
   obtained without some genetic exchanges among herds, as demonstrated by
   genetic and spatial data.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ethnic minorities in Northern Thailand, often referred to
   as Hill Tribes, are considered an ideal model to study the different
   genetic impact of sex-specific migration rates expected in matrilocal
   (women remain in their natal villages after the marriage and men move
   to their wife's village) and patrilocal societies (the opposite is
   true). Previous studies identified such differences, but little is
   known about the possible interaction with another cultural factor that
   may potentially affect genetic diversity, i.e. linguistic differences.
   In addition, Hill Tribes started to migrate to Thailand in the last
   centuries from different Northern areas, but the history of these
   migrations, the level of genetic legacy with their places of origin,
   and the possible confounding effects related to this migration history
   in the patterns of genetic diversity, have not been analysed yet. Using
   both original and published data on the Hill Tribes and several other
   Asian populations, we focused on all these aspects.
   Results: Genetic variation within population at mtDNA is lower in
   matrilocal, compared to patrilocal, tribes. The opposite is true for
   Y-chromosome microsatellites within the Sino-Tibetan linguistic family,
   but Hmong-Mien speaking patrilocal groups have a genetic diversity very
   similar to the matrilocal samples. Population divergence ranges between
   5\% and 14\% at mtDNA sequences, and between 5\% and 36\% at
   Y-chromosomes STRs, and follows the sex-specific differences expected
   in patrilocal and matrilocal tribes. On the average, about 2 men and 14
   women, and 4 men and 4 women, are exchanged in patrilocal and
   matrilocal tribes every generation, respectively. Most of the Hill
   Tribes in Thailand seem to preserve a genetic legacy with their likely
   geographic origin, with children adoption probably affecting this
   pattern in one tribe.
   Conclusion: Overall, the sex specific genetic signature of different
   postmarital habits of residence in the Hill Tribes is robust. However,
   specific perturbations related to linguistic differences, population
   specific traits, and the complex migratory history of these groups, can
   be identified. Additional studies in different populations are needed,
   especially to obtain more precise estimates of the migration parameters.}},

Abstract = {{False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens (Owen, 1846)) are
   incidentally taken in the North Pacific pelagic long-line fishery, but
   little is known about their population structure to assess the impact
   of these takes. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence
   data, we quantified genetic variation for the species and tested for
   genetic differentiation among geographic strata. Our data set of 124
   samples included 115 skin-biopsy samples collected from false killer
   whales inhabiting the eastern North Pacific Ocean (ENP), and nine
   samples collected from animals sampled at sea or on the beach in the
   western North Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. Twenty-four (24).
   haplotypes were identified, and nucleotide diversity was low (pi =
   0.37\%) but comparable with that of closely related species.
   Phylogeographic concordance in the distribution of haplotypes was
   revealed and a demographically isolated population of false killer
   whales associated with the main Hawaiian islands was identified
   (Phi(ST) = 0.47, p < 0.0001). This result supports recognition of the
   existing management unit, which has geo-political boundaries
   corresponding to the USA's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Hawai'i.
   However, a small number of animals sampled within the EEZ but away from
   the near-shore island area, which is defined as <25 nautical miles (1
   nautical mile = 1.852 km) from shore, had haplotypes that were the same
   or closely related to those found elsewhere in the ENP, which suggests
   that there may be a second management unit within the Hawaiian EEZ.
   Biologically meaningful boundaries for the population(s) cannot be
   identified until we better understand the distribution and ecology of
   false killer whales.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of effective population sizes (N-e) and temporal gene flow
   (N(e)m, m) has many implications for understanding population structure
   in evolutionary and conservation biology. However, comparative studies
   that gauge the relative performance of N-e, N(e)m or m methods are few.
   Using temporal genetic data from two salmonid fish population systems
   with disparate population structure, we (i) evaluated the congruence in
   estimates and precision of long- and short-term N-e, N(e)m and m from
   six methods; (ii) explored the effects of metapopulation structure on
   N-e estimation in one system with spatiotemporally linked
   subpopulations, using three approaches; and (iii) determined to what
   degree interpopulation gene flow was asymmetric over time. We found
   that long-term N-e estimates exceeded short-term N-e within populations
   by 2-10 times; the two were correlated in the system with temporally
   stable structure (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar) but not in the highly
   dynamic system (brown trout, Salmo trutta). Four temporal methods
   yielded short-term N-e estimates within populations that were strongly
   correlated, and these were higher but more variable within salmon
   populations than within trout populations. In trout populations,
   however, these short-term N-e estimates were always lower when assuming
   gene flow than when assuming no gene flow. Linkage disequilibrium data
   generally yielded short-term N-e estimates of the same magnitude as
   temporal methods in both systems, but the two were uncorrelated.
   Correlations between long- and short-term geneflow estimates were
   inconsistent between methods, and their relative size varied up to
   eightfold within systems. While asymmetries in gene flow were common in
   both systems (58-63\% of population-pair comparisons), they were only
   temporally stable in direction within certain salmon population pairs,
   suggesting that gene flow between particular populations is often
   intermittent and/or variable. Exploratory metapopulation N-e analyses
   in trout demonstrated both the importance of spatial scale in
   estimating N-e and the role of gene flow in maintaining genetic
   variability within subpopulations. Collectively, our results illustrate
   the utility of comparatively applying N-e, N(e)m and m to (i) tease
   apart processes implicated in population structure, (ii) assess the
   degree of continuity in patterns of connectivity between population
   pairs and (iii) gauge the relative performance of different approaches,
   such as the influence of population subdivision and gene flow on N-e
   estimation. They further reiterate the importance of temporal sampling
   replication in population genetics, the value of interpreting N-e or m
   in light of species biology, and the need to address long-standing
   assumptions of current N-e, N(e)m or m models more explicitly in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of nucleotide diversity in the wild ancestor of maize, Zea mays
   ssp. parviglumis, have revealed genomewide departures from the standard
   neutral equilibrium (NE) model. Here we investigate the degree to which
   Population structure may account for the excess of rare polymorphisms
   frequently observed in species-wide samples. On the basis of sequence
   data from five nuclear and two chloroplast loci, we found significant
   population genetic structure among seven subpopulations from two
   geographic regions. Comparisons of estimates of population genetic
   parameters from species-wide samples and subpopulation-specific samples
   showed that population genetic subdivision influenced observed patterns
   of nucleotide polymorphism. In particular, Tajima's D was significantly
   higher (closer to zero) in subpopulation-specific samples relative to
   species-wide samples, and therefore more closely corresponded to NE
   expectations. In spite of these overall patterns, the extent to which
   levels and patterns of polymorphism within subpopulations differed from
   species-wide samples and NE expectations depended strongly on the
   geographic region (Jalisco vs. Balsas) from which subpopulations were
   sampled. This may be due to the demographic history of subpopulations
   in those regions. Overall, these results suggest that explicitly
   accounting for population structure may be important for studies
   examining the genetic basis of ecologically and agronomically important
   traits as well as for identifying loci that have been the targets of
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Tertiary geological events and Quaternary climatic fluctuations have
   been proposed as important factors of speciation in the North American
   flora and fauna. Few studies, however, have rigorously tested
   hypotheses regarding the specific factors driving divergence of taxa.
   Here, we test explicit speciation hypotheses by correlating geologic
   events with divergence times among species in the continentally
   distributed trilling chorus frogs (Pseudacris). In particular, we ask
   whether marine inundation of the Mississippi Embayment, uplift of the
   Appalachian Mountains, or modification of the ancient Teays-Mahomet
   River system contributed to speciation. To examine the plausibility of
   ancient rivers causing divergence, we tested whether modern river
   systems inhibit gene flow. Additionally, we compared the effects of
   Quaternary climatic factors (glaciation and aridification) on levels of
   genetic variation. Divergence time estimates using penalized likelihood
   and coalescent approaches indicate that the major lineages of chorus
   frogs diversified during the Tertiary, and also exclude Quaternary
   climate change as a factor in speciation of chorus frogs. We show the
   first evidence that inundation of the Mississippi Embayment contributed
   to speciation. We reject the hypotheses that Cenozoic uplift of the
   Appalachians and that diversion of the Teays-Mahomet River contributed
   to speciation in this clade. We find that by reducing gene flow, rivers
   have the potential to cause divergence of lineages. Finally, we
   demonstrate that populations in areas affected by Quaternary glaciation
   and aridification have reduced levels of genetic variation compared to
   those from more equable regions, suggesting recent colonization.}},

Abstract = {{The Transverse Ranges in southern California have been identified as
   having a prominent phylogeographic role. Numerous studies have
   identified distinct north-south and/or east-west lineage breaks
   involving the Transverse Ranges. However, in evaluating their findings,
   most authors have regarded this complex system somewhat simplistically.
   In this study we more deeply investigate these breaks using two
   approaches: first we examine the phylogeographic history of
   Sepedophilus castaneus (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and then implement a
   comparative phylogeography approach applying Brooks parsimony analysis
   to the topologies of nine additional taxa. Phylogenetic analysis,
   nested clade analysis, and AMOVAs for S. castaneus agree that there is
   a major lineage break between the eastern and western Transverse
   Ranges, localized between the Sierra Pelona and the San Gabriel
   Mountains. The comparative phylogeographic analysis supports a
   generally strong concordance of area relationships with geographic
   proximity. It is notable, however, that the Transverse Ranges as a
   group do not show phylogenetic cohesion, but rather they are split into
   three main regions: an eastern region (San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and
   San Jacinto Mountains), a central region (central Transverse Ranges and
   Sierra Pelona) that is often grouped with the Tehachapi and Sierra
   Nevada populations, and a western region (northwestern Transverse
   Ranges and Santa Ynez Mountains) that is consistently grouped with
   coast range areas to the north. The lineage break between east and west
   Transverse Ranges is attributable to the presence of a marine embayment
   in what is now the Santa Clara River valley 5-2.5 million years ago.}},

Title = {{Multi-locus phylogeography of the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus
   obscurus): passive dispersal via the west-wind drift or response to
   prey species and climate change?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The dusky dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is distributed
   along temperate, coastal regions of New Zealand, South Africa,
   Argentina, and Peru where it feeds on schooling anchovy, sardines, and
   other small fishes and squid tightly associated with temperate ocean
   sea surface temperatures. Previous studies have suggested that the
   dusky dolphin dispersed in the Southern Hemisphere eastward from Peru
   via a linear, temperate dispersal corridor provided by the circumpolar
   west-wind drift. With new mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data,
   we propose an alternative phylogeographic history for the dusky dolphin
   that was structured by paleoceanographic conditions that repeatedly
   altered the distribution of its temperate prey species during the
   Plio-Pleistocene.
   Results: In contrast to the west-wind drift hypothesis, phylogenetic
   analyses support a Pacific/Indian Ocean origin, with a relatively early
   and continued isolation of Peru from other regions. Dispersal of the
   dusky dolphin into the Atlantic is correlated with the history of
   anchovy populations, including multiple migrations from New Zealand to
   South Africa. Additionally, the cooling of the Eastern Equatorial
   Pacific led to the divergence of anchovy populations, which in turn
   explains the north-south equatorial transgression of L. obliquidens and
   the subsequent divergence of L. obscurus in the Southern Hemisphere.
   Conclusion: Overall, our study fails to support the west-wind drift
   hypothesis. Instead, our data indicate that changes in primary
   productivity and related abundance of prey played a key role in shaping
   the phylogeography of the dusky dolphin, with periods of ocean change
   coincident with important events in the history of this temperate
   dolphin species. Moderate, short-term changes in sea surface
   temperatures and current systems have a powerful effect on anchovy
   populations; thus, it is not infeasible that repeated fluctuations in
   anchovy populations continue to play an important role in the history
   of coastal dolphin populations.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal learning is thought to have evolved in three clades of birds
   (parrots, hummingbirds, and oscine passerines), and three clades of
   mammals (whales, bats, and primates). Behavioural data indicate that,
   unlike other suboscine passerines, the three-wattled bellbird Procnias
   tricarunculata (Cotingidae) is capable of vocal learning. Procnias
   tricarunculata shows conspicuous vocal ontogeny, striking geographical
   variation in song, and rapid temporal change in song within a
   population. Deprivation studies of vocal development in P.
   tricarunculata are impractical. Here, we report evidence from
   mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci that
   genetic variation within and among the four allopatric breeding
   populations of P. tricarunculata is not congruent with variation in
   vocal behaviour. Sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region
   document extensive haplotype sharing among localities and song types,
   and no phylogenetic resolution of geographical populations or
   behavioural groups. The vocally differentiated, allopatric breeding
   populations of P. tricarunculata are only weakly genetically
   differentiated populations, and are not distinct taxa. Mitochondrial
   DNA and microsatellite variation show small (2.9\% and 13.5\%,
   respectively) but significant correlation with geographical distance,
   but no significant residual variation by song type. Estimates of the
   strength of selection that would be needed to maintain the observed
   geographical pattern in vocal differentiation if songs were genetically
   based are unreasonably high, further discrediting the hypothesis of a
   genetic origin of vocal variation. These data support a fourth,
   phylogenetically independent origin of avian vocal learning in
   Procnias. Geographical variations in P. tricarunculata vocal behaviour
   are likely culturally evolved dialects.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially harvested marine bivalve populations show a broad range of

   variation among populations and year classes of the commercially

   relative significance of gene flow and drift on three spatial scales:
   within commercially harvested populations in the northwest Atlantic;
   among Atlantic populations; and between the Atlantic and Pacific
   oceans. We found small nonsignificant genetic subdivision among eight
   populations from the northwest Atlantic (F (ST) = 0.002). All of these

   age structure, but we found little differentiation among age classes.
   In one case, we were able to analyze genetic diversity between age
   classes older or younger than the advent of intensive commercial

Abstract = {{The population genetic structure of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta
   caretta) nesting in the eastern Mediterranean was assessed by
   sequencing a fragment of the control region of the mitochondrial DNA (n

   revealed genetic structuring (mtDNA: gamma(st) = 0.212, P < 0.001; nDNA
   F (st) = 0.006, P < 0.001), thus indicating that both females and males
   are philopatric and that gene flow between populations is restricted.
   Mitochondrial DNA data indicate that the female populations nesting on
   the islands of Crete and Cyprus have suffered a recent bottleneck or
   colonization event. However, no bottleneck or founder effect was
   revealed by nuclear markers, thus indicating male-mediated gene flow
   from other populations that would increase nuclear genetic variability.
   Crete, and to a lower extent Cyprus, are thought to play a central role
   in such male-mediated gene flow that may reduce the negative effect of
   genetic drift or inbreeding on the small populations of Lebanon and
   Israel. This population structure indicates that assessing population
   relevance only on the basis of genetic variability and size would be
   misleading, as some populations not fulfilling those requirements may
   play a relevant role in genetic exchange and hence contribute to the
   overall genetic variability.}},

Abstract = {{A number of evolutionary mechanisms have been suggested for generating
   low but significant genetic structuring among marine fish populations.
   We used nine microsatellite loci and recently developed methods in
   landscape genetics and coalescence-based estimation of historical gene
   flow and effective population sizes to assess temporal and spatial
   dynamics of the population structure in European flounder (Platichthys
   flesus L.). We collected 1062 flounders from 13 localities in the
   northeast Atlantic and Baltic Seas and found temporally stable and
   highly significant genetic differentiation among samples covering a
   large part of the species' range (global F-ST = 0.024, P < 0.0001). In
   addition to historical processes, a number of contemporary acting
   evolutionary mechanisms were associated with genetic structuring.
   Physical forces, such as oceanographic and bathymetric barriers, were
   most likely related with the extreme isolation of the island population
   at the Faroe Islands. A sharp genetic break was associated with a
   change in life history from pelagic to benthic spawners in the Baltic

   not related with genetic structuring among Atlantic and western Baltic

   environmental gradients, could be important for generating genetic

   critically on its interplay with other evolutionary mechanisms,
   highlighting the importance of investigating species with wide
   geographical and ecological distributions to increase our understanding

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at evaluating the likelihood that kin-biased
   distribution will be expressed or detected in a range of brown trout
   (Salmo trutta) populations as a function of family size. Microsatellite
   analysis indicated that fewer fall- and half-siblings were found in
   populations with larger effective population sizes, while more full-
   and half-siblings were found in populations with lower effective
   population size. It is suggested that kin-biased distribution and hence
   kin-biased behaviours are not likely to be expressed equally frequently
   in all populations since the number of close relatives will vary among
   populations and, hence, the opportunity for relatives to interact
   differs among populations. These findings can, at least partly, explain
   the discrepancy among previous studies of kin-biased distribution in
   wild salmonids under natural conditions. Effective population size
   could, hence, be used to predict the salmonid populations in which
   kin-biased distribution are more likely to occur and be detected. (c)

Abstract = {{Long-term effective population size is expected, and has been shown, to
   correlate positively with various measures of-population fitness. Here
   we examine the interacting effects of population size (as a surrogate
   for genetic factors) and prey consumption rates (as a surrogate for
   environmental quality) on fecundity in two sympatric species of wolf
   spider, Rabidosa punctulata and Rabidosa rabida. Population size was
   estimated in each of seven genetically isolated populations in each of
   3 years using mark-recapture methods. Fecundity was estimated as the
   mean number of live offspring produced by similar to 15 females sampled
   from each population of each species each year for 3 years. Prey
   consumption rates were estimated by sampling similar to 300 spiders per
   population per year and assaying the proportion of spiders with prey.
   Larger populations have higher fecundity and more genetic diversity
   than smaller populations. Variation among populations in fecundity for
   a given year could be attributed most strongly to differences in
   population size, with variation in prey consumption rates and the
   interaction between population size and prey consumption playing
   smaller but still important roles. During the most stressful
   environmental conditions, the smallest populations of both species
   experienced disproportionately low-fecundity rates, more than doubling
   the estimated number of lethal equivalents during those years. The
   evidence presented in this paper for inbreeding-environment
   interactions at the population level and further evidence for a
   log-linear relationship between population size and fitness have
   important implications for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The Japanese wood pigeon (Columba janthina) is endemic to the islands

   studying 463 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region sequences.
   We analyzed 154 samples from eight populations and identified 27
   haplotypes. Three population groups were identified based on the
   pairwise Phi(ST) values. A substantial gene flow, as reflected by the
   low and non-significant Phi(ST) values, is maintained among the
   northern group that includes six populations found on the Okinawa,
   Tokara, Goto, Setouchi, Oki, and Izu islands. In contrast, the
   southeastern group found on the Ogasawara Islands had large Phi(ST)
   values with every population from other regions (0.910 < Phi(ST) <
   0.962). The southwestern group found on the Sakishima Islands also had
   significant but small Phi(ST) values with every population from the
   northern group (0.081 < Phi(ST) < 0.205). The Mantel test showed a
   highly significant correlation between the Phi(ST) values and the route
   length of the habitat network, as well as the linear distance with
   correction of the habitat gap effect, indicating the importance of the
   closely connected structure of the habitats. The three groups mentioned
   above could be considered as independent management units, and the
   southeastern group has the highest conservation priority due to its

Abstract = {{The Balearic shearwater Puffinus rnauretanicus is one of the most
   critically endangered seabirds in the world. The species is endemic to
   the Balearic archipelago, and conservation concerns are the low number
   of breeding pairs, the low adult survival, and the possible
   hybridization with a sibling species, the morphologically smaller
   Yelkouan shearwater (P. yelkouan). We sampled almost the entire
   breeding range of the species and analyzed the genetic variation at two
   mitochondrial DNA regions. No genetic evidence of population decline
   was found. Despite the observed philopatry, we detected a weak
   population structure mainly due to connectivity among colonies higher
   than expected, but also to a Pleistocene demographic expansion. Some
   colonies showed a high imbalance between immigration and emigration
   rates, suggesting spatial heterogeneity in patch quality. Genetic
   evidence of maternal introgression from the sibling species was
   reinforced, but almost only in a peripheral colony and not followed, at
   least to date, by the spread of the introgressed mtDNA lineages.
   Morphometric differences were not correlated with mtDNA haplotypes and
   introgression. is probably due to a secondary contact between the two
   species several generations ago. Overall, results suggested that the

Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Better tools are needed to predict population connectivity in
   complex landscapes. `Least-cost modelling' is one commonly employed
   approach in which dispersal costs are assigned to distinct habitat
   types and the least-costly dispersal paths among habitat patches are
   calculated using a geographical information system (GIS). Because
   adequate data on dispersal are usually lacking, dispersal costs are
   often assigned solely from expert opinion. Spatially explicit,
   high-resolution genetic data may be used to infer variation in animal
   movements. We employ such an approach to estimate habitat-specific
   migration rates and to develop least-cost connectivity models for
   desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis nelsoni.
   2. Bighorn sheep dispersal is thought to be affected by distance and
   topography. We incorporated both factors into least-cost GIS models
   with different parameter values and estimated effective geographical
   distances among 26 populations. We assessed which model was correlated
   most strongly with gene flow estimates among those populations, while
   controlling for the effect of anthropogenic barriers. We used the
   best-fitting model to (i) determine whether migration rates are higher
   over sloped terrain than flat terrain; (ii) predict probable movement
   corridors; (iii) predict which populations are connected by migration;
   and (iv) investigate how anthropogenic barriers and translocated
   populations have affected landscape connectivity.
   3. Migration models were correlated most strongly with migration when
   areas of at least 10\% slope had 1/10th the cost of areas of lower
   slope; thus, gene flow occurred over longer distances when `escape
   terrain' was available. Optimal parameter values were consistent across
   two measures of gene flow and three methods for defining population
   polygons.
   4. Anthropogenic barriers disrupted numerous corridors predicted to be
   high-use dispersal routes, indicating priority areas for mitigation.
   However, population translocations have restored high-use dispersal
   routes in several other areas. Known intermountain movements of bighorn
   sheep were largely consistent with predicted corridors.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Population genetic data provided
   sufficient resolution to infer how landscape features influenced the
   behaviour of dispersing desert bighorn sheep. Anthropogenic barriers
   that block high-use dispersal corridors should be mitigated, but
   population translocations may help maintain connectivity. We conclude
   that developing least-cost models from similar empirical data could
   significantly improve the utility of these tools.}},

Abstract = {{The constraining effect of gene flow on adaptive divergence is often
   inferred but rarely quantified. We illustrate ways of doing so using
   stream populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
   that experience different levels of gene flow from a parapatric lake
   population. In the Misty Lake watershed (British Columbia, Canada), the
   inlet stream population is morphologically divergent from the lake
   population, and presumably experiences little gene flow from the lake.
   The outlet stream population, however, shows an intermediate phenotype
   and may experience more gene flow from the lake. We first used
   microsatellite data to demonstrate that gene flow from the lake is low
   into the inlet but high into the outlet, and that gene flow from the
   lake remains relatively constant with distance along the outlet. We
   next combined gene flow data with morphological and habitat data to
   quantify the effect of gene flow on morphological divergence. In one
   approach, we assumed that inlet stickleback manifest well-adapted
   phenotypic trait values not constrained by gene flow. We then
   calculated the deviation between the observed and expected phenotypes
   for a given habitat in the outlet. In a second approach, we
   parameterized a quantitative genetic model of adaptive divergence. Both
   approaches suggest a large impact of gene flow, constraining adaptation
   by 80-86\% in the outlet (i.e., only 14-20\% of the expected
   morphological divergence in the absence of gene flow was observed).
   Such approaches may be useful in other taxa to estimate how important
   gene flow is in constraining adaptive divergence in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Pelobates fuscus is a fossorial amphibian that inhabits much of the

   analysis (NCPA), and used summary statistics to analyse population
   structure under a neutral model of evolution. Populations were assigned
   to different drainage systems and we tested hypotheses of explicit
   refugial models using information from analysis of molecular variance,
   nucleotide diversity, effective population size estimation, NCPA,
   mismatch distribution and Bayesian dating. Coalescent simulations were
   used as post hoc tests for plausibility of derived or a priori assumed

   system as a centre of diversity for part of the `western lineage';

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects different organs and
   tissues. During these infection events, subpopulations of HIV type 1
   (HIV-1) develop and, if viral trafficking is restricted between
   subpopulations, the viruses can follow independent evolutionary
   histories, i.e., become compartmentalized. This phenomenon is usually
   detected via comparative sequence analysis and has been reported for
   viruses isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and the genital
   tract. Several approaches have been proposed to study the
   compartmentalization of HIV sequences, but to date, no rigorous
   comparison of the most commonly employed methods has been made. In this
   study, we systematically compared inferences made by six different
   methods for detecting compartmentalization based on three data sets:
   (i) a sample of 45 patients with sequences gathered from the CNS, (ii)
   sequences from the female genital tract of 18 patients, and (iii) a set
   of simulated sequences. We found that different methods often reached
   contradictory conclusions. Methods based on the topology of a
   phylogenetic tree derived from clonal sequences were generally more
   sensitive in detecting compartmentalization than those that relied
   solely upon pairwise genetic distances between sequences. However, as
   the branching structure in a phylogenetic tree is often uncertain,
   especially for short, low-diversity, or recombinant sequences,
   tree-based approaches may need to be modified to take phylogenetic
   uncertainty into account. Given the frequently discordant predictions
   of different methods and the strengths and weaknesses of each
   particular methodology, we recommend that a suite of several approaches
   be used for reliable inference of compartmentalized population
   structure.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1466-1480}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) is a popular method for
   reconstructing the demographic history of spatially distributed
   populations from genetic data. Although some parts of the analysis are
   automated, there is no unique and widely followed algorithm for doing
   this in its entirety, beginning with the data, and ending with the
   inferences drawn from the data. This article describes a method that
   automates NCPA, thereby providing a framework for replicating analyses
   in an objective way. To do so, a number of decisions need to be made so
   that the automated implementation is representative of previous
   analyses. We review how the NCPA procedure has evolved since its
   inception and conclude that there is scope for some variability in the
   manual application of NCPA. We apply the automated software to three
   published datasets previously analyzed manually and replicate many
   details of the manual analyses, suggesting that the current algorithm
   is representative of how a typical user will perform NCPA. We simulate
   a large number of replicate datasets for geographically distributed,
   but entirely random-mating, populations. These are then analyzed using
   the automated NCPA algorithm. Results indicate that NCPA tends to give
   a high frequency of false positives. In our simulations we observe that
   14\% of the clades give a conclusive inference that a demographic event
   has occurred, and that 75\% of the datasets have at least one clade
   that gives such an inference. This is mainly due to the generation of
   multiple statistics per clade, of which only one is required to be
   significant to apply the inference key. We survey the inferences that
   have been made in recent publications and show that the most commonly
   inferred processes (restricted gene flow with isolation by distance and
   contiguous range expansion) are those that are commonly inferred in our
   simulations. However, published datasets typically yield a richer set
   of inferences with NCPA than obtained in our random-mating simulations,
   and further testing of NCPA with models of structured populations is
   necessary to examine its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cephalopod movement occurs during all phases of the life history, with
   the abundance and location of cephalopod populations strongly
   influenced by the prevalence and scale of their movements.
   Environmental parameters, such as sea temperature and oceanographic
   processes, have a large influence on movement at the various life cycle
   stages, particularly those of oceanic squid. Tag recapture studies are
   the most common way of directly examining cephalopod movement,
   particularly in species which are heavily fished. Electronic tags,
   however, are being more commonly used to track cephalopods, providing
   detailed small- and large-scale movement information. Chemical tagging
   of paralarvae through maternal transfer may prove to be a viable
   technique for tracking this little understood cephalopod life stage, as
   large numbers of individuals could be tagged at once. Numerous indirect
   methods can also be used to examine cephalopod movement, such as
   chemical analyses of the elemental and/or isotopic signatures of
   cephalopod hard parts, with growing interest in utilising these
   techniques for elucidating migration pathways, as is commonly done for
   fish. Geographic differences in parasite fauna have also been used to
   indirectly provide movement information, however, explicit movement
   studies require detailed information on parasite-host specificity and
   parasite geographic distribution, which is yet to be determined for
   cephalopods. Molecular genetics offers a powerful approach to
   estimating realised effective migration rates among populations, and
   continuing developments in markers and analytical techniques hold the
   promise of more detailed identification of migrants. To date genetic
   studies indicate that migration in squids is extensive but can be
   blocked by major oceanographic features, and in cuttlefish and octopus
   migration is more locally restricted than predictions from life history
   parameters would suggest. Satellite data showing the location of
   fishing lights have been increasingly used to examine the movement of
   squid fishing vessels, as a proxy for monitoring the movement of the
   squid populations themselves, allowing for the remote monitoring of
   oceanic species.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for model fitting and inference in
   the context of Bayesian models of the type f(Y vertical bar X,theta) f
   (X vertical bar theta)f(theta), where Y is the (set of) observed data,
   theta is a set of model parameters and X is an unobserved (latent)
   stationary stochastic process induced by the first order transition
   model f(X(t+1)vertical bar X-(t),theta), where X-(t) denotes the state
   of the process at time (or generation) t. The crucial feature of the
   above type of model is that, given theta, the transition model f(X(t+1
   vertical bar|X-(t) stop,theta) is known but the distribution of the
   stochastic process in equilibrium, that is f(X|theta), is, except in
   very special cases, intractable, hence unknown. A further point to note
   is that the data Y has been assumed to be observed when the underlying
   process is in equilibrium. In other words, the data is not collected
   dynamically over time.
   We refer to such specification as a latent equilibrium process (LEP)
   model. It is motivated by problems in population genetics (though other
   applications are discussed), where it is of interest to learn about
   parameters such as mutation and migration rates and population sizes,
   given a sample of allele frequencies at one or more loci. In such
   problems it is natural to assume that the distribution of the observed
   allele frequencies depends on the true (unobserved) population allele
   frequencies, whereas the distribution of the true allele frequencies is
   only indirectly specified through a transition model.
   As a hierarchical specification, it is natural to fit the LEP within a
   Bayesian framework. Fitting such models is usually done via Markov
   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, we demonstrate that, in the case of
   LEP models, implementation of MCMC is far from straightforward. The
   main contribution of this paper is to provide a methodology to
   implement MCMC for LEP models. We demonstrate our approach in
   population genetics problems with both simulated and real data sets.
   The resultant model fitting is computationally intensive and thus, we
   also discuss parallel implementation of the procedure in special cases.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat connectivity and corridors are often assumed to be critical for
   the persistence of patchily distributed populations, but empirical
   evidence for this assumption is scarce. We assessed the importance of
   connectivity among habitat patches for dispersal by a mature-forest
   obligate, the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus). Boreal Owls demonstrated
   a lack of genetic structure (theta = 0.004 +/- 0.002 {[}SE]) among
   subpopulations, regardless of matrix type and extent, which indicates
   that unforested matrix does not act as a barrier to dispersal for this
   vagile species. We found only slightly higher genetic distances
   (Cavalli-Sforza chord distances ranged from 0.015 to 0.025) among
   patchily distributed Rocky Mountain subpopulations as compared with
   largely contiguous boreal-forest subpopulations (0.013 to 0.019) and no
   evidence of a genetic split across the expansive high plains of
   Wyoming. Even the most isolated subalpine patches are connected via
   gene flow. As northern boreal forests continue to experience intensive
   harvest of mature stands, geographic dispersion of Boreal Owl habitat
   may begin to more closely resemble that found in the Rocky Mountains.
   We suggest that decreased connectivity poses much less of a threat to
   continued abundance of this mature-forest obligate than overall loss of
   nesting and foraging habitat. Assessment of the importance of corridors
   and connectivity should be conducted on a species-by-species basis,
   given the variation in response of species to discontinuity of habitat,
   even among closely related taxa or guilds.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated granitic rock outcrops or `inselbergs' may provide a window
   into the molecular ecology and genetics of continental radiations under
   simplified conditions, in analogy to the use of oceanic islands in
   studies of species radiations. Patterns of variability and gene flow in
   inselberg species have never been thoroughly evaluated in comparison to
   related taxa with more continuous distribution ranges, or to other
   species in the same kingdom in general. We use nuclear microsatellites
   to study population differentiation and gene flow in two diploid,
   perennial plants adapted to high-altitude neotropical inselbergs,
   Alcantarea imperialis and Alcantarea geniculata (Bromeliaceae).
   Population differentiation is pronounced in both taxa, especially in A.
   imperialis. Gene flow in this species is considerably lower than
   expected from the literature on plants in general and Bromeliaceae in
   particular, and too low to prevent differentiation due to drift (N(e)m
   < 1), unless selection coefficients/effect sizes of favourable alleles
   are great enough to maintain species cohesion. Low gene flow in A.
   imperialis indicates that the ability of pollinating bats to promote
   gene exchange between inselbergs is smaller than previously assumed.
   Population subdivision in one inselberg population of A. imperialis
   appears to be associated with the presence of two colour morphs that
   differ in the coloration of rosettes and bracts. Our results indicate a
   high potential for inselbergs as venues for studies of the molecular
   ecology and genetics of continental radiations, such as the one that
   gave rise to the extraordinary diversity of adaptive strategies and

Abstract = {{I present a simple approach to overcome the high cost and low

   screening transformed bacterial colonies and identifying the inserts

   this technique by presenting the results I obtained from cloning four
   nuclear genes in 118 individuals from three species of sea urchins
   (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. droebachiensis and S. pallidus). Of

Abstract = {{Natural populations of wild common buckwheat have been found growing

   wild common buckwheat were chosen, one from Yanjing village in the
   Sanjiang area, which is presumed to be the original birthplace of
   common buckwheat, and one from Jinhe village, Yanyuan district of
   Sichuan province in China. The genotypes of 45 individuals from each
   population were examined at eight microsatellite marker loci to
   estimate the magnitude of gene flow between the cultivated and wild
   common buckwheat populations. The Bayesian method with a Markov chain
   Monte Carlo approach estimated that the magnitude of gene flow between
   the populations in the Sanjiang area at 0.0020.008 was not
   significantly different from that found in Yanyuan district at
   0.0020.008. The gene flow between cultivated populations was higher,
   usually at 0.002-0.044 (exceptionally high at 0.255 between cultivated

   population and a natural population (0.002-0.008) or between two

   found between the cultivated populations and natural populations

   Analysis of six microsatellite loci from paired plots on the same side

   stream did contribute to genetic differentiation of salamander
   populations. Collectively, our results imply that low-order streams do
   influence patterns of movement and gene flow in red-backed salamanders.
   We suggest that given the high density of first-order and second-order

Abstract = {{The Namaqua sandgrouse, Pterocles namaqua, is a highly nomadic
   granivore of semiarid to arid habitats. As a result of nomadic
   movements in response to rainfall, the size of the breeding population
   in any one area fluctuates dramatically between breeding seasons. This
   high mobility in response to spatial and temporal abundance of food
   resources is expected to result in little population genetic
   structuring. Namaqua sandgrouse also shows a seasonally predictable
   partial migration between the southeast and northwest regions of South
   Africa, and a further possible north-south migration between
   southwestern South Africa and central Namibia. It is unclear whether
   birds migrating between these regions breed in only one or both
   regions. If populations breed in only one region of their migratory
   range, then population genetic structuring is predicted to occur. This
   study addresses Namaqua sandgrouse movements with the analysis of
   mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. In general, little
   population genetic structure was evident, yet strong signals of
   population growth were detected. Several populations have private
   alleles, which is in direct contradiction to the spatial genetic

Abstract = {{The vast majority of phylogenetic models focus on resolution of gene
   trees, despite the fact that phylogenies of species in which gene trees
   are embedded are of primary interest. We analyze a Bayesian model for
   estimating species trees that accounts for the stochastic variation
   expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled from a
   single species history after a coalescent process. Application of the
   model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set of gene
   trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared but unknown
   species tree from which gene trees are sampled is much reduced compared
   with treating the history of each locus independently of an overarching
   species tree. The analysis also yields a concentrated posterior
   distribution of the yeast species tree whose mode is congruent with the
   concatenated gene tree but can do so with less than half the loci
   required by the concatenation method. Using simulations, we show that,
   with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species trees can be
   estimated under conditions in which concatenation of sequence data will
   positively mislead phylogeny, and when the proportion of gene trees
   matching the species tree is <10\%. However, when gene tree/species
   tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved with just two or

   geographical population differentiation and its contemporary migration
   rates. The population sample consists of 110 specimens collected in
   Northern Quebec, Baffin Island, Western Greenland and Northern
   Scandinavia. DNA-sequence data sets of three nuclear gene fragments
   (LSU, RPB2 and beta-tubulin) were analysed for genetic diversity
   within, and differentiation between, geographical regions. Tests of
   population subdivision employing analyses of molecular variance and
   exact tests of haplotype frequency distributions showed significant
   structure between the geographical regions. However, the lack of fixed
   nucleotide polymorphisms and the wide sharing of identical haplotypes
   between geographical regions suggest recurrent long-distance gene flow
   of propagules. Still, the means by which propagules are dispersed
   remain to be discovered. Inference of migration rates shows that in
   many cases a sufficiently high amount of migrants is exchanged between
   geographical regions to prevent drastic population differentiation
   through genetic drift. The observed haplotype distributions and
   migration rates point to a gene flow model of isolation by distance.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach for estimating mixing between populations
   based on non-recombining markers, specifically Y-chromosome
   microsatellites. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian statistical
   approach is used to calculate the posterior probability distribution of
   population parameters of interest, including the effective population
   size and the time to most recent common ancestor (MRCA). To test
   whether two populations are homogeneously mixed we introduce a
   ``mixing{''} statistic defined for each coalescent event that weights
   the contribution of that ancestor's descendants to the two
   subpopulations, and an associated population ``purity{''} statistic.
   Using simulated data with low levels of migration between two
   populations, we demonstrate that our method is more sensitive than
   other commonly used distance-based methods such as R-ST and D-SW. To
   illustrate our method, we analysed mixing between 11 pre-defined
   Chinese ethnic/regional populations, using 5 microsatellite markers
   from the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome (NRY),
   demonstrating a significant clustering of a subset of subpopulations
   with a high mutual relative degree of mixing (homogeneous mixing with
   support > 0.99). Our analysis suggests that there is a strong
   correlation between effective population size and mixing with other
   subpopulations. Thus, despite considerable mixing between these groups,
   the purity statistic still identifies significant heterogeneity,
   suggesting that periods of historical isolation continue to leave a
   recoverable signal despite modern introgression.}},

Abstract = {{Larval dispersal is critical for the maintenance of species populations
   in patchy and ephemeral hydrothermal vent habitats. On fast-spreading
   ridges, such as the East Pacific Rise, rates of habitat turnover are
   comparable to estimated life-spans of many of the inhabiting species.
   Traditionally, dispersal questions have been addressed with two very
   different approaches, larval studies and population genetics.
   Population genetic studies of vent-endemic species have been
   informative for determining whether patterns of dispersal are
   suggestive of stepping stone or island models and estimating rates of
   gene flow (effective migrants per generation) over broad geographic
   ranges. However, these studies leave fundamental questions unanswered
   about the specific mechanisms by which larvae disperse and species
   maintain their populations and biogeographic ranges. With the goal of
   examining genetic structure and elucidating alternative larval
   dispersal mechanisms, we employed a genomic DNA fingerprinting
   technique, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). To assess
   the potential utility of AFLPs, and genetic structure of the
   hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, genomic `fingerprints'
   were recovered from 29 individuals from five vent fields spanning a
   distance of up to c. 5000 km along the East Pacific Rise. In contrast
   to previous population genetic studies that found little to no genetic
   structure using allozymes and mitochondrial DNA, genetic analyses of
   630 polymorphic AFLP loci identified distinct subclades within R.
   pachyptila populations. Significant levels of differentiation were
   observed among populations from all vent regions as well as within each
   region. Discrete assemblages of tube-worms separated by as little as c.
   400 m within a given vent region were genetically distinguishable and
   cohorts (based on size-frequency distribution) within an aggregation
   were found to be most closely related. These results suggest that
   mechanisms of larval dispersal act to retain cohort fidelity in R.

   waterfowl and shorebirds in this region (1998-2004; 8,254 samples)

   Combined with a synthesis of avian diversity and abundance,

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the
   NONMEM prior functionality compared to a full Bayesian method when
   applied to population physiological models using diazepam as a case
   study.
   Methods: Whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WBPBPK)
   models for diazepam were initially developed, tested and calibrated for
   rats and man using a full Bayesian analysis as implemented in WINBUGS.
   The final models were implemented in NONMEM and the results from the
   two analyses compared in terms of parameter estimates, measures of
   parameter precision and run times.
   Results: NONMEM population parameter estimates were in close agreement
   with those produced by the Bayesian analysis although there was a
   substantial shortening of run time for both the animal WBPBPK model
   (4.5 vs. 21 h) and human WBPBPK models (2 vs. 167 h). The adequacy of
   the model and the final parameter estimates were judged to be
   sufficient by the model's ability to describe individual tissue
   concentration-time profiles. The model provided a good overall
   description of the plasma concentration-time data in both rat and man
   with comparable parameter precision. A limited nonparametric bootstrap
   (n=50) was performed to assess parameter sensitivity, bias and
   imprecision. No systematic bias was seen when comparing bootstrap means
   to final parameter estimates.
   Conclusions: The ease of implementation and reductions in run time
   hopefully provide a further step forward in allowing the wider use of
   these complex and information-rich models together with clinical data

Abstract = {{The range of the grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), one of the most
   heavily harvested bird species for the international pet trade, spans
   the forest belt of Central and West Africa and includes the oceanic
   island of Principe (Gulf of Guinea). Morphological variation led to the
   recognition of two mainland subspecies (P. e. erithacus and P. e.
   timneh). The population from Principe was originally described as a
   separate species (P. princeps) but is currently included in the
   nominate race. We used 1932 bp of the mitochondrial genome to clarify
   the genealogical affinities between the two currently-recognized
   mainland subspecies and the Principe population. Sampling included 20
   individuals from Principe, 17 from P. e. erithacus, and 13 from P. e.
   timneh. We found that the two mainland subspecies form two independent
   lineages, having diverged up to 2.4 million years ago (Ma), and that
   the Principe population is composed of two lineages that diverged in
   allopatry. The most common lineage is descended from the first
   colonizers and evolved in isolation for up to 1.4 Ma. Contrary to
   current understanding, this `Principe lineage' is more closely related
   to the timneh than to the erithacus subspecies. The second lineage
   consists of P. e. erithacus birds from the nearby mainland that
   colonized the island in recent times. The evolutionary dynamics of the
   grey parrot population of Principe are primarily characterized by
   isolation, with new genetic variation being added through rare
   immigration events. The heavily harvested Principe grey parrot
   population should therefore be treated as an independent conservation

Abstract = {{Although fragmented rainforest environments represent hotspots for
   invertebrate biodiversity, few genetic studies have been conducted on
   rainforest invertebrates. Thus, it is not known if invertebrate species
   in rainforests are highly genetically fragmented, with the potential
   for populations to show divergent selection responses, or if there are
   low levels of gene flow sufficient to maintain genetic homogeneity
   among fragmented populations. Here we use microsatellite markers and
   DNA sequences from the mitochondrial ND5 locus to investigate genetic
   differences among Drosophila birchii populations from tropical
   rainforests in Queensland, Australia. As found in a previous study,
   mitochondrial DNA diversity was low with no evidence for population
   differentiation among rainforest fragments. The pattern of
   mitochondrial haplotype variation was consistent with D. birchii having
   undergone substantial past population growth. Levels of nuclear genetic
   variation were high in all populations while F-ST values were very low,
   even for flies from geographically isolated areas of rainforest. No
   significant differentiation was observed between populations on either
   side of the Burdekin Gap (a long-term dry corridor), although there was
   evidence for higher gene diversity in low-latitude populations. Spatial
   autocorrelation coefficients were low and did not differ significantly
   from random, except for one locus which revealed a clinal-like pattern.
   Comparisons of microsatellite differentiation contrasted with
   previously established clinal patterns in quantitative traits in D.
   birchii, and indicate that the patterns in quantitative traits are
   likely to be due to selection. These results suggest moderate gene flow
   in D. birchii over large distances. Limited population structure in
   this species appears to be due to recent range expansions or cycles of
   local extinctions followed by recolonizations/expansions. Nevertheless,
   patterns of local adaptation have developed in D. birchii that may
   result in populations showing different selection responses when faced
   with environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Pine and oak woodlands are common North American floral communities

   highly disjunct distribution of these woodlands. We propose three
   historical hypotheses to explain the evolution of the white-breasted
   nuthatch in its principal habitat. (i) The species evolved in situ in
   the regional pine-oak communities and the isolation of populations in
   these regions is captured in cryptic genetic variation. (ii) Migration
   of individuals between regions is frequent enough to maintain the
   widespread distributions and prevent regional divergence. (iii) The
   species have recently expanded to occupy their current distributions
   and an insufficient amount of time has passed for divergence to occur.
   Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (ND2 gene) variation (N =
   216) in the white-breasted nuthatch reveals four reciprocally
   monophyletic clades concordant with the distribution of the regional

Abstract = {{The connectivity among marine populations is determined by the
   dispersal capabilities of adults as well as their eggs and larvae.
   Dispersal distances and directions have a profound effect on gene flow
   and genetic differentiation within species. Genetic homogeneity over
   large areas is a common feature of coral reef fishes and can reflect
   high dispersal capability resulting in high levels of gene flow. If
   fish larvae return to their parental reef, gene flow would be
   restricted and genetic differentiation could occur. Larabicus
   quadrilineatus (Labridae) is considered as an endemic fish species of
   the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The juveniles of this species are cleaner
   fish that feed on ectoparasites of other fishes. Here, we investigated
   the genetic population structure and gene flow in L. quadrilineatus
   among five locations in the Red Sea to infer connectivity among them.
   To estimate genetic diversity, we analysed 369 bp of 237 mitochondrial
   DNA control region sequences. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were
   higher in the southern than in the northern Red Sea. Analysis of
   molecular variance (AMOVA) detected the highest significant genetic
   variation between northern and central/southern populations (Phi(CT) =
   0.01; P < 0.001). Migration analysis revealed a several fold higher
   northward than southward migration, which could be explained by
   oceanographic conditions and spawning season. Even though the Phi(ST)
   value of 0.01 is rather low and implies a long larval dispersal
   distance, estimates based on the isolation-by-distance model show a
   very low mean larval dispersal distance (0.44-5.1 km) compared to other
   studies. In order to enable a sustainable ornamental fishery on the
   four-line wrasse, the results of this study suggest that populations in
   the northern and southern Red Sea should be managed separately as two
   different stocks. The rather low larval dispersal distance of about 5
   km needs to be considered in the design of marine protected areas to
   enable connectivity and self-seeding.}},

Abstract = {{Brown trout populations in the Hardanger Fjord, Norway, have declined
   drastically due to increased exposure to salmon lice from salmonid
   aquaculture. We studied contemporary samples from seven populations and
   historical samples (1972 and 1983) from the two largest populations,
   one of which has declined drastically whereas the other remains stable.
   We analysed 11 microsatellite loci, including one tightly linked to the
   UBA gene of the major histocompatibility class I complex (MHC) and
   another locus linked to the TAP2A gene, also associated with MHC. The
   results revealed asymmetric gene flow from the two largest populations
   to the other, smaller populations. This has important conservation
   implications, and we predict that possible future population recoveries
   will be mediated primarily by the remaining large population. Tests for
   selection suggested diversifying selection at UBA, whereas evidence was
   inconclusive for TAP2A. There was no evidence for temporally
   fluctuating selection. We assessed the distribution of adaptive
   divergence among populations. The results showed the most pronounced
   footprints of selection between the two largest populations subject to
   the least immigration. We suggest that asymmetric gene flow has an
   important influence on adaptive divergence and constrains local
   adaptive responses in the smaller populations. Even though UBA alleles
   may not affect salmon louse resistance, the results bear evidence of
   adaptive divergence among populations at immune system genes. This
   suggests that similar genetic differences could exist at salmon louse
   resistance loci, thus rendering it a realistic scenario that
   differential population declines could reflect differences in adaptive

Abstract = {{Bayesian methods have become extremely popular in molecular ecology

   complex demographic scenarios using genetic data. Articles presenting
   new methods generally include sensitivity studies that evaluate their
   performance, but they tend to be limited and need to be followed by a
   more thorough evaluation. Here we evaluate the performance of a recent
   method, BAYESASS, which allows the estimation of recent migration rates
   among populations, as well as the inbreeding coefficient of each local
   population. We expand the simulation study of the original publication
   by considering multi-allelic markers and scenarios with varying number
   of populations. We also investigate the effect of varying migration
   rates and F-ST more thoroughly in order to identify the region of
   parameter space where the method is and is not able to provide accurate
   estimates of migration rate. Results indicate that if the demographic
   history of the species being studied fits the assumptions of the
   inference model, and if genetic differentiation is not too low (F-ST >=
   0.05), then the method can give fairly accurate estimates of migration
   rates even when they are fairly high (about 0.1). However, when the
   assumptions of the inference model are violated, accurate estimates are
   obtained only if migration rates are very low (m = 0.01) and genetic
   differentiation is high (F-ST >= 0.10). Our results also show that

Abstract = {{Dispersal is often viewed as a process on which the landscape has
   little effect. This is particularly apparent in populations' genetic
   and ecological studies, where isolation by distance is generally tested
   using a Euclidean distance between populations. However, landscapes can
   be richly textured mosaics of patches, associated with different
   qualities (e.g. different costs crossing patches) and different
   structures (shape, size and arrangement). An important challenge,
   therefore, is to determine if accounting for this additional complexity
   enriches our understanding of the dispersal processes.
   In this study, we quantify the effect of landscape structure on
   dispersal distances between 15 populations of the greater white-toothed
   shrew (Crocidura russula) in a highly fragmented landscape in
   Switzerland. We use a spatially explicit individual-based model to
   simulate C. russula dispersal. This model is designed to account for
   movement behavior in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore the
   relationship between simulation results and genetic differentiation
   between actual subpopulations. Finally, we test if simulated dispersal
   distances are better predictors of genetic differentiation than
   traditional Euclidean distances.
   The ecological distances measured by the model show a clear
   relationship with genetic differentiation between C. russula
   subpopulations. This relationship is stronger than the one obtained by
   the usual Euclidean distance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (n = 1654) of sea lions from across Alaska than earlier investigations

   phylogeographic differentiation between southeastern and western Alaska

   ecology and population trends. A number of rookeries were also
   significantly differentiated from nearby rookeries (F-st = 0.02-0.025,

Abstract = {{In 1988, Felsenstein described a framework for assessing the likelihood
   of a genetic data set in which all of the possible genealogical
   histories of the data are considered, each in proportion to their
   probability. Although not analytically solvable, several approaches,
   including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, have been developed to find
   approximate solutions. Here, we describe an approach in which Markov
   chain Monte Carlo simulations are used to integrate over the space of
   genealogies, whereas other parameters are integrated out analytically.
   The result is an approximation to the full joint posterior density of
   the model parameters. For many purposes, this function can be treated
   as a likelihood, thereby permitting likelihood-based analyses,
   including likelihood ratio tests of nested models. Several examples,
   including an application to the divergence of chimpanzee subspecies,
   are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus Girard, have a 3-month pelagic larval stage
   and are an important recreational and commercial species on the west
   coast of North America. Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue
   samples were used to characterize population structure and infer
   patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic
   structure was found when estimates of Wright's F-ST (i.e., Phi(ST))
   were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations
   within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington
   State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work.
   Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although
   migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of
   all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one
   direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm
   < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity
   at large (similar to 1,000 km) and small (similar to 100 km) spatial
   scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the
   inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with
   prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances
   for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future
   work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However,
   limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help
   explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in
   the northern (87\% rebuilt) than in the southern (24\% rebuilt) fishery
   region, supporting a regional management strategy. These results
   suggest that despite a 3-month pelagic larval stage, some areas may be
   effectively closed with respect to both population dynamics and fishery
   management issues.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape genetics has emerged as a new research area that integrates
   population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics.
   Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic
   markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to
   evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic
   diversity and population structure. While interest in this research
   area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data,
   test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines
   has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of
   the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and
   knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines.
   The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing
   geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques
   widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely
   addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the
   term `landscape genetics', provide an overview of the landscape
   genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design
   and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the
   field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance
   interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal in birds and mammals tends to be female-biased in monogamous

   in sex ratios and in asymmetric gene flow between neighbouring salmon
   populations, but little or no evidence for sex-biased dispersal. We
   show that conditions favouring male dispersal will often be offset by
   those favouring female dispersal, and that spatial and temporal
   variation in sex ratios within a metapopulation may favour the
   dispersal of different sexes in source and sink habitats. Thus, our
   results reconcile previous discrepancies on salmonid dispersal and

Abstract = {{Since the late 1990s, molecular techniques have fuelled debate about
   the role of Pleistocene glacial cycles in structuring contemporary
   avian diversity in North America. The debate is still heated; however,
   there is widespread agreement that the Pleistocene glacial cycles
   forced the repeated contraction, fragmentation, and expansion of the
   North American biota. These demographic processes should leave genetic
   `footprints' in modern descendants, suggesting that detailed population
   genetic studies of contemporary species provide the key to elucidating
   the impact of the late Quaternary (late Pleistocene-Holocene). We
   present an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in the
   mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli) in an attempt to examine the
   genetic evidence of the impact of the late Quaternary glacial cycles.
   Phylogenetic analyses reveal two strongly supported clades of P.
   gambeli: an Eastern Clade (Rocky Mountains and Great Basin) and a
   Western Clade (Sierra Nevada and Cascades). Post-glacial introgression
   is apparent between these two clades in the Mono Lake region of Central
   California. Within the Eastern Clade there is evidence of
   isolation-by-distance in the Rocky Mountain populations, and of limited
   gene flow into and around the Great Basin. Coalescent analysis of

Abstract = {{This study examined the degree and pattern of variability in trophic
   morphology in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) at three spatial
   scales: across 22 populations from Scotland and between and within two
   adjacent catchments (Laxford and Shin) in northern Scotland. In
   addition, the variability at six microsatellite loci between and within
   the Laxford and Shin systems was determined. Habitat use by charr
   differed significantly between populations. The pattern of variability
   in trophic morphology, known to influence foraging ability in charr,
   showed a very high degree of between-population variation with at least
   52\% of population pairs showing significant differences in head shape.
   Trophic morphology and genetic variation was also high over small
   geographical scales; variation being as high between charr from lakes
   within the same catchment, as between adjacent catchments. The pattern
   of both phenotypic and genotypic variation suggests a mosaic of
   variation across populations with geographically close populations
   often as distinct from each other as populations with much greater
   separation. Very low levels of effective migrants between populations,
   even within the same catchment, suggest that this variation is being
   maintained by very low straying rates between phenotypically and
   genetically distinct populations, even when there is no apparent
   barrier to movement. We conclude that the genetic and phenotypic
   integrity of charr populations across Scotland is high and that this
   adaptive radiation constitutes a `hidden' element of diversity in
   northern freshwater systems. Two consequences of this are that the
   population (rather than the species) makes a more rational unit for the
   consideration of conservation strategies and that the habitat
   requirements and therefore management needs may differ significantly
   between populations.}},

Abstract = {{The range dynamics of a species can either be governed by the spatial

   realized environmental niche in three land snail species of the genus
   Candidula, integrating phylogeographical methods, morphometrics, and
   spatial biodiversity informatics. The phylogeographical analyses showed
   significant range expansions in all species. These expansions were
   accompanied in Candidula gigaxii by a shift in the realized
   environmental niche, the species Candidula unifasciata followed its
   ancestral niche during expansion while the climate changed in the area
   of origin and Candidula rugosiuscula tracked the ancestral
   environmental conditions. The significant niche shifts were associated

Abstract = {{Populations of lake sturgeon Acipenser Julvescens have undergone

   While information regarding the genetic population structure of this

   and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation as a means of estimating
   population genetic diversity within, and the degree of spatial
   population structuring among, 11 remnant lake sturgeon populations in
   the upper Great Lakes basin. Multiple measures of genetic diversity
   were consistently high across populations and were not significantly

   substantial population declines, life history characteristics,

   sturgeon populations from losses of genetic diversity. Significant
   levels of interpopulation variance in both microsatellite allele and
   mtDNA haplotype frequencies (mean genetic differentiation index = 0.055

Abstract = {{One proposed mechanism of speciation is divergent sexual selection,

   among populations of an Amazonian frog (Physalaemus petersi). First,
   sexual selection has promoted divergence in male mating calls and
   female preferences for calls between neighbouring populations,
   resulting in strong behavioural isolation. Second, phylogenetic
   analysis indicates that populations have become fixed for alternative
   call types several times throughout the species' range, and coalescent
   analysis rejects genetic drift as a cause for this pattern, suggesting
   that this divergence is due to selection. Finally, gene flow estimated
   with microsatellite loci is an average of 30 times lower between
   populations with different call types than between populations
   separated by a similar geographical distance with the same call type,
   demonstrating genetic divergence and incipient speciation. Taken
   together, these data provide strong evidence that sexual selection is
   driving behavioural isolation and speciation, supporting sexual
   selection as a cause for speciation in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of recently established populations are challenging
   because the assumption of equilibrium underlying many analyses is
   likely to be violated. Using microsatellites, we investigated
   determinants of genetic structure and migration among invasive
   European-Chinese mitten crab populations, applying a combination of
   traditional population genetic analyses and nonequilibrium Bayesian
   methods. Consistent with their recent history, invasive populations
   showed much lower levels of genetic diversity than a native Chinese
   population, indicative of recent bottlenecks. Population
   differentiation was generally low but significant and especially
   pronounced among recently established populations. Significant
   differentiation among cohorts from the same geographical location
   (River Thames) suggests the low effective population size and
   associated strong genetic drift that would be anticipated from a very
   recent colonization. An isolation-by-distance pattern appears to be
   driven by an underlying correlation between geographical distance and
   population age, suggesting that cumulative homogenizing gene flow
   reduces founder bottleneck-associated genetic differentiation between
   longer-established populations. This hypothesis was supported by a
   coalescent analysis, which supported a drift + gene flow model as more
   likely than a model excluding gene flow. Furthermore, admixture
   analysis identified several recent migrants between the UK and
   Continental European population clusters. Admixture proportions were
   significantly predicted by the volume of shipping between sites,
   indicating that human-mediated transport remains a significant factor
   for dispersal of mitten crabs after the initial establishment of
   populations. Our study highlights the value of nonequilibrium methods
   for the study of invasive species, and also the importance of

Abstract = {{Peregrine falcon populations underwent devastating declines in the
   mid-20th century due to the bioaccumulation of organochlorine
   contaminants, becoming essentially extirpated east of the Great Plains
   and significantly reduced elsewhere in North America. Extensive
   re-introduction programs and restrictions on pesticide use in Canada
   and the United States have returned many populations to predecline
   sizes. A proper population genetic appraisal of the consequences of
   this decline requires an appropriate context defined by (i) meaningful
   demographic entities; and (ii) suitable reference populations. Here we
   explore the validity of currently recognized subspecies designations
   using data from the mitochondrial control region and 11 polymorphic
   microsatellite loci taken from 184 contemporary individuals from across
   the breeding range, and compare patterns of population genetic
   structure with historical patterns inferred from 95 museum specimens.
   Of the three North American subspecies, the west coast marine
   subspecies Falco peregrinus pealei is well differentiated genetically
   in both time periods using nuclear loci. In contrast, the partitioning
   of continental Falco peregrinus anatum and arctic Falco peregrinus
   tundrius subspecies is not substantiated, as individuals from these
   subspecies are historically indistinguishable genetically. Bayesian
   clustering analyses demonstrate that contemporary genetic
   differentiation between these two subspecies is mainly due to changes
   within F. p. anatum (specifically the southern F. p. anatum
   populations). Despite expectations and a variety of tests, no genetic
   bottleneck signature is found in the identified populations; in fact,
   many contemporary indices of diversity are higher than historical
   values. These results are rationalized by the promptness of the
   recovery and the possible introduction of new genetic material.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic diversity and genetic structure of plant populations are
   influenced by processes of regeneration. Assessing the genetic
   composition of populations regenerated by different modes is important
   for successful forest management and conservation. In this study, we
   compared the genetic diversity and genetic structure of six populations
   in mixed stands with those of four post-fire stands of the noble
   hardwood species Betula maximowicziana. We collected plant tissues from
   491 adults and 266 seedlings, germinated from soil samples, for a total
   of 10 populations, and genotyped them using 11 microsatellite loci.
   Genetic diversity parameters (e.g., H-E, R-s, F-IS) in the post-fire
   stands were similar to those in the mixed stands. In contrast, other
   parameters, including the number of private alleles (P-A), the number
   of loci showing significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) and effective
   population size (Ne) differed between the mixed and post-fire stands.
   The average P-A, LD and Ne values were 1.2, 2.0 and 315.7,
   respectively, for the mixed stands, and 0.3, 5.0 and 282.2,
   respectively, for the post-fire stands. Evidence of a significant
   bottleneck was detected in two of four adult populations in the
   post-fire stands, possibly as a result of a catastrophic founder effect
   due to fire disturbance on their genetic constitution. Buried seed
   populations maintained the same level of genetic variability as adult
   populations, but with lower genetic differentiation among them.
   Spatioternporal gene flow, characterized by wind-mediated dispersal and
   the persistence of viable seeds in the soil, are key factors
   maintaining the genetic diversity of B. maximowicziana populations. Our
   study reveals that post-fire stands and buried seeds will be useful
   genetic resources in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the evolution of genes of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) is rapidly increasing, but there are
   still enigmatic questions remaining, particularly regarding the
   maintenance of high levels of MHC polymorphisms in small, isolated
   populations. Here, we analyze the genetic variation at eight
   microsatellite loci and sequence variation at exon 2 of the MHC class
   IIB (DAB) genes in two wild populations of the Trinidadian guppy,
   Poecilia reticulata. We compare the genetic variation of a small (N-e
   approximate to 100) and relatively isolated upland population to that
   of its much larger (N. 2400) downstream counterpart. As predicted,
   microsatellite diversity in the upland population is significantly
   lower and highly differentiated from the population further downstream.
   Surprisingly, however, these guppy populations are not differentiated
   by MHC genetic variation and show very similar levels of allelic
   richness. Computer simulations indicate that the observed level of
   genetic variation can be maintained with overdominant selection acting
   at three DAB loci. The selection coefficients differ dramatically
   between the upland (s >= 0.2) and lowland (s <= 0.01) populations.
   Parasitological analysis on wild-caught fish shows that parasite load
   is significantly higher on upland than on lowland fish, which suggests
   that large differences in selection intensity may indeed exist between
   populations. Based on the infection intensity, a substantial proportion
   of the upland fish would have suffered direct or indirect fitness
   consequences as a result of their high parasite loads. Selection by
   parasites plays a particularly important role in the evolution of
   guppies in the upland habitat, which has resulted in high levels of MHC
   diversity being maintained in this population despite considerable
   genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{Effective spatial management of coral reefs including design of marine
   protected areas requires an understanding of interpopulation genetic
   connectivity. We assessed gene flow along 355 km of the Florida reef
   system and between Florida and Belize in three commensal invertebrates
   occupying the same host sponge (Callyspongia vaginalis) but displaying
   contrasting reproductive dispersal strategies: the broadcast-spawning
   brittle star Ophiothrix lineata and two brooding amphipods Leucothoe
   kensleyi and Leucothoe ashleyae. Multiple analytical approaches to
   sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI gene demonstrated a high
   degree of overall connectivity for all three species along the Florida
   reef system. Ophiothrix lineata showed significant genetic structuring
   between Florida and Belize, and a pattern of isolation by distance but
   no significant genetic structuring along the Florida coastline.
   Bayesian estimates of migration detected a strong southerly dispersal
   bias for O. lineata along the Florida reef system, contrary to the
   general assumption of northerly gene flow in this region based on the
   direction of the Florida Current. Both amphipods, despite direct
   development, also showed high gene flow along the Florida reef system.
   Multiple inferences of long-distance dispersal from a nested clade
   analysis support the hypothesis that amphipod transport, possibly in
   detached sponge fragments, could generate the high levels of overall
   gene flow observed. However, this transport mechanism appears much less
   effective across deep water as connectivity between Florida and Belize
   (1072 km) is highly restricted.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have shown that amphibian populations may
   exhibit high genetic subdivision in areas with recent fragmentation and
   urban development. Less is known about the potential for genetic
   differentiation in continuous habitats. We studied genetic
   differentiation of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) across a
   2-km transect through continuous forest in Virginia, USA.
   Mark-recapture studies suggest very little dispersal for this species,
   whereas homing experiments and post-Pleistocene range expansion both
   suggest greater dispersal abilities. We used six microsatellite loci to
   examine genetic population structure and differentiation between eight
   subpopulations of red-backed salamanders at distances from 200 m to 2
   km. We also used several methods to extrapolate dispersal frequencies
   and test for sex-biased dispersal. We found small, but detectable
   differentiation among populations, even at distances as small as 200 m.
   Differentiation was closely correlated with distance and both Mantel
   tests and assignment tests were consistent with an
   isolation-by-distance model for the population. Extrapolations of
   intergenerational variance in spatial position (sigma(2) < 15 m(2)) and
   pair-wise dispersal frequencies (4Nm < 25 for plots separated by 300 m)
   both suggest limited gene flow. Additionally, tests for sex-biased
   dispersal imply that dispersal frequency is similarly low for both
   sexes. We suggest that these low levels of gene flow and the infrequent
   dispersal observed in mark-recapture studies may be reconciled with
   homing ability and range expansion if dispersing animals rarely succeed
   in breeding in saturated habitats, if dispersal is flexible depending
   on the availability of habitat, or if dispersal frequency varies across
   the geographic range of red-backed salamanders.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Tripterygion (Risso 1826) is restricted to the eastern
   Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and comprises only three species. T.
   melanuros and T. tripteronotus are essentially endemic to the
   Mediterranean, while Tripterygion delaisi occurs in the Atlantic and in
   the Mediterranean. Two subspecies of T. delaisi have been described (T.
   d. xanthosoma in the Mediterranean and T. d. delaisi in the Atlantic).
   Several scenarios have been proposed for the evolution of T. delaisi
   subspecies, but so far its subspeciation process is not clear. In this
   study we present a population survey of T. delaisi including specimens
   from the two recognized subspecies. We combined a phylogeographic
   approach with estimates of the direction of migration (between the
   Atlantic and the Mediterranean) and of the coalescence time of the two
   subspecies, using polymorphic mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The
   results of this study clearly support the existence of two Tripterygion
   delaisi clades, one in the eastern Atlantic islands and another in the
   Atlantic coasts of Europe and in the Mediterranean. Historical
   migration between the islands and Western Europe plus Mediterranean was
   restricted, and showed a westbound trend, with a higher number of
   migrants going from the Western Europe plus Mediterranean into the
   islands. We estimated the time of coalescence of both groups of T.
   delaisi to be more recent than the onset of Pleistocene glaciations
   (1.7 Mya). Our results are consistent with previous hypothesis that
   consider successive dispersal events of a Tripterygion ancestor from
   the western African coast colonizing the Atlantic islands and the
   Mediterranean, promoting the evolutionary divergence between these

Abstract = {{Using the structured serial coalescent with Bayesian MCMC and serial

   estimated with the true model. However with an incorrect model,
   estimates were biased and can be positively misleading. We extend these
   results to the case where there are sequences from the ghost at the
   last time sample. This case can arise in HIV patients, when some tissue
   samples and viral sequences only become available after death. When
   some sequences from the ghost deme are available at the last sampling

   griseorufus of Beza Mahafaly}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The past decade has seen a remarkable increase in the
   number of recognized mouse lemur species ( genus Microcebus). As
   recently as 1994, only two species of mouse lemur were recognized
   according to the rules of zoological nomenclature. That number has now
   climbed to as many as fifteen proposed species. Indeed, increases in
   recognized species diversity have also characterized other nocturnal
   primates - galagos, sportive lemurs, and tarsiers. Presumably, the
   movement relates more to a previous lack of information than it does to
   any recent proclivity for taxonomic splitting. Due to their nocturnal
   habits, one can hypothesize that mouse lemurs will show only minimal
   variation in pelage coloration as such variation should be
   inconsequential for the purposes of mate and/ or species recognition.
   Even so, current species descriptions for nocturnal strepsirrhines
   place a good deal of emphasis on relatively fine distinctions in pelage
   coloration.
   Results: Here, we report results from a multi- year study of mouse
   lemur populations from Beza Mahafaly in southern Madagascar. On the
   basis of morphological and pelage variation, we initially hypothesized
   the presence of up to three species of mouse lemurs occurring
   sympatrically at this locality, one of which appeared to be
   undescribed. Genetic analysis reveals definitively, however, that all
   three color morphs belong to a single recognized species, Microcebus
   griseorufus. Indeed, in some cases, the three color morphs can be
   characterized by identical mitochondrial haplotypes.
   Conclusion: Given these results, we conclude that investigators should
   always proceed with caution when using a single data source to identify
   novel species. A synthetic approach that combines morphological,
   genetic, geographic, and ecological data is most likely to reveal the
   true nature of species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying ecological factors associated with population genetic
   differentiation is important for understanding microevolutionary
   processes and guiding the management of threatened populations. We
   identified ecological correlates of several population genetic
   parameters for three interacting species (two garter snakes and an
   anuran) that occupy a common landscape. Using multiple regression
   analysis, we found that species interactions were more important in
   explaining variation in population genetic parameters than habitat and
   nearest-neighbour characteristics. Effective population size was best
   explained by census size, while migration was associated with
   differences in species abundance. In contrast, genetic distance was
   poorly explained by the ecological correlates that we tested, but
   geographical distance was prominent in models for all species. We found
   substantially different population dynamics for the prey species
   relative to the two predators, characterized by larger effective sizes,
   lower gene flow and a state of migration-drift equilibrium. We also
   identified an escarpment formed by a series of block faults that serves
   as a barrier to dispersal for the predators. Our results suggest that
   successful landscape-level management should incorporate genetic and
   ecological data for all relevant species, because even closely
   associated species can exhibit very different population genetic
   dynamics on the same landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and
   plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for
   Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently,
   phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have
   been largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse
   lineages (including plants), it seems timely to assess the
   phylogeography across this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the
   patterns seen in plants and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of
   pseudocongruence; and (iii) discussing the potential applications of
   regional phylogeography to issues in ecology, such as response to
   climatic change. Unglaciated eastern North America is a large,
   geologically and topographically complex area with the species examined
   having diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns
   emerge: (i) maritime - Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River
   discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the
   Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River
   discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi River
   discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals, most of
   these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing support for
   phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may generally be
   attributable to isolation and differentiation during Pleistocene
   glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene). Molecular
   studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of glacial
   refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as the
   southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice
   Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique,
   rather than the shared, aspects of species' phylogeographical
   histories. Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can
   result from different underlying causal factors operating at different
   times (i.e. pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of
   pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to
   categorize patterns visually - similar patterns may, in fact, not fully
   coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual patterns and
   lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear
   spatial patterning and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical
   structure in diverse temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by
   just a few barriers.}},

Abstract = {{We used mitochondrial DNA control-region sequences to investigate the
   genetic structure of Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida)
   populations in the southwestern United States. This subspecies is
   federally listed as threatened, and its preferred habitat is naturally
   fragmented. We found that intrapopulation genetic diversity was high in
   all but the southeastern Arizona ``sky island{''} populations, where it
   was variable. Genetic variance partitioning indicated that similar to
   17\% of the variation was distributed among populations and 7.5\% was
   distributed among physiographic regions. Patterns of genetic
   correlation with geographic distance indicated that gene flow was
   substantial among populations within the relatively continuous habitat
   zone of the Mogollon Rim-Upper Gila Mountains in central Arizona and
   west-central New Mexico. However, there was significant
   isolation-by-distance elsewhere, and estimates of genetic divergence
   increased exponentially with geographic distance among fragmented
   populations on the scale of a few hundreds of kilometers; this implies
   that gene flow is restricted among those habitat fragments. Genetic
   heterogeneity among southeastern Arizona populations suggest that they
   have regularly received immigrants from the central Arizona
   populations. The Colorado population either was larger than thought or,
   more likely, has continuously received immigrants from elsewhere and is
   not a self-sustaining population.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and climate change are two major threats on
   biodiversity. Fragmentation limits the number of patches and their
   decreased connectivity cannot always maintain populations at dynamic
   equilibrium. The natural extreme fragmentation of marine cave habitats
   represents an opportunity to understand how these processes interact.
   The hypothesis of a low gene flow among populations due to a high level
   of fragmentation was tested by analysing sequence variation in a
   fragment of the mitochondrial gene of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I
   in 170 individuals (23 localities across the NW Mediterranean) of two
   marine cave-dwelling mysids of the genus Hemimysis. The species
   Hemimysis margalefi recently replaced its congener Hemimysis
   speluncola, a species shift that could be related to the warming of the
   Mediterranean Sea and to differences in their thermal tolerances. There
   were too few H. speluncola samples to further discuss their genetic
   structuring, but for H. margalefi, the present study revealed high
   levels of genetic diversity and genetic structuring, as shown by the
   eight genetically distinct groups identified. The Croatian group might
   constitute a sibling species due to a strong divergence (15\%).
   Nevertheless, these groups present reduced but orientated gene flow
   according to the general circulation in the Mediterranean, and fit a
   stepping-stone model. At local scale (Marseille area, France), gene
   flow among caves is dependent on unexpected local hydrodynamic
   barriers, that determine metapopulation sizes. Through the example of
   mysid species inhabiting marine caves, the present work confirms the
   strong influence of habitat disjunction (natural fragmentation) on
   population structure, and stresses the importance of coastal
   geomorphological features in inducing complex interactions between the
   circulation of water masses and the circulation of genes.}},

Abstract = {{Several processes have been described that could explain geographical
   variation and speciation within small islands, including fragmentation
   of populations through volcanic eruptions. Massive landslides, or
   debris avalanches, could cause similar effects. Here we analyse the
   potential impact of the 0.8 million-year-ago (Ma) Guimar valley debris
   avalanche on the phylogeography of the lizard Gallotia galloti on the
   Canary Island of Tenerife. Distributions of mitochondrial DNA lineages
   (based on cytochrome b sequences) were analysed on a 60-km southeastern
   coast transect centred on this area. Three main clades were detected,
   which can be divided into northern (one clade) and southern (two
   clades) groups that introgress across the valley. Maximum-likelihood
   estimates of migration rates (scaled for mutation rate) revealed highly
   asymmetric patterns, indicating that long-term gene flow into this
   region from both the northern and the southern populations greatly
   exceeded that in the opposite directions, consistent with
   recolonization of the area. The ancestral Tenerife node on the G.
   galloti tree is estimated at 0.80 Ma, matching closely with the
   geological estimate for the debris avalanche. Morphological variation
   (body dimensions and scalation) was also analysed and indicated a
   stepped cline in female scalation across the valley, although the
   patterns for male scalation and male and female body dimensions were
   not as clear. Together these findings provide support for the
   hypothesis that the debris avalanche has shaped the phylogeography of
   G. galloti and may even have been a primary cause of the within-island
   cladogenesis through population fragmentation and isolation. Current
   estimates of timing of island unification mean that the original
   hypothesis that within-island diversity is explained by the secondary
   contact of populations from the two ancient precursor islands of Teno
   and Anaga is less plausible for this and some other Tenerife species.
   Large-scale landslides have occurred on many volcanic islands, and so
   may have been instrumental in shaping within-island diversities.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have investigated the human population history of
   eastern North America by examining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation
   among Native Americans, but these studies could only reconstruct
   maternal population history. To evaluate similarities and differences
   in the maternal and paternal population histories of this region, we
   obtained DNA samples from 605 individuals, representing 16 indigenous
   populations. After amplifying the amelogenin locus to identify males,
   we genotyped 8 binary polymorphisms and 10 microsatellites in the
   male-specific region of the Y chromosome. This analysis identified 6
   haplogroups and 175 haplotypes. We found that sociocultural factors
   have played a more important role than language or geography in shaping
   the patterns of Y chromosome variation in eastern North America.
   Comparisons with previous mtDNA studies of the same samples demonstrate
   that male and female demographic histories differ substantially in this
   region. Postmarital residence patterns have strongly influenced genetic
   structure, with patrilocal and matrilocal populations showing different
   patterns of male and female gene flow. European contact also had a
   significant but sex-specific impact due to a high level of
   male-mediated European admixture. Finally, this study addresses
   long-standing questions about the history of Iroquoian populations by
   suggesting that the ancestral Iroquoian population lived in

   considerably across populations and the distribution of genetic

   populations at the microsatellite loci were also highly polymorphic at
   the MHC. We also observed high levels of differentiation among

Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on
   genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data on

   for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics
   to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the
   isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting
   equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model
   predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and
   the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise
   relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in
   electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the
   resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more
   robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based
   distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide
   range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of
   habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial
   datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR
   model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for
   habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve

Abstract = {{Small populations at the edge of a species' distribution can represent
   evolutionary relics left behind after range contractions due to climate
   change or human exploitation. The distinctiveness and genetic diversity
   of a small population of bottlenose whales in the Gully, a submarine
   canyon off Nova Scotia, was quantified by comparison to other North
   Atlantic populations using 10 microsatellites and mitrochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) control region sequences (434 bp). Both markers confirmed the
   distinctiveness of the Gully (n = 34) from the next nearest population,
   off Labrador (n = 127; microsatellites - F-ST = 0.0243, P < 0.0001;
   mtDNA - Phi(ST) = 0.0456, P < 0.05). Maximum likelihood microsatellite
   estimates suggest that less than two individuals per generation move
   between these areas, refuting the hypothesis of population links
   through seasonal migration. Both males and females appear to be
   philopatric, based on significant differentiation at both genomes and
   similar levels of structuring among the sexes for microsatellites.
   mtDNA diversity was very low in all populations (h = 0.51, pi =
   0.14\%), a pattern which may be due to selective sweeps associated with
   this species' extreme deep-diving ecology. Whaling had a substantial
   impact on bottlenose whale abundance, with over 65 000 animals killed
   before the hunt ceased in the early 1970s. Genetic diversity was
   similar among all populations, however, and no signal for bottlenecks
   was detected, suggesting that the Gully is not a relic of a
   historically wider distribution. Instead, this unique ecosystem appears
   to have long provided a stable year-round habitat for a distinct
   population of bottlenose whales.}},

Abstract = {{Microsatellites have gained wide application for elucidating population
   structure in nonmodel organisms. Since they are generally noncoding,
   neutrality is assumed but rarely tested. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua
   L.), microsatellite studies have revealed highly heterogeneous
   estimates of genetic differentiation among loci. In particular one
   locus, Gmo 132, has demonstrated elevated genetic differentiation. We
   investigated possible hitchhiking selection at this and other
   microsatellite loci in Atlantic cod. We employed 11 loci for analysing
   samples from the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Barents Sea and Newfoundland
   covering a large part of the species' distributional range. The
   `classical' Lewontin-Krakauer test for selection based on variance in
   estimates of F-ST and G'(ST) (standardized genetic differentiation)
   revealed only one significant pairwise test (North Sea-Barents Sea),
   and the source of the elevated variance could not be ascribed
   exclusively to Gmo 132. In contrast, different variants of the recently
   developed ln R theta. test for selective sweeps at microsatellite loci
   revealed a high number of significant outcomes of pair-wise tests for
   Gmo 132. Further, the presence of selection was indicated in at least
   one other locus. The results suggest that many previous estimates of
   genetic differentiation in cod based on microsatellites are inflated,
   and in some cases relationships among populations are obscured by one
   or more loci being the subject to hitch-hiking selection. Likewise,
   temporal estimates of effective population sizes in Atlantic cod may be
   flawed. We recommend, generally, to use a higher number of
   microsatellite loci to elucidate population structure in marine fishes
   and other nonmodel species to allow for identification of outlier loci

Abstract = {{The brittle-star Acrocnida brachiata (Montagu) lives in sandy-bottom
   habitat of both intertidal and subtidal zones along the coasts of the
   northwestern Europe. An allozyme frequency-based survey (five enzyme
   loci) was combined with a mitochondrial (mt) COI haplotype analysis
   (598-bp sequences) on 17 populations to trace back past colonization
   pathways from the actual population structure of the species. Both
   genetic markers display a sharp genetic break between intertidal (clade
   I) and subtidal populations (clade S). This break corresponds to an
   allele frequency inversion at three enzyme loci (Hk, Pgm and Pgi) and a
   deep divergence of about 20\% in mtCOI sequences between most of the
   intertidal populations and other samples. The geographic distribution
   of clade I seems to be more restricted than clade S as it is absent
   from the intertidal of the eastern English Channel and North Sea and
   may be replaced by clade S in south Brittany. Applying previously
   published rates of mutation, divergence between the two clades is
   estimated to pre-date 5 million years ago and may be due to allopatric
   speciation processes at the Mio-Pliocene transition. The occurrence of
   putative hybrids in a few localities, however, suggests incomplete
   cryptic speciation with secondary contact zones. The relative
   importance of colonization history vs. habitat specialization are
   discussed in the light of neutral evolution as tested from mtCOI gene
   sequences. While differential selection seems to have contributed
   little to the separation of the lineages, it may have played a role in
   the emergence of adaptive polymorphisms in the hybrid zone.
   Furthermore, congruent spatial patterns of differentiation were
   observed in both clades suggesting a recent increase in population
   size. These findings are in agreement with a recent expansion of the
   populations during or after the formation of the English Channel, from
   a southern refuge for the subtidal clade whereas the intertidal clade
   may have persisted further north. As previously suspected for a species
   with a very short pelagic larval phase, contemporary gene flow between
   distant or adjacent populations appears to be extremely reduced or even
   absent.}},

Abstract = {{The North American freshwater limpet genus Laevapex (Walker, 1903) is a
   ubiquitous inhabitant of lentic and slow-moving lotic habitats east of
   the Rocky Mountains, but uncertainty clouds its systematic affinities,
   the phylogenetic validity of its constituent nominal species, and its
   degree of genetic connectivity among drainages. We addressed these
   issues by sampling the genus throughout much of its collective range
   and constructing representative nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) gene
   trees, in addition to performing morphometric analyses of shell shape
   variation. Our results identify neotropical Gundlachia and South
   American Uncancylus as sister lineages for Laevapex and reveal a
   pronounced sub-familial dichotomy within the Ancylidae, separating
   these three New World genera from a Holarctic (Ferrissia (Ancylus,
   Rhodacmea)) sister clade. Five nominal taxa (L. fuscus, L. diaphanus,
   L. peninsulae, L. sp., and ``F{''} arkansasensis), indistinguishable in
   our morphometrie analyses, were polyphyletic in the mt gene trees,
   exhibited modest levels (< 3.9\%) of genetic divergence in the primary
   (103 of 109 individuals) mt clade and, with one minor exception, they
   appeared fixed for a single nuclear ITS-2 genotype. Although
   complicated by the presence of rare, highly divergent mt lineages (of
   either introgressive or persistent ancestral polymorphic origin) in
   some populations, the molecular data were consistent with a taxonomic
   conclusion that these five nominal taxa represent a single polymorphic
   lineage of the type species L. Juscus. AMOVA analyses indicated that
   56\% of the observed mt variation could be attributed to among
   population differences, only two of 36 haplotypes were detected in more
   than one sampling location, and estimates of among-population mt gene
   flow were generally low at both regional and continental scales.
   Unrooted network analyses revealed a number of mt tip clades, one
   restricted to the southwestern part of the range, the remainder having
   overlapping distributions in eastern North America. All of the eastern
   tip clades occurred in the Mid-Atlantic region, and these samples
   displayed by far the highest levels of collective mt diversity.
   However, directional gene flow estimates indicated that this region has
   been a recipient (especially from Alabama populations), rather than a
   source of haplotypic diversity, implying that it likely represents a
   center of overlap, not a primary ice age refugium, for this limpet
   species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   first use of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has
   been used for variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and
   informativeness of pedigrees. However, until now there has been no
   theory to predict expected values of this index under given genetic and
   demographic conditions. We present a new null theory for H-S at the

   independence of measures at each hierarchical level of organization;
   (ii) robust estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of
   conditions; (iii) ability to incorporate information on population

   Utilization of this index in conjunction with other existing indices

Abstract = {{The global migration patterns of the fungal wheat pathogen

   Analysis of 693 isolates from nine populations indicated that the
   population structure of P. nodorum is characterized by high levels of
   genetic diversity and a low degree of subdivision between continents.
   To determine whether genetic similarity of populations was a result of
   recent divergence or extensive gene flow, the microsatellite data were
   analysed using an isolation-with-migration model. We found that the
   continental P. nodorum populations diverged recently, but that enough
   migration occurred to reduce population differentiation. The migration
   patterns of the pathogen indicate that immigrants originated mainly
   from populations in Europe, China and North America.}},

Abstract = {{River systems are vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic habitat
   fragmentation and will often harbor populations deviating markedly from
   simplified theoretical models. We investigated fine-scale population
   structure in the sedentary river fish Cottus gobio using
   microsatellites and compared migration estimates from three F-ST
   estimators, a coalescent maximum-likelihood method and Bayesian recent
   migration analyses. Source-sink structure was evident via asymmetry in
   migration and genetic diversity with smaller upstream locations
   emigration biased and larger downstream subpopulations immigration
   biased. Patterns of isolation by distance suggested that the system was
   largely, but not entirely, in migration-drift equilibrium, with
   headwater populations harboring a signal of past colonizations and in
   some cases also recent population bottlenecks. Up- vs. downstream
   asymmetry in population structure was partly attributable to the
   effects of flow direction, but was enhanced by weirs prohibiting
   compensatory upstream migration. Estimators of migration showed strong
   correspondence, at least in relative terms, especially if pairwise F-ST
   was used as an indirect index of relative gene flow rather than being
   translated to Nm. Since true parameter values are unknown in natural
   systems, comparisons among estimators are important, both to determine
   confidence in estimates of migration and to validate the performance of
   different methods.}},

Abstract = {{The process of recolonization after disturbance is crucial for the

   developed a model to compare the spatial distribution and spatial
   genetic structure of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria within the
   perimeter of two reconstructed 19th century disturbances with a nearby
   reference area without stand-level disturbance. Population genetic data
   suggested that after stand-replacing disturbance, each plot was
   colonized by one or a few genotypes only, which subsequently spread
   clonally within a local neighborhood. The model (cellular automaton)
   aimed at testing the validity of this interpretation and at assessing
   the relative importance of local dispersal of clonal propagules vs.
   long-distance dispersal of clonal and/or sexual diaspores. A reasonable
   model fit was reached for the empirical data on host tree distribution,
   lichen distribution, and tree- and plot-level genotype diversity of the
   lichen in the reference area. Although model calibration suggested a
   predominance of local dispersal of clonal propagules, a substantial
   contribution of immigration of non-local genotypes by long-distance
   dispersal was needed to reach the observed levels of genotype
   diversity. The model could not fully explain the high degree of

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal landscape patterns have long been recognized to
   influence biological processes, but these processes often operate at
   scales that are difficult to study by conventional means. Inferences
   from genetic markers can overcome some of these limitations. We used a
   landscape genetics approach to test hypotheses concerning landscape
   processes influencing the demography of Lahontan cutthroat trout in a
   complex stream network in the Great Basin desert of the western US.
   Predictions were tested with population- and individual-based analyses
   of microsatellite DNA variation, reflecting patterns of dispersal,
   population stability, and local effective population sizes.
   Complementary genetic inferences suggested samples from migratory
   corridors housed a mixture of fish from tributaries, as predicted based
   on assumed migratory life histories in those habitats. Also as
   predicted, populations presumed to have greater proportions of
   migratory fish or from physically connected, large, or high quality
   habitats had higher genetic variability and reduced genetic
   differentiation from other populations. Populations thought to contain
   largely non-migratory individuals generally showed the opposite
   pattern, suggesting behavioral isolation. Estimated effective sizes
   were small, and we identified significant and severe genetic
   bottlenecks in several populations that were isolated, recently
   founded, or that inhabit streams that desiccate frequently. Overall,
   this work suggested that Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in stream
   networks are affected by a combination of landscape and metapopulation
   processes. Results also demonstrated that genetic patterns can reveal
   unexpected processes, even within a system that is well studied from a
   conventional ecological perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Several boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, were captured in
   pheromone traps in 2004 near Tlabualilo, Durango, Mexico, an area where
   none had been reported for approximate to 10 yr. It is possible that
   they were from an endemic population normally too low in numbers to be
   detected but that increased in response to more favorable rainfall
   conditions in 2004. Alternatively, they may represent an influx of
   migrants or the immediate descendents of migrants. To identify the most
   likely origin of the boll weevils captured in this area, we
   characterized microsatellite variation of the Tlahualilo weevils and
   compared it with the variation from three other populations in northern
   Mexico and from one in southern Texas. Measures of gene flow and
   individual assignment tests suggest that the boll weevils captured near
   Tlabualilo were primarily from an endemic low-level population, but
   that this area also is receiving immigrants from a cotton growing
   region approximate to 200 km to the north, near Rosales, Chihuahua,
   which is currently under a boll weevil eradication program. Similarly,
   Rosales is receiving immigrants from Tlahualilo. This study shows that
   microsatellite markers and population assignment techniques will be
   practical tools for determining the most likely origins of boll weevils
   reintroduced to eradication zones in the United States and Mexico.
   Population assignment strategies based on genetic markers hold promise
   for replacing conventional, but spatially constrained, mark-recapture
   studies of insect dispersal. This relatively new and powerful
   analytical approach is widely used in conservation genetics and
   fisheries studies, but has been underused by entomologists.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity is a key factor for the persistence of many
   specialist species in fragmented landscapes. However, connectivity
   estimates have rarely been validated by the observation of dispersal
   movements. In this study, we estimated functional connectivity of a
   real landscape by modelling dispersal for the endangered natterjack
   toad (Bufo calamita) using cost distance. Cost distance allows the
   evaluation of `effective distances', which are distances corrected for
   the costs involved in moving between habitat patches in spatially
   explicit landscapes. We parameterized cost-distance models using the
   results of our previous experimental investigation of natterjack's
   movement behaviour. These model predictions (connectivity estimates
   from the GIS study) were then confronted to genetic-based dispersal
   rates between natterjack populations in the same landscape using Mantel
   tests. Dispersal rates between the populations were inferred from
   variation at six microsatellite loci. Based on these results, we
   conclude that matrix structure has a strong effect on dispersal rates.
   Moreover, we found that cost distances generated by habitat preferences
   explained dispersal rates better than did the Euclidian distances, or
   the connectivity estimate based on patch-specific resistances (patch
   viscosity). This study is a clear example of how landscape genetics can
   validate operational functional connectivity estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have focused on the relationship between the marine
   fauna of the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, but within the
   Atlantic, little is known about genetic relationships between
   populations of the Macaronesian islands. In this study, we tested
   whether the paleo-climatology and paleo-oceanography of the region
   could predict the genetic relationships among three eastern Atlantic
   populations (Azores, Madeira, and Canaries) of a damselfish, Chromis
   limbata, and compared our results with its Mediterranean and adjacent
   Atlantic sister species, Chromis chromis. We combined phylogeographic
   and coalescent approaches using the fast evolving mitochondrial control
   region gene. No population structure was found for the three
   archipelagos. The coalescence time estimated for C. limbata (0.857-1.17
   Mya) was much greater than that estimated for C. chromis. We propose
   that this difference reflects differences in glaciating extents in the
   Northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Diversity indexes (Hd and
   genetic distances) together with historical demographic parameters of
   C. limbata (Theta and g) revealed a more stable population history when
   compared to C chromis. Our results suggest that the Macaronesian
   populations of C. limbata have probably been less affected by the last
   glaciation than the Mediterranean populations of C. chromis. Migration
   across the three archipelagos was estimated and a prevailing northwest
   trend was detected. This result supports the idea of a colonization of
   the Azores by warm water fish from Madeira or the westernmost Canary
   islands which acted as major glacial refugia for the tropical and
   subtropical marine fauna during the glaciations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Most animal species show detectable genetic differentiation between
   populations, but the extent and pattern of this differentiation varies
   considerably between species. Some show gradual differentiation due to
   isolation by distance, some show chaotic patchiness, and some show
   relative uniformity over large distances with striking discontinuities
   over short distances. These varying patterns reflect both the dispersal
   powers of the organism and its population history. The evolution of
   locally adapted genotypes is facilitated in populations with restricted
   gene flow, and such co-adapted genotypes may then vary from population
   to population depending on local selective forces. Restocking and stock
   enhancement programmes need to be aware of the stock structure of the
   target species, as the introduction of genotypes unrepresentative of
   the augmented population can have negative effects. Swamping the native
   population with large numbers of genotypes from a few matings, even if
   derived from the native population, can also be detrimental. It follows
   that, wherever possible, restocking and stock enhancement programmes
   should use broodstock taken directly from the population to be
   enhanced, and that large numbers of broodstock should be used. If
   broodstock cannot be taken from the population to be enhanced, they
   should be taken from the genetically most similar population available.
   Restocking and stock enhancement programmes should be genetically
   monitored to determine their impacts and outcomes. Crown Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Despite the considerable evidence showing that dispersal between

   assume symmetric dispersal. In this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo
   simulation model to quantify the effect of asymmetric dispersal on
   metapopulation persistence. Our results suggest that metapopulation
   extinctions are more likely when dispersal is asymmetric.
   Metapopulation viability in systems with symmetric dispersal mirrors
   results from a mean field approximation, where the system persists if
   the expected per patch colonization probability exceeds the expected
   per patch local extinction rate. For asymmetric cases, the mean field
   approximation underestimates the number of patches necessary for
   maintaining population persistence. If we use a model assuming
   symmetric dispersal when dispersal is actually asymmetric, the
   estimation of metapopulation persistence is wrong in more than 50\% of
   the cases. Metapopulation viability depends on patch connectivity in
   symmetric systems, whereas in the asymmetric case the number of patches
   is more important. These results have important implications for
   managing spatially structured populations, when asymmetric dispersal
   may occur. Future metapopulation models should account for asymmetric
   dispersal, while empirical work is needed to quantify the patterns and
   the consequences of asymmetric dispersal in natural metapopulations.}},

   the Lessepsian rabbitfish migrant Siganus luridus, that arrived in
   Linosa Island (Sicily Strait) in 2000, offered a unique opportunity to
   examine the genetic variability of the early phase of invasion and the
   starting point to test genetic variation within and between colonist
   and source populations.
   Demographics and dynamic aspects of S. luridus in the Mediterranean
   were evaluated by using phylogeographic and demographic (coalescent)
   methods based on DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region.
   Sequences from 95 S. luridus, 25 Siganus rivulatus, and one of Siganus
   (Lo) vulpinus and S. doliatus were used. Samples were collected in one
   locality in the Red Sea (Eilat) and three localities in the

   Within the Mediterranean populations, there was no pattern of regional
   separation and mitochondrial diversity appeared to be preserved during
   the Linosa colonization, with no traces of founder events. Such

   are still poorly understood. While tectonic uplifts and changes in sea
   level may have caused large-scale vicariance, warmer conditions during
   glacial maxima may have allowed pockets of diversity to persist to a
   much wider extent than in the Northwestern Atlantic. The large-scale
   geographic distribution of deeply divergent lineages of the coastal
   polychaete tubeworms Pectinaria koreni (two clades) and Owenia
   fusiformis (three clades) were compared using a fragment of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (mtCOI). All lineages were
   present along the biogeographic transition zone on the north coast of
   Brittany (France) and we found evidence pointing towards congruence in
   the timing of cladogenic events between Pectinaria sp. (P. auricoma/P.
   belgica and P. koreni) and Owenia sp., suggesting a shared history of
   vicariant events. More conserved 16SrRNA sequences obtained from four
   species of Pectinariidae together with mtCOI sequences of P. koreni
   seem consistent with an initial establishment of pectinariids in the
   north, and a southward colonization of the Northeast Atlantic.
   Phylogeographic patterns in O. fusiformis were also consistent with a
   north/south pattern of lineage splitting and congruent levels of
   divergence were detected between lineages of both species. We observed
   signatures of both persistence in small northern glacial refugia, and
   of northwards range expansion from regions situated closer to the
   Mediterranean. However, whether the recolonization of the Northeast
   Atlantic by both species actually reflects separate interglacial
   periods is unclear with regards to the lack of molecular clock
   calibration in coastal polychaete species.}},

Abstract = {{Locating birthplaces using genetic parentage determination can increase
   the precision and accuracy with which animal dispersal patterns are
   established. We re-analyse patterns of movement away from the
   birthplace as a function of time, sex and population density for a
   sample of 303 banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis. We
   located birth sites using a combination of likelihood-based parentage
   analysis with live-trapping of mothers during the breeding season. The
   results demonstrate that natal-breeding site distances are density
   dependent in this species; in particular, both sexes emigrate earlier
   in the year, and females disperse farther than males, at low population
   densities. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats were chosen as a study system
   because live-trapping easily detects maternal and offspring locations;
   nevertheless, parentage analysis reveals that some offspring evade
   early detection and move substantial distances before their first
   capture. In a few cases, the approach even detects dispersal out of the
   natal `deme' prior to first capture. Parentage analysis confirms the
   extreme philopatry of both sexes but indicates that prior estimates of
   median dispersal distance were too low. For D. spectabilis, more
   accurate location of individual birthplaces clarifies patterns of sex
   bias and density dependence in dispersal, and may resolve apparent
   discrepancies between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal
   distance. For species in which mothers can be more reliably trapped
   than juveniles, using offspring genotypes to locate parents is a novel
   way that genetic techniques can contribute to the analysis of animal
   dispersal.}},

   erythropterus in East Asia was examined with a 427-bp hypervariable
   portion of the mtDNA control region. A total of 262 samples were
   collected and 75 haplotypes were obtained. Neutrality tests (Tajima's

   haplotypes, a hierarchical examination of populations in 11 localities
   from four geographical regions using analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) indicated significant genetic differentiation among regions
   (Phi(CT) = 0.08564, p < 0.01). Limited gene flow between the eastern
   region (including a locality in the western Pacific Ocean and two

   China Sea largely contributed to the genetic subdivision. However,
   comparisons among three geographic regions of the South China Sea

   erythropterus in East Asia are inferred to be divided into two major

Abstract = {{The traditional view of the species as the fundamental unit of
   evolution has been challenged by observations that in heterogeneous
   environments, gene flow may be too restricted to overcome the effects
   of local selection. Whether a species evolves as a cohesive unit
   depends critically on the dynamic balance between homogenizing gene
   flow among populations and potentially disruptive local adaptation. To
   examine this evolutionary balance between ``global{''} gene flow and
   local selection, we studied northern Californian populations of
   Helianthus exilis, the serpentine sunflower, within a mosaic of
   contrasting serpentine and nonserpentine areas that differ considerably
   in soil chemistry and water availability. Local adaptation to riparian
   and serpentine habitats was studied in Helianthus exilis along with an
   analysis of gene flow patterns among populations within these habitats.
   Local adaptation was assessed in H. exilis during 2002 and 2003 using
   reciprocal transplant experiments at multiple locations within
   serpentine and riparian habitats. Effects of competition and
   germination date on the expression of local adaptation were also
   examined within the reciprocal transplant experiments. Local adaptation
   was detected in both years at the local site level and at the level of
   habitat. The analysis of the transplanted populations indicated that
   the patterns of selection differed considerably between riparian and
   serpentine sites. Differential survivorship occurred in serpentine
   habitats, whereas selection on reproductive output predominated in
   riparian habitats. Local adaptation was expressed only in the absence
   of competition. Local adaptation in terms of survivorship was most
   strongly expressed in treatments with delayed seed germination.
   Microsatellite markers were used to quantify population genetic
   parameters and examine the patterns of gene flow among sampled
   populations. Analysis of molecular markers revealed a system of
   population patches that freely exchange genes with each other. Strong
   selection seems to maintain ecotypic variation within this endemic
   sunflower species, while extensive gene flow among populations prevents
   local speciation between serpentine and riparian ecotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Bigeye (Thunnus obesus) is a large, pelagic, and migratory species of
   tuna that inhabits tropical and temperate marine waters worldwide.
   Previous studies based on mitochondrial RFLP data have shown that
   bigeye tunas from the Atlantic Ocean are the most interesting from a
   genetic point of view. Two highly divergent mitochondrial haplotype
   clades (I and II) coexist in the Atlantic Ocean. One is almost
   exclusive of the Atlantic Ocean whereas the other is also found in the
   Indo-Pacific Ocean. Bigeye tuna from the Atlantic Ocean is currently
   managed as a single stock, although this assumption remains untested at
   the genetic level. Therefore, genetic diversity was determined at the
   mitochondrial control region to test the null hypothesis of no
   population structure in bigeye tuna from the Atlantic Ocean. A total of
   331 specimens were sampled from four locations in the Atlantic Ocean
   (Canada, Azores, Canary Islands, and Gulf of Guinea), and one in the
   Indian and Pacific Oceans, respectively. The reconstructed
   neighbor-joining phylogeny confirmed the presence of Clades I and II
   throughout the Atlantic Ocean. No apparent latitudinal gradient of the
   proportions of both clades in the different collection sites was
   observed. Hierarchical AMOVA tests and pairwise phi(ST) comparisons
   involving Atlantic Ocean Clades I and II were consistent with a single
   stock of bigeye tuna in the Atlantic Ocean. Population genetic analyses
   considering phylogroups independently supported gene flow within Clade
   II throughout the Atlantic Ocean, and within Clade I between Atlantic
   and Indo-Pacific Oceans. The latter result suggests present
   uni-directional gene flow from the Indo-Pacific into the Atlantic
   Ocean. Moreover, mismatch analyses dated divergence of Clades I and II
   during the Pleistocene, as previously proposed. In addition, migration
   rates were estimated using coalescent methods, and showed a net
   migration from Atlantic Ocean feeding grounds towards the Gulf of
   Guinea, the best-known spawning ground of Atlantic bigeye tuna. (c)

   2003. DNA sequence analysis of 613 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene

   whereas overall nucleotide diversity (pi) was low (0.009 +/- 0.005). A
   total of 154 mtDNA haplotypes were identified; however, 114 were
   present in only one individual. Analysis of molecular variance revealed
   significant genetic structuring at Point Conception, CA, USA, that is
   likely due to the oceanographic circulation patterns, which result in
   asymmetrical migration of haplotypes. However, genetic variation among
   eastern Pacific populations was generally low, probably because of high
   contemporary gene flow and recent common ancestry of haplotypes.
   Mismatch analysis and nested clade analysis suggested that the
   population history of this region is characterized by two contiguous
   northwards range expansions, which are congruent with Late Pleistocene
   glacial cycles. Highly significant genetic differentiation was detected
   between eastern Pacific populations and Korea, indicating transpacific

Abstract = {{Divergent habitat preferences can contribute to speciation, as has been
   observed for host-plant preferences in phytophagous insects. Geographic
   variation in host preference can provide insight into the causes of
   preference evolution. For example, selection against maladaptive
   host-switching occurs only when multiple hosts are available in the
   local environment and can result in greater divergence in regions with
   multiple vs. a single host. Conversely, costs of finding a suitable
   host can select for preference even in populations using a single host.
   Some populations of Timema cristinae occur in regions with only one
   host-plant species present (in allopatry, surrounded by unsuitable
   hosts) whereas others occur in regions with two host-plant species
   adjacent to one another (in parapatry). Here, we use host choice and
   reciprocal-rearing experiments to document genetic divergence in host
   preference among 33 populations of T. cristinae. Populations feeding on
   Ceanothus exhibited a stronger preference for Ceanothus than did
   populations feeding on Adenostoma. Both allopatric and parapatric pairs
   of populations using the different hosts exhibited divergent host
   preferences, but the degree of divergence tended to be greater between
   allopatric pairs. Thus, gene flow between parapatric populations
   apparently constrains divergence. Host preferences led to levels of
   premating isolation between populations using alternate hosts that were
   comparable in magnitude to previously documented premating isolation
   caused by natural and sexual selection against migrants between hosts.
   Our findings demonstrate how gene flow and different forms of selection
   interact to determine the magnitude of reproductive isolation observed

Abstract = {{We review commonly used population definitions under both the
   ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the
   evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find
   that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative
   criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are
   different enough to be considered `populations'. Units for these
   criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and
   migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These
   criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated
   genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter
   set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and
   samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power
   to detect departures from panmixia was very high (similar to 100\%; P <
   0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the
   number of correct population assignments with the random expectation,
   performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further
   consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced
   power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set,
   power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H-0: Nm <
   X) can also be high, provided that true Nm <= 0.5X. Developing the
   appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several
   key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural
   populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori
   sampling information detected the true number of populations only under
   conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm <= 5), and power dropped
   sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple
   algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies
   in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of
   populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical
   evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations
   using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic
   dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where
   genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical
   developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope
   that this situation may change in the future.}},

Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Molecular genetic approaches have much to offer population
   biology. Despite recent advances, convenient techniques to develop and
   screen highly-resolving markers can be limiting for some applications
   and taxa. We describe an improved PCR-based, cloning-free, nuclear
   marker development procedure, in which single-stranded conformation
   polymorphism ( SSCP) plays a central role. Sequence-variable alleles at
   putative nuclear loci are simultaneously identified and isolated from
   diploid tissues. Based on a multiple allele alignment, locus-specific
   primers are designed in conserved regions, minimizing `null' alleles.
   Using two undescribed endemic Australian Collembola as exemplars, we
   outline a comprehensive approach to generating and validating suites of
   codominant, sequence-yielding nuclear loci for previously unstudied
   invertebrates.
   Results: Six markers per species were developed without any baseline
   genetic information. After evaluating the characteristics of each new
   locus via SSCP pre-screening, population samples were genotyped on the
   basis of either DNA sequence, restriction site, or insertion/deletion
   variation, depending on which assay was deemed most appropriate.
   Polymorphism was generally high ( mean of nine alleles per locus), and
   the markers were capable of resolving population structuring over very
   fine spatial scales (< 100 km). SSCP coupled with targeted DNA
   sequencing was used to obtain genotypic, genic and genealogical
   information from six loci ( three per species). Phylogeographic
   analysis identified introns as being most informative.
   Conclusion: The comprehensive approach presented here feasibly
   overcomes technical hurdles of ( i) developing suitably polymorphic
   nuclear loci for non-model organisms, ( ii) physically isolating
   nuclear allele haplotypes from diploid tissues without cloning, and (
   iii) genotyping population samples on the basis of nuclear DNA sequence
   variation.}},

   genotype data. Although a substantial number of such methods have been
   developed, they have focused principally on inference from unrelated
   individuals, and comparisons between methods have been rather limited.
   Here, we describe the extension of five leading algorithms for phase
   inference for handling father-mother-child trios. We performed a
   comprehensive assessment of the methods applied to both trios and to
   unrelated individuals, with a focus on genomic-scale problems, using
   both simulated data and data from the HapMap project. The most accurate
   algorithm was PHASE (v2.1). For this method, the percentages of
   genotypes whose phase was incorrectly inferred were 0.12\%, 0.05\%, and
   0.16\% for trios from simulated data, HapMap Centre d'Etude du
   Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) trios, and HapMap Yoruban trios,
   respectively, and 5.2\% and 5.9\% for unrelated individuals in
   simulated data and the HapMap CEPH data, respectively. The other
   methods considered in this work had comparable but slightly worse error
   rates. The error rates for trios are similar to the levels of
   genotyping error and missing data expected. We thus conclude that all
   the methods considered will provide highly accurate estimates of
   haplotypes when applied to trio data sets. Running times differ
   substantially between methods. Although it is one of the slowest
   methods, PHASE (v2.1) was used to infer haplotypes for the 1
   million-SNP HapMap data set. Finally, we evaluated methods of
   estimating the value of r(2) between a pair of SNPs and concluded that
   all methods estimated r(2) well when the estimated value was similar to
   0.8.}},

Abstract = {{Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are a powerful
   evolutionary model system due to the rapid and repeated phenotypic
   divergence of freshwater forms from a marine ancestor throughout the
   Northern Hemisphere. Many of these recently derived populations are
   found in overlapping habitats, yet are reproductively isolated from
   each other. This scenario provides excellent opportunities to
   investigate the mechanisms driving speciation in natural populations.
   Genetically distinguishing between such recently derived species,
   however, can create difficulties in exploring the ecological and
   genetic factors defining species boundaries, an essential component to
   our understanding of speciation. We overcame these limitations and
   increased the power of analyses by selecting highly discriminatory
   markers from the battery of genetic markers now available. Using
   species diagnostic molecular profiles, we quantified levels of
   hybridization and introgression within three sympatric species pairs of
   three-spined stickleback. Sticklebacks within Priest and Paxton lakes
   exhibit a low level of natural hybridization and provide support for
   the role of reinforcement in maintaining distinct species in sympatry.
   In contrast, our study provides further evidence for a continued
   breakdown of the Enos Lake species pair into a hybrid swarm, with
   biased introgression of the `limnetic' species into that of the
   `benthic'; a situation that highlights the delicate balance between
   persistence and breakdown of reproductive barriers between young
   species. A similar strategy utilizing the stickleback microsatellite
   resource can also be applied to answer an array of biological questions
   in other species' pair systems in this geographically widespread and
   phenotypically diverse model organism.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the genetic covariance between habitat preference and

   genetic covariance within populations between host plant preference and
   a trait affecting performance on different hosts ( cryptic color
   pattern) varies in magnitude predictably among populations according to
   migration regimes. Specifically, genetic covariance within populations
   is high in heterogeneous habitats where migration between populations
   locally adapted to different host plants generates nonrandom
   associations ( i. e., linkage disequilibrium) between alleles at color
   pattern and host preference loci. Conversely, genetic covariance is low
   in homogeneous habitats where a single host exists and migration
   between hosts does not occur. Our results show that habitat structure

Abstract = {{A computer simulation study has been made of the accuracy of estimates

   are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as the reciprocal of
   the squared coefficient of variation. This should be proportional to
   sample size when the entities sampled provide independent information.
   Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling strategy for estimation
   of Theta can be investigated. Two models for cost have been used, a
   cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read model. The former would lead us
   to prefer to have a very large number of loci, each one base long. The
   latter, which is more realistic, causes us to prefer to have one read
   per locus and an optimum sample size which declines as costs of
   sampling organisms increase. For realistic values, the optimum sample
   size is 8 or fewer individuals. This is quite close to the results
   obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly for a cost-per-base model,
   evaluating other estimators of Theta It can be understood by
   considering that the resources spent collecting larger samples prevent
   us from considering more loci. An examination of the efficiency of
   Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made, and it was found to be
   reasonably efficient when the number of mutants per generation in the

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A central prediction of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is
   that coevolving interspecific interactions will show varying degrees of
   local maladaptation. According to the theory, much of this local
   maladaptation is driven by selection mosaics and spatially intermingled
   coevolutionary hot and cold spots, rather than a simple balance between
   gene flow and selection. Here I develop a genetic model of
   host-parasite coevolution that is sufficiently general to incorporate
   selection mosaics, coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and a diverse
   array of genetic systems of infection/resistance. Results from this
   model show that the selection mosaics experienced by the interacting
   species are an important determinant of the sign and magnitude of local
   maladaptation. In some cases, this effect may be stronger than a
   previously described effect of relative rates of parasite and host gene
   flow. These results provide the first theoretical evidence that
   selection mosaics and coevolutionary hot and cold spots per se
   determine the magnitude and sign of local maladaptation. At the same
   time, however, these results demonstrate that coevolution in a
   geographic mosaic can lead to virtually any pattern of local adaptation
   or local maladaptation. Consequently, empirical studies that describe
   only patterns of local adaptation or maladaptation do not provide
   evidence either for or against the theory.}},

Abstract = {{Comparison of the performance and accuracy of different inference

   coalescence theory. Both inference methods use the same Markov chain

   better than the ML approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some

   Motivation: The Markov chain Monte Carlo-based ML framework can fail on
   sparse data and can deliver non-conservative support intervals. A
   Bayesian framework with appropriate prior distribution is able to
   remedy some of these problems.
   Results: The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-)

Abstract = {{The extent of gene dispersal is a fundamental factor of the population
   and evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree species, but directly
   monitoring seed and pollen movement is a difficult task. However,
   indirect estimates of historical gene dispersal can be obtained from
   the fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations at
   drift-dispersal equilibrium. Using an approach that is based on the
   slope of the regression of pairwise kinship coefficients on spatial
   distance and estimates of the effective population density, we compare
   indirect gene dispersal estimates of sympatric populations of 10
   tropical tree species. We re-analysed 26 data sets consisting of mapped
   allozyme, SSR (simple sequence repeat), RAPD (random amplified
   polymorphic DNA) or AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism)
   genotypes from two rainforest sites in French Guiana. Gene dispersal
   estimates were obtained for at least one marker in each species,
   although the estimation procedure failed under insufficient marker
   polymorphism, limited sample size, or inappropriate sampling area.
   Estimates generally suffered low precision and were affected by
   assumptions regarding the effective population density. Averaging
   estimates over data sets, the extent of gene dispersal ranged from 150
   m to 1200 m according to species. Smaller gene dispersal estimates were
   obtained in species with heavy diaspores, which are presumably not well
   dispersed, and in populations with high local adult density. We suggest
   that limited seed dispersal could indirectly limit effective pollen
   dispersal by creating higher local tree densities, thereby increasing
   the positive correlation between pollen and seed dispersal distances.
   We discuss the potential and limitations of our indirect estimation
   procedure and suggest guidelines for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons across multiple taxa can often clarify the histories of
   biogeographic regions. In particular, historic barriers to movement
   should have affected multiple species and, thus, result in a pattern of
   concordant intraspecific genetic divisions among species. A striking
   example of such comparative phylogeography is the recent observation
   that populations of many small mammals and reptiles living on the Baja
   California peninsula have a large genetic break between northern and
   southern peninsular populations. In the present study, I demonstrate
   that five species of near-shore fishes living on the Baja coastline of
   the Gulf of California share this genetic pattern. The simplest
   explanation for this concordant genetic division within both
   terrestrial and marine vertebrates is that the Baja Peninsula was
   fragmented by a Plio-Pleistocene marine seaway and that this seaway
   posed a substantial barrier to movement for near-shore fishes. For some
   fish species, the signal of this vicariance in mtDNA has been eroded by
   gene flow and is not evident with classic, equilibrium measures of
   population structure. Yet, significant divisions are apparent in
   coalescent analyses that jointly estimate divergence with gene flow.
   The genetic divisions within Gulf of California fishes also coincide
   with recognized biogeographic regions based on fish community
   composition and several environmental factors. It is likely that
   adaptation to regional environments and present-day oceanographic
   circulation limit gene exchange between biogeographic regions and help

Abstract = {{Although many studies have documented the effect of glaciation on the
   evolutionary history of Northern Hemisphere flora and fauna, this study
   is the first to investigate how the indirect aridification of Africa
   caused by global cooling in response to glacial cycles at higher
   latitudes has influenced the evolutionary history of an African montane
   bird. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from the NADH 3 gene were collected
   from 283 individual Starred Robins (Pogonocichla stellata,
   Muscicapoidea). At least two major vicariant events, one that separated
   the Albertine Rift from all but the Kenyan Highlands around 1.3-1.2
   Myrs BP, and another that separated the Kenyan Highlands from the
   northern Eastern Arc, and the northern Eastern Are from the
   south-central Eastern Arc between 0.9 and 0.8 Myrs BP appear to
   underlie much of the observed genetic diversity and structure within
   Starred Robin populations. These dates of divergence suggest a lack of
   recurrent gene flow; although the Albertine Rift and south-central
   Eastern Arc share haplotypes, based on coalescent analyses this can
   confidently be accounted for by ancestral polymorphism as opposed to
   recurrent gene flow. Taken collectively, strong evidence exists for
   recognition of four major ancestral populations: (1) Kenyan Highlands
   (subspecies keniensis), (2) Albertine Rift (ruwenzori), (3) northern
   Eastern Are (helleri), and (4) south-central Eastern Arc, Ufipa and the
   Malawi Rift (orientalis). The estimated divergence times cluster
   remarkably around one of the three estimated peaks of aridification in
   Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene centred on I Myrs BP. Further, time
   to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates (1.7-1.6 Myrs BP) of
   gene divergence between the Albertine Rift and the other montane
   highlands corresponds closely with a second estimated peak of
   aridification at about 1.7 Myrs BP. Collectively, these results suggest
   that aridification of Africa in response to glaciation at higher
   latitudes during the Pleistocene has had a profound influence on
   montane speciation in east and central Africa. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{There is a need for biological information to support current stock
   designations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of
   Mexico. The existence of many inshore, resident ``communities{''}
   raises questions as to the relationship these dolphins may hold with
   dolphins inhabiting neighboring inshore and coastal areas. In this
   study, population subdivision was examined among four resident, inshore
   bottlenose dolphin stocks (Sarasota Bay, FL, Tampa Bay, FL, Charlotte
   Harbor, FL and Matagorda Bay, TX) and one coastal stock (1-12 km
   offshore) in the Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of significant population
   structure among all areas was found on the basis of both mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data and nine nuclear
   microsatellite loci. Estimates of relatedness showed no population
   contained a significantly high number of related individuals, while
   separate AMOVAs for males and females indicated that both sexes exhibit
   a significant level of site philopatry. Results presented here provide
   the first genetic evidence of population subdivision between the
   coastal Gulf of Mexico and adjacent inshore areas along the central
   west coast of Florida. Such strong genetic subdivision is surprising
   given the short geographical distance between many of these areas and
   the lack of obvious geographic barriers to prevent gene flow. These
   findings support the current, separate identification of stocks for
   bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the eastern coastal and inshore areas of
   the Gulf of Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{The yellow lampmussel (Lampsilis cariosa) is a rare unionid species in
   need of conservation, as it is declining throughout most of its
   Atlantic slope range in North America. Because freshwater mussels rely
   on a fish host for dispersal of their larvae, barriers to the movement
   of hosts, such as habitat fragmentation by dams, may indirectly affect
   population genetic structure. We used microsatellite loci to assess
   genetic variation for L. cariosa within and among three river drainages
   in the northern part of its range, which emerged from glaciation only
   similar to 8-10 kya. Despite this relatively recent emergence,
   significant differences were observed among populations both within and
   among drainages, possibly because low effective population sizes meant
   that populations of these mussels achieved drift-migration equilibrium
   rapidly following glaciation. L. cariosa individuals could be assigned
   to their own drainages with 89.3\% accuracy. Among-population
   differences were modest, however, in comparison to differences observed
   in another study of rare mussels south of the recently glaciated
   region. L. cariosa populations exhibited significant isolation by
   distance, but there was no additional variation explained by the
   number, size, or age of intervening dams. An understanding of mussel
   population genetic structure provides information, useful for
   conservation planning, on patterns of isolation and connectivity among

Abstract = {{Two general processes may influence gene flow among populations. One
   involves divergent selection, wherein the maladaptation of immigrants

   processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia
   reticulata). If selection is important, gene flow should be reduced
   between different selective environments. If geography is important,
   gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical
   barriers. We examined how genetic divergence, long-term gene flow, and
   contemporary dispersal within a watershed were influenced by
   waterfalls, geographic distance, predation, and habitat features. We
   found that waterfalls and geographic distance increased genetic
   divergence and reduced dispersal and long-term gene flow. Differences
   in predation or habitat features did not influence genetic divergence

Abstract = {{Testing for simultaneous vicariance across comparative phylogeographic
   data sets is a notoriously difficult problem hindered by mutational
   variance, the coalescent variance, and variability across pairs of
   sister taxa in parameters that affect genetic divergence. We simulate
   vicariance to characterize the behaviour of several commonly used
   summary statistics across a range of divergence times, and to
   characterize this behaviour in comparative phylogeographic datasets
   having multiple taxon-pairs. We found Tajima's D to be relatively
   uncorrelated with other summary statistics across divergence times, and
   using simple hypothesis testing of simultaneous vicariance given
   variable population sizes, we counter-intuitively found that the
   variance across taxon pairs in Nei and Li's net nucleotide divergence
   (pi(net)), a common measure of population divergence, is often inferior
   to using the variance in Tajima's D across taxon pairs as a test
   statistic to distinguish ancient simultaneous vicariance from variable
   vicariance histories. The opposite and more intuitive pattern is found
   for testing more recent simultaneous vicariance, and overall we found
   that depending on the timing of vicariance, one of these two test
   statistics can achieve high statistical power for rejecting
   simultaneous vicariance, given a reasonable number of intron loci (> 5

   regions in Alaska, and generated DNA sequence data from the
   protein-coding beta-tubulin gene and the internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) regions of the ribosomal DNA repeat.
   Homologous sequences from additional A. muscaria isolates were
   downloaded from GenBank. We conducted phylogenetic and nested clade
   analyses (NCA) to reveal the phylogeographic history of the species

   three above-mentioned clades, representatives of all three groups were

   cryptic phylogenetic species with partially overlapping geographic

   phylogenetic species share at least two morphological varieties with
   other species, suggesting ancestral polymorphism in pileus and wart
   colour pre-dating their speciations. The ancestral population of A.
   muscaria likely evolved in the Siberian-Beringian region and underwent
   fragmentation as inferred from NCA and the coalescent analyses. The
   data suggest that these populations later evolved into species,

   the pattern of nucleotide variation at DPS2002, a noncoding region
   tightly linked to a paracentric inversion that strongly contributes to

   Analysis of a subset of the data, for which recursive computation of

Abstract = {{Information on population connectivity throughout the annual cycle has
   become more crucial, because populations of many migratory birds are in
   decline. One such species is the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor),
   which inhabits early-successional forests in eastern North America.
   Although band recoveries have proved useful for dividing populations of
   this game bird species into an Eastern Region and Central Region for
   management purposes, these data do not provide enough detail to
   determine the breeding population of origin of birds recovered on
   stopover and wintering areas. To obtain more fine-scale data, we
   undertook a phylogeographic study of American Woodcock populations
   throughout their primary breeding range in the eastern United States
   and Canada using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from the
   hypervariable control region I (CRI) and ND6 gene. Despite high
   haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity was low and there was no
   phylogeographic structure among American Woodcock populations across
   the species range, with birds from many states and provinces in both
   management regions sharing identical haplotypes. Results suggest recent
   or ongoing gene flow among populations, with asymmetric movement of
   birds between migration flyways. As has been demonstrated for several
   other avian species in North America, American Woodcock appear to have
   undergone a rapid population expansion following the late Pleistocene
   glacial retreat. Thus, a combination of historical demographic factors
   and recent or ongoing gene flow mask any population structure based on
   mtDNA that might accrue from philopatry to breeding areas observed in

Abstract = {{The desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea during the Messinian Salinity
   Crisis 6.0-5.3 million years ago (Ma), caused a major extinction of the
   marine ichthyofauna of the Mediterranean. This was followed by an
   abrupt replenishment of the Mediterranean from the Atlantic after the
   opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. In this study, we combined
   demographic and phylogeographic approaches using mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA markers to test the alternative hypotheses of where
   (Atlantic or Mediterranean) and when ( before or after the Messinian
   Salinity Crisis) speciation occurred in the Mediterranean damselfish,
   Chromis chromis. The closely related geminate transisthmian pair
   Chromis multilineata and Chromis atrilobata was used as a way of
   obtaining an internally calibrated molecular clock. We estimated C.
   chromis speciation timing both by determining the time of divergence
   between C. chromis and its Atlantic sister species Chromis limbata
   (0.93-3.26 Ma depending on the molecular marker used, e. g. 1.23-1.39
   Ma for the control region), and by determining the time of coalescence
   for C. chromis based on mitochondrial control region sequences
   (0.14-0.21 Ma). The time of speciation of C. chromis was always
   posterior to the replenishment of the Mediterranean basin, after the
   Messinian Salinity Crisis. Within the Mediterranean, C. chromis
   population structure and demographic characteristics revealed a genetic
   break at the Peloponnese, Greece, with directional and eastbound gene
   flow between western and eastern groups. The eastern group was found to
   be more recent and with a faster growing population ( coalescent time =
   0.09-0.13 Ma, growth = 485.3) than the western group ( coalescent time
   = 0.13-0.20 Ma, growth = 325.6). Our data thus suggested a western
   origin of C. chromis, most likely within the Mediterranean. Low sea
   water levels during the glacial periods, the hydrographic regime of the
   Mediterranean and dispersal restriction during the short pelagic larval
   phase of C. chromis (18-19 days) have probably played an important role

Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in the extent to which marine

   have impeded our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine
   species as well as our attempts to effectively manage marine
   populations. Because direct measurements of larval movements are
   difficult, genetic markers have often been used for indirect
   measurements of gene flow among marine populations. Here we examine
   data from allozymes, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and microsatellite
   length polymorphisms to assess the extent of gene flow among
   populations of the burrowing crustacean Callichirus islagrande. All
   three types of markers revealed a genetic break between populations
   separated by the Louisiana Chenier Plain. The extent of mitochondrial
   sequence divergence across this break indicates that the nominal
   species, C. islagrande, consists of at least two lineages that have
   been reproductively isolated for about a million years. Within the
   eastern lineage microsatellite allele frequencies were significantly
   heterogeneous among populations as little as 10 km apart. Maximum
   likelihood estimates of gene flow and effective population size based
   on a coalescent model for the microsatellite data indicated that local
   populations are nearly closed. A model-based clustering method
   identified four or five groups from the microsatellite data, although
   individuals sampled from each location generally consisted of mixtures
   of these groups. This suggests a mechanism that would lead to genetic
   differentiation of open populations: gene flow from different source

   one of multiple latent regional genetic disjunctions, involving five
   cryptic Caribbean species, that appear to be the product of a long
   history of regional cladogenesis. Disjunctions involving three stem
   lineages clearly predate formation of the Isthmus of Panama and of the
   Caribbean Sea, although four of the five cryptic species have
   within-basin sister relationships. Surprisingly, the Atlantic clade was
   also found to be widespread in the southern Caribbean, and ancestral
   demography calculations through time for Atlantic coast-specific
   genotypes are consistent with a northward range extension after the
   last glacial maximum. Our new data seriously undermine the hypothesis
   of a Floridian vicariant genesis and imply that the scorched mussel
   Gulf/Atlantic disjunction represents a case of geographic and temporal
   pseudocongruence. All five Caribbean Basin cryptic species exhibited an
   intriguing pattern of predominantly allopatric distribution
   characterized by distinct geographic areas of ecological dominance,
   often adjoining those of sister taxa. This pattern of distribution is
   consistent with allopatric speciation origins, coupled with restricted
   postspeciation range extensions. Several lines of indirect evidence
   favor the hypothesis that the predominantly allopatric distributions
   are maintained over evolutionary time scales, primarily by
   postrecruitment ecological filters rather than by oceanographic
   barriers to larval-mediated gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The present study reports the first population genetic analysis of
   Arapaima gigas, an important but critically over-exploited fish species
   of the Amazon basin. We sequenced two discontinuous mitochondrial DNA
   regions of 1204 base-pairs (bp) (NADH1 segment) and 1143 bp (ATPase
   segment) from 139 individuals of A. gigas representing eight localities
   spanning the Amazon basin from Iquitos, Peru to Macap, Brazil. We
   discovered 34 haplotypes separated by 44 segregating sites. The two
   most common haplotypes are shared among all populations and
   isolation-by-distance appears to be the most important population
   dynamic, although there is no significant association between
   geographical distance and genetic differentiation. Observed patterns of
   differentiation appear to be attributable largely to anthropogenic
   factors associated with over-exploitation. Greatest haplotypic
   diversity exists upstream of Manaus and in areas away from large
   centres of population. The female variance and inbreeding effective
   population sizes are approximately 150000 individuals and localities in
   the Amazon basin are connected by gene flow. Naturally low levels of
   population differentiation and relatively high between-population
   connectivity is encouraging for the conservation and management of A.
   gigas. If strategically placed biological reserves were created
   throughout the Amazon basin to act as sources of emigrants within a
   source-sink metapopulation model, we believe locally depleted
   populations can be re-populated and maintained by individuals
   immigrating from these reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Invasions by exotic organisms have had devastating affects on aquatic
   ecosystems, both ecologically and economically. One striking example of
   a successful invader that has dramatically affected fish community
   structure in freshwater lakes of North America is the sea lamprey
   (Petromyzon marinus). We used eight microsatellite loci and multiple
   analytical techniques to examine competing hypotheses concerning the
   origins and colonization history of sea lamprey (n = 741). Analyses
   were based on replicated invasive populations from Lakes Erie, Huron,
   Michigan, and Superior, populations of unknown origins from Lakes
   Ontario, Champlain, and Cayuga, and populations of anadromous putative
   progenitor populations in North America and Europe. Populations in
   recently colonized lakes were each established by few colonists through
   a series of genetic bottlenecks which resulted in lower allelic
   diversity in more recently established populations. The spatial genetic
   structure of invasive populations differed from that of native
   populations on the Atlantic coast, reflecting founder events and
   connectivity of invaded habitats. Anadromous populations were found to
   be panmictic (theta(rho) = 0.002; 95\% CI = -0.003 - 0.006; P > 0.05).
   In contrast, there was significant genetic differentiation between
   populations in the lower and upper Great Lakes (theta(rho) = 0.007; P <
   0.05; 95\% CI = 0.003 - 0.009). Populations in Lakes Ontario,
   Champlain, and Cayuga are native. Alternative models that describe
   different routes and timing of colonization of freshwater habitats were
   examined using coalescent-based analyses, and demonstrated that
   populations likely originated from natural migrations via the St

Abstract = {{Although most genetic estimates of contemporary effective population
   size (N-e) are based on models that assume N-e is constant, in real
   populations N-e changes (often dramatically) over time, and estimates
   (N-e) will be influenced by N-e in specific generations. In such cases,
   it is important to properly match N-e to the appropriate time periods
   (for example, in computing N-e/N ratios). Here I consider this problem
   for semelparous species with two life histories (discrete generations
   and variable age at maturity - the `salmon' model), for two different
   sampling plans, and for estimators based on single samples (linkage
   disequilibrium, heterozygote excess) and two samples (temporal method).
   Results include the following. Discrete generations: (i) Temporal
   samples from generations 0 and t estimate the harmonic mean N-e in
   generations 0 through t - 1 but do not provide information about N-e in
   generation t; (ii) Single samples provide an estimate of N-e in the
   parental generation, not the generation sampled; (iii) single-sample
   and temporal estimates never provide information about N-e in exactly
   the same generations; (iv) Recent bottlenecks can downwardly bias
   estimates based on linkage disequilibrium for several generations.
   Salmon model: (i) A pair of single-cohort (typically juvenile) samples
   from years 0 and t provide a temporal estimate of the harmonic mean of
   the effective numbers of breeders in the two parental years (N-b(0) and
   N-b(t)), but adult samples are more difficult to interpret because they
   are influenced by N-b in a number of previous years; (ii) For
   single-cohort samples, both one-sample and temporal methods provide
   estimates of N-b in the same years (contrast with results for discrete
   generation model); (iii) Residual linkage disequilibrium associated
   with past population size will not affect single-sample estimates of
   N-b as much as in the discrete generation model because the
   disequilibrium diffuses among different years of breeders. These
   results lead to some general conclusions about genetic estimates of N-e
   in iteroparous species with overlapping generations and identify areas
   in need of further research.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first description of phylogeographic structure among
   Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) worldwide using
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences obtained from
   strandings (n = 70), incidental fisheries takes (n = 11), biopsy (n =
   1), and whale-meat markets (n = 5). Over a 290-base pair fragment, 23
   variable sites defined 33 unique haplotypes among the total of 87
   samples. Nucleotide diversity at the control region was relatively low
   (pi = 1.27\% +/- 0.723\%) compared to wide-ranging baleen whales, but
   higher than strongly matrifocal sperm, pilot and killer whales.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood revealed four
   distinct haplotype groups, each of which displayed strong frequency
   differences among ocean basins, but no reciprocal monophyly or fixed
   character differences. Consistent with this phylogeographic pattern, an
   analysis of molecular variance showed high levels of differentiation
   among ocean basins (F-ST = 0.14, Phi(ST) = 0.42; P < 0.001). Estimated
   rates of female migration among ocean basins were low (generally <= 2
   individuals per generation). Regional sample sizes were too small to
   detect subdivisions within oceans except in the North Atlantic, where
   the Mediterranean Sea (n = 12) was highly differentiated due to the
   presence of two private haplotypes. One market product purchased in
   South Korea grouped with other haplotypes found only in the North
   Atlantic, suggesting a violation of current agreements banning
   international trade in cetacean species. Together, these results
   demonstrate a high degree of isolation and low maternal gene flow among
   oceanic, and in some cases, regional populations of Cuvier's beaked
   whales. This has important implications for understanding the threats
   of human impact, including fisheries by-catch, direct hunting, and

Abstract = {{The effective population size (N-e) is an important parameter in
   ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation biology. It is, however,
   notoriously difficult to estimate, mainly because of the highly
   stochastic nature of the processes of inbreeding and genetic drift for
   which N-e is usually defined and measured, and because of the many
   factors (such as time and spatial scales, systematic forces)
   confounding such processes. Many methods have been developed in the
   past three decades to estimate the current, past and ancient effective
   population sizes using different information extracted from some
   genetic markers in a sample of individuals. This paper reviews the
   methodologies proposed for estimating N-e from genetic data using
   information on heterozygosity excess, linkage disequilibrium, temporal
   changes in allele frequency, and pattern and amount of genetic
   variation within and between populations. For each methodology, I
   describe mainly the logic and genetic model on which it is based, the
   data required and information used, the interpretation of the estimate
   obtained, some results from applications to simulated or empirical

Abstract = {{We use genetic divergence at 16 microsatellite loci to investigate how
   geographical features of the Galapagos landscape structure island
   populations of Darwin's finches. We compare the three most genetically
   divergent groups of Darwin's finches comprising morphologically and
   ecologically similar allopatric populations: the cactus finches
   (Geospiza scandens and Geospiza conirostris), the sharp-beaked ground
   finches (Geospiza difficilis) and the warbler finches (Certhidea
   olivacea and Certhidea fusca). Evidence of reduced genetic diversity
   due to drift was limited to warbler finches on small, peripheral
   islands. Evidence of low levels of recent interisland migration was
   widespread throughout all three groups. The hypothesis of
   distance-limited dispersal received the strongest support in cactus and
   sharp-beaked ground finches as evidenced by patterns of isolation by
   distance, while warbler finches showed a weaker relationship. Support
   for the hypothesis that gene flow constrains morphological divergence
   was only found in one of eight comparisons within these groups. Among
   warbler finches, genetic divergence was relatively high while
   phenotypic divergence was low, implicating stabilizing selection rather
   than constraint due to gene flow. We conclude that the adaptive
   radiation of Darwin's finches has occurred in the presence of ongoing
   but low levels of gene flow caused by distance-dependent interisland
   dispersal. Gene flow does not constrain phenotypic divergence, but may
   augment genetic variation and facilitate evolution due to natural
   selection. Both microsatellites and mtDNA agree in that subsets of
   peripheral populations of two older groups are genetically more similar
   to other species that underwent dramatic morphological change. The
   apparent decoupling of morphological and molecular evolution may be
   accounted for by a modification of Lack ` s two-stage model of
   speciation: relative ecological stasis in allopatry followed by
   secondary contact, ecological interactions and asymmetric phenotypic
   divergence.}},

Abstract = {{The glacial refugia hypothesis indicates that during the height of the

   European, North African and Asian tawny owls were found to represent
   three distinct lineages, where North Africa is the sister clade to all
   European owls. Within Europe, I found three well-supported clades that
   correspond to each of the three allopatric refugia. Expansion patterns
   indicate that owls from the Balkan refugium repopulated most of
   northern Europe, while expansion out of Iberia and Italy had only
   regional effects leading to admixture in France. Estimates of

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and empirical studies of phylogeography and
   population structure indicate that many processes influence
   intraspecific evolutionary history. The present study represents the
   first examination of various forces influencing the spatial and
   temporal patterns of sequence variation in the freshwater Mexican
   banded spring snail, Mexipyrgus churinceanus. This snail occurs in one
   of the most critically endangered centres of freshwater endemism, the
   desert ecosystem of Cuatro Cienegas. From cytochrome b mtDNA sequence
   variation, there is strong evidence of long-term isolation of three
   regions, suggesting that these regions represent evolutionarily
   distinct lineages. Molecular clock estimates of clade age indicate a
   time to most recent common ancestor of approximately 2.5 million years
   ago (Ma). The three regions differ considerably in the historical and
   demographic forces affecting population structure. The western
   populations have extremely low mtDNA diversity consistent with a severe
   bottleneck dating to 50 000 years before present (BP). The nearby Rio
   Mesquites drainage is characterized by fragmentation events, restricted
   gene flow with isolation by distance, and higher levels of mtDNA
   polymorphism. These patterns are consistent with the long-term
   stability of this drainage along with habitat heterogeneity and
   brooding contributing to population isolation and restricted gene flow.
   Southeastern populations show evidence of range expansion and a strong
   influence of genetic drift. Migration rates between drainages indicate
   very little gene flow between drainages except for asymmetric migration
   from the Rio Mesquites into both western and southeastern drainages.}},

Abstract = {{Complex population structure can result from either sex-biased gene
   flow or population overlap during migrations. Loggerhead turtles
   (Caretta caretta) have both traits, providing an instructive case
   history for wildlife management. Based on surveys of maternally
   inherited mtDNA, pelagic post-hatchlings show no population structure
   across the northern Atlantic (phi(ST) < 0.001, P = 0.919), subadults in
   coastal habitat show low structure among locations (phi(ST) = 0.01, P <
   0.005), and nesting colonies along the southeastern coast of the United
   States have strong structure (phi(ST) = 0.42, P < 0.001). Thus the
   level of population structure increases through progressive life
   history stages. In contrast, a survey of biparentally inherited
   microsatellite DNA shows no significant population structure: R-ST <
   0.001; F-ST = 0.002 (P > 0.05) across the same nesting colonies. These
   results indicate that loggerhead females home faithfully to their natal
   nesting colony, but males provide an avenue of gene flow between
   regional nesting colonies, probably via opportunistic mating in
   migratory corridors. As a result, all breeding populations in the
   southeastern United States have similar levels of microsatellite
   diversity (H-E = 0.70-0.89), whereas mtDNA haplotype diversity varies
   dramatically (h = 0.00-0.66). Under a conventional interpretation of
   the nuclear DNA data, the entire southeastern United States would be
   regarded as a single management unit, yet the mtDNA data indicate
   multiple isolated populations. This complex population structure
   mandates a different management strategy at each life stage.
   Perturbations to pelagic juveniles will have a diffuse impact on
   Atlantic nesting colonies, mortality of subadults will have a more
   focused impact on nearby breeding populations, and disturbances to
   adults will have pinpoint impact on corresponding breeding populations.
   These findings demonstrate that surveys of multiple life stages are
   desirable to resolve management units in migratory marine species.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete lineage sorting can genetically link populations long after
   they have diverged, and will exert a more powerful influence on larger
   populations. The effects of this stochastic process can easily be
   confounded with those of gene flow, potentially leading to inaccurate
   estimates of dispersal capabilities or erroneous designation of
   evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). We have used phylogenetic,
   population genetic, and coalescent methods to examine genetic
   structuring in large populations of a widely dispersing bat species and
   to test hypotheses concerning the influences of coalescent
   stochasticity vs. gene flow. The Mexican free-tailed bat, Tadarida
   brasiliensis mexicana, exhibits variation in both migratory tendency
   and route over its range. Observations of the species' migratory
   behaviour have led to the description of behaviourally and
   geographically defined migratory groups, with the prediction that these
   groups compose structured gene pools. Here, we used mtDNA sequence
   analyses coupled with existing information from allozyme, banding, and
   natural history studies to evaluate hypotheses regarding the
   relationship between migration and genetic structure. Analyses of
   molecular variance revealed no significant genetic structuring of
   behaviourally distinct migratory groups. Demographic analyses were
   consistent with population growth, although the timing of population
   expansion events differs between migratory and nonmigratory
   populations. Hypotheses concerning the role of gene flow vs. incomplete
   lineage sorting on these data are explored using coalescent
   simulations. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for
   coalescent stochasticity in formulating phylogeographical hypotheses,
   and indicates that analyses that do not take such processes into
   account can lead to false conclusions regarding a species'
   phylogeographical history.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) distribution and abundance have
   been reduced drastically in the past 30 years and the conversion of
   shortgrass prairie to agriculture has caused breeding populations to
   become geographically isolated. This, coupled with the fact that
   Mountain Plovers are thought to show fidelity to breeding grounds,
   leads to the prediction that the isolated breeding populations would be
   genetically distinct. This pattern, if observed, would have important
   management implications for a species at risk of extinction. Our study
   examined genetic variation at two mitochondrial regions for 20-30
   individuals from each of four breeding sites. We found no evidence of
   significant population differentiation in the data from the control
   region or the ATPase 6/8 region. Nested-clade analysis revealed no
   relationship between haplotype phylogeny, and geography among the 47
   control region haplotypes. In the ATPase 6/8 region, however, one of
   the two clades provided information suggesting that, historically,
   there has been continuous range expansion. Analysis of mismatch
   distributions and Tajima\&PRIME; s D suggest that the Mountain Plover
   underwent a population expansion, following the Pleistocene glacial
   period. To explain the lack of detectable genetic differentiation among
   populations, despite their geographic isolation and fidelity to
   breeding locations, we speculate that there is sufficient
   female-mediated gene flow to homogenize gene pools among populations.
   Such gene flow might ensue if pair bonds are formed in mixed flocks on
   wintering grounds rather than on the summer breeding grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The Variable Antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens) is arguably the most
   polytypic thamnophilid, with males ranging from almost entirely jet
   black to nearly white. The four subspecies that occur in Bolivia are
   strikingly divergent in male plumage: T. c. aspersiveuter (black with
   white-barred belly), T c. connectens (black back and bib with white
   belly), T c. dinellii (gray throat and back with rufous belly), and T
   c. paraguayeusis (light gray with white belly). To assess the genetic
   structure of those taxa in Bolivia, sequence variation at the
   mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene was screened in 126 individuals
   collected across transects spanning the plumage and vocal variation in
   the four forms. A 95-km-wide cline in haplotype frequencies from T. c.
   aspersiventer to T. c. dinellii was centered in the Serrania Cochabamba
   across an ecotone from humid to dry Andean foothill habitats.
   Thamnophilus caerulescens connectens is not a valid taxon, instead
   representing an introgressed population near the dinellii tail of the T
   c. aspersiventer-T. c. dinellii hybrid zone. Although direct contact
   between T. c. dinellii and T. c. paraguayensis remains undocumented,
   the mitochondrial data were consistent with introgression along a broad
   cline extending across most of southern Bolivia. Overall, the
   transitions in mitochondrial frequencies were remarkably concordant
   with clinal changes in vocalizations among those same populations
   (Isler et al. 2005). Both studies highlight the need for increased
   sampling, in both the geographic extent and number of individuals per
   population, to address adequately the potential for clinal variation
   between populations that are not isolated geographically. A more
   restricted sampling design in the present study might have led to the
   erroneous conclusion that T. c. aspersiventer, T c. dinellii, and T c.
   paraguayeusis have reciprocally monphyletic mitochondrial lineages,
   making them full species according to some species concepts.}},

   ruficollis, an endemic species of the Tibetan plateau. We analysed 879
   base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and 529 bp of
   the control region in 41 birds from four regional groups separated by
   mountain ranges. We detected 34 haplotypes, 31 of which occurred in a

   sites within regional groups or among regional groups. Haplotype
   diversity was high (h = 0.94); nucleotide diversity was low (th =

   Analyses of mismatch distributions and geographically nested clades
   yielded results consistent with contiguous range expansion, and the
   expansion times were estimated as 0.07-0.19 million years ago (Ma). Our
   results suggest that P. ruficollis colonized the Tibetan plateau after
   the extensive glacial period (0.5-0.175 Ma), expanding from the eastern
   margin towards the inner plateau. Thus, in contrast to many of the
   postglacial phylogeographical structures known at high latitudes, this
   colonization occurred without matrilineal population structuring. This
   might be due to the short glacial cycles typical of the Tibetan

Abstract = {{Motivation: Population allele frequencies are correlated when

   Unfortunately, most models for allele frequency and inference about
   population structure ignore this correlation. Recent analytical results
   show that among populations, correlations can be very high, which could
   affect estimates of population genetic structure. In this study, we
   propose a mixture beta model to characterize the allele frequency
   distribution among populations. This formulation incorporates the
   correlation among populations as well as extending the model to data
   with different clusters of populations.
   Results: Using simulated data, we show that in general, the mixture
   model provides a good approximation of the among-population allele
   frequency distribution and a good estimate of correlation among
   populations. Results from fitting the mixture model to a dataset of
   genotypes at 377 autosomal microsatellite loci from human populations
   indicate high correlation among populations, which may not be
   appropriate to neglect. Traditional measures of population structure
   tend to overestimate the amount of genetic differentiation when
   correlation is neglected. Inference is performed in a Bayesian

Abstract = {{Two genetic consequences are often considered evidence of a founder
   effect: substantial loss in genetic diversity and rapid divergence

   Experiments of serial bottlenecks have shown losses of diversity,
   increased divergence, and rapid behavioural changes possibly leading to
   reproductive isolation between source and final populations. The few
   studies conducted on natural, sequentially founded systems show some
   evidence of these effects. We examined a natural vertebrate system of
   sequential colonization among northwestern song sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia). This system has an effectively linear distribution, it was
   probably colonized within the last 10 000 years, there are
   morphological and behavioural differences among populations, and the
   westernmost populations occur in atypical habitats for the species.
   Eight microsatellite loci from eight populations in Alaska and British
   Columbia (n = 205) showed stepwise loss of genetic diversity, genetic
   evidence for strong population bottlenecks, and increased population
   divergence. The endpoint population on Attu Island has extremely low

   older (north Pacific) and younger (northeast Atlantic) sea urchin
   populations on genetic variation in the northwest Atlantic. We found
   strong evidence of survival of northwestern Atlantic populations in
   local Pleistocene glacial refugia: most haplotypes were the same as or
   closely related to Pacific haplotypes, with deep gene genealogies that
   reflect divergence times within the northwestern Atlantic that are much
   older than the last glacial maximum. We detected gene flow across the
   North Atlantic in the form of haplotypes shared with or recently
   descended from European populations. We also found evidence of
   significant introgression of haplotypes from a closely related species
   (S. pallidus). The relative magnitude of gene flow estimated by
   coalescent methods (and the effective population size differences among
   oceanic regions) depended on the genetic marker used. In general, we
   found very small effective population size in the northeastern Atlantic
   and high trans-Arctic gene flow between the Pacific and northwestern
   Atlantic. Both analyses suggested significant back-migration to the
   Pacific. However, microsatellites more strongly reflected older Pacific
   migration (with similar effective population sizes across the Arctic),
   whereas mtDNA sequences appeared to be more sensitive to recent
   trans-Atlantic dispersal (with larger differences in effective
   population size). These differences across marker types might have
   several biological or methodological causes, and they suggest caution
   in interpretation of the results from a single locus or class of
   markers.}},

Abstract = {{Fishes of the genus Prochilodus are ecologically and commercially
   important, ubiquitous constituents of large river biota in South

   fishes exist in large, stable populations with adult census numbers

   contrast to very low levels of genetic diversity (Theta) and small
   effective population sizes (N-e) observed in a mitochondrial (nu) DNA
   dataset obtained for two species, Prochilodus mariae, and its putative
   sister taxon, Prochilodus rubrotaeniatus. Both species Occupy major
   river drainages (Orinoco, Essequibo, and Negro) of northeastern South
   America. Disparity between expectations based on current abundance and
   life history information and observed genetic data in these lineages
   could result from historical demographic bottlenecks, or alternatively,
   natural selection (i.e., a mtDNA selective sweep). To ascertain
   underlying processes that affect mtDNA diversity in these species we
   compared 0 and N-e estimates obtained from two, unlinked nuclear loci
   (calmodulin intron-4 and elongation factor-1 alpha intron-6) using an
   approach based on coalescent theory. Genetic diversity and N-e
   estimated from mtDNA and nuclear sequences were uniformly low in P.
   rubrotaeniatus from the Rio Negro, suggesting that this population has
   encountered a historical bottleneck. For all P. mariae populations,
   Theta and N-e based on nuclear sequences were comparable to
   expectations based on current adult census numbers and were
   significantly greater than mtDNA estimates, suggesting that a selective
   mtDNA sweep has occurred in this species. Comparative genetic analysis
   indicates that a suite of evolutionary processes involving historical

   from 317 kit foxes from 8 sites and estimated genetic variability in

Abstract = {{The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is a threatened

   occidentalis) is a subspecies of special concern in the western United
   States. Concern for their continued viability has arisen because of
   habitat loss caused by timber harvesting. The taxonomic status of the
   northern subspecies has been the subject of continuing controversy. We
   investigated the phylogeographical and population genetic structure of
   northern and California spotted owls with special reference to their
   region of contact. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences
   confirmed the existence of two well-differentiated lineages connected
   by a narrow hybrid zone in a region of low population density in north
   central California. Maximum-likelihood estimates indicated
   bidirectional gene flow between the lineages but limited introgression
   outside the region of contact. The lengths of both the mtDNA hybrid
   zone and the reduced density patch were similar and slightly exceeded
   estimates of natal dispersal distances. This suggests that the two
   subspecies were in secondary contact in a hybrid zone trapped by a
   population density trough. Consequently, the zone of interaction is
   expected to be geographically stable. We discovered a third, rare clade
   of haplotypes, which we interpreted to be a result of incomplete
   lineage sorting; those haplotypes result in a paraphyletic northern
   spotted owl with respect to the California spotted owl. A congeneric
   species, the barred owl (Strix varia), occasionally hybridizes with
   spotted owls; our results indicated an upper bound for the frequency of
   barred owl mtDNA haplotypes in northern spotted owl populations of 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific phylogeographical patterns largely depend on the life
   history traits of a species. Especially species with a high degree of
   cold tolerance, limited requirements towards habitat preferences, and
   relatively low active dispersal capacities may have responded in a
   different way to the Pleistocene climatological fluctuations than the
   majority of taxa studied so far. To evaluate this possibility, we
   studied Arion fuscus (Muller, 1774), a common and widespread European
   terrestrial slug, from 88 locations (N = 964). Sequence variation was
   assessed for fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and COI genes by
   means of single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and subsequent
   DNA sequencing. Additionally, eight allozyme loci were scored in 843
   individuals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two major
   evolutionary lineages, one in the Balkan region and another in the Alps
   and the rest of Europe. The sequence divergence between the two
   lineages was limited (3.3\%), but gene flow between the regions was
   absent, suggesting that the two regions have been isolated since the
   late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. Allozyme differentiation among
   geographical regions and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages was low.
   The geographical patterns observed in our data showed that (i)
   haplotype and nucleotide diversities are very low in northern Europe,
   suggesting that single haplotypes rapidly colonized large areas; (ii)
   recently expanded haplotype clades have restricted distribution ranges,
   suggesting that current gene flow is low; and (iii) genetic diversity
   in the Alps is much higher than in other regions and estimated past
   gene flow from the Eastern Alps to other regions was high, suggesting
   that this was a refugial zone during the Pleistocene. This full-range
   phylogeography suggests the existence of an alternative refugial zone,
   situated north of the refugial areas currently recognized in most other

Abstract = {{We show that the unstructured ancestral selection graph applies to part
   of the history of a sample from a population structured by restricted
   migration among subpopulations, or demes. The result holds in the limit
   as the number of demes tends to infinity with proportionately weak
   selection, and we have also made the assumptions of island-type
   migration and that demes are equivalent in size. After an instantaneous
   sample-size adjustment, this structured ancestral selection graph
   converges to an unstructured ancestral selection graph with a mutation
   parameter that depends inversely on the migration rate. In contrast,
   the selection parameter for the population is independent of the
   migration rate and is identical to the selection parameter in an
   unstructured population. We show analytically that estimators of the
   migration rate, based on pairwise sequence differences, derived under
   the assumption of neutrality should perform equally well in the
   presence of weak selection. We also modify an algorithm for simulating
   genealogies conditional on the frequencies of two selected alleles in a
   sample. This permits efficient simulation of stronger selection than
   was previously possible. Using this new algorithm, we simulate gene
   genealogies under the many-demes ancestral selection graph and identify
   some situations in which migration has a strong effect on the time to
   the most recent common ancestor of the sample. We find that a similar
   effect also increases the sensitivity of the genealogy to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Bathymetric gradients of biodiversity in the deep-sea benthos
   constitute a major class of large-scale biogeographic phenomena. They

   transects. Here, we examine the depth ranges of deep-sea gastropods and
   bivalves in the eastern and western North Atlantic. This approach shows
   that the abyssal molluscan fauna largely represents deeper range
   extensions for a subset of bathyal species. Most abyssal species have
   larval dispersal, and adults live at densities that appear to be too
   low for successful reproduction. These patterns suggest a new
   explanation for abyssal biodiversity. For many species, bathyal and
   abyssal populations may form a source-sink system in which abyssal
   populations are regulated by a balance between chronic extinction
   arising from vulnerabilities to Allee effects and immigration from
   bathyal sources. An increased significance of source-sink dynamics with
   depth may be driven by the exponential decrease in organic carbon flux
   to the benthos with increasing depth and distance from productive
   coastal systems. The abyss, which is the largest marine benthic

   dispersal success was detected at the regional and continental scales

Abstract = {{In 2004, the term `ghost population' was introduced to summarize the
   effect of unsampled subpopulations that exchange migrants with other
   subpopulations that have been sampled. Estimated long-term migration
   rates among populations sampled will be affected by ghost populations.
   Although it would be convenient to be able to define an apparent
   migration matrix among sampled populations that incorporate the
   exchange of migrants with ghost populations, no such matrix can be
   defined in a way that predicts all features of the coalescent process
   for the true migration matrix. This paper shows that if the underlying
   migration matrix is symmetric, it is possible to define an apparent
   migration matrix among sampled subpopulations that predicts the same
   within-population and between-population homozygosities among sampled
   populations as is predicted by the true migration matrix. Application
   of this method shows that there is no simple relationship between true
   and apparent migration rates, nor is there a way to place an upper
   bound on the effect of ghost populations. In general, ghost populations
   can create the appearance of migration between subpopulations that do
   not actually exchange migrants. Comparison with published results from
   the application of the program, MIGRATE, shows that the apparent
   migration rates inferred with that program in a three-subpopulation
   model differ from those based on pairwise homozygosities. The apparent
   migration matrix determined by the method described in this paper
   probably represents the upper bound on the effect of ghost populations.}},

Abstract = {{Population structure and phylogeography of the pink-footed goose, Anser
   brachyrhynchus Baillon 1833, was studied using mtDNA control region

   during the late Pleistocene. In pairwise comparisons phi(ST) estimates
   showed significant differentiation among eastern and western
   populations, whereas sampling localities within both areas were not
   differentiated. The mtDNA data indicate that the populations have
   separated recently (less than 10 000 years ago) and present breeding
   areas were colonized from one refugial population. The levels of
   haplotype and nucleotide diversity were approximately five times higher
   for the eastern population compared to the western population and
   suggest that the latter was colonized by a subset of eastern birds.
   Time to the most recent common ancestor of the species is 32 000-46 000

   a 936 bp portion of the cytochrome b gene dated Northern and

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Pest eradication is an important facet of conservation and
   ecological restoration and has been applied successfully to invasive
   rat species on offshore and oceanic islands. Successful eradication
   requires the definition of a target population that is of manageable
   size, with low recolonization risk. We applied a molecular genetic
   approach to the identification of populations suitable for eradication
   (eradication units) to provide a new tool to assist the management of
   brown rats Rattus norvegicus on South Georgia (Southern Ocean).
   2. A single eradication attempt on South Georgia (4000 km(2)) would be
   an order of magnitude larger than any previously successful rat
   eradication programme (110 km(2)). However, rats are demarcated into
   glacially isolated populations, which could allow sequential
   eradication. We examined genetic variation at 18 nuclear microsatellite
   loci to identify gene flow between two glacially isolated rat
   populations. One population, Greene Peninsula (30 km(2)), was earmarked
   for an eradication trial.
   3. Genetic diversity in 40 rats sampled from each population showed a
   pronounced level of genetic population differentiation, allowing
   individuals to be assigned to the correct population of origin.
   4. Our study suggests limited or negligible gene flow between the
   populations and that glaciers, permanent ice and icy waters restrict
   rat dispersal on South Georgia. Such barriers define eradication units
   that, with due care, could be eradicated with low risk of
   recolonization, hence facilitating the removal of brown rats from South
   Georgia.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We propose that the molecular definition
   of eradication units is a valuable approach to management as it (i)
   provides a temporal perspective to gene flow, which is important if
   dispersal events are rare; (ii) allows an eradication failure (i.e.
   surviving individuals) to be distinguished from a recolonization event,
   opening the way for adaptive management in the face of failure; and
   (iii) can aid the management of pest species in habitat continua by
   resolving meta-population dynamics, so guiding pest eradication/control
   strategies. This study further illustrates the developing array of
   applied ecological issues in which molecular techniques can help guide
   management.}},

   whether gene flow generally places a substantial constraint on
   evolutionary diversification. We studied multiple independent
   lake-stream population pairs of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus). For each pair, we quantified adaptive divergence based on
   morphological traits that have a genetic basis and are subject to
   divergent selection. We then estimated gene flow based on variation at
   five unlinked microsatellite loci. We found a consistent and
   significant pattern for morphological divergence to be positively
   correlated with genetic divergence and negatively correlated with gene
   flow. Statistical significance and the amount of variation explained
   varied within and among traits: 36.1-74. 1\% for body depth and 11.8-5
   1.7\% for gill raker number. Variation within each trait was the result
   of differences among methods for estimating genetic divergence and gene
   flow. Variation among traits likely reflects different strengths of
   divergent selection. We conclude that gene flow has a substantial
   effect on adaptive divergence in nature but that the magnitude of this
   effect varies among traits. An alternative explanation is that cause
   and effect are reversed: adaptive divergence is instead constraining
   gene flow. This effect seems relatively unimportant for our system
   because genetic divergence and gene flow were not correlated with
   ecologically relevant habitat features of lakes (surface area) or
   streams (width, depth, flow, canopy openness).}},

Abstract = {{The molecular clock hypothesis states that the rate of nucleotide
   substitution per generation is constant across lineages. If generation
   times were equal across lineages, samples obtained at the same calendar
   time would have experienced the same number of generations since their
   common ancestor. However, if sequences are not derived from
   contemporaneous samples, differences in the number of generations may
   be misinterpreted as variation in substitution rates and hence may lead
   to false rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis. A recent study
   has called into doubt the validity of clock-like evolution for HIV-1,
   using molecular sequences derived from noncontemporaneous samples.
   However, after separating their within-individual data according to
   sampling time, we found that what appeared to be nonclock-like behavior
   could be attributed, in most cases, to noncontemporaneous sampling,
   with contributions also likely to derive from recombination. Natural
   selection alone did not appear to obscure the clock-like evolution of

   variability. Half of the 15 distinct haplotypes were restricted to a
   single island, but the most common was found throughout the
   archipelago, suggesting a single colonization event followed by limited
   interisland female gene flow. All N. azoreum haplotypes were closely
   related and formed a star-like structure typical of expanded
   populations. The inferred age of demographic expansions was consistent
   with the arrival of founder animals during the Holocene, well before
   the first humans inhabited the Azores. Comparisons with a population of

Abstract = {{Inferring the spatial expansion dynamics of invading species from
   molecular data is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the
   processes involved. For these demographic scenarios, genetic data
   obtained from highly variable markers may be profitably combined with
   specific sampling schemes and information from other sources using a
   Bayesian approach. The geographic range of the introduced toad Bufo
   marinus is still expanding in eastern and northern Australia, in each
   case from isolates established around 1960. A large amount of
   demographic and historical information is available on both expansion
   areas. In each area, samples were collected along a transect
   representing populations of different ages and genotyped at 10
   microsatellite loci. Five demographic models of expansion, differing in
   the dispersal pattern for migrants and founders and in the number of
   founders, were considered. Because the demographic history is complex,
   we used an approximate Bayesian method, based on a rejection-regression
   algorithm. to formally test the relative likelihoods of the five models
   of expansion and to infer demographic parameters. A stepwise
   migration-foundation model with founder events was statistically better
   supported than other four models in both expansion areas. Posterior
   distributions supported different dynamics of expansion in the studied
   areas. Populations in the eastern expansion area have a lower stable
   effective population size and have been founded by a smaller number of
   individuals than those in the northern expansion area. Once
   demographically stabilized, populations exchange a substantial number
   of effective migrants per generation in both expansion areas, and such
   exchanges are larger in northern than in eastern Australia. The
   effective number of migrants appears to be considerably lower than that
   of founders in both expansion areas. We found our inferences to be
   relatively robust to various assumptions on marker. demographic, and
   historical features. The method presented here is the only robust,
   model-based method available so far, which allows inferring complex
   population dynamics over a short time scale. It also provides the basis
   for investigating the interplay between population dynamics, drift, and
   selection in invasive species.}},

   Ten distinct ITS haplotypes were distinguished, mapped and treated

   an old fragmentation into two major groups of populations, which likely
   colonized regions on different sides of the French Central Massif.
   This re-colonization pattern is reminiscent of the one observed for

Abstract = {{The genetic variability of southern European populations of the marine
   amphipod Gammarus locusta (L.) was analyzed using randomly amplified
   polymorphic DNA (PCR-RAPD). We analyzed 4 populations along the
   Portuguese coast with 10 arbitrary primers, which produced a total of
   114 interpretable bands. The average percentage of polymorphism was
   77\% and the within-population average similarity index was high
   (0.841). Between-population differentiation was low, as determined by
   Wright's fixation index, F-ST (0.074), analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) Phi(ST) (0.048), and Nei's unbiased distances (mean 0.032).
   These results are consistent with those of previous allozyme analysis,
   which indicated that G. locusta has low intra- and inter-population
   genetic variability. Low between-population differentiation indicates
   that G. locusta has efficient dispersal mechanisms for an organism
   lacking larval stages and that disperses passively. Despite the low
   level of genetic differentiation it was still possible to detect some
   genetic subdivision. The Sado and Alvor populations clustered together
   consistently in dendograms based on several genetic distances, and
   AMOVA analysis indicated some level of differentiation between
   populations located to the north (Aveiro and Foz do Arelho) versus
   southern populations (Sado and Alvor), albeit this was very low
   (<1.5\%). Analysis of migration patterns suggested that dispersal is
   unbalanced, occurring primarily from west coast populations to the
   south coast population of Alvor, with much less reciprocal dispersal.
   It would be worthwhile inspecting the significance of this unbalanced
   north-south flow, by determining whether populations located east of
   Alvor also exibit such unbalanced dispersal relative to west coast

Abstract = {{In the past several decades, the development of novel molecular
   techniques and the advent of noninvasive DNA sampling, coupled with the
   ease and speed with which molecular analyses can now be performed, have
   made it possible for primatologists to directly examine the fitness
   effects of individual behavior and to explore how variation in behavior
   and social systems influences primate population genetic structure.
   This review describes the theoretical connections between individual
   behavior and primate social systems on the one hand and population
   genetic structure on the other, discusses the kinds of molecular
   markers typically employed in genetic studies of primates, and
   summarizes what primatologists have learned from molecular studies over
   the past few decades about dispersal patterns, mating systems,
   reproductive strategies, and the influence of kinship on social
   behavior. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this
   overview. First, genetic data confirm that, in many species, male
   dominance rank and fitness are positively related, at least over the
   short term, though this relationship need not simply be a reflection of
   male-male contest competition over mates. More importantly, genetic
   research reveals the significance of female choice in determining male
   reproductive success, and documents the efficacy of alternative mating
   tactics among males. Second, genetic data suggest that the presumed
   importance of kinship in structuring primate social relationships needs
   to be evaluated further, at least for some taxa such as chimpanzees in
   which demographic factors may be more important than relatedness. I
   conclude this paper by offering several suggestions of additional ways
   in which molecular techniques might be employed in behavioral and
   ecological studies of primates (e.g., for conducting,{''}molecular
   censuses{''} of unhabituated populations, for studying disease and
   host-parasite interactions, or for tracking seed fate in studies of
   seed dispersal) and by providing a brief introduction to the burgeoning

Abstract = {{The 8-10 million European Roma/Gypsies are a founder population of
   common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially
   divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups. Unlike other
   founder populations, whose genealogy has been extensively documented,
   the demographic history of the Gypsies is not fully understood and,
   given the lack of written records, has to be inferred from current
   genetic data. In this study, we have used five disease loci harboring
   private Gypsy mutations to examine some missing historical parameters
   and current structure. We analyzed the frequency distribution of the
   five mutations in 832-1,363 unrelated controls, representing 14 Gypsy
   populations, and the diversification of chromosomal haplotypes in 501
   members of affected families. Sharing of mutations and high carrier
   rates supported a strong founder effect, and the identity of the
   congenital myasthenia 1267delG mutation in Gypsy and Indian/Pakistani
   chromosomes provided the best evidence yet of the Indian origins of the
   Gypsies. However, dramatic differences in mutation frequencies and
   haplotype divergence and very limited haplotype sharing pointed to
   strong internal differentiation and characterized the Gypsies as a
   founder population comprising multiple subisolates. Using disease
   haplotype coalescence times at the different loci, we estimated that
   the entire Gypsy population was founded similar to32-40 generations
   ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring similar
   to16-25 generations ago. The existence of multiple subisolates, with
   endogamy maintained to the present day, suggests a general approach to
   complex disorders in which initial gene mapping could be performed in
   large families from a single Gypsy group, whereas fine mapping would
   rely on the informed sampling of the divergent subisolates and
   searching for the shared genomic region that displays the strongest
   linkage disequilibrium with the disease.}},

   within a > 1,600-km narrow strip of forested habitat; that genetic

   Multiple lines of paleontological and genetic evidence suggest that the

   of the Pacific coast. The reduced dimensionality of the distribution of
   the fisher in western coastal forests appears to have contributed to
   the high levels of structure and decreasing diversity from north to

Abstract = {{Reconstructing ancestral geographic origins is critical for
   understanding the long-term evolution of a species. Bayesian methods
   have been proposed to test biogeographic hypotheses while accommodating
   uncertainty in phylogenetic reconstruction. However, the problem that
   certain taxa may have a disproportionate influence on conclusions has
   not been addressed. Here, we infer the geographic origin of Drosophila
   simulans using 2014 bp of the period locus from 63 lines collected from
   18 countries. We also analyze two previously published datasets,
   alcohol dehydrogenase related and NADH.-ubiquinone reductase 75 kDa
   subunit precursor. Phylogenetic inferences of all three loci support
   Madagascar as the geographic origin of D. simulans. Our phylogenetic
   conclusions are robust to taxon resampling and to the potentially
   confounding effects of recombination. To test our phylogenetically
   derived hypothesis we develop a randomization test of the population
   genetics prediction that sequences from the geographic origin should
   contain more genetic polymorphism than those from derived populations.
   We find that the Madagascar population has elevated genetic
   polymorphism relative to non-Madagascar sequences. These data are
   corroborated by mitochondrial DNA sequence data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{HIV-1 group O originated through cross-species transmission of SIV from
   chimpanzees to humans and has established a relatively low prevalence
   in Central Africa. Here, we infer the population genetics and epidemic
   history of HIV-1 group 0 from viral gene sequence data and evaluate the
   effect of variable evolutionary rates and recombination on our
   estimates. First, model selection tools were used to specify suitable
   evolutionary and coalescent models for HIV group O. Second, divergence
   times and population genetic parameters were estimated in a Bayesian
   framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, under both strict
   and relaxed molecular clock methods. Our results date the origin of the
   group 0 radiation to around 1920 (1890-1940), a time frame similar to
   that estimated for HIV-1 group M. However, group 0 infections, which
   remain almost wholly restricted to Cameroon, show a slower rate of
   exponential growth during the twentieth century, explaining their lower
   current prevalence. To explore the effect of recombination, the
   Bayesian framework is extended to incorporate multiple unlinked loci.
   Although recombination can bias estimates of the time to the most
   recent common ancestor, this effect does not appear to be important for
   HIV-1 group O. In addition, we show that evolutionary rate estimates
   for different HIV genes accurately reflect differential selective
   constraints along the HIV genome.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic, ethnographic, and historical evidence suggests that the Hindu
   castes have been highly endogamous for several thousand years and that,
   when movement between castes does occur, it typically consists of
   females joining castes of higher social status. However, little is
   known about migration rates in these populations or the extent to which
   migration occurs between caste groups of low, middle, and high social
   status. To investigate these aspects of migration, we analyzed the
   largest collection of genetic markers collected to date in Hindu caste
   populations. These data included 45 newly typed autosomal short tandem
   repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), 411 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence, and
   43 Y-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were assayed in
   more than 200 individuals of known caste status sampled in Andrah
   Pradesh, in South India. Application of recently developed
   likelihood-based analyses to this dataset enabled us to obtain
   genetically derived estimates of intercaste migration rates. STRPs
   indicated migration rates of 1-2\% per generation between high-,
   middle-, and low-status caste groups. We also found support for the
   hypothesis that rates of gene flow differ between maternally and
   paternally inherited genes. Migration rates were substantially higher
   in maternally than in paternally inherited markers. In addition, while
   prevailing patterns of migration involved movement between castes of
   similar rank, paternally inherited markers in the low-status castes
   were most likely to move into high-status castes. Our findings support
   earlier evidence that the caste system has been a significant,
   long-term source of population structuring in South Indian Hindu
   populations, and that patterns of migration differ between males and
   females.}},

Abstract = {{The Eastern Spot-billed Duck (Anas zonorhyncha) historically was rare
   in the southern Russian Far East. However, during the last 60-70 years,
   its breeding range in East Asia has expanded northwest; Eastern
   Spot-billed Ducks are breeding increasingly within the range of
   Mallards (A. platyrhynchos). We collected 120 Eastern Spot-billed Ducks
   and Mallards from Primorye, Russia, and sequenced 666-667 base pairs
   (bp) of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control
   region and 255 bp of the ornithine decarboxylase intron six (ODC6).
   Control region and ODC-6 allele sequences revealed two divergent groups
   of haplotypes and alleles that differ by 1.5\% and 2.0\%, respectively,
   and correspond to Avise et al.'s (1990) group A and B mtDNA haplotypes.
   Group A mtDNA haplotypes occurred in 22 Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and
   78 Asian Mallards, and group B haplotypes occurred in 14 Eastern
   Spot-billed Ducks and 4 Asian Mallards. Moreover, the group B
   haplotypes that we observed predominantly in Eastern Spot-billed Ducks
   (i.e. group SB) were monophyletic and diverged by 2-16 substitutions
   from group B haplotypes previously sequenced from 241 Mottled (A.
   fulvigula), American Black (A. rubripes), and Mexican ducks (A. diazi),
   and from North American Mallards. In contrast, type 1 and 2 ODC-6
   allele frequencies for Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and Mallards did not
   differ, but heterozygosity for the former was greater than expected
   under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our analysis is the first to document
   the existence of two divergent haplotype and allele lineages (group A
   and B, type I and 2) in Asian mallard species and suggests that Eastern
   Spot-billed Ducks are more closely related to North America's Mottled,
   American Black, and Mexican ducks than they are to Mallards, which
   occur sympatrically in East Asia. Our data are consistent with the
   hypothesis that Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and Mallards have hybridized
   extensively in the Russian Far East. If so, apparent differences in
   group A and B mtDNA haplotype ratios, effective populations sizes, and
   migration rates indicate that many more male Eastern Spot-billed Ducks
   mated with female Mallards and more Eastern Spot-billed Ducks received
   ODC-6 alleles from Mallards than vice versa. We hypothesize that those
   differences reflect strong female natal-site fidelity and high levels
   of male dispersal, and that Mallards significantly outnumber Eastern
   Spot-billed Ducks in Primorye. Excess heterozygosity in Eastern
   Spot-billed Ducks (and in Mallards to a lesser extent) is probably
   maintained by ongoing emigration of Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and
   Mallards from areas of allopatry outside the Primorye region, where
   Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and Mallards are predicted to possesses
   genotypic frequencies historically diagnostic of each species.}},

   considerable uncertainty. Population genetic parameters can be used for
   independent estimates of historical demography, but also have large
   uncertainty, particularly for rates of mutational substitution and gene

   abundance differ by an order of magnitude and, consequently, suggest
   vastly different baselines for judging recovery. Here, we review these

Abstract = {{The genetic study of diverging, closely related Populations is required
   for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for

   whether divergence is due Simply to separation or whether populations
   have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with
   a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a
   Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior
   probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this
   method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci.
   These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance
   scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be
   estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also
   possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of
   recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are
   applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura
   and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged similar
   to500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow
   since the initial separation of the species, with considerable
   variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analyses of complete mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences
   support the monophyly of pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) populations
   from the 1000 km length of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico,
   relative to other geographical segments of the species range in western
   North America. The Baja California peninsula is an area that
   encompasses considerable ecomorphological and infraspecific diversity
   within this pocket gopher species. However, detailed population
   analyses encompassing 35 localities distributed over the southern half
   of the peninsula reveal only trivial phylogeographical structure.
   Rather, most of the 72 unique 500-base pair haplotypes examined from
   142 individuals is restricted to single populations, although a few
   haplotypes are shared broadly across geography. Individual populations
   are typically comprised of haplotype sets from different branches in a
   network of relationships. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
   indicates that approximately half of the total pool of variation is
   contained among individuals within local populations, and that only
   about 25\% can be explained by the regional subdivisions of current
   subspecies distributions or physiographic realms. A hypothesized
   historical vicariant event that has been causally linked to the
   phylogeographical structure of other, codistributed species has had
   little influence on these pocket gopher populations, explaining only
   13\% of the total variation. The temporal depth, estimated by
   coalescence parameters, of the haplotype lineage in Baja California is
   relatively recent, approximately 300 000 generations; both the mismatch
   distribution of pairwise comparisons and a significantly positive
   exponential growth estimate support a recent history of expanding
   populations; but current, or recent past, migration estimates have
   remained small, are largely unidirectional from north to south, and
   weak isolation by distance is present. All data suggest that pocket
   gophers have relatively recently invaded the southern half of
   peninsular Baja California, with the genetic signature of expansion
   still evident but with sufficient time having lapsed to result in a
   weak isolation by distance pattern. The geographical assemblage of
   sampled populations thus appears as a meta-population, with limited
   gene flow contrasting with random haplotype loss due to drift in small,
   localized populations.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of geographic variation in phenotype or genotype may provide

   in color, allele frequencies of a pigmentation gene (the melanocortin-1
   receptor, Mc1r), and patterns of neutral mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   variation in rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) across a
   habitat gradient in southern Arizona. Pocket mice inhabiting volcanic
   lava have dark coats with unbanded, uniformly melanic hairs, whereas
   mice from nearby light-colored granitic rocks have light coats with
   banded hairs. This color polymorphism is a presumed adaptation to avoid
   predation. Previous work has demonstrated that two Mc1r alleles, D and
   d, differ by four amino acids, and are responsible for the color
   polymorphism: DD and Dd genotypes are melanic whereas dd genotypes are
   light colored. To determine the frequency of the two Mc1r allelic
   classes across the dark-colored lava and neighboring light-colored
   granite, we sequenced the Mc1r gene in 175 individuals from a 35-km
   transect in the Pinacate lava region. We also sequenced two neutral
   mtDNA genes, COIII and ND3, in the same individuals. We found a strong
   correlation between Mc1r allele frequency and habitat color and no
   correlation between mtDNA markers and habitat color. Using estimates of
   migration from mtDNA haplotypes between dark- and light-colored
   sampling sites and Mc1r allele frequencies at each site, we estimated
   selection coefficients against mismatched Mc1r alleles, assuming a
   simple model of migration-selection balance. Habitat-dependent
   selection appears strong but asymmetric: selection is stronger against
   light mice on dark rock than against melanic mice on light rock.
   Together these results suggest that natural selection acts to match
   pocket mouse coat color to substrate color, despite high levels of gene
   flow between light and melanic populations.}},

   diversity was higher in the mackerel (0.022) than in the chub mackerel

   mackerel (0.024, P<0.0001) as opposed to the chub mackerel (0.003,

   structuring for these two closely related species. There is extensive
   gene flow between Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean populations of
   chub mackerel, which are organized into a larger panmictic unit. In
   contrast, Mediterranean Sea populations of mackerel show some degree of
   genetic differentiation and are structured along an east-west axis. The
   analysed eastern Mediterranean Sea mackerel populations (Greece, Italy)
   are clearly separated from that of the western Mediterranean Sea
   (Barcelona), which forms a panmictic unit with eastern Atlantic Ocean
   populations. The genetic structures of both species showed asymmetric
   migration patterns and indicated population expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Orissa, on the east coast of India, is one of the three mass nesting
   sites in the world for olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea).
   This population is currently under threat as a result of
   fishery-related mortality; more than 100 000 olive ridleys have been
   counted dead in the last 10 years in Orissa. In general, the globally
   distributed olive ridley turtle has received significantly less
   conservation attention than its congener, the Kemp's ridley turtle (L.
   kempi), because the latter is recognized as a distinct species
   consisting of a single endangered population. Our study of
   mitochondrial DNA haplotypes suggests that the ridley population on the
   east coast of India is panmictic, but distinct from all other
   populations including Sri Lanka. About 96\% of the Indian population
   consisted of a distinct `K' clade with haplotypes not found in any
   other population. Nested clade analysis and conventional analysis both
   supported range expansions and/or long-distance colonization from the
   Indian Ocean clades to other oceanic basins, which suggested that these
   are the ancestral source for contemporary global populations of olive
   ridley turtles. These data support the distinctiveness of the Indian
   Ocean ridleys, suggesting that conservation prioritization should be
   based on appropriate data and not solely on species designations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the genetic population structure and species status of

   Phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial control region DNA
   sequences resulted in the identification of three basal clades of
   haplotypes that were largely congruent with well-known biogeographical
   regions. These clades corresponded to the parapatric sooty (D. o.
   fuliginosus) and dusky (D. o. obscurus) subspecies groups of blue
   grouse plus a previously unrecognized division between northern and
   southern dusky grouse populations; the latter does not correspond
   closely to any currently recognized subspecies boundary. Approximately
   66\% of the total genetic variation was distributed among these three
   regions. Maximum likelihood estimates of gene flow between the regions
   were low or asymmetric; gene flow has been insufficient to prevent
   genetic divergence between dusky and sooty grouse. Estimates of gene
   flow among populations within sooty grouse were large except across the
   Columbia River valley. Among populations of dusky grouse, estimates of
   gene flow were heterogeneous and asymmetrical, reflecting large-scale
   fragmentation of the distribution due to landscape features and

Abstract = {{We examined polymorphism at seven microsatellite loci among sea trout
   (Salmo trutta) (n = 846) collected from three areas in the Limfjord
   (Denmark). We then assessed their potential population source by
   comparing, using a mixed stock analysis (MSA) Bayesian framework, their
   genetic composition to that of brown trout collected from 32
   tributaries pooled into nine geographical regions (n = 3801) and two
   hatcheries (n = 222) used for stocking. For each of the three regional
   sea trout groups (western, central and eastern Limfjord, n = 91, n =
   426, n = 329, respectively), MSA was conducted with (i) all individuals
   in the group, (ii) with the subset of spawning sea trout only and (iii)
   with the subset of foraging, nonspawning individuals only, a subset
   that consisted primarily of sea trout caught during their first year at
   sea. For all three regional sea trout groups, a higher proportion of
   individuals (regardless of whether they were foraging or spawning)
   appear to have originated from the rivers that drain locally, than from
   the rivers that drain in other parts of the Limfjord. This suggests (1)
   that sea trout, at least during their first year at sea, undertake
   limited migrations within the Limfjord system and (2) that sea trout on
   their spawning run were caught close to their natal rivers. The
   proportion of sea trout of hatchery origin varied widely among all
   three Limfjord areas and broadly reflected regional stocking histories,
   with high proportions of sea trout of domestic origin in the east
   (39.3\%), where stocking with domestic trout was practised intensely at
   the time of sampling, and in the west (57.2\%), where a programme of
   coastal stocking of post smolts took place over several years in the
   early 1990s. In contrast, in the central Limfjord, where stocking with
   domestic trout was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, the proportion
   of sea trout of domestic origin was only 8.5\%. Interestingly, for all
   three regional sea trout groups, virtually no sea trout of hatchery
   origin were found among the spawning individuals, which were on average
   larger than the nonspawning sea trout. These results suggest that
   stocked domestic brown trout that become anadromous experience high
   mortality at sea and are therefore largely absent among the larger,
   spawning individuals. We conclude that sea trout of domestic origin
   exhibit much reduced ability to reproduce and are unlikely to
   contribute significantly to the local gene pool largely because of a
   relatively high mortality at sea before the onset of maturity.}},

Abstract = {{Western European populations of red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) are
   characterized by low size and high fragmentation, which accentuate
   their sensitivity to hunting. Uncertainties regarding the demographic
   trends of these populations highlight the need for pertinent hunting
   regulations. This requires identification of the limits of the
   populations under exploitation, i.e. delimiting a management unit. We
   used the left domain of the mitochondrial control region and seven
   nuclear loci (four microsatellites and three introns) to assess the
   level of genetic structure and demographic independence between the
   fragmented Western European and the large Central Asian populations.
   The second objective was to investigate the colonization history of the
   Western European populations. This study demonstrated that the Western
   European populations of red-crested pochard constitute a separate
   demographic conservation unit relative to the Asian population as a
   result of very low female dispersal (mitochondrial DNA: Phi(ST) =
   0.152). A morphometric analysis further suggested that Central Asian
   and Western European specimens of both sexes originate from different
   pools of individuals. Male dispersal seems higher than female
   dispersal, as suggested by the lack of clear genetic structure for the
   nuclear markers at this continental scale. Genetic data, in conjunction
   with historical demographic data, indicate that the current Western
   European populations probably originate from a recent colonization from
   Central Asia. As numbers of red-crested pochards in Western Europe
   cannot be efficiently supplemented by immigration from the larger Asian

   nine isolates of the parasitic lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus. Eight
   of the isolates were sampled from cattle in geographically separated
   farms throughout south-central Sweden, and one isolate was a laboratory
   strain that has been maintained in experimentally infected calves for
   almost four decades. A total of 72 worms were examined, with eight
   individual worms from the same individual host representing each
   isolate. The genetic variation as revealed by amplified fragment length
   polymorphism analysis using four selective primer combinations was
   high. Depending on the primer combination a total of 66-79 restriction
   fragments were amplified, with 26-44 peaks of similar complexity from
   each of the isolates. The heterozygosity within populations was
   relatively small, as were the population mutation and immigration
   rates, which seemed to be in neutral equilibrium. The genetic diversity
   was therefore reasonably well structured in the field; and the
   laboratory isolate was quite distinct from the field samples. There was
   no relationship between the patterns of genetic diversity and the
   geographical proximity of the farms. The estimates of heterozygosity
   were much larger and more consistent than those previously estimated
   for this nematode species using mitochondrial sequencing, and the
   genetic structuring was thus much less pronounced and the gene flow
   greater. We attribute these differences in estimation to the broader
   sampling of loci available using amplified fragment length polymorphism
   markers, which may therefore constitute a superior technique for the
   study of patterns of lungworm diversity. Furthemore, the data
   estimating gene flow for D. viviparus was less than previously reported
   for closely related species in North America. This might be related to
   different rates of movements of infected hosts. It seems likely that
   lungworm infections are rather persistent on different farms, and the
   sudden outbreaks of disease that can be observed with host movements
   are most likely to be related to the introduction of susceptible stock.

Abstract = {{We propose a method of analysing genetic data to obtain separate
   estimates of the size (N-p) and migration rate (m(p)) for the sampled
   populations, without precise prior knowledge of mutation rates at each
   locus (mu(L)). The effects of migration and mutation can be
   distinguished because high migration has the effect of reducing genetic
   differentiation across all loci, whereas a high mutation rate will only
   affect the locus in question. The method also takes account of any
   differences between the spectra of immigrant alleles and of new mutant
   alleles. If the genetic data come from a range of population sizes, and
   the loci have a range of mutation rates, it is possible to estimate the
   relative sizes of the different N-p values, and likewise the m(p) and
   the mu(L). Microsatellite loci may also be particularly appropriate
   because loci with a high mutation rate can reach
   mutation-drift-migration equilibrium more quickly, and because the
   spectra of mutants arriving in a population can be particularly
   distinct from the immigrants. We demonstrate this principle using a
   microsatellite data set from Mauritian skinks. The method identifies
   low gene flow between a putative new species and populations of its
   sister species, whereas the differentiation of two other populations is
   attributed to small population size. These distinct interpretations
   were not readily apparent from conventional measures of genetic
   differentiation and gene diversity. When the method is evaluated using
   simulated data sets, it correctly distinguishes low gene flow from
   small population size. Loci that are not at mutation-migration-drift
   equilibrium can distort the parameter estimates slightly. We discuss
   strategies for detecting and overcoming this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those that
   estimate parameters assuming that the populations investigated are a
   small random sample of a large number of populations and those that
   assume that all populations were sampled. Maximum likelihood or
   Bayesian approaches that estimate the migration rates and population
   sizes directly using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets
   that contain a population that has no data, a so-called `ghost'
   population. This manipulation allows us to explore the effects of
   missing populations on the estimation of population sizes and migration
   rates between two specific populations. The biases of the inferred
   population parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate
   from the unknown populations. The effects on the population sizes are
   larger than the effects on the migration rates. The more immigrants
   from the unknown populations that are arriving in the sample
   populations the larger the estimated population sizes. Taking into
   account a ghost population improves or at least does not harm the
   estimation of population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate
   M (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate per
   generation) are fairly robust as long as migration rates from the
   unknown populations are not huge. The inclusion of a ghost population
   does not improve the estimation of the migration rate M; when the
   migration rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a
   ghost population improves the estimates because of its effect on
   population size estimation. It seems that for `real world' analyses one
   should carefully choose which populations to sample, but there is no
   need to sample every population in the neighbourhood of a population of
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{A plethora of statistical models have recently been developed to

   methods, however, have been adequately evaluated for their performance
   in accurately estimating population genetic parameters of interest. In
   this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of population
   genetic methods through computer simulation. Specifically, we examine
   the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and test the accuracy of this software to
   estimate genetic diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
   intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a neutral
   coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000 bp, and with three
   different per site Theta values of (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed

   We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 performs reasonably well in

Abstract = {{Population differentiation often reflects a balance between divergent
   natural selection and the opportunity for homogenizing gene flow to
   erode the effects of selection. However, during ecological speciation,
   trait divergence results in reproductive isolation and becomes a cause,
   rather than a consequence, of reductions in gene flow. To assess both
   the causes and the reproductive consequences of morphological
   differentiation, we examined morphological divergence and sexual
   isolation among 17 populations of Timema cristinae walking-sticks.
   Individuals from populations adapted to using Adenostoma as a host
   plant tended to exhibit smaller overall body size, wide heads, and
   short legs relative to individuals using Ceonothus as a host. However,
   there was also significant variation in morphology among populations
   within host-plant species. Mean trait values for each single population
   could be reliably predicted based upon host-plant used and the
   potential for homogenizing gene flow, inferred from the size of the
   neighboring population using the alternate host and mitochondrial DNA
   estimates of gene flow. Morphology did not influence the probability of
   copulation in between-population mating trials. Thus, morphological
   divergence is facilitated by reductions in gene flow, but does not
   cause reductions in gene flow via the evolution of sexual isolation.
   Combined with rearing data indicating that size and shape have a
   partial genetic basis, evidence for parallel origins of the
   host-associated forms, and inferences from functional morphology, these
   results indicate that morphological divergence in T. cristinae reflects
   a balance between the effects of host-specific natural selection and
   gene flow. Our findings illustrate how data on mating preferences can
   help determine the causal associations between trait divergence and
   levels of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about what controls effective sizes and migration rates
   among parasite populations. Such data are important given the medical,
   veterinary, and economic (e.g., fisheries) impacts of many parasites.
   The autogenic-allogenic hypothesis, which describes ecological patterns
   of parasite distribution, provided the foundation on which we studied
   the effects of life cycles on the distribution of genetic variation
   within and among parasite populations. The hypothesis states that
   parasites cycling only in freshwater hosts (autogenic life cycle) will
   be more limited in their dispersal ability among aquatic habitats than
   parasites cycling through freshwater and terrestrial hosts (allogenic
   life cycle). By extending this hypothesis to the level of intraspecific
   genetic variation, we examined the effects of host dispersal on
   parasite gene flow. Our a priori prediction was that for a given
   geographic range, autogenic parasites would have lower gene flow among
   subpopulations. We compared intraspecific mitochondrial DNA variation
   for three described species of trematodes that infect salmonid fishes.
   As predicted, autogenic species had much more highly structured
   populations and much lower gene flow among subpopulations than an
   allogenic species sampled from the same locations. In addition, a
   cryptic species was identified for one of the autogenic trematodes.
   These results show how variation in life cycles can shape parasite
   evolution by predisposing them to vastly different genetic structures.
   Thus, we propose that knowledge of parasite life cycles will help
   predict important evolutionary processes such as speciation,
   coevolution, and the spread of drug resistance.}},

   from the Orinoco sharing most recent common ancestry with co-occurring

Abstract = {{The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of senescence postulates genes or
   traits that have opposite effects on early-life and late-life
   performances. Because selection is generally weaker late in life, genes
   or traits that improve early-life performance but impair late-life
   performance should come to predominate. Variation in the strength of
   age-specific selection should then generate adaptive variation in
   senescence. We demonstrate this mechanism by comparing early and late
   breeders within a population of semelparous capital-breeding sockeye
   salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that early breeders (but not late
   breeders) are under strong selection for a long reproductive lifespan
   (RLS), which facilitates defence of their nests against disturbance by
   later females. Accordingly, early females invest less energy in egg
   production while reserving more for nest defence. Variation along this
   reproductive trade-off causes delayed or slower senescence in early
   females (average RLS of 26 days) than in late females (reproductive
   lifespan of 12 days). We use microsatellites to confirm that gene flow
   is sufficiently limited between early and late breeders to allow
   adaptive divergence in response to selection. Because reproductive
   trade-offs should be almost universal and selection acting on them
   should typically vary in time and space, the mechanism described herein
   may explain much of the natural variation in senescence.}},

   mark-recapture data revealed some movement by fish, but the proportion
   of recaptured fish migrating from one population area to another was
   low (0-4.1\%). Additionally, during sampling periods in the spawning
   seasons, no fish was found in the alternate population area to that of
   its first capture. Despite this pattern of limited movement,
   microsatellite analysis based on sixteen polymorphic loci provided no
   evidence of genetic differentiation. Indirect estimates of dispersal
   parameters varied greatly between different methods of analysis. While
   use of a coalescent-based model yielded estimated migration rates
   congruent with the results of the mark-recapture study, other methods

   In particular, the lack of genetic differentiation coupled with likely

   meaningful estimates of dispersal using Fst. The disparities between
   migration rates estimated from the mark-recapture work and from the

Abstract = {{Background: The study of organisms with restricted dispersal abilities
   and presence in the fossil record is particularly adequate to
   understand the impact of climate changes on the distribution and
   genetic structure of species. Trochoidea geyeri (Soos 1926) is a land
   snail restricted to a patchy, insular distribution in Germany and
   France. Fossil evidence suggests that current populations of T. geyeri
   are relicts of a much more widespread distribution during more
   favourable climatic periods in the Pleistocene.
   Results: Phylogeographic analysis of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and
   nuclear ITS-1 sequence variation was used to infer the history of the
   remnant populations of T. geyeri. Nested clade analysis for both loci
   suggested that the origin of the species is in the Provence from where
   it expanded its range first to Southwest France and subsequently from
   there to Germany. Estimated divergence times predating the last glacial
   maximum between 25-17 ka implied that the colonization of the northern
   part of the current species range occurred during the Pleistocene.
   Conclusion: We conclude that T. geyeri could quite successfully persist
   in cryptic refugia during major climatic changes in the past, despite
   of a restricted capacity of individuals to actively avoid unfavourable

Abstract = {{The phylogeographical patterns of a small marine fish, the common goby,

   northeastern Atlantic coasts and the western Mediterranean Sea. A
   combination of two genetic markers was employed: cellulose acetate
   allozyme electrophoresis (CAGE) and sequence analysis of a 289 bp
   fragment of the mitochondrial locus cytochrome b. Both markers were
   congruent in revealing significant differences between samples (global
   F-ST = 0.247 for the allozymes and Phi(ST) = 0.437 for the
   mitochondrial DNA data) and a pattern of isolation-by-distance.
   Phylogeographical analyses yielded a shallow branching structure with
   four groups. Three of those were confined to the Atlantic basin and
   showed a star-like pattern. The fourth group contained a central
   haplotype occurring at the edges of the species' distribution,
   accompanied by a few more rare variants, which were restricted to the
   Mediterranean Sea. A genetic break was observed around the British
   Isles, with distinct haplotypes dominating at either side of the
   English Channel. A significantly negative correlation between the
   degree of genetic diversity and latitude was recorded both for
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and allozymes in the Atlantic basin. Gene
   flow analysis suggested that recolonization of the North Sea and the
   coasts of western Scotland and Ireland may have taken place from a

   routes of marine fish along the northeastern Atlantic coasts.}},

Abstract = {{In the newly emerging field of statistical phylogeography,
   consideration of the stochastic nature of genetic processes and
   explicit reference to theoretical expectations under various models has
   dramatically transformed how historical processes are studied. Rather
   than being restricted to ad hoc explanations for observed patterns of
   genetic variation, assessments about the underlying evolutionary
   processes are now based on statistical tests of various hypotheses, as
   well as estimates of the parameters specified by the models. A wide
   range of demographical and biogeographical processes can be
   accommodated by these new analytical approaches, providing biologically
   more realistic models. Because of these advances, statistical
   phylogeography can provide unprecedented insights about a species'
   history, including decisive information about the factors that shape
   patterns of genetic variation, species distributions, and speciation.
   However, to improve our understanding of such processes, a critical
   examination and appreciation of the inherent difficulties of historical
   inference and challenges specific to testing phylogeographical
   hypotheses are essential. As the field of statistical phylogeography
   continues to take shape many difficulties have been resolved.

Abstract = {{Population subdivision complicates analysis of molecular variation.
   Even if neutrality is assumed, three evolutionary forces need to be
   considered: migration, mutation, and drift. Simplification can be
   achieved by assuming that the process of migration among and drift
   within subpopulations is occurring fast compared to Mutation and drift
   in the entire population. This allows a two-step approach in the
   analysis: (i) analysis of population subdivision and (ii) analysis of
   molecular variation in the migrant pool. We model population
   subdivision using an infinite island model, where we allow the
   migration/drift parameter Theta to vary among populations. Thus,
   central and peripheral populations can be differentiated. For inference
   of Theta, we use a coalescence approach, implemented via a Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration method that allows estimation of allele
   frequencies in the migrant pool. The second step of this approach
   (analysis of molecular variation in the migrant pool) uses the
   estimated allele frequencies in the migrant pool for the study of
   molecular variation. We apply this method to a Drosophila ananassae
   sequence data set. We find little indication of isolation by distance,
   but large differences in the migration parameter among populations. The

Abstract = {{Long-distance dispersal (LDD) includes events in which propagules
   arrive, but do not necessarily establish, at a site far removed from
   their origin. Although important in a variety of ecological contexts,
   the system-specific nature of LDD makes ``far removed{''} difficult to
   quantify, partly, but not exclusively, because of inherent uncertainty
   typically involved with the highly stochastic LDD processes. We
   critically review the main methods employed in studies of dispersal, in
   order to facilitate the evaluation of their pertinence to specific
   aspects of LDD research. Using a novel classification framework, we
   identify six main methodological groups: biogeographical; Eulerian and
   Lagrangian movement/redistributional; short-term and long-term genetic
   analyses; and modeling. We briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses
   of the most promising methods available for estimation of LDD,
   illustrating them with examples from current studies.
   The rarity of LDD events will continue to make collecting, analyzing,
   and interpreting the necessary data difficult, and a simple and
   comprehensive definition of LDD will remain elusive. However,
   considerable advances have been made in some methodological areas, such
   as miniaturization of tracking devices, elaboration of stable isotope
   and genetic analyses, and refinement of mechanistic models.
   Combinations of methods are increasingly used to provide improved
   insight on LDD from multiple angles. However, human activities
   substantially increase the variety of long-distance transport avenues,
   making the estimation of LDD even more challenging.}},

Abstract = {{The houbara bustard, Chlamydotis undulata, is a declining cryptic
   desert bird whose range extends from North Africa to Central Asia.
   Three subspecies are currently recognized by geographical distribution
   and morphology: C.u.fuertaventurae, C.u.undulata and C.u.macqueenii. We
   have sequenced 854 bp of mitochondrial control region from 73 birds to
   describe their population genetic structure with a particular sampling
   focus on the connectivity between C.u.fuertaventurae and C.u.undulata
   along the Atlantic seaboard of North Africa. Nucleotide and haplotypic
   diversity varied among the subspecies being highest in C.u.undulata,
   lowest in C.u.fuertaventurae and intermediate in C.u.macqueenii.
   C.u.fuertaventurae and C.u.undulata are paraphyletic and an average
   nucleotide divergence of 2.08\% splits the later from C.u.macqueenii.
   We estimate that C.u.fuertaventurae and C.u.undulata split from
   C.u.macqueenii approximately 430 000 years ago. C.u.fuertaventurae and
   C.u.undulata are weakly differentiated (F-ST = 0.27, N-m = 1.3),
   indicative of a recent shared history. Archaeological evidence
   indicates that houbara bustards have been present on the Canary Islands
   for 130-170 000 years. However, our genetic data point to a more recent
   separation of C.u.fuertaventurae and C.u.undulata at around 20-25 000
   years. Concordant archaeological, climatic opportunities for
   colonization and genetic data point to a scenario of: (i) initial
   colonization of the Canary Islands about 130 000 years ago; (ii) a
   period of secondary contact 19-30 000 years ago homogenizing any
   pre-existing genetic structure followed by; (iii) a period of relative

Abstract = {{Unravelling relationships between dispersal and population structure
   requires considering the impacts of assumption violations of indirect
   gene flow models in a given system. We combined temporal, individual
   and coalescent-based analyses of microsatellite DNA variation to
   explore the general hypothesis that unequal effective population size
   (N-e), asymmetric gene flow (m) and nonrandom (sex-biased) individual
   dispersal had an important effect on spatiotemporal population
   structuring in lake-dwelling brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). This
   integrative examination shed light on the dichotomous structuring
   observed between an outlet and three tributary-spawning populations and
   their potential for adaptive divergence. It revealed further that finer
   tributary population structuring incongruent with drainage structure
   has been shaped by asymmetric m from one population with a large N-e
   towards two populations of smaller N-e. Gene flow among the tributaries
   was also mediated mainly by male-biased dispersal. However, longer
   distance dispersal from tributaries to the outflow was female-biased.
   Spatially dependent sex-biased dispersal may have contributed therefore
   to gene flow at different levels of population structuring. Our results
   demonstrate how dispersal and population structure may interrelate to
   produce spatial variation in intraspecific diversity, and are therefore
   relevant for conservation programmes seeking to define conservation
   units or predict recolonization rates of extirpated populations.}},

Abstract = {{European grayling populations in Bavaria have shown steady declines
   during the last 10-20 years. In order to provide guidelines for
   conservation strategies and future management programs, we investigated
   the genetic structure of 15 grayling populations originating from three
   major Central European drainages (the Danube, the Elbe and the
   Rhine/Main) using 20 microsatellite loci. Genetic divergence between
   the three drainage systems was substantial as illustrated by highly
   significant heterogeneity of genotype frequencies, high number of
   drainage-specific private alleles, high between-drainage F-ST values,
   high assignment success of individuals to their drainage of origin and
   the high bootstrap support for the genetic distance based
   drainage-specific population clusters. In agreement with earlier
   studies, microsatellites revealed relatively low levels of
   intrapopulational genetic diversity in comparison to the overall level
   of variation across populations. Maximum likelihood methods using the
   coalescent approach revealed that the proportion of common ancestors
   was generally high in native populations and that the estimates of N-e
   were correlated with the genetic diversity parameters in all drainages.
   The number of effective immigrants per generation (N(e)m) was less than
   one for all pairwise comparisons of populations within the drainages,
   indicating restricted interpopulational gene flow. Based on these
   findings we recommend a drainage and sub-drainage specific conservation
   of grayling populations in order to preserve their overall genetic
   diversity and integrity. For large-scale stocking actions to supplement
   declining or to restore extinct populations, creation of separate
   broodstocks for major conservation units (ESUs and MUs) is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Islands are considered to be natural laboratories in which to examine
   evolution because of the implicit assumption that limited gene flow
   allows tests of evolutionary processes in isolated replicates(1). Here
   we show that this well-accepted idea requires re-examination. Island
   inundation during hurricanes can have devastating effects on lizard
   populations in the Bahamas(2,3). After severe storms, islands may be
   recolonized by overwater dispersal of lizards from neighbouring
   islands(3). High levels of gene flow may homogenize genes responsible
   for divergence, and are widely viewed as a constraining force on
   evolution(4,5). Ultimately, the magnitude of gene flow determines the
   extent to which populations diverge from one another, and whether or
   not they eventually form new species(6,7). We show that patterns of
   gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards are best explained
   by prevailing ocean currents, and that over-water dispersal has
   evolutionary consequences. Across islands, divergence in
   fitness-related morphology decreases with increasing gene flow(5).
   Results suggest that over-water dispersal after hurricanes constrains
   adaptive diversification in Anolis lizards, and that it may have an
   important but previously undocumented role in this classical example of

Abstract = {{Orchids of the genus Ophrys (Orchidaceae) are pollinated by male bees

   encompasses several closely related species that differ slightly in

   Populations representing different species of the O. sphegodes group
   often flower simultaneously in sympatry. To test whether gene flow
   across the species boundaries occurs in these sympatric populations, or
   whether they are reproductively isolated, we examined the distribution
   of genetic variation within and among populations and species of this
   group. We collected at each of five different localities in southern
   France and Italy two sympatric, co-flowering Ophrys populations,
   representing six Ophrys species in total. The six microsatellite loci
   surveyed were highly variable. Genetic differentiation among
   geographically distant populations of the same species was lower than
   differentiation among sympatric populations of different species.
   However, the strength of genetic differentiation among species was
   among the lowest reported for orchids. Genotype assignment tests and
   marker-based estimates of gene flow revealed that gene flow across
   species boundaries occurred and may account for the low observed
   differentiation among species. These results suggest that sexual deceit

Abstract = {{Population viability has often been assessed by census of reproducing
   adults. Recently this method has been called into question and
   estimation of the effective population size (N-e) proposed as a
   complementary method to determine population health. We examined
   genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia,
   Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted
   from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic
   diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range
   in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated N-e from the
   temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method
   to calculate effective population size (N-e M), calculated the harmonic
   mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census
   estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in
   all five populations of chinook examined; however, N-e calculated for
   each population was low (81-691) and decreasing over the time interval
   measured. Values of N-e M were low, but substantially higher than N-e
   calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were
   generally low (M < 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for
   all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and
   development activities do not appear to account for the low values of
   N-e; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with
   N-e. Both N-e and M estimates indicate that these populations are
   potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability
   to respond adaptively to stochastic events. Our findings question the
   practice of relying exclusively on census estimates for interpreting

Abstract = {{Molecular and geological evidence indicates that the emergence of the
   Isthmus of Panama influenced the historical biogeography of the
   Neotropics in a complex, staggered manner dating back at least 9 Myr
   BP. To assess the influence of Isthmus formation on the biogeography of
   the harlequin beetle-riding pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides,
   we analysed mitochondrial COI sequence data from 71 individuals from 13
   locations in Panama and northern South America. Parsimony and
   likelihood-based phylogenies identified deep divergence between South
   American and Panamanian clades. In contrast to low haplotype diversity
   in South America, the Panamanian Cordylochernes clade is comprised of
   three highly divergent lineages: one clade consisting predominantly of
   individuals from central Panama (PAN A), and two sister clades (PAN B1
   and PAN B2) of western Panamanian pseudoscorpions. Breeding experiments
   demonstrated a strictly maternal mode of inheritance, indicating that
   our analyses were not confounded by nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes.
   Haplotype diversity is striking in western Atlantic Panama, where all
   three Panamanian clades can occur in a single host tree. This sympatry
   points to the existence of a cryptic species hybrid zone in western
   Panama, a conclusion supported by interclade crosses and
   coalescence-based migration rates. Molecular clock estimates yield a
   divergence time of approximate to3 Myr between the central and western
   Panamanian clades. Taken together, these results are consistent with a
   recent model in which a transitory proto-Isthmus enabled an early wave
   of colonization out of South America at the close of the Miocene,
   followed by sea level rise, inundation of the terrestrial corridor and
   then a second wave of colonization that occurred when the Isthmus was
   completed approximate to3 Myr bp.}},

   observed genealogical relationships in sequence data from nine nuclear
   genes in wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum), a highly
   self-fertilizing grass species. In self-fertilizing plants, gamete
   dispersal is severely limited; dissemination occurs primarily through
   seed dispersal. Also, heterozygosity is greatly reduced, which renders
   recombination less effective at randomizing genetic variation and
   causes larger portions of the genome to trace a similar history.
   Despite these predicted effects of this mating system, the majority of
   loci show evidence of recombination. Levels of nucleotide variation and
   the patterns of geographic distribution of mutations in wild barley are
   highly heterogeneous across loci. Two of the nine sampled loci maintain
   highly diverged, geographic region-specific suites of mutations. Two
   additional loci include region-specific haplotypes with a much
   shallower coalescence. Despite inbreeding, sessile growth habit, and
   the observation of geographic structure at almost half of sampled loci,
   parametric estimates of migration suggest that seed dispersal is
   sufficient for migration across the approximate to3,500-km range of the

   distribution of mutational variation at some loci. At one locus a
   single haplotype has spread rapidly enough to occur, unmodified by

Abstract = {{The effective population sizes of ancestral as well as modern species

   gene tree reconstruction. In this article, we develop a Bayes method
   for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times and current
   and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence data from
   multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts among gene tree
   topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral population sizes.
   The topology, of the species free is assumed known. A Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate over uncertain gene
   trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times) at each locus as well
   as species divergence times. The method call handle any species tree

Abstract = {{This paper studies the speciation of two land snail species in

   species are shown to be sister species within the larger clade of
   western European Candidula species. The species never occurred
   syntopically, but a narrow contact zone population was identified.
   Recent range expansions inferred from phylogeographical methods
   indicated that the present day distributions are not limited by the
   colonization capacity of the species. Analysis of environmental
   variables suggested distribution along an ecotone. The gastropod
   community is also correlated to this gradient. Morphometric shell
   analysis showed that the divergence between the sister species is a
   result of desiccation-resistant shell characters. We therefore conclude
   that the cause for the ecological speciation is most probably the
   establishment of the Mediterranean climate approximate to 3.2 mya. A
   model of ecological speciation with a moving ecotone is put forward.

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA sequence data for 295 individuals of the marine
   bivalve Macoma balthica (L.) were collected from 10 sites across the
   European distribution, and from Alaska. The data were used to infer
   population subdivision history and estimate current levels of gene
   flow. Inferred historical biogeography was expected to be congruent
   with colonization of the Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean after
   the opening of the Bering Strait 3.5 Ma. In addition, the last glacial
   maximum, about 18 000 years ago, was expected to have been responsible
   for most of the present-day distribution of molecular variation within
   Europe, because the area must have been recolonized after confinement
   to France and the south of the British Isles during the last glacial
   maximum. Current gene flow was hypothesized to be high, because the
   larvae of M. balthica spend 2-5 weeks drifting in the water column. The
   geographical distribution of one highly diverged haplotype clade was
   found to be disjunct and was encountered exclusively in samples from
   the Baltic Sea and Alaska. A molecular clock calibration for marine
   bivalve cytochrome-c -oxidase I dates this clade as having split off
   from the other haplotypes 9.8-39 Ma. Multiple colonizations of the
   Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific by M. balthica may explain the strong
   differences found between Baltic Sea and other European populations of
   this species. The sympatric occurrence of the highly diverged
   mitochondrial lineages in western parts of the Baltic Sea points to
   secondary admixture. With the use of coalescent analysis, population
   divergence times for French vs. other non-Baltic European populations
   ('Atlantic population assemblage') were estimated at a minimum of about
   110 000 years ago, well before the last glacial maximum 18 000 years
   ago. Signatures of population divergence of M. balthica that appear to
   have originated during the Pleistocene have thus survived the last
   glacial maximum. Some of the populations within the Atlantic assemblage
   are currently isolated, while others appear to be connected by gene
   flow. Apparently, populations of this species can remain highly
   subdivided in spite of the potential for high gene flow, implying that
   their population and evolutionary dynamics can be independent.}},

Abstract = {{Within populations, the stochastic effect of genetic drift and

   Lake Erie populations of the common garter snake has been of particular
   interest because of a discontinuous colour pattern polymorphism
   (striped vs. melanistic) that is a target of natural selection. We
   reassessed the relative contributions of gene flow and genetic drift
   using genetic data and population size estimates. We compared all
   combinations of two marker systems and two analytical approaches to the
   estimation of gene flow rates: allozymes (data previously published),
   microsatellite DNA (new data), the island model (F-ST-based approach),
   and a coalescence-based approach. For the coalescence approach,
   mutation rates and sampling effects were also investigated. While the
   two markers produced similar results, gene flow based on F-ST was
   considerably higher (Nm > 4) than that from the coalescence-based
   method (Nm < 1). Estimates of gene flow are likely to be inflated by
   lack of migration-drift equilibrium and changing population size.
   Potentially low rates of gene flow (Nm < 1), small population size at
   some sites, and positive correlations of number of microsatellite DNA
   alleles and island size and between M, mean ratio of number of alleles

Abstract = {{1. Fishes can often rebound numerically and distributionally from
   short-term (i.e. seasonal) drought, yet their capacity to recover from
   decades or centuries of drought is less apparent. An exceedingly warm
   and dry period swept the intermontane west of North America ca. 7500
   years BP, concomitant with an abrupt extinction of >35 mammal species.
   Were larger fishes in mainstem rivers also impacted by this drought?
   2. The Colorado River Basin encompasses seven states in western North
   America and drains 600 000 km(2) . Its endemic mainstem fish community
   is ancient (i.e. Miocene) but depauperate.
   3. We evaluated one widely distributed candidate species (flannelmouth
   sucker, Catostomus latipinnis ) for basin-wide genetic and geographic
   structure at three fast-evolving mitochondrial (mt) DNA genes, ND2 with
   589 bp and ATPase 8 and 6 with 642 bp. It is hypothesized that a
   concomitant signature would be present in the mtDNA of this species, if
   indeed it had been seriously bottlenecked by post-Pleistocene drought.
   A total of 352 individuals were sequenced from 24 populations (4-40
   individuals/population; average of 14.7).
   4. Only 49 unique haplotypes were found, 53\% of which represented
   single individuals. Haplotype diversity was high (0.905 +/- 0.007)
   whereas nucleotide diversity was low (0.002 +/- 0.000).
   5. A significant and positive geographical cline (P < 0.001) in
   nucleotide diversity was observed as sampling locations progressed
   upstream from southwest to northeast. These results divided the
   Colorado River Basin into three reaches: the lower reach with six
   populations and 83 individuals; the upper reach with seven populations
   and 83 individuals; and the middle reach with 11 populations and 186
   individuals. An analysis of molecular variance (amova) revealed that
   81.5\% of the total genetic variation was within populations, 16\%
   among populations within reaches and 2.5\% among reaches. Only the last
   was significant. Populations from the three reaches diverged from one
   another by 3400-11 000 years BP. Haplotype distribution suggested
   populations in the upper Colorado River are expanding.
   6. The lack of genetic variation and recent coalescence of lineages in
   C. latipinnis are unusual given its fossil history, broad geographical
   sampling, the rapid rate of mtDNA evolution and the number (and
   evolutionary rate) of the genes examined. The most parsimonious
   explanation for these data is a rapid expansion following a recent
   period of low effective population size at the end of the Pleistocene.
   7. The intense drought is suggested at the end of the Pleistocene
   (late-to-mid-Holocene), severely impacted not only large mammals but
   also larger fishes in western North American rivers. These perspectives
   have important implications for management of endangered and threatened
   species in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Life history variation and genetic differentiation were analysed in
   sockeye salmon in Klukshu River, Yukon Canada over 7 years (1994-2000).
   Sockeye salmon return to the Klukshu River in two distinct runs, with a
   small `early run' in June-August, and a larger `late run' in
   August-September. A maximum likelihood test for clusters indicated that
   the return frequency distribution was bimodal in all the years
   analysed. Life history differences (fork length, sex ratio, age at
   maturity, fresh- and saltwater residency times) were found between the
   early and late runs; however, inconsistent patterns suggest that
   environmental effects outweigh, or strongly interact with, genetic
   effects for the life history characters evaluated. Analysis of
   variation at eight microsatellite loci showed that the early and late
   runs are genetically differentiated in all years examined (exact test).
   F-ST estimates between runs within years were significantly greater
   than zero (range: 0.018-0.041) for all years except one (0.004). The
   genetic variance explained by early vs. late runs (2.27\%) was twice
   the variance among years (1.16\%) based on analysis of molecular
   variance. Our neighbour-joining tree showed early and late runs
   generally clustering separately, indicating higher gene flow among the
   early or late run fish across years relative to between-run gene flow.
   Two years did not fit the general clustering pattern; although the
   early and late runs in 1995 and 2000 were genetically differentiated,
   they clustered separately from the rest of the groups. We cannot offer
   a definitive explanation for these anomalies; however, an analysis of
   possible cryptic population structure in early and late runs indicated
   that at least a few fish strayed between the runs in each year, and the
   highest rate of mixing was in 1995 and 2000. Our data indicate that the
   runs are at least partially reproductively isolated as a result of
   temporal and/or spatial isolating mechanisms. Such reproductive
   isolation has important implications for conservation and management of
   the Klukshu sockeye salmon, and make them an evolutionarily interesting

   4 Gene flow parameters were higher in the upper, mountainous part than
   in the alluvial plain downstream. There was no accumulation of

   migration parameters between adjacent populations.
   5 The results are discussed with regard to the dispersal mechanisms of

Year = {{2003}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Among tuco-tucos, Ctenomys rionegrensis is especially amenable to the
   study of the forces driving population differentiation because of the
   restricted geographic range it occupies in Uruguay. Within this limited
   area, the Rio Negro tuco-tuco is limited to sandy soils. It nonetheless
   exhibits remarkable variation in pelage color, including melanic,
   agouti, and dark-backed individuals. Two hypotheses have been put forth
   to explain this pattern: (1) local differentiation and fixation of
   alternative pelage types by genetic drift under limited gene flow; or
   (2) fixation by natural selection that may take place even in the
   presence of gene flow. A previous allozyme study rejected the genetic
   drift hypothesis on the basis of high inferred levels of migration. New
   estimates of gene flow from microsatellites and mitochondrial
   cytochrome b sequences were obtained for C. rionegrensis populations to
   further test these hypotheses. Much lower levels of gene flow were
   estimated with these more sensitive markers. Microsatellite-based
   estimates of gene flow are close to zero and may come closest to
   estimating current levels of migration. A lack of equilibrium between
   migration and genetic drift is also strongly suggested by the absence
   of an isolation-by-distance pattern found in all three genetic
   datasets. The microsatellite genotype data show that the species is
   strongly structured geographically, with subpopulations constituting
   distinct genetic entities. If current levels of gene flow are very low,
   as indicated by the new data, the local fixation of alternative
   alleles, including those responsible for pelage color polymorphism, is
   possible by drift alone. A scenario is thus proposed in which the
   species expanded in the recent past from a more restricted geographic

Abstract = {{Using properties of moment stationarity we develop exact expressions
   for the mean and covariance of allele frequencies at a single locus for
   a set of populations subject to drift, mutation, and migration. Some
   general results can be obtained even for arbitrary mutation and
   migration matrices, for example: (1) Under quite general conditions,
   the mean vector depends only on mutation rates, not on migration rates
   or the number of populations. (2) Allele frequencies covary among all
   pairs of populations connected by migration. As a result, the drift,
   mutation, migration process is not ergodic when any finite number of
   populations is exchanging genes. In addition, we provide closed-form
   expressions for the mean and covariance of allele frequencies in
   Wright's finite-island model of migration under several simple models
   of mutation, and we show that the correlation in allele frequencies
   among populations can be very large for realistic rates of mutation
   unless an enormous number of populations are exchanging genes. As a
   result, the traditional diffusion approximation provides a poor
   approximation of the stationary distribution of allele frequencies
   among populations. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results

Abstract = {{In vivo virologic compartments are cell types or tissues between which

   important because therapies that would be effective against a reservoir
   may not be effective against viruses produced by a given compartment,
   and vice versa. For example, the use of cytokines to ``flush out{''}

Abstract = {{Geographic patterns of genetic diversity depend on a species'
   demographic properties in a given habitat, which may change over time.
   The rates at which patterns of diversity respond to changes in
   demographic properties and approach equilibrium are therefore pivotal
   in our understanding of spatial patterns of diversity. The brook charr
   Salvelinus fontinalis is a coastal fish exhibiting limited marine
   movements, such that a stable one-dimensional isolation-by distance
   (IBD) pattern should be observed over the whole range. Its range,
   however, recently shifted northward such that northern populations may
   still be in the process of reaching equilibrium. We investigated
   variation in IBD patterns, genetic divergence, and allelic richness at
   six microsatellite markers in 2087 anadromous brook chart from 59
   rivers along the most likely postglacial colonization route. We
   observed a decrease in allelic richness, together with an increase in
   differentiation and a decrease in IBD in the most recently colonized
   northern populations, as expected following recent colonization.
   Contrary to expectation, however, similar patterns were also observed
   at the southernmost part of the range, despite the fact that these
   populations are not considered to be newly colonized. We propose that
   the loss of dispersal capabilities associated with anadromy may have
   caused the southernmost populations to evolve relatively independently
   of one another. This study thus demonstrated that changes in a species'
   geographic range and dispersal capabilities may contribute to shaping
   geographic patterns of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The neutral island model forms the basis for several estimation models

   a null distribution based on the average F (ST) taken over multiple
   loci. A parametric bootstrap method is described here based on Wright's
   beta-distribution to generate null distributions of F (ST) for each

   sampling populations, individuals and loci, and also biological sources

   deviations from the island model may be the result of selection,
   deviations from the island model's migration pattern, nonequilibrium

   Australia and New Zealand, suggesting recent or ongoing migration
   across the Tasman Sea; and (3) reciprocal monophyly among Patagonian

   Andes. These results corroborate experimental work suggesting that
   spore features may be critical determinants of species range. We use
   the mid-Miocene development of the Atacama Desert, 14 million years

   methods invariably make the critical assumption of a single isolated

   can substantially bias estimates of Ne if it is not accounted for. Here
   we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood methods to allow the

   under- and overestimation of N-e, respectively, if it is ignored.
   Extensive simulations are run to evaluate the newly developed moment

Abstract = {{At present there is tremendous interest in characterizing the magnitude

   genome, which will provide the necessary foundation for genome-wide LD
   analyses and facilitate detailed evolutionary studies. To this end, a
   human high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker map has
   been constructed. Many of the SNPs on this map, however, were
   identified by sampling a small number of chromosomes from a single
   population, and inferences drawn from studies using such SNPs may be
   influenced by ascertainment bias (AB). Through extensive simulations,
   we have found that AB is a potentially significant problem in
   estimating and comparing LD within and between populations.
   Specifically, the magnitude of AB is a function of the SNP discovery
   strategy, number of chromosomes used for SNP discovery, population
   genetic characteristics of the particular genomic region considered,
   amount of gene flow between populations, and demographic history of the
   populations. We demonstrate that a balanced SNP discovery strategy

Abstract = {{We explored the impact of phylogeny shape on the results of

   information. In most phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), the
   phylogeny can be represented as a relationship matrix, and the
   hierarchical nature of interspecific phylogenies translates into a
   distinctive blocklike matrix that can be described by its eigenvectors
   (topology) and eigenvalues (branch lengths). Thus, differences in the
   eigenvectors and eigenvalues of different relationship matrices can be
   used to gauge the impact of possible phylogeny errors by comparing the
   actual phylogeny used in a PCM analysis with a second phylogenetic
   hypothesis that may be more accurate. For example, we can use the sum
   of inverse eigenvalues as a rough index to compare the impact of
   phylogenies with different branch lengths. Topological differences are
   better described by the eigenvectors. In general, phylogeny errors that
   involve deep splits in the phylogeny (e.g., moving a taxon across the
   base of the phylogeny) are likely to have much greater impact than will
   those involving small perturbations in the fine structure near the
   tips. Small perturbations, however, may have more of an impact if the
   phylogeny structure is highly dependent (with many recent splits near
   the tips of the tree). Unfortunately, the impact of any phylogeny
   difference on the results of a PCM depends on the details of the data

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We report here a simulation study examining the effect of a recent
   spatial expansion on the pattern of molecular diversity within a deme.
   We first simulate a range expansion in a virtual world consisting in a
   two-dimensional array of demes exchanging a given proportion of
   migrants (m) with their neighbors. The recorded demographic and
   migration histories are then used under a coalescent approach to
   generate the genetic diversity in a sample of genes. We find that the
   shape of the gene genealogies and the overall pattern of diversity
   within demes depend not only on the age of the expansion but also on
   the level of gene flow between neighboring demes, as measured by the
   product Nm, where N is the size of a deme. For small Nm values (<
   approximately 20 migrants sent outwards per generation), a substantial
   proportion of coalescent events occur early in the genealogy, whereas
   with larger levels of gene flow, most coalescent events occur around
   the time of the onset of the spatial expansion. Gene genealogies are
   star shaped, and mismatch distributions are unimodal after a range
   expansion for large Nm values. In contrast, gene genealogies present a
   mixture of both very short and very long branch lengths, and mismatch
   distributions are multimodal for small Nm values. It follows that
   statistics used in tests of selective neutrality like Tajima's D
   statistic or Fu's F-S statistic will show very significant negative
   values after a spatial expansion only in demes with high Nm values. In
   the context of human evolution, this difference could explain very
   simply the fact that analyses of samples of mitochondrial DNA sequences
   reveal multimodal mismatch distributions in hunter-gatherers and
   unimodal distributions in post-Neolithic populations. Indeed, the
   current simulations show that a recent increase in deme size (resulting
   in a larger Nm value) is sufficient to prevent recent coalescent events
   and thus lead to unimodal mismatch distributions, even if deme sizes
   (and therefore Nm values) were previously much smaller. The fact that
   molecular diversity within deme is so dependent on recent levels of
   gene flow suggests that it should be possible to estimate Nm values
   from samples drawn from a single deme.}},

Abstract = {{Using eight microsatellite loci and a variety of analytical methods, we
   estimated genetic effective size (N-e) of an abundant and long-lived
   marine fish species, the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The ratio N-e/N, where short-term
   variance N-e was estimated via the temporal method from shifts in
   allele-frequency data over four cohorts and where N reflected a current
   estimate of adult census size in the northern Gulf, was similar
   to0.001. In an idealized population, this ratio should approximate
   unity. The extraordinarily low value of N-e/N appears to arise from
   high variance in individual reproductive success and perhaps more
   importantly from variance in productivity of critical spawning and
   nursery habitats located in spatially discrete bays and estuaries
   throughout the northern Gulf. An estimate of N, based on a coalescent
   approach, which measures long-term, inbreeding effective size, was four
   orders of magnitude lower than the estimate of current census size,
   suggesting that factors presently driving N-e/N to low values among red
   drum in the northern Gulf may have operated similarly in the past.
   Models that predict N-e/N exclusively from demographic and life-history
   features will seriously overestimate N-e if variance in reproductive
   success and variance in productivity among spatially discrete demes is
   underestimated. Our results indicate that these variances, especially
   variance in productivity among demes, must be large for red drum.
   Moreover, our study indicates that vertebrate populations with enormous
   adult census numbers may still be at risk relative to decline and
   extinction from genetic factors.}},

Abstract = {{An importance-sampling method is presented for computing the likelihood
   of the configuration of population genetic data under general
   assumptions about population history and transitions among states. The
   configuration of the data is the number of chromosomes sampled that are
   in each of a finite set of states. Transitions among states are
   governed by a Markov chain with transition probabilities dependent on
   one or more parameters. The method assumes that the joint distribution
   of coalescence times of the underlying gene genealogy is independent of
   the genetic state of each lineage. Given a set of coalescence times,
   the probability that a pair of lineages is chosen to coalesce in each
   replicate is proportional to the contribution that the coalescence
   event makes to the probability of the data. This method can be applied
   to gene genealogies generated by the neutral coalescent process and to
   genealogies generated by other processes, such as a linear birth-death
   process which provides a good approximation to the dynamics of
   low-frequency alleles. Two applications are described. In the first,
   the fit of allele frequencies at two microsatellite loci sampled in a
   Sardinian population to the one-step mutation model is tested. The
   one-step model is rejected for one locus but not for the other. The
   second application is to low-frequency alleles in a geographically
   subdivided population. The geographic location is the allelic state,
   and the alleles are assumed to be sufficiently rare that their dynamics
   can be approximated by a linear birth-death process in which the birth
   and death rates are independent of geographic location. The analysis of
   eight low-frequency allozyme alleles found in the glaucous-winged gull,
   Larus glaucescens, illustrates how geographically restricted dispersal
   can be detected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.}},

   geographical history. In contrast, methods that seek to reconstruct
   phylogeographic history are able to consider many alternative
   geographical scenarios, but are primarily nonstatistical, making
   inferences about particular biological processes without explicit
   reference to stochastically derived expectations. We advocate the
   merging of these two traditions so that statistical phylogeographic
   methods can provide an accurate representation of the past, consider a
   diverse array of processes, and yet yield a statistical estimate of
   that history. We discuss various conceptual issues associated with
   statistical phylogeographic inferences, considering especially the
   stochasticity of population genetic processes and assessing the
   confidence of phylogeographic conclusions. To this end, we present some
   empirical examples that utilize a statistical phylogeographic approach,
   and then by contrasting results from a coalescent-based approach to
   those from Templeton's nested cladistic analysis (NCA), we illustrate
   the importance of assessing error. Because NCA does not assess error in
   its inferences about historical processes or contemporary gene flow, we
   performed a small-scale study using simulated data to examine how our
   conclusions might be affected by such unconsidered errors. NCA did not
   identify the processes used to simulate the data, confusing among
   deterministic processes and the stochastic sorting of gene lineages.
   There is as yet insufficent justification of NCA's ability to
   accurately infer or distinguish among alternative processes. We close
   with a discussion of some unresolved problems of current statistical
   phylogeographic methods to propose areas in need of future development.}},

   in control region 1 (CR1) by 14 nucleotide substitutions (3.6\%). For
   estimation of the time of divergence, the whole CR of 14 specimens was
   sequenced. The major clades differed by 2.2\%, corresponding to an
   estimated coalescence time of c. 1.1 million years. On CR1, 45
   haplotypes were found. Western clade haplotypes were found in France,
   England, Germany, Poland, Italy and Austria. Eastern clade haplotypes
   were found in Finland, Bulgaria, Greece, and Ireland. One Finnish
   population and all Bulgarian and Irish populations were mixed, but only
   in Bulgaria was the mixing assumed to be natural. Nucleotide and
   haplotype diversities varied between populations, and both clades
   showed geographical structuring. The distribution of pairwise
   nucleotide differences in the eastern clade fitted the expectations of
   an expanding population. About 80\% of the genetic structure in the

Abstract = {{A range-wide survey of Dakota skipper (Hesperia dacotae) populations
   assessed levels of genetic variability and geographic scale of

   species exists on isolated patches of native tall- and mixed-grass
   prairie within a highly modified landscape dominated by agriculture. It
   has been extirpated from the southern portion of its range and has
   suffered range-wide declines. Nine populations were sampled from
   western Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and southern Manitoba. Starch
   gel electrophoresis was used to resolve 21 isozyme loci in 278 Dakota
   skippers. Dakota skipper populations were approximately as variable as
   other lepidopterans found in isolated habitats. Genetic distances
   indicated that Manitoba populations were somewhat distinct from ones in
   Minnesota and South Dakota. Isolation-by-distance was detected
   range-wide and among the seven southern-most populations. Genetically
   effective immigration rates were small at both range-wide and regional
   scales and effective populations sizes were low suggesting that Dakota
   skipper populations are genetically isolated from one another, although
   they were likely more connected in the recent past. Genotype assignment
   tests revealed two clusters of populations in Minnesota and South
   Dakota that were not apparent from the isolation-by-distance results.
   Significant heterozygote deficiencies relative to Hardy-Weinberg
   expectations and high inbreeding coefficients suggest structure within
   sample locations. Management recommendations include the maximization
   of effective population size in each Dakota skipper population to
   offset the effects of drift and habitat corridors in some cases.

   relevant to the large number of coalescent estimation procedures, which
   generally assume neutrality for segregating polymorphisms-applying
   these estimators to evolutionarily constrained sequences could lead to
   a significant degree of bias. We also estimate the statistical power of
   several neutrality tests in detecting weak to moderate purifying
   selection and find that the power is quite good for some parameter
   combinations. This result contrasts with previous studies, which
   predicted low statistical power because of the minor effect that weak
   purifying selection has on the shape of a genealogy. Finally, we

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of allozyme methods in the mid 1960s it has been
   a standard practice to report Wright's measure of population
   subdivision, F-ST, for surveys of genetic variation. Its widespread use
   has provided us with a sense of what values can be expected in
   particular situations and how they can be interpreted. With some
   theoretical justification, F-ST has also been used to estimate rates of
   gene flow. However there are conditions under which F-ST is
   inappropriate for gene flow estimation and can lead to incorrect or
   even absurd conclusions. These pitfalls have prompted critics to
   suggest that F-ST has failed to deliver what its proponents have
   promised and should be abandoned. A further challenge has been the
   development of new methods that offer even greater promise. Thus it is
   reasonable to ask if perhaps it is time to retire F-ST and turn to new
   and more powerful methods for the inference of gene flow from genetic
   markers. Here I will argue that although gene flow should be estimated

Abstract = {{The present study combines methods that were designed to infer
   intraspecific relationships (e.g. nested-clade analysis (NCA), mismatch
   distributions and maximum likelihood gene flow analysis) to analyse
   historic events and recurrent processes in the cryptic mud snail
   species Hydrobia acuta and H. glyca . Specifically, we test the
   proposed allopatry of cryptic species and whether the peculiar
   range-subdivision of the putative subspecies H. a. acuta and H. a.
   neglecta is a result of long-distance dispersal or continuous range
   expansion. The NCA indicates a past fragmentation of the two H. acuta
   subspecies as well as past fragmentations within H. glyca . Gene-flow
   analyses show extensive gene flow in an E-W direction (towards the
   Atlantic) in the Mediterranean H. a. acuta , generally low gene flow in
   a W-E direction in the Atlantic H. a. neglecta and complex gene-flow
   pattern in a N-S but also in a S-N direction (against the Gulf Stream)
   in H. glyca . Based on these data and supportive ecological and
   oceanographical data, we hypothesize that the separation of the two H.
   acuta subspecies was not caused by long-distance dispersal but by a
   range shift and/or range expansion of the closely related competitor H.
   glyca as a result of an interglacial warming with a subsequent range
   shift in H. acuta . Moreover, our data do not show evidence for a
   long-term, stable sympatry of Hydrobia species, supporting the concept
   of allopatric relationships within cryptic radiations. NCA and
   gene-flow analyses indicate that the only sympatric population found in
   our study is the result of a recent dispersal event from the nearby
   Mediterranean. It is assumed that allopatric relationships in ephemeral
   Hydrobia populations constitute an evolutionary advantage relative to
   competition, recruitment and re-establishment of habitats. Mechanisms

Abstract = {{We investigated the interplay between natural selection and gene flow

   Misty Lake system (Vancouver Island, British Columbia), stickleback
   from the inlet stream (flowing into the lake) have fewer gill rakers
   and deeper bodies than stickleback from the lake-differences thought to
   facilitate foraging (benthic macroinvertebrates in the stream vs.
   zooplankton in the open water of the lake). Common-garden experiments
   demonstrated that these differences have a genetic basis. Reciprocal
   transplant enclosure experiments showed that lake and inlet stickleback
   grow best in their home environments (although differences were subtle
   and often not significant). Release-recapture experiments in the inlet
   showed that lake fish are less well-suited than inlet fish for life in
   the stream (higher mortality or emigration in lake fish). Morphological
   divergence in the wild and under common rearing was greater between the
   lake and the inlet than between the lake and the outlet. Genetic
   divergence (mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites) was greatest between
   the lake and the upper inlet (1.8 km upstream from the lake),
   intermediate between the lake and the lower inlet (0.9 km upstream),
   and least between the lake and the outlet stream (1.2 km downstream).
   Relative levels of gene flow estimated from genetic data showed the
   inverse pattern. The negative association between morphological
   divergence and gene flow is consistent with the expectation that gene
   flow can constrain adaptation. Estimated absolute levels of gene flow
   also implied a constraint on adaptation in the outlet but not the
   inlet. Our results suggest that natural selection promotes the adaptive
   divergence of lake and stream stickleback, but that the magnitude of
   divergence can be constrained by gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technical advances allow straightforward access to genetic

   Molecular markers appear particularly useful for i) measuring local

   population of origin, iii) measuring effective population size through
   the between-generation comparison of allele frequencies, and iv)
   detecting past demographic bottlenecks through allele frequency

Abstract = {{The Kermode bear is a white phase of the North American black bear that
   occurs in low to moderate frequency on British Columbia's mid-coast. To
   investigate the genetic uniqueness of populations containing the white
   phase, and to ascertain levels of gene flow among populations, we
   surveyed 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, assayed from
   trapped bear hairs. A total of 216 unique bear genotypes, 18 of which
   were white, was sampled among 12 localities. Island populations, where
   Kermodes are most frequent, show approximate to 4\% less diversity than
   mainland populations, and the island richest in white bears (Gribbell)
   exhibited substantial genetic isolation, with a mean pairwise F-ST of
   0.14 with other localities. Among all localities, F-ST for the
   molecular variant underlying the coat-colour difference (A893G) was
   0.223, which falls into the 95th percentile of the distribution of F-ST
   values among microsatellite alleles, suggestive of greater
   differentiation for coat colour than expected under neutrality.
   Control-region sequences confirm that Kermode bears are part of a
   coastal or western lineage of black bears whose existence predates the
   Wisconsin glaciation, but microsatellite variation gave no evidence of
   past population expansion. We conclude that Kermodism was established

   and somewhat reduced population sizes in insular habitat, with the
   possible contribution of selective pressure and/or nonrandom mating.}},

   polymorphism levels and in the levels of polymorphisms that are shared

   patterns of linkage disequilibrium, is developed. The results from
   these. and other tests, support a model in which D. pseudoobscura and
   D. persimilis have exchanged genes at some loci. However, the pattern
   of variation suggests that most gene flow, although occurring after

Abstract = {{Although neutral molecular markers have long been important tools for

   The review also explores how increasing interest in non-neutral

Abstract = {{There is a wealth of published molecular population genetic studies,
   however, most do not include historic samples and thus implicitly
   assume temporal genetic stability. We tested for changes in genetic
   diversity and structure in three populations of steelhead trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from a northern British Columbia watershed using
   seven microsatellite loci over 40 years. We found little change in
   genetic diversity (mean allele numbers and observed and expected
   heterozygosity), despite large variation in the estimated numbers of
   steelhead returning to the watershed over the same time period.
   However, the temporal stability in genetic diversity is not reflected
   in population structure, which appears to be high among populations,
   yet significantly variable over time. The neighbour-joining tree showed
   that, overall, two of the populations (Zymoetz and Kispiox) clustered
   separately from the third (Babine); a finding which was not consistent
   with their geographical separation. The clustering pattern was also not
   temporally consistent. We used the temporal method to estimate the
   effective number of breeders (N-b) for the three populations; our
   values (N-b = 17-102) were low for the large and presumed vigorous
   populations of steelhead trout sampled. The low N-b values were also
   not consistent with the generally high genetic diversity estimates,
   suggesting the possibility of intermittent gene flow among the three
   populations. The use of temporal analyses in population genetic samples
   should be a priority; first, to verify observed patterns in
   contemporary data, and second, to build a data-set of temporal analyses
   to allow generalizations to be made concerning temporal genetic
   stability and effective population size in natural populations.}},

   history (post-Pleistocene range expansion followed by subdivision into

   species differ in anticipated rates of gene flow because of differences
   in body size and degree to which they use aquatic habitats. Significant
   population subdivision was present in all three species, and isolation
   by distance was evident in water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) and, to a
   lesser degree, in brown snakes (Storeria dekayi) but not in garter

Abstract = {{The effects of Quaternary climatic cycles were investigated in
   Drosophila serido, a Brazilian cactophilic fly widely distributed
   outside the Amazonian region. Previous studies have indicated this
   species displays remarkable karyotypic, male genitalia, and mtDNA
   variation, so much so that it has been described as a species complex,
   or superspecies. In the present study we expand the analysis of the
   mtDNA COI gene on D. serido populations, particularly in central
   Brazil, by obtaining DNA sequences from 248 individuals distributed
   across 47 localities. This allowed us to perform a nested clade
   analysis to discriminate historical from recurrent forces shaping the
   evolution of D. serido populations. The nested analysis indicates one
   event of past fragmentation separating populations from south and
   central Brazil (referred to as type B) from populations in central and
   northeast Brazil (type D) and 15 other significant events. The most
   common outcome of our analysis was contiguous range expansion and we
   discuss why this was expected in D. serido. Our data indicate that D.
   serido has been distributed across Brazil at least since the
   Mid-Pleistocene, which contradicts the hypothesis of current
   distribution being determined by last glaciation cycle. Nonetheless, we
   present evidence that climatic cycles during the Quaternary and before
   have had a significant impact on the differentiation of D. serido in

Abstract = {{Substantial genetic differentiation, as great as among species, exists
   between populations of Drosophila melanogaster inhabiting opposite
   slopes of a small canyon. Previous work has shown that prezygotic
   sexual isolation and numerous differences in stress-related phenotypes
   have evolved between D. melanogaster populations in ``Evolution
   Canyon,{''} Israel, in which slopes 100-400 m apart differ dramatically
   in aridity, solar radiation, and associated vegetation. Because the
   canyon's width is well within flies' dispersal capabilities, we
   examined genetic changes associated with local adaptation and incipient
   speciation in the absence of geographical isolation. Here we report
   remarkable genetic differentiation of microsatellites and divergence in
   the regulatory region of hsp70Ba which encodes the major inducible heat
   shock protein of Drosophila, in the two populations. Additionally, an
   analysis of microsatellites suggests a limited exchange of migrants and
   lack of recent population bottlenecks. We hypothesize that adaptation
   to the contrasting microclimates overwhelms gene flow and is
   responsible for the genetic and phenotypic divergence between the

   the pre-data mean. Second, both the post-data density and expectation
   for the coalescence time are shown to converge, in the weak-migration
   limit, to the corresponding parmictic results, as opposed to the
   pre-data situation where there is convergence in the density but not in

Abstract = {{A simple genealogical process is found for samples from a
   metapopulation, which is a population that is subdivided into a large
   number of demes, each of which is subject to extinction and
   recolonization and receives migrants from other demes. As in the
   migration-only models studied previously, the genealogy of any sample
   includes two phases: a brief sample-size adjustment followed by a
   coalescent process that dominates the history. This result will hold
   for metapopulations that are composed of a large number of domes. It is
   robust to the details of population structure, as long as the number of
   possible source domes of migrants and colonists for each deme is large.
   Analytic predictions about levels of genetic variation are possible,
   and results for average numbers of pairwise differences within and
   between domes are given. Further analysis of the expected number of
   segregating sites in a sample from a single dome illustrates some
   previously known differences between migration and
   extinction/recolonization. The ancestral process is also amenable to
   computer simulation. Simulation results show that migration and
   extinction/recolonization have very different effects on the
   site-frequency distribution in a sample from a single deme. Migration
   can cause a U-shaped site-frequency distribution, which is
   qualitatively similar to the pattern reported recently for positive
   selection. Extinction and recolonization, in contrast, can produce a
   mode in the site-frequency distribution at intermediate frequencies,

Abstract = {{This article describes a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method

   We demonstrate the utility of the method in three applications. First,
   we demonstrate how the method can be used to make inferences regarding
   population genetical parameters such as theta (the effective population
   size times the mutation rate). Second, we show how the method can be
   used to estimate the ages of mutations in finite sites models and for
   making inferences regarding the distribution and ages of nonsynonymous
   and synonymous mutations. The method is applied to two previously
   published data sets and we demonstrate that in one of the data sets the
   average age of nonsynonymous mutations is significantly, lower than the
   average age of synonymous mutations, suggesting the presence of
   slightly deleterious mutations. Third, we demonstrate how the method in
   general can be used to evaluate the posterior distribution of a

Abstract = {{We present results from a study of genetic variation in Utah's cougar
   population. Estimates were based on data for 50 animals at nine
   microsatellite loci with five individuals sampled for each of ten
   management units throughout Utah. Levels of variation were moderate
   (average genetic diversity across populations was estimated to be
   0.4687 for all 50 individuals), and comparable with other large
   mammals. But this level of variation for the microsatellite loci
   translated into an inbreeding effective population size of only 571
   animals, much lower than the current estimates of census sizes of
   around 2000-3000. A lack of differentiation among the sampled
   populations across Utah (average N(e)m = 6.2) indicates that gene flow
   occurs over a large area. Since cougars are capable of movement beyond
   the Utah state borders (and certainly across management units), a
   better understanding of migration rates and patterns of dispersal will
   be achieved by sampling a much larger geographic region incorporating
   much of the western USA. Successful management and conservation of this

Abstract = {{When populations are separated for long periods and then brought into
   contact for a brief episode in part of their range, this can result in
   genetic admixture. To analyze this type of event we considered a simple
   model under which two parental populations (P-1 and P-2) mix and create
   a hybrid population (H). After that event, the three populations evolve
   under pure drift without exchange during T generations. We developed a
   new method, which allows the simultaneous estimation of the time since
   the admixture event (scaled by the population size t(i) = T/N-ii, where
   N-i is the effective population size of population i) and the
   contribution of one of two parental populations (which we call p(1)).
   This method takes into account drift since the admixture event,
   variation caused by sampling, and uncertainty in the estimation of the
   ancestral allele frequencies. The method is tested on simulated data
   sets and then applied to a human data set. We find that (i) for
   single-locus data, point estimates are poor indicators of the real
   admixture proportions even when there are many alleles; (ii) biallelic
   loci provide little information about the admixture proportion and the
   time since admixture, even for very small amounts of drift, but can be
   powerful when many loci are used; (iii) the precision of the
   parameters' estimates increases with sample size (n = 50 vs. n = 200)
   but this effect is larger for the t(i)'s than for p(1); and (iv) the
   increase in precision provided by multiple loci is quite large, even
   when there is substantial drift (we found, for instance, that it is
   preferable to use five loci than one locus, even when drift is 100
   times larger for the five loci). Our analysis of a previously studied
   human data set illustrates that the joint estimation of drift and
   p(1)can provide additional insights into the data.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the extent, causes, and consequences of biotic distributions
   in space is fundamental to our understanding of how species evolve and
   cope with particular environments. Yet, identifying extrinsic barriers
   to migration imposed by landscape structure and predicting their
   impacts on intraspecific genetic diversity remains a major challenge in
   population biology. In this study, 30 populations (771 individuals) of
   brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmonidae) representing six major
   river drainages from Maine, USA, were characterized at six
   microsatellite loci to quantify the role of landscape features, such as
   habitat site, altitude, contemporary and historical connectivity, in
   shaping genetic diversity at three spatial scales: within lakes, within
   river drainages, and among river drainages. Within-population expected
   heterozygosity was negatively correlated with altitude, whereas no
   significant correlation was observed with lake size. Conversely, the
   extent of heterozygote deficiency within lakes was negatively
   associated with habitat size. The hierarchical analysis of genetic
   variance revealed that the extent of among-drainage differentiation was
   unexpectedly low relative to the pronounced population structuring
   within drainage. Geographically proximate St. John and Penobscot River
   drainages were characterized by opposite effects of altitude and
   geographic distance in shaping the pattern of population
   differentiation within drainages. The geographic pattern of
   differentiation among drainages could not be accounted for either by an
   isolation by distance or by a stepwise range expansion model. Overall,
   this study provided evidence for the role of contemporary landscape
   features in shaping the observed pattern of genetic diversity at
   smaller geographic scales (within and among populations within river
   drainage). On a broader geographic scale, contemporary landscape
   structure appeared to be only a minor factor determining the observed
   pattern of genetic structuring among drainages. These results add to
   the increasing evidence for nonequilibrium conditions between drift and
   migration in a wide array of animal taxa. The development of more
   realistic theoretical descriptions of nonequilibrium population
   structure thus appears to be important to better understand the
   relative influence of historical and ecological factors in shaping
   genetic variation in young habitats, such as recently deglaciated areas.}},

   The ancestry of a sample of non-recombining DNA sequences has a simple
   structure when the sample size is much smaller than the total number of
   demes in the population. This allows an expression for the probability
   distribution of the number of segregating sites in the sample to be

   computed estimators of the migration parameter for each deme in a

   ancestral to the sample tend to accumulate in demes with low migration
   rates and/or which contribute disproportionately to the migrant pool.
   In addition, common ancestor or coalescent events tend to occur in
   demes of small size. This provides a framework for understanding the

Abstract = {{Many species persist as a metapopulation under a balance between the
   local extinction of subpopulations or demes and their recolonization
   through dispersal from occupied patches. Here we review the growing
   body of literature dealing with the genetic consequences of such
   population turnover. We focus our attention principally on theoretical
   studies of a classical metapopulation with a `finite-island' model of
   population structure, rather than on `continent-island' models or
   `source-sink' models. In particular, we concern ourselves with the
   subset of geographically subdivided population models in which it is
   assumed that all demes are liable to extinction from time to time and
   that all demes receive immigrants. Early studies of the genetic effects
   of population turnover focused on population differentiation, such as
   measured by F-ST A key advantage of F-ST over absolute measures of
   diversity is its relative independence of the mutation process, so that
   different genes in the same species may be compared. Another advantage
   is that F-ST Will usually equilibrate more quickly following
   perturbations than will absolute levels of diversity. However, because
   F-ST is a ratio of between-population differentiation to total
   diversity, the genetic effects of metapopulation processes may be
   difficult to interpret in terms of F-ST-on its own, so that the
   analysis of absolute measures of diversity in addition is likely to be
   informative. While population turnover may either increase or decrease
   F-ST, depending on the mode of colonization, recurrent extinction and
   recolonization is expected always to reduce levels of both
   within-population and species-wide diversity (pi (S) and pi (T),
   respectively). One corollary of this is that pi (S) cannot be used as
   an unbiased estimate of the scaled mutation rate, theta, as it can,
   with some assumptions about the migration process, in species whose
   demes do not fluctuate in size. The reduction of pi (T) in response to
   population turnover reflects shortened mean coalescent times, although
   the distribution of coalescence times under extinction-colonization
   equilibrium is not yet known. Finally we review current understanding
   of the effect of metapopulation dynamics on the effective population
   size.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the shape of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from
   sequences evolving under the coalescent with recombination. The
   motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from
   phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though
   recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur
   (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases
   when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard
   software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from
   sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With
   recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total
   branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common
   ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving
   with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels
   of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set.
   The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble
   phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population.
   However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such
   as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large
   overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of
   the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address alternative hypotheses for the evolution of

   among populations of rock ptarmigan in the Aleutian Islands and parts
   of both Alaska and Siberia. Variation in mitochondrial control region
   sequences of 105 rock ptarmigan from 10 subspecies within the Bering
   region revealed three major phylogenetic lineages, two of which are
   endemic to the Aleutian Islands. Accordingly, haplotype and nucleotide
   diversities of rock ptarmigan within the archipelago are much higher
   than within mainland Alaska or Siberia. For Aleutian rock ptarmigan,
   analyses of molecular variance indicated significant genetic
   structuring and low estimates of gene flow among populations, despite
   small interisland distances within the archipelago. However; isolation
   by distance did not describe the pattern of gene flow or
   differentiation at this scale. Our estimates of divergence times of
   lineages suggest that Aleutian rock ptarmigan became isolated prior to
   the most recent Pleistocene glaciation event (late Wisconsin Stade) and
   that current patterns of genetic variation reflect the postglacial
   redistribution of divergent lineages and subsequent limited gene flow
   In addition, genetic divergence among lineages was concordant with the
   distribution of plumage types among subspecies. The patterns of genetic
   variation described here for rock ptarmigan provide evidence for the

Abstract = {{Long-distance seed dispersal influences many key aspects of the biology
   of plants, including spread of invasive species, metapopulation
   dynamics, and diversity and dynamics in plant communities. However,
   because long-distance seed dispersal is inherently hard to measure,
   there are few data sets that characterize the tails of seed dispersal
   curves. This paper is structured around two lines of argument. First,
   we argue that long-distance seed dispersal is of critical importance
   and, hence, that we must collect better data from the tails of seed
   dispersal curves. To make the case for the importance of long-distance
   seed dispersal, we review existing data and models of long-distance
   seed dispersal, focusing on situations in which seeds that travel long
   distances have a critical impact (colonization of islands, Holocene
   migrations, response to global change, metapopulation biology). Second,
   we argue that genetic methods provide a broadly applicable way to
   monitor long-distance seed dispersal; to place this argument in
   context, we review genetic estimates of plant migration rates. At
   present, several promising genetic approaches for estimating
   long-distance seed dispersal are under active development, including
   assignment methods, likelihood methods, genealogical methods, and
   genealogical/demographic methods. We close the paper by discussing
   important but as yet largely unexplored areas for future research.}},

   to the branch lengths of the reconstructed genealogy. With infinite
   amounts of data, ML models using SNP data are expected to produce

   SNPs defined as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under

Abstract = {{The collapse of various stock complexes of cod (Gadus morhua) in the
   northwest Atlantic has prompted a clarification of relationships among
   stock components. Here we examine the genetic composition of >2300 cod
   collected during 1994-1997 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its
   approaches to determine whether: (1) stock components can be
   genetically identified; (2) population structure is temporally stable;
   (3) components are always separated and, if not, where and when are
   they mixed; and (4) component contributions to mixtures can be
   estimated. We use polymorphism at six microsatellite DNA loci from cod
   collected on or near their spring and summer spawning grounds to
   examine structure and then employ maximum likelihood analyses to
   estimate contributions of each component to mixtures overwintering near
   the entrance to the Gulf. Estimates of genetic structure (F-ST and
   R-ST) reveal significant differences among cod populations during
   stock-separated periods, and the structure appears to be temporally
   stable. Multidimensional scaling analysis of estimates of genetic
   distance (D-A) suggest that the structure results from differences
   among cod collected within the Gulf of St. Lawrence and those collected
   near the entrance to the Gulf on either side of the Laurentian Channel
   in the Cabot Strait, as well as among cod collected south of
   Newfoundland along the north side of the Channel. Weak genetic
   heterogeneity among seven regional mixed-stock collections during the
   overwintering period suggests that cod aggregations characteristically
   found in the overwintering region represent population mixtures that
   differ in the proportion of cod contributed to them by the various
   stock components, Maximum likelihood estimates indicate no significant
   temporal changes in component contributions to the mixed-stock samples
   between 1996 and 1997 when all of the winter mixed-stock samples were
   pooled. The combined contribution of cod from the southern and northern
   Gulf of St. Lawrence to the mixed-stock samples ranged between 46\% and
   71\% (expected 64\%), More precise estimates of contributions from
   these two regions are precluded by the weak genetic differentiation
   detected in our samples. The contribution by cod from the Cape Breton
   Island region was small and estimated at 3\%. Contributions by cod from
   the eastern Scotian Shelf, southwest Newfoundland and south-central
   Newfoundland were in the range of 13-14\%, 4\%, and 8\%, respectively.
   Contributions by inshore cod from Placentia and Fortune Bays in south
   Newfoundland were small to negligible (similar to 3\% each). The
   results indicate that future management could be designed around the
   spatial and temporal scale of the stock structure identified during the
   stock-separated period and around the spatially varying contributions

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of population differentiation in highly vagile species such
   as seabirds are poorly understood. Previous studies of marbled
   murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus; Charadriiformes: Alcidae) found
   significant population genetic structure, but could not determine
   whether this structure is due to historical vicariance (e.g., due to
   Pleistocene glaciers), isolation by distance, drift or selection in
   peripheral populations, or nesting habitat selection. To discriminate
   among these possibilities, we analyzed sequence variation in nine
   nuclear introns from 120 marbled murrelets sampled from British
   Columbia to the western Aleutian Islands. Mismatch distributions
   indicated that murrelets underwent at least one population expansion
   during the Pleistocene and probably are not in genetic equilibrium.
   Maximum-likelihood analysis of allele frequencies suggested that
   murrelets from ``mainland{''} sites (from the Alaskan Peninsula east)
   are genetically different from those in the Aleutians and that these
   two lineages diverged prior to the last glaciation. Analyses of
   molecular variance, as well as estimates of gene flow derived using
   coalescent theory, indicate that population genetic structure is best
   explained by peripheral isolation of murrelets in the Aleutian Islands,
   rather than by selection associated with different nesting habitats. No
   isolation-by-distance effects could be detected. Our results are
   consistent with a rapid expansion of murrelets from a single refugium
   during the early-mid Pleistocene, subsequent isolation and divergence
   in two or more refugia during the final Pleistocene glacial advance,
   and secondary contact following retreat of the ice sheets. Population
   genetic structure now appears to be maintained by distance effects
   combined with small populations and a highly fragmented habitat in the

Abstract = {{A special stochastic process, called the coalescent, is of fundamental
   interest in population genetics. For a large class of population models
   this process is the appropriate tool to analyse the ancestral structure
   of a sample of n individuals or genes, if the total number of
   individuals in the population is sufficiently large. A corresponding
   convergence theorem was first proved by Kingman in 1982 for the
   Wright-Fisher model and the Moran model. Generalizations to a large
   class of exchangeable population models and to models with overlying
   mutation processes followed shortly later. One speaks of the
   ``robustness{''} of the coalescent, as this process appears in many
   models as the total population size tends to infinity. This publication
   can be considered as an introduction to the theory of the coalescent as
   well as a review of the most important ``
   convergence-to-the-coalescent-theorems{''}. Convergence theorems are
   not only presented for the classical exchangeable haploid case but also
   for larger classes of population models, for example for diploid,
   two-sex or non-exchangeable models. A review-like summary of further
   examples and applications of convergence to the coalescent is given
   including the most important biological forces like mutation,
   recombination and selection. The general coalescent process allows for
   simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lines. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations which are
   constructed as perfect phylogenies from the pattern of mutations in a
   sample of DNA sequences and presents a new recursion for the
   probability distribution of such gene trees. The underlying
   evolutionary model is the coalescent process in a subdivided
   population. The infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed.
   Ancestral inference questions that are discussed are maximum likelihood
   estimation of migration and mutation rates; detection of population
   growth by likelihood techniques; determining the distribution of the
   time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample of sequences;
   determining the distribution of the age of the mutations on the gene
   tree; determining in which subpopulation the most recent common
   ancestor of all the sequences was; determining subpopulation ancestors,
   where they were, and times to them; and determining in which
   subpopulations mutations occurred. A computational technique of
   Griffiths and Tavare used is a computer intensive Markov chain
   simulation, which simulates gene trees conditional on their topology
   implied by the mutation pattern in the sample of DNA sequences. The
   software GENETREE, which implements these ancestral inference
   techniques, is available. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a Monte Carlo-based likelihood method for estimating
   migration rates and population divergence times from data at unlinked
   loci at which mutation rates are sufficiently low that, in the recent
   past, the effects of mutation can be ignored. The method is applicable
   to restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sampled from a subdivided population.
   The method produces joint maximum-likelihood estimates of the migration
   rate and the time of population divergence, both scaled by population
   size, and provides a framework in which to test either for no ongoing
   gene flow or for population divergence in the distant past. We show the
   method performs well and provides reasonably accurate estimates of
   parameters even when the assumptions under which those estimates are
   obtained are not completely satisfied. Furthermore, we show that,
   provided that the number of polymorphic loci is sufficiently large,
   there is some power to distinguish between ongoing gene how and
   historical association as causes of genetic similarity between pairs of
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The grey wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) are highly mobile
   carnivores that disperse over great distances in search of territories
   and mates. Previous genetic studies have shown little geographical
   structure in either species. However, population genetic structure is
   also influenced by past isolation events and population fluctuations
   during glacial periods. In this study, control region sequence data
   from a worldwide sample of grey wolves and a more limited sample of
   coyotes were analysed. The results suggest that fluctuating population
   sizes during the late Pleistocene have left a genetic signature on
   levels of variation in both species. Genealogical measures of
   nucleotide diversity suggest that historical population sizes were much
   larger in both species and grey wolves were more numerous than coyotes.
   Currently, about 300 000 wolves and 7 million coyotes exist. In grey
   wolves, genetic diversity is greater than that predicted from census
   population size, reflecting recent historical population declines. By
   contrast, nucleotide diversity in coyotes is smaller than that
   predicted by census population size, reflecting a recent population
   expansion following the extirpation of wolves from much of North
   America. Both species show little partitioning of haplotypes on
   continental or regional scales. However, a statistical parsimony
   analysis indicates local genetic structure that suggests recent
   restricted gene now.}},

Abstract = {{Some general likelihood and Bayesian methods for analyzing single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are presented. First, an efficient
   method for estimating demographic parameters from SNPs in linkage
   equilibrium is derived. The method is applied in the estimation of
   growth rates of a human population based on 37 SNP loci. It is
   demonstrated how ascertainment biases, due to biased sampling of loci,
   can be avoided, at least in some cases, by appropriate conditioning:
   when calculating the likelihood function. Second, a Markov chain Monte
   Carl (MCMC) method for analyzing linked SNPs is del eloped. This method
   call be used for Bayesian and likelihood inference on linked SNPs. The
   utility of the method is illustrated by estimating recombination rates
   in a human data set containing 17 SNPs and 60 individuals. Both methods
   are based on assumptions of low mutation rates.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the performance of Nm estimates based on F-ST and R-ST
   obtained from microsatellite data using simulations of the stepwise
   mutation model with range constraints in allele size classes. The
   results of the simulations suggest that the use of microsatellite loci
   can lead to serious overestimations of Nm, particularly when population
   sizes are large (N > 5000) and range constraints are high (K < 20). The
   simulations also indicate that, when population sizes are small (N less
   than or equal to 500) and migration rates are moderate (Nm approximate
   to 2), violations to the assumption used to derive the Nm estimators
   lead to biased results. Under ideal conditions, i.e. large sample sizes
   (n(s) greater than or equal to 50) and many loci (n(l) greater than or
   equal to 20), R-ST performs better than Fs, for most of the parameter
   space. However, F-ST-based estimates are always better than R-ST when
   sample sizes are moderate or small (n(s) less than or equal to 10) and
   the number of loci scored is low (n(l) < 20). These are the conditions
   under which many real investigations are carried out and therefore we
   conclude that in many cases the most conservative approach is to use
   F-ST.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of five human
   Y-chromosome microsatellite polymorphisms based on samples from five
   diverse populations. Our analysis provides strong evidence for
   mutational bias favoring increase in length at all loci. Estimates of

   samples, one African and one European, suggest that the African
   population is older but smaller and that the English East Anglian
   population has undergone significant expansion, being larger but
   younger, We conclude that Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of
   microsatellite haplotypes can uncover information not apparent when the
   microsatellites are considered independently. Incorporation of
   population size as a variable should allow us to estimate the timing
