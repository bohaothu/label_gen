     Abstract: Over the years, automated vehicles have evolved from reliable 
   yet rigidly constrained AGV to the fairly flexible ones of the HelpMate 
   generation. If many problems related to the autonomous navigation of
   such vehicles have found solutions that appear to be adequate to many 
   practical situations, yet their capacity of interacting with the users 
   and the environment is still limited. In the present paper, the reserch 
   work done at IRST in the framework of the Experimental Platform of MAIA 
   is presented. In particular, a transport mission scenario (MAIA'94) is 
   considered, in which autonomous navigation, speech recognition and 
   planning skills represents three aspects of one and the same
   ability that the system can exhibit of establishg interactions with 
   the external world in an reliable and autonomous fashion. }

     Abstract: In this paper we present a system for intelligent robot 
     navigation. Its main feature is the ability to integrate goal directed 
     planning with information acquisition from the external world, and 
     with reaction to failure. This ability is obtained by means of a 
     two-layered architecture: the higher (strategical) level controls 
     the activation of the modules of the lower (navigation) level, which 
     can perform, in different ways, basic tasks such as path planning, 
     activation of navigation and processing of information acquired from 
     the external environment. By programming the strategical level with 
     the suitable strategies, the system can control navigation with 
     sophisticated modalities.}

Many propositions in spatial and qualitative reasoning can be 
modelled as regions in phase or configuration spaces. Deciding 
the consistency of k propositions then amounts to deciding 
the question of whether there exists a point which simultaneously 
falls into all k corresponding regions. I call this feasibility of 
the set of propositions. In this paper, I present a method for 
deciding consistency and feasibility for convex regions using only 
topological inference. It uses Helly's theorem to decide consistency 
of any set of k propositions based on information about consistency 
of small subsets. Using methods of algebraic topology, I show a
sufficient method to compute a minimal skeleton of feasible places 
which accurately models the connectivity between feasible environments. 
The method has been implemented. I show how to formulate 
and solve the piano-movers problem, an important problem in 
spatial reasoning, using the framework. (faltings@lia.di.epfl.ch)}

  review = {
 By constructing "diagrams" and analyzing these with a visualization
 subsystem, a high-level reasoner can determine results of actions.
 The HLR is enabled to ask the visualizer a powerful set of queries
 such as the results of a collision, and it uses this to determine
 whether the mental diagram should be redrawn. The visualizer 
 simulates a retina with non-uniform radial resolution and active 
 focusing and uses this simulated information to detect similar 
 objects and symmetries. The task solved by the WHISPER system is 
 to determine in a given blocks world context, the blocks that 
 are unstable, and by (mentally or on the retina) moving one 
 unstable block at a time, arrive at the final configuration.

abstract ={
The phenomenon of movement arises whenever the same object occupies different
positions in space at different times. Therefore a theory of movement must
contain theories of time, space, objects, and position. We provide a theoretical
basis for describing movement events in terms of the conditions for their
occurence, which refer to the holding or not holding of various positional fluents at
different times. For this we need to bring together a formal model of time with a
formal model of space. By attending closely to the constraints imposed by
continuity on the temporal behaviour of different fluents we develop a theory of
dominance, which enables us to generate ab initio the perturbation relation on the
full set of positional relations. (antony@dcs.exeter.ac.uk)}

     Abstract:
Many real world applications require systems with both reasoning and sensing/acting capabilities. However, most often, these systems do not work properly, i.e. they fail to execute actions and rarely perceive the external world correctly. No action, even if apparently simple, is guaranteed to succeed and, therefore, no planning can be "sound" (with respect to the real world) without taking into account failure. In this paper, we present a theory of planning that provides:
(1) a language that allows us to express failure; 
(2) a declarative formal semantics for this language; 
(3) a logic for reasoning about (possibly failing) plans.}

	Abstract:
   The paper describes a case study that explores the idea of building
   a planner with a neat semantics of the plans it produces, by
   choosing some action formalism that is "ideal" for the planning
   application and building the planner accordingly.  In general---and
   particularly so for the action formalism used in this study, which
   is quite expressive---this strategy is unlikely to yield fast and
   efficient planners if the formalism is used naively.  Therefore, we
   adopt the idea that the planner approximates the theoretically
   ideal plans, where the approximation gets closer, the more run time
   the planner is allowed. As the particular formalism underlying our
   study allows a significant degree of uncertainty to be modeled and
   copes with the ramification problem, we end up in a planner that is
   functionally comparable to modern anytime uncertainty planners, yet
   is based on a neat formal semantics.

   Machine learning can offer an increase in the flexibility and
   applicability of robotics at several levels of control. In this
   paper, we characterize two symbolic learning tasks in the field of
   robotics. We outline an approach for learning features from sensory

   illustrate our approach with first experiments in the field of

	Abstract:
   We address the problem of guiding a robot in such a way, that it
   can decide, based on perceived sensor data, which future actions to
   choose, in order to reach a goal. In order to realize this
   guidance, the robot has access to a (probabilistic) automaton (PA),
   whose final states represent concepts, which have to be recognized
   in order to verify, that a goal has been achieved. The contribution
   of this work is to learn these PA's from classified sensor data of
  robot traces through known environments. Within this framework, we
   account for the uncertainties arising from ambiguous perceptions.
   We introduce a knowledge structure, called prefix tree , in which
   the sample data, represented as cases, is organized.  The prefix
   tree is used to derive and estimate the parameters of
   deterministic, as well as probabilistic automata models, which
   reflect the inherent knowledge, implicit in the data, and which are
   used for recognition in a restricted first-order logic framework.}

robot navigation task through trial-and-error. A mobile robot, equipped 
with visual, ultrasonic and laser sensors, learns to servo to a designated 
target object. In less than ten minutes of operation time, the robot is able 
to navigate to a marked target object in an office environment. The central learning mechanism is the explanation-based neural network learning algorithm
(EBNN). EBNN initially learns function purely inductively using neural 
network representations. With increasing experience, EBNN employs domain 
knowledge to explain and to analyze training data in order to generalize in 
a more knowledgeable way. Here EBNN is applied in the context of reinforcement learning, which allows the robot to learn control using dynamic programming.}

   abstract = {
Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their 
environments. Past research on mobile robot navigation has produced two 
major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. 
While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity 
often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale 
indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used 
much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are 
most difficult to learn in large-scale environments. This paper describes 
an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. 
Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and Bayesian analysis. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, 
by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both 
paradigms---grid-based and topological---, the approach presented here 
gains the best of both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. 
The paper gives results for autonomously operating a mobile robot 
equipped with sonar sensors in populated multi-room environments. }

     Abstract: We are interested in the development of planners that work 
  in real-world and large-scale applications. Most of these applications 
  require systems that perform and combine the usual planning tasks, e.g. 
  plan formation, plan execution, monitoring and recovering from failure, 
  in a problem dependent way. Furthermore, in most cases, these systems 
  must integrate the various different planning techniques proposed in 
  the literature, e.g. planning ahead, deferred and reactive planning. 
  In this paper we present a system (called MRG) that eases all these 
  difficulties by representing explicitly all the planning tasks and
  by combining them using a small set of powerful control structures.
  At the moment, we are experimenting with MRG in a complex large-scale 
  application that is briefly described in this paper.}
