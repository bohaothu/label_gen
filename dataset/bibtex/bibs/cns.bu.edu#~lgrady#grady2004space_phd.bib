  abstract =     {Space-variant sampling of visual input is ubiquitous
                  in the higher vertebrate brain, because a large
                  input space may be processed with high peak
                  precision without requiring an unacceptably large
                  brain mass. Space-variant sampling has been studied
                  in computer vision for decades. A major obstacle to
                  exploiting this architecture in machines, and
                  understanding its role in biology, is the lack of
                  algorithms that generalize beyond regular samplings.
                  Most image processing algorithms implicitly assume a
                  Cartesian grid underlying the sensor. This thesis
                  generalizes image processing to a sensor
                  architecture described by an arbitrary graph. This
                  data structure separates the sensor topology,
                  expressed by the graph edge structure, from its
                  geometry, represented by coordinates of the vertex
                  set. The combinatorial Laplacian of the sensor graph
                  is a key operator underlying a series of novel image
                  processing algorithms. First, a new graph
                  partitioning algorithm for segmentation is presented
                  that heuristically minimizes the ratio of the
                  perimeter of the partition border and the area of
                  the partitions, under a suitable definition of
                  graph-theoretic area. This approach produces high
                  quality image segmentations. Interpolation of
                  missing data on graphs is developed, using a
                  combinatorial version of the Dirichlet Problem,
                  i.e., minimizing the average gradients of the
                  interpolated values while maintaining fixed boundary
                  conditions. This leads to the solution of the
                  Laplace Equation, which represents the steady-state
                  of the diffusion process for stated boundary
                  conditions. Results compare favorably to both
                  isotropic and anisotropic diffusion for filling-in
                  of missing data. A pyramid graph is defined by
                  connecting vertical and horizontal levels of the
                  Laplacian pyramid data structure. The isoperimetric
                  algorithm, run on the graph pyramid, yields an
                  improved segmentation at little extra computational
                  cost. Finally, a small-world graph topology is
                  employed by randomly introducing a few new edges to
                  the image graph. This results in a large speed-up in
                  computation time, with identical final results. The
                  algorithms developed in this thesis do not require
                  that the data associated with the graph are embedded
                  in two-dimensions or even have a metric structure.
                  Therefore, this approach to generalized image
                  processing may find wider application in other areas
                  of discrete data processing.},
