  abstract = {In today's workstation based environment, applications such as
  design databases, multimedia databases, and knowledge bases do not fit well
  into the relational data processing framework. The object-oriented data model
  has been proposed to model and process such complex databases. Due to the
  nature of the supported applications, object-oriented database systems need
  efficient mechanisms for the retrieval of complex objects and the navigation
  along the semantic links among objects. Object clustering and buffering have
  been suggested as efficient mechanisms for the retrieval of complex objects.
  However, to improve the efficiency of the aforementioned operations, one has
  to look at the recent advances in storage technology. This paper is an
  attempt to investigate the feasibility of using parallel disks for
  object-oriented databases. It analyzes the conceptual changes needed to map
  the clustering and buffering schemes proposed on the new underlying
  architecture. The simulation and performance evaluation of the proposed
  leveled-clustering and mapping schemes utilizing parallel I/O disks are
  presented and analyzed.}
