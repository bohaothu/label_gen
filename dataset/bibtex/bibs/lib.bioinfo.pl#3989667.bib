abstract={In two separate experiments, 25 and 42 adult working males participated in a visual-motor task modeled on a video game. The game was designed to permit measurement of strategy, risk taking, errors committed, and overall task performance. Predictions of complexity theory for task performance were supported. In the second experiment, participants were divided into four subgroups on the basis of Type A versus Type B coronary-prone behavior (measured on the structured interview) and on the basis of unidimensional versus multidimensional responding (measured by a complexity interview with stems of the sentence completion test). Type A coronary-prone behavior did not contribute to differences in visual-motor performance. More multidimensional persons exceeded their unidimensional counterparts, especially in the application of strategy. The extension of complexity theory approaches to simpler tasks is discussed. It is noted that the frequently voiced assumptions of Type A individuals-that their behavior style tends to lead to higher performance levels-is not supported.}
