	filter several problems can arise. One difficulty is to obtain error
	models for the sensors and for the state transitions. The other difficulty
	is to find an adequate compromise between the accuracy of the belief
	probability distribution and the computational costs that are needed
	to update it. In this paper we show how a short-term memory of perceptions
	and actions can be used to calculate the state. In contrast to the
	Bayesian filter, this method does not need an internal representation
	of the state which is updated by the sensor and motion information.
	It is shown that this is especially useful when information of sparse
	sensors (sensors with non-unique measurements with respect of the
	state) has to be integrated.},

Die mobile Robotik stellt ein sehr junges und komplexes Forschungsfelder unserer Zeit dar. Innerhalb der letzten Jahrzehnte wurde es Robotern möglich, sich innerhalb ihrer Umgebung zu bewegen, zu navigieren und mit ihrer Umwelt zu interagieren. Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass die Welt von Unsicherheit geprägt ist und ein Roboter immer nur partielle Information über sie erhalten kann, wurden probabilistische Navigationsverfahren entwickelt, mit denen sich Roboter lokalisieren und Objekte ihrer Umgebung modellieren können. Weiterhin wurden in letzter Zeit Verfahren untersucht, die die kooperative Exploration der Umgebung durch eine Gruppe von Robotern zum Ziel haben. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein neuartiges Konzept, welches sich Perzeptrelationen für die kooperative Umweltmodellierung zu Nutze macht, vorgestellt und evaluiert. Einen zweiten Beitrag der Arbeit stellen constraintbasierte Lokalisierungstechniken dar, die es einem oder mehreren Robotern auf effiziente Art und Weise ermöglichen, sich zu lokalisieren und ihre Umwelt zu modellieren.

Mobile autonomous robotics is a very young and complex field of research. Only in recent decades have robots become able to explore, to move, navigate and to interact with their environment. Since the world is uncertain and since robots can only gain partial information about it, probabilistic navigation algorithms have become very popular whenever a robot has to localize itself or surrounding objects. Furthermore, cooperative exploration and localization approaches have become very relevant lately, as robots begin to act not just alone but in groups. Within this thesis a new approach using the concept of spatial percept-relations for cooperative environment modeling is presented and evaluated. As a second contribution, constraint based localization techniques will be introduced for having a robot or a group of robots efficiently localized and to model their environment.
