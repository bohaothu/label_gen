ABSTRACT::

Ground based high resolution coronographic images of the inner M1-67
nebula
<NOBR>(<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/simeq.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=8 ALT="~"> 40" &times; 60")</NOBR> around the Wolf Rayet WR124 have been obtained with the
Johns Hopkins Adaptive Optic Coronograph at the Swope 40" telescope,
Las Campanas, in the light of H<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/alpha.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=10 ALT="alpha"> + [NII]. 
The inner M1-67 nebula appears very clumpy and remarkably axisymmetric. In addition, we present new high signal-to-noise long
slit spectroscopic data, with full spatial coverage of the nebula
<NOBR>(<IMG SRC="/science/preprints/Icons/simeq.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=8 ALT="~"> 90" &times; 75")</NOBR>, which have been used to derive its radial velocity map
(from the [NII] 6583 &Aring; line profile). The radial velocity data
reveal the presence of two different motions in the environment of
WR124: a spherical hollow shell, 46" in radius expanding with a 
velocity of 46&nbsp;km&nbsp;s<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>-1</SUP></FONT>, and a newly
discovered bipolar outflow, with a velocity of 88&nbsp;km&nbsp;s<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>-1</SUP></FONT>.
Their dynamical ages are estimated to be 
2&nbsp;&times&nbsp;10<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>&nbsp;yrs
and 1.2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>&nbsp;yrs
respectively, and their overall N enriched composition seem to
indicate that they formed during the post-main sequence evolution
of WR124. This scenario is consistent with two subsequent outbursts,
possibly occured during a previous LBV phase.
