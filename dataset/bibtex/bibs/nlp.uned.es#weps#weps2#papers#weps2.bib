  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;There is a wide set of evaluation metrics available
	to compare the quality of text clustering algorithms. In this article,
	we define a few intuitive formal constraints on such metrics which
	shed light on which aspects of the quality of a clustering are captured
	by different metric families. These formal constraints are validated
	in an experiment involving human assessments, and compared with other
	constraints proposed in the literature. Our analysis of a wide range
	of metrics shows that only BCubed satisfies all formal constraints.
	We also extend the analysis to the problem of overlapping clustering,
	where items can simultaneously belong to more than one cluster. As
	Bcubed cannot be directly applied to this task, we propose a modified
	version of Bcubed that avoids the problems found with other metrics.},

  booktitle = {Proc. of Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference},

  month = {July 20--24},
  abstract = {Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types
	to the web search engines today. However, when a person name is queried,
	the returned webpages often contain documents related to several
	distinct namesakes who have the queried name. The task of disambiguating
	and finding the webpages related to the specific person of inter
	est is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches
	have been developed recently that attempt to automate this disambiguation
	process. Nevertheless, the disambiguation quality of these techniques
	leaves a major room for improvement. This paper presents a new server-side
	WePS approach. It is based on collecting co-occurrence information
	from the Web and thus it uses the Web as an external data source.
	A skyline-based classification technique is developed for classifying
	the collected co-occurrence information in order to make clustering
	decisions. The clustering technique is specifically designed to (a)
	handle the dominance that exists in data and (b) to adapt to a given
	clustering quality measure. These properties allow the framework
	to get a major advantage in terms of result quality over all the
	latest WePS techniques we are aware of, including all the 18 methods
	covered in the recent WePS competition.},
