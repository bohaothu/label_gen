  ANNOTE = { We present a novel technique for
		  effectively calibrating a binocular stereo
		  rig using the information from both scenes
		  and classical calibration objects. The
		  calibration provided by the classical
		  methods is only valid for the space near
		  the position of the calibration object.
		  Our technique tries to make the best use
		  of the rigidity of the geometry between
		  two cameras. The idea is to first estimate
		  precisely the epipolar geometry which is
		  valid for a wide range in space from all
		  available matches, extracted from both the
		  environment and the calibration objects.
		  This allows us to conduct an accurate
		  projective reconstruction. Using the
		  \emph{a priori} knowledge of the
		  calibration object, we are finally able to
		  calibrate the stereo rig in a Euclidean
		  space. The proposed technique has been
		  tested with a number of real images, and
		  significant improvement has been observed.

  ANNOTE = {Motion analysis in computer vision is a
		  well-studied problem with numerous
		  applications. In particular, the tasks of
		  optical flow estimation and tracking are
		  of increasing interest. In this paper, we
		  propose a level set approach to address
		  both aspects of motion analysis. Our
		  approach relies on the propagation of
		  smooth interfaces to perform tracking
		  while using an incremental estimation of
		  the motion models. Implicit
		  representations are used to represent
		  moving objects, and capture their motion
		  parameters. Information from different
		  sources like a boundary attraction term, a
		  background subtraction component and a
		  visual consistency constraint are
		  considered. The Euler–Lagrange equations
		  within a gradient descent method lead to a
		  flow that deforms a set of initial curve
		  towards the object boundaries as well an
		  incremental robust estimator of their
		  apparent motion. Partial extension of the
		  proposed framework to address dense motion
		  estimation and the case of moving observer
		  is also presented. Promising results
		  demonstrate the performance of the
		  method.}
