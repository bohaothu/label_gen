kinetics of the muon catalysed fusion (MCF) in solid hydrogen-deuterium mixtures (H/D) 
at a temperature of 3 K. The experiment E742 was carried out on a TRIUMF meson facility 
in Canada. Four exposures were performed at different deuterium concentrations in the 
H/D mixture: c$_d$ = 0.0005, 0.02, 0.15 and 0.75. A simultaneous analysis of the 
measured time distributions of the 5.5 MeV $\gamma$-quanta and the 5.3 MeV conversion 
muons obtained from nuclear fusion in the $pd\mu$ molecule allowed to extract the values 
of MCF chain parameters in the H/D mixture: the fusion partial rates for different 
nuclear spin states of the $pd\mu$ molecule, and the $pd\mu$ molecule formation rate. 
The experimental data fitting procedure was conducted in two ways: using solely the 
analytical formulae describing the kinetics of the MCF processes in the H/D mixture, 
and the detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the entire experiment. The results obtained 
by these two methods are consistent with each other and confirm the existence of the 
Wolfenstein-Gerstein effect.

of the reactions between light nuclei ($pd,\ dd,\ d^3\mathrm{He}$, and

in nuclear physics. Research of the given processes in the ultralow energy
region is rather problematic since intesity of the beams of the accelerated
particles produced by classical accelerators are extremely low 
($ 10^{12} - 10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$), and cross sections of these nuclear
reactions in the astrophysical energy region are extremely small 
($10^{-39} - 10^{-33}$ cm$^2$).
An impetus to the current intensive study of indicated reactions has become
the possibility of for these purposes using pulsed high-current plasma
accelerators. Plasma accelerators with the liner plasma formation in the
direct and inverse Z-pinch configuration and with closed Hall current pulse
ion source allowed to receive the quantitative information on the
astrophysical S-factors and effective cross sections of the $pd$ and $dd$
reactions ($pd\rightarrow ^4\mathrm{He}+\gamma;\ dd\rightarrow
^3\mathrm{He}+n$) in the energy region 2 - 12 keV.
The results obtained indicate that, on the one hand, the technique proposed
by us is worthy and can be effectively used to study nuclear reactions in the
astrophysical energy region and, on the other hand, can be considered as a
basis of the nuclear-physics diagnostics of plasma processes.

                 study of the scattering of low-energy p$\mu$ atoms in
                 solid hydrogen cooled to 3 K. Strong effects resulting
                 from the solid state interactions have been observed in
                 the TRIUMF experiment E742 where muons were stopped in
                 thin frozen layers of hydrogen. The resulting emission
                 of low-energy p $\mu$ atoms from the hydrogen layer into
                 the adjacent vacuum was much higher than that predicted
                 by calculations which ignored the solid nature of the
                 hydrogen. New differential scattering cross sections
                 have been calculated for the collisions of p$\mu$ atoms

                 crystalline nature. Analysis of the experimental data
                 performed using such cross sections shows the important
                 role of the coherent scattering in p$\mu$ atom diffusion.
                 For p$\mu$ energies lower than the Bragg cutoff limit (

                 vanishes which makes the total scattering cross section
                 fall by several orders of magnitude, and thus the
                 hydrogen target becomes transparent allowing the

versus its hydrogea content were calculated. Next, the stationary neutron
fields were considered using some different theoretical approaches. Strong

determinations, especially with applying the epithermal-neutron gauges,
since the appreciable matrix effects can be expected in the case of thermal
neutron detection. The interferring influence of the borehole was considered

high intensity, radially converging deuteron beams, generated during
implosion of liner plasma. A two-jet liner made of 17\%D$_2$ + 83\%N$_2$

neutrons were detected by time-of-flight scintillator spectrometers and

The result demonstrates that liner implosion technique can be used in the
investigations of nuclear reactions between light nuclei at infra low

this project will make possible a first determination of the characteristics

This problem cannot be resolved, practically, with the aid of classical
accelerators, since theoretical estimations show the cross sections of the
reactions investigated to be within the range from $10^{-43}$ to $10^{-32}$
cm$^2$ for the energies indicated. The products of the nuclear reactions,
i.e. $\gamma$-quanta, charged particles and neutrons, are to be detected by
detectors based on NaI(Tl) crystals, by CR-39 solid-state detectors, and by
plastic scintillation detectors involving TOF technique, respectively. The
experimental program can be implemented at the high-current accelerators
SNOP-111 and GIT-8 at the RAS IHCE (Tomsk, Russia)."

of gamma-gamma probes, the maximum of the calibration curve is observed and
for this reason a simple single-counter probe cannot be used. It has been
shown that using a two-counter probe withe the two counters placed in such a
way that for the one nearer to the isotope source the slope of the
calibration curve is positive and for that fahrter off - negative, a good
sensitivity of measurement can be achieved.
