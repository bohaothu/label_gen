This paper notes that the commonly used FDN with an N?N orthogonal feedback matrix is isomorphic to a normalized digital waveguide network consisting of one scattering junction joining N reflectively terminated branches. Generalizations of FDNs and DWNs are discussed. The general case of a lossless FDN feedback matrix is shown to be any matrix having unit-modulus eigenvalues and linearly independent eigenvectors. A special class of FDNs using circulant matrices is proposed. These structures can be efficiently implemented and allow control of the time and frequency behavior. Applications of circulant feedback delay networks in audio signal processing are discussed",

	ABSTRACT = "We present a probabilistic generative model for timing deviations in expressive music performance. The structure of the proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model. The switch variables correspond to discrete note locations as in a musical score. The continuous hidden variables denote the tempo. We formulate two well known music recognition problems, namely tempo tracking and automatic transcription (rhythm quantization) as filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) state estimation tasks. Exact computation of posterior features such as the MAP state is intractable in this model class, so we introduce Monte Carlo methods for integration and optimization. We compare Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (such as Gibbs sampling, simulated annealing and iterative improvement) and sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters). Our simulation results suggest better results with sequential methods. The methods can be applied in both online and batch scenarios such as tempo tracking and transcription and are thus potentially useful in a number of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment, score typesetting and music information retrieval."

Further, the authors attempt to identify similarities and dissimilarities between its use in technical and musical settings.

The first is that music making can be viewed as a three-level hierarchy of control and feedback interactions. The top level is the composer or conductor interacting through hand and auditory signals with the musician's conscious (higher brain level) activity. The mid level is internal to the musician, the higher brain centers interacting with the musician's subconscious neuromuscular activity. The lowest level is the musician's neuromuscular system interacting with the musical instrument. At each level there are constraints that are discussed in the paper. A second perspective refers to a phenomenon of music listening, its capability to engender a sense of virtual reality (or virtual presence) in much the same way that observing a computer-generated visual scene can make an observer feel present in a place other than where he or she is physically located.",

The main concept of supervisory control is illustrated with engineering applications, particularly in humanmachine(-computer) interaction, as well as applied to music performance. Several activities in the performing arts and in industrial engineering are compared. Composition, analysis, and performance are discussed in more detail, in relation to the scientifically embedded concert of the workshop and its four works from three continents, including computer music with live performance as well as Japanese aesthetics. Performance theory and performance tools are also mentioned. Sensorimotor, gestural, and cognitive control are outlined, briefly supplemented by visual and auditory supervision. Finally, sound design and musical information retrieval are also identified as aspects of human supervision and control.",

	ABSTRACT = "Music transcription refers to extraction of a human readable and interpretable description from a recording of a music performance. The final goal is to implement a program that can automatically infer a musical notation that lists the pitch levels of notes and corresponding score positions in any arbitrary acoustical input. However, in this full generality, music transcription stays yet as a very hard problem and is arguably ``AI-complete'', i.e. requires simulation of a human level intelligence. On the other hand, under some realistic assumptions, a practical engineering solution is possible by an interplay of scientific knowledge from cognitive science, musicology, musical acoustics and computational techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning and digital signal processing. In this context, the aim of this thesis is to integrate this vast amount of prior knowledge in a consistent and transparent computational framework and to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach in moving us closer to a practical solution to music transcription.\\ In this thesis, we approach music transcription as a statistical inference problem where given a signal, we search for a score that is consistent with the encoded music. In this context, we identify three subproblems: Rhythm Quantization, Tempo Tracking and Polyphonic Pitch Tracking. For each subproblem, we define a probabilistic generative model, that relates the observables (i.e. onsets or audio signal) with the underlying score. Conceptually, the transcription task is then to ``invert'' this generative model by using the Bayes Theorem and recover back the original score."
