  abstract = {Vessel enhancement and segmentation aim at (binary) per-pixel segmentation
	considering certain local features as probabilistic vessel indicators.
	We propose a new methodology to combine any local probability map
	with local directional vessel information. The resulting global vessel
	segmentation is represented as a set of discrete streamlines populating
	the vascular structures and providing additional connectivity and
	geometric shape information. The streamlines are computed by numerical
	integration of the directional vector field that is obtained from
	the eigenanalysis of the local Hessian indicating the local vessel
	direction. The streamline representation allows for sophisticated
	post-processing techniques using the additional information to refine
	the segmentation result with respect to the requirements of the particular
	application such as image registration. We propose different post-processing
	techniques for hierarchical segmentation, centerline extraction,
	and catheter removal to be used for X-ray angiograms. We further
	demonstrate how the global approach is able to significantly improve
	the segmentation compared to conventional local Hessian-based approaches.},
