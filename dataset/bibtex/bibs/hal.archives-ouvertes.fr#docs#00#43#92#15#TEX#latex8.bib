	models to segment and label sequence data. Conditional random fields
	offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic

	assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also
	avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs)

@book{fellbaum98wordnet,
	Abstract = {WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most
	important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics,
	text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by
	current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical
	memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized
	into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept.
	Different relations link the synonym sets. <P>The purpose of this
	volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and
	the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey
	of representative applications, including word sense identification,
	information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical
	chains. <P>Contributors: Reem Al-Halimi, Robert C. Berwick, J. F.
