  abstract =	 {Research in distributed AI has dealt with the
                  interactions of agents' both cooperative and
                  self-interested. The Recursive Modeling Method (RMM)
                  is one method used for modeling rational
                  self-interested agents. It assumes that knowledge is
                  nested to a finite depth. An expansion of RMM using
                  a sigmoid function was proposed with the hope that
                  the solution concept of the new RMM would
                  approximate the Nash EP in cases where RMMS
                  knowledge approximated the common knowledge that is
                  assumed by game theory. In this paper, we present a
                  mathematical analysis of RMM with the sigmoid
                  function and prove that it indeed tries to converge
                  to the Nash EP. However, we also show how and why it
                  fails to do so for most cases. Using this analysis
                  we argue for abandoning the sigmoid function as an
                  implicit representation of uncertainty about the
                  depth of knowledge in favor of an explicit
                  representation of the uncertainty. We also suggest
                  other avenues of research that might give us other
                  more efficient solution concepts which would also take
                  into consideration the cost of computation and the
                  expected gains.},

                  other agents are important to consider when choosing
                  an action. Pruning away less important models allows
                  an agent to take its ``best'' action in a timely
                  manner, given its knowledge, computational
                  capabilities, and time constraints. We describe a
                  theoretical framework, based on {\em situations},
                  for talking about recursive agent models and the
                  strategies and expected strategies associated with
                  them. This framework allows us to rigorously define
                  the {\em gain} of continuing deliberation versus
                  taking action. The expected gain of computational
                  actions is used to guide the pruning of the nested
                  model structure. We have implemented our approach on
                  a canonical multi-agent problem, the pursuit task,

                  in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) composed of similar
                  learning agents. The problem is divided into the two
                  subproblems of deciding how much an agent should
                  think about what others think about what others
                  think\ldots{} and the problem raised by the fact
                  that if the other agents are learning and changing
                  their behavior, an agent's model of them might never
                  be accurate.  We start by presenting a framework
                  that can formally describe a MAS and the agents that
                  inhabit it, along with their behavior and a measure
                  of the correctness of this behavior. The framework
                  is used to develop an algorithm (LR-RMM) that tells
                  an agent when to stop thinking about other
                  agents. The algorithm is implemented and its results
                  verified. The framework is then extended to capture
                  the agents' learning abilities and the degree to
                  which they impact each others' behavior. This
                  extended framework (CLRI) is used to predict the
                  expected behavior of learning agents in MASs.
                  Theoretical predictions from this framework are
                  confirmed with experimental results from our
                  research and with experimental results from the
                  research literature.  Finally, a specific
                  market-based MAS is studied in detail. We confirm
                  results predicted by the CLRI framework and present
                  other findings specific to market-based MAS. These

                  and predict the behavior of multi-agent systems
                  (MASs) with learning agents. A difference equation
                  is used for calculating the progression of an
                  agent's error in its decision function, thereby
                  telling us how the agent is expected to fare in the
                  MAS. The equation relies on parameters which capture
                  the agent's learning abilities, such as its change
                  rate, learning rate and retention rate, as well as
                  relevant aspects of the MAS such as the impact that

                  distributed systems where an Intelligent Agent
                  handles the security monitoring at each host. The
                  agents are made responsible for alerting the system
                  administrators about an attempted intrusion or
                  misuse for a particular system. Recently, there has
                  been an increase in the number of reports of the
                  attacks, which are wide spread across the network
                  and affecting a chain of systems before they attack
                  the actual target system. To detect such attacks,
                  the amount of information associated within a single
                  isolated system is inadequate for an agent to
                  confirm an intrusion. Therefore, the need for a
                  framework that allows the agents to negotiate with
                  their co-agents to share information about an
                  intrusion, thereby aiding in effective handling of
                  Intrusion Detection is emphasized. Our design aims
                  at developing such a framework in the FIPA-OS
                  (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents ? Open
                  Source) environment, which provides most of the
                  source code for building agents on its platform. The
                  concept of mutual co-operation among agents has been
                  developed as a means of queries. These queries are
                  carried out by tasks associated with each agent. The
                  protocols to support these interactions by means of
                  queries are explained. The issues and requirements
                  involved in standardizing formats, interaction
                  protocols and architectures to co-manage intrusion

                  development of incentive-compatible exchange
                  mechanisms for recommendations in a multiagent
                  system. These mechanism will allow and motivate
                  agents to create an economy of ideas, where agents
                  trade recommendations between themselves. In this
                  paper we present a domain model and an
                  incentive-compatible protocol for information
                  exchange. Our model captures a subset of the
                  realities of recommendation exchanges in the
                  Internet. We provide an algorithm that selfish
                  agents can use for deciding whether to exchange
                  recommendations and with whom.  We analyze this
                  algorithm and show that, under certain common
                  circumstances, the agents' rational choice is to
                  exchange recommendations. Finally, we have
                  implemented our model and algorithm and tested the
                  performance of various populations. Our  results
                  show that both the social welfare and the individual
                  utility of the agents is increased by participating
                  in the exchange of recommendations.},

                  request for a particular service a process referred
                  to as matchmaking. The algorithms that have thus far
                  been proposed for matchmaking are based on
                  comparisons of the requested and offered inputs and

                  by taking into account the detailed process

                  accurate matchmaking. That is, we present an

                  systems are becoming more prevalent. These attacks
                  usually employ some form of automation and involve
                  the compromise of many systems across the Internet;
                  systems which are not necessarily owned by the same
                  company or individual. The information needed to
                  detect and neutralize these attacks is spread across
                  many machines. A system administrator who wishes to
                  detect and handle these distributed attacks must
                  constantly monitor his systems and communicate with
                  other administrators around the world---a
                  challenging task. In this paper we present our
                  design and implementation of a multi-agent system,
                  built using FIPA-OS, in which agents responsible for
                  different network realms communicate with each other
                  in order to determine if certain suspicious events
                  are actually part of a distributed attack, and to
                  warn each other about possible threats. We describe
                  the event types which, we have found, flag the
                  presence of suspicious activities and trigger the
                  agents into action. We explain the various
                  interaction protocols that we have implemented in
                  order to handle these suspicious events. We discuss
                  issues and requirements involved in standardizing
                  formats and architectures for the distributed
                  management of intrusion detection. Finally, we

                  some form of workflow management system. Workflow

                  degradation. We first formalize the service

                  hill-climbing, a global hill-climbing, and a
                  bidding-protocol algorithm for solving it. We
                  analyze the expected performance of these algorithms

                  the branching factor and the number of agents.

                  runtime is becoming increasingly important as the
                  era of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC)
                  emerges. With SOC selection and invocation of Web
                  service partners will occur in software at run-time,
                  rather than by software developers at design and
                  compile time. Unfortunately, the marketplace has yet
                  to yield a predominate applications programming
                  interface for the invocation of Web services. This
                  results in software that is deeply ingrained with
                  vendor-specific calls. This is problematic because
                  Web service technology is changing at a rapid
                  pace. In order to leverage the latest developments,
                  code often needs to be heavily refactored to account
                  for changing invocation interfaces. This paper
                  explores the mitigation of this problem through the
                  application of software design
                  patterns. Specifically, it details how a Web service
                  architectural pattern, based upon the composition of
                  software design patterns, provides for
                  implementations that insulate the application code

                  problems. Unfortunately, most of the winner
                  determination solutions that exists are
                  centralized. They require all agents to send their
                  bids to a centralized auctioneer who then determines
                  the winners. The PAUSE auction, in contrast, is an
                  increasing-price combinatorial auction in which the
                  problem of winner determination is naturally
                  distributed amongst the bidders. Furthermore, the
                  bidders' have an incentive to perform the required
                  computations. But, until now, no bidding algorithm
                  for the auction existed. We provide a bidding
                  algorithm for agents in a PAUSE auction, the
                  pausebid algorithm. It always returns the bid that
                  maximizes the bidder's utility. In effect, pausebid
                  is a the distributed counterpart to the existing
                  centralized winner determination algorithms, from
                  which we borrow several proven techniques. Our test
                  results show that a system where all agents use
                  pausebid finds the revenue-maximizing solution at
                  least 95\% of the time. Run time, as expected since
                  this is an NP-complete problem, remains exponential

                  unable to perform, or would perform with a lower
                  efficiency. The focus of our work is on real-world
                  application domains where we have systems inhabited
                  by rational, self-interested agents. We also assume
                  an environment without any trusted central manager
                  to resolve issues concerning multiple agents. For
                  such environments, we have to determine both an
                  optimal (utility-maximizing) coalition configuration
                  and a stable payoff configuration, concurrently and
                  in a distributed fashion. Solving each of these
                  problems is known to be computationally expensive,
                  and having to consider them together exacerbates the
                  problem further. In this paper, we present our
                  Progressive, Anytime, Convergent, and Time-efficient
                  (PACT) algorithm for coalition formation to address
                  the above concerns. We assess the stability of the
                  resulting coalition by using a new stability
                  concept, the relaxed core, which is a slight
                  variation on the core. We show experimentally that
                  our algorithm performs admirably in comparison to an
                  optimal solution, it typically produces solutions
                  that are relaxed-core-stable, and it scales well.},

                  are centralized. The PAUSE auction is one of a few
                  efforts to release the auctioneer from having to do
                  all the work (it might even be possible to get rid
                  of the auctioneer). It is an increasing price
                  combinatorial auction that naturally distributes the
                  problem of winner determination amongst the bidders
                  in such a way that they have an incentive to perform
                  the calculation. It can be used when we wish to
                  distribute the computational load among the bidders
                  or when the bidders do not wish to reveal their true
                  valuations unless necessary. PAUSE establishes the
                  rules the bidders must obey. However, it does not
                  tell us how the bidders should calculate their
                  bids. We have developed a couple of bidding
                  algorithms for the bidders in a PAUSE auction. Our
                  algorithms always return the set of bids that
                  maximizes the bidder's utility. Since the problem is
                  NP-Hard, run time remains exponential on the number
                  of items, but it is remarkably better than an
                  exhaustive search. In this paper we present our
                  bidding algorithms, discuss their virtues and
                  drawbacks, and compare the solutions obtained by
                  them to the revenue-maximizing solution found by a

                  process is the fair division of payoff generated
                  from such a joint effort among all coalition
                  members. The nucleolus is widely recognized as a
                  fair way of distributing the revenue in a
                  coalition. While we have efficient algorithms for
                  computing the nucleolus using linear programming
                  based techniques, we believe that such approaches
                  are infeasible in multiagent settings where the loci

                  seaport container terminals are increasingly looking
                  to reduce the time a truck spends at the terminal to
                  complete a transaction. For terminals that stack
                  their containers, the solution may seem obvious: add
                  more yard cranes to reduce trucks’ wait time in the
                  yard. However, the high cost of these cranes often
                  prohibits terminal operators from freely buying
                  more. Another reason is because there is no clear
                  understanding of how the yard cranes’ availability
                  and service strategy affect truck turn time. This
                  study introduces an agent-based approach to model
                  yard cranes for the analysis of truck turn time with
                  respect to service strategy. It is accomplished by
                  modeling the cranes as utility-maximizing
                  agents. This study has identified a set of utility
                  functions that properly capture the essential
                  decision making process of crane operators in

                  cross-platform multi-agent programmable modeling
                  environment. Simulation results show that the
                  distance-based service strategy produces the best
                  results in terms of average waiting time and the
                  maximum waiting time of any truck.},

                  systems community is seaport container terminals. It
                  can be argued that the operations that take place at
                  a container terminal are as complex as that of an
                  airport. A seaport container terminal faces a myriad
                  of operational challenges such as optimizing berth
                  space, minimizing ship turnaround time, maximizing
                  use of resources, and reducing wait time of drayage
                  trucks. Due to environmental concerns, terminal
                  operators and port planners are focusing on the

                  utility-maximizing agents using several different

                  a representative layout of a terminal our simulation
                  model allows us to analyze the behavior of the
                  cranes and evaluate the collective performance of
                  the system. We demonstrate that it is possible to
                  build a realistic and useful model of yard crane
                  operation. Our test results show that utility
                  functions that give higher precedence to nearby
                  trucks lead to much better results than those that
                  favor serving trucks on a mostly first-come
                  first-serve order.},

                  global supply networks, more and greater risks are
                  introduced for cooperating and competing companies
                  alike. These networks can be affected by events such
                  as natural disasters, terrorism, and of late,
                  economic downturn. Supply industry leaders, such as
                  IBM, have announced a need for methods to identify
                  and prevent risks in these ever-growing complex
                  networks. Multiagent-based simulation lends itself
                  perfectly to supply network modeling due to its
                  autonomous nature. Our research illustrates a
                  multiagent supply network formation technique using
                  greedy supply agents and limited resource
                  allocation. Using these formations, the resilience
                  of each network is compared with others and assessed
                  so that we may ascertain the characteristics of
                  risky supply network structure. Our results show
                  that an increase in relationship resources results
                  in a more resilient network; however, as the amount
                  of available resources increases, the risk of the
                  most vulnerable agent in the network decreases by a
                  smaller margin.},

  abstract =	 {In this study we examine the relationship between
                  supply network’s topology and its robustness in the
                  presence of random failures and targeted
                  attacks. The agent based model developed in this
                  paper uses the basic framework and parameters in the
                  experimental game presented in Sterman (1989) for
                  modeling adaptive managerial decision making in an
                  inventory management context.  The study extends the
                  linear supply chain context to a complex supply
                  network and undertakes a rigorous examination of
                  robustness of these supply networks that are
                  characterized by distinct network
                  characteristics. We theorize that network
                  characteristics such as average path length,
                  clustering coefficient, size of the largest
                  connected component in the network and the maximum
                  distance between nodes in the largest connected
                  component are related to the robustness of supply
                  networks, and test the research hypotheses using
                  data from several simulation runs.  Simulations were
                  carried out using twenty distinct network topologies
                  where ten of these topologies were generated using
                  preferential attachment approach (based on the
                  theory of scalefree networks) and the remaining ten
                  topologies were generated using random attachment
                  approach (using random graph theory as a
                  foundation). These twenty supply networks were
                  subjected to random demand and their performances
                  were evaluated by considering varying probabilities
                  of random failures of nodes and targeted attacks on
                  nodes. We also consider the severity of these
                  disruptions by considering the downtime of the
                  affected nodes. Using the data collected from a
                  series of simulation experiments, we test the
                  research hypotheses by means of binomial logistic
                  regression analysis. The results point towards a
                  significant association between network
                  characteristics and supply network robustness
                  assessed using multiple performance measures. We
                  discuss the implications of the study and present
                  directions for future research.}

  abstract =	 {Truck queuing at marine terminal gates has long been
                  recognized as a source of emissions problem due to
                  the large number of trucks idling. For this reason,
                  there is a great deal of interest among the
                  different stakeholders to lessen the severity of the
                  problem. An approach being experimented by some
                  terminals to reduce truck queuing at the terminal is
                  to provide live views of their gates via webcams. An
                  assumption made by the terminals in this method is
                  that truck dispatchers and drivers will make
                  rational decisions regarding their departure times
                  such that there will be less fluctuations in truck
                  arrivals at the terminal based on the live
                  information. However, it is clear that if
                  dispatchers send trucks to the terminal whenever the
                  truck queues are short and not send trucks when the
                  truck queues are long, it could lead to a perpetual
                  whip lash effect. This study explores the predictive
                  strategies that need to be made by the various
                  dispatchers to achieve the desired effects
                  (i.e. steady arrival of trucks and hence less
                  queuing at the seaport terminal gates). This problem
                  is studied with the use of an agent-based simulation
                  model and the solution to the well known El Farol
                  Bar problem. Results demonstrate that truck depots
                  can manage (without any collaboration with one
                  another) to minimize congestion at seaport terminal
                  gates by using the provided real-time gate
                  congestion information and some simple logics for
                  estimating the expected truck wait time.}
