The need for direct memory manipulation through pointers is essential in
many applications. However, it is also commonly understood that the use (or
probably misuse) of pointers is often a rich source of program errors.
Therefore, approaches that can effectively enforce safe use of pointers in
programming are highly sought after.  ATS is a programming language with a
type system rooted in a recently developed framework Applied Type System,
and a novel and desirable feature in ATS lies in its support for safe
programming with pointers through a novel notion of {\em stateful
views}. In particular, even pointer arithmetic is allowed in ATS and
guaranteed to be safe by the type system of ATS.  In this paper, we give an
overview of this feature in ATS, presenting some interesting examples based
on a prototype implementation of ATS to demonstrate the practicality of
safe programming with pointer through stateful views.

The wide practice of objected oriented programming (OOP) in current
software practice is evident. Despite extensive studies on typing
programming objects, it is still undeniably a challenging research task to
design a type system that can satisfactorily account for a variety of
features (e.g., binary methods and multiple inheritance) in OOP. In this
paper, we present a typeful approach to implementing objects that makes use
of a recently introduced notion of guarded datatypes. In particular, we
demonstrate how the feature of multiple inheritance can be supported with
this approach, presenting a simple and general account for multiple
inheritance in a typeful manner.

Gentzen's Hauptsatz -- cut elimination theorem -- in sequent calculi
reveals a fundamental property on logic connectives in various logics such
as classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  In this paper, we implement a
procedure in Haskell to perform cut elimination for intuitionistic sequent
calculus, where we use types to guarantee that the procedure can only
return a cut-free proof of the same sequent when given a proof of a sequent
that may contain cuts.  The contribution of the paper is two-fold.  On
the one hand, we present an interesting (and somewhat unexpected) application
of the current type system of Haskell, illustrating through a concrete
example how some typical use of dependent types can be simulated in
Haskell. On the other hand, we identify several problematic issues with
such a simulation technique and then suggest some approaches to addressing
these issues in Haskell.

	Abstract = {Writing performance-critical programs can be frustrating because
   optimizing compilers for imperative languages tend to be
   unpredictable. For a subset of optimizations - those that simplify
   rather than reorder code - it would be useful to prove that a compiler
   reliably performs optimizations. We show that adopting a
   ``superanalysis'' approach to optimization enables such a proof. By
   analogy with linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an optimizer
   as those programs it reduces to the empty program. To span the
   nullspace, we define rewrite rules that de-optimize programs by
   introducing abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
   sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications is undone by the
   optimizer. Thus, we are able to give programmers a clear mental model
   of what simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to perform, and
   make progress on the problem of ``abstraction penalty'' in imperative
   languages.},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

	Abstract = {Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, which results in large
                 speed increases for many applications. A simple example
                 that generates factorials at compile time is presented.
                 Although this technique might seem like just a cute C++
                 trick, it becomes powerful when combined with normal
                 C++ code. In this hybrid approach, source code contains
                 two programs: the normal C++ runtime program, and a
                 template metaprogram that runs at compile time.
                 Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively
                 inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation of an
                 algorithm that works for a specific input size, and has
                 its loops unrolled. This results in large speed
                 increases for many applications. The article presents a
                 simple template metaprogram that generates a bubble
                 sort algorithm and its performance is analysed.},

                   meta-programming, in particular program generation, and
                   its use in software development. The second part
                   introduces a basic calculus, related to FreshML, that
                   supports program generation (as described through
                   examples and a translation of MetaML into it) and
                   programming in-the-large (this is demonstrated by a
                   translation of CMS into it).},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

	Abstract = {Array syntax, which is supported in many technical programming languages, adds expressive power by allowing operations on and assignments to whole arrays and array sections. To compile an array assignment statement to a uniprocessor, the language processor must convert the statement into a loop that has the same meaning. This process is called scalarization.Scalarization presents a significant technical problem because an array assignment needs to be implemented as if all inputs are fetched before any outputs are stored. Since a loop intermixes loads and stores, the compiler typically allocates a temporary array to hold the intermediate result. Because these extra temporary arrays can cause performance problems in cache, many techniques have been developed to avoid their use or minimize their size.In this paper, we present a novel application of two compiler strategies--loop alignment and loop skewing--to address this problem. We show that these strategies can achieve the asymptotically minimal memory allocation for stencil computations. Our experiments with loop alignment and loop skewing demonstrate that it is extremely effective in improving memory hierarchy performance of Fortran 90 array code on standard uniprocessors. The result should be applicable to other array languages, such as MATLAB.},

	Abstract = {The framework of graph transformation combines the potentials and advantages
of both, graphs and rules, to a single computational paradigm. In this paper we
present some recent developments in applying graph transformation as a rule-based
framework for the specification and development of systems, languages, and tools.
After reviewing the basic features of graph transformation, we discuss a selection of
applications, including the evaluation of functional expressions, the specification of
an interactive graphical tool, an example specification for abstract data types, and
the definition of a visual database query language. The case studies indicate the
need for suitable structuring principles which are independent of a particular graph
transformation approach. To this end, we present the concept of a transformation
unit, which allows systematic and structured specification and programming based
on graph transformation.},

	Abstract = {If the set of atomic formulas is augmented by adding a `universal
formula' and a `null formula', then the equivalence classes of this set under
alphabetic variation form a complete non-modular lattice, with `instance'
as the partial ordering, `greatest common instance' as the meet operation,
and `least common generalization' as the join operation. The greatest common
instance of two formulas can be obtained from Robinson's Unification Algorithm.
An algorithm is given for computing the least common generalization of two
formulas, the covering relation of the lattice is determined, bounds are
obtained on the length of chains from one formula to another, and it is shown
that any formula is the least common  generalization of its set of ground
instances.
A transformational system is a finite set of clauses containing only units
and transformations, which are clauses containing exactly one positive and one
negative literal. It is shown that every unsatisfiable transformational system
has a refutation where every resolution has at least one resolvend which is an
initial clause. An algorithm is given for computing a common generalization of
all atomic formulas which can be derived from a transformational system, and
it is shown that there is no decision procedure for transformational systems.},

for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been
formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass
higher-order functions.  For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize
homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an `abstraction' theorem
that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions,
including user-defined types. Finally, we consider polymorphic functions,
and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of
parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.},

	Abstract = {Classical phantom types are datatypes in which type constraints are expressed using type variables that do not appear in the datatype cases themselves. They can be used to embed typed languages into Haskell or ML. However, while such encodings guarantee that only well-formed data can be constructed, they do not permit type-safe deconstruction without additional tagging and run-time checks. We introduce first-class phantom types, which make such constraints explicit via type equations. Examples of first-class phantom types include typed type representations and typed higher-order abstract syntax trees. These types can be used to support typed generic functions, dynamic typing, and staged compilation in higher-order, statically typed languages such as Haskell or Standard ML. In our system, type constraints can be equations between type constructors as well as type functions of higher-order kinds. We prove type soundness and decidability for a Haskell-like language extended by first-class phantom types.},

@inproceedings{Liang:1995ia,
	Abstract = {We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct
programming language interpreters, and present implementations
of such building blocks capable of supporting many
commonly known features, including simple expressions,
three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, callby-
value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment,
nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing.
The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers,
a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide
range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations,
and exceptions.
Our work is significant in the following respects. First,
we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter
based on monad transformers that includes features missing
from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts.
Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations
through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not
achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated
that interactions between features are reflected in
liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering
monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our
interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just
the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise
and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation
includes a method for constructing extensible unions
and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.},

	Annote = {Generic programming has recently emerged as a paradigm
for developing highly-reusable software libraries, most notably in C++.
We have designed and implemented a constrained generics
extension for C++ to support modular type-checking of generic
algorithms and to address other issues associated with unconstrained
generics.
To be as broadly applicable as possible, generic algorithms are
defined with minimal requirements on their inputs.
At the same time, to not lose potential efficiency, generic algorithms
may have multiple implementations that exploit features of specific
classes of inputs.
This process of algorithm specialization relies on non-local type
information and conflicts directly with the local nature of modular
type-checking.
In this paper, we review the design and implementation of our
extensions for generic programming in C++, describe the issues of
algorithm specialization and modular type-checking in detail, and
discuss the important design tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both.
We present the particular design that we chose for our implementation,
with the goal of hitting the sweet spot in this interesting design space.},

	Abstract = {This paper specifies, via a Hoare-like logic, an interprocedural and flow sensitive (but termination insensitive) information flow analysis for object-oriented programs. Pointer aliasing is ubiquitous in such programs, and can potentially leak confidential information. Thus the logic employs independence assertions to describe the noninterference property that formalizes confidentiality, and employs region assertions to describe possible aliasing. Programmer assertions, in the style of JML, are also allowed, thereby permitting a more fine-grained specification of information flow policy.The logic supports local reasoning about state in the style of separation logic. Small specifications are used; they mention only the variables and addresses relevant to a command. Specifications are combined using a frame rule. An algorithm for the computation of postconditions is described: under certain assumptions, there exists a strongest postcondition which the algorithm computes.

	Abstract = {Embedded code pointers (ECPs) are stored handles of functions and continuations commonly seen in low-level binaries as well as functional or higher-order programs. ECPs are known to be very hard to support well in Hoare-logic style verification systems. As a result, existing proof-carrying code (PCC) systems have to either sacrifice the expressiveness or the modularity of program specifications, or resort to construction of complex semantic models. In Reynolds's LICS'02 paper, supporting ECPs is listed as one of the main open problems for separation logic.In this paper we present a simple and general technique for solving the ECP problem for Hoare-logic-based PCC systems. By adding a small amount of syntax to the assertion language, we show how to combine semantic consequence relation with syntactic proof techniques. The result is a new powerful framework that can perform modular reasoning on ECPs while still retaining the expressiveness of Hoare logic. We show how to use our techniques to support polymorphism, closures, and other language extensions and how to solve the ECP problem for separation logic. Our system is fully mechanized. We give its complete soundness proof and a full verification of Reynolds's CPS-style "list-append" example in the Coq proof assistant.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining imperative and
  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.},

@techreport{friedman03:_improve_krivine_tr,
	Annote = {Krivine presents the K machine, which produces weak head normal form results. Sestoft introduces several call-by-need variants of the K machine that implement result sharing via pushing update markers on the stack in a way similar to the TIM and the STG machine. When a sequence of consecutive markers appears on the stack, all but the first cause redundant updates. Improvements related to these sequences have dealt with either the consumption of the markers or the removal of the markers once they appear. Here we present an improvement that eliminates the production of marker sequences of length greater than one. This improvement results in the C machine, a more space and time efficient variant of K. We then apply the classic optimization of short-circuiting operand variable dereferences to create the call-by-need S machine. Finally, we combine the two improvements in the CS machine. On our benchmarks this machine uses half the stack space, performs one quarter as many updates, and executes between 27 0.000000aster and 17lower than our L variant of Sestoft's lazy Krivine machine. More interesting is that on one benchmark L, S, and C consume unbounded space, but CS consumes constant space. Our comparisons to Sestoft's Mark 2 machine are not exact, however, since we restrict ourselves to unpreprocessed closed lambda terms. Our variant of his machine does no environment trimming, conversion to deBruijn-style variable access, and does not provide basic constants, data type constructors, or the recursive let. (The Y combinator is used instead.)},

	Annote = {The past decade of experience has demonstrated that the generic programming methodology is highly effective for the design, implementation, and use of large-scale software libraries. The fundamental principle of generic programming is the realization of interfaces for entire sets of components, based on their essential syntactic and semantic requirements, rather than for any particular components. Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces between software components, but none completely support the approach used in generic programming. We have recently developed G, a language designed to provide first-class language support for generic programming and large-scale libraries. In this paper, we present an overview of G and analyze the interdependence between language features and libraries design in light of a complete implementation of the Standard Template Library using G. In addition, we discuss important issues related to modularity and encapsulation in large-scale libraries and how language support for validation of components in isolation can prevent many common problems in component integration. },

Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we present the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. Concepts include a novel combination of associated types and same-type constraints that do not appear in type classes, but that are similar to nested types and type sharing in ML.},

	Abstract = {The Microsoft .NET Framework is a new computing architecture designed to support a variety of distributed applications and web-based services. .NET software components are typically distributed in an object-oriented intermediate language, Microsoft IL, executed by the Microsoft Common Language Runtime. To allow convenient multi-language working, IL supports a wide variety of high-level language constructs, including class-based objects, inheritance, garbage collection, and a security mechanism based on type safe execution.This paper precisely describes the type system for a substantial fragment of IL that includes several novel features: certain objects may be allocated either on the heap or on the stack; those on the stack may be boxed onto the heap, and those on the heap may be unboxed onto the stack; methods may receive arguments and return results via typed pointers, which can reference both the stack and the heap, including the interiors of objects on the heap. We present a formal semantics for the fragment. Our typing rules determine well-typed IL instruction sequences that can be assembled and executed. Of particular interest are rules to ensure no pointer into the stack outlives its target. Our main theorem asserts type safety, that well-typed programs in our IL fragment do not lead to untrapped execution errors.Our main theorem does not directly apply to the product. Still, the formal system of this paper is an abstraction of informal and executable specifications we wrote for the full product during its development. Our informal specification became the basis of the product team's working specification of type-checking. The process of writing this specification, deploying the executable specification as a test oracle, and applying theorem proving techniques, helped us identify several security critical bugs during development.},

	Abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being used in vision, robotics and other control systems applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation. As an example of a limitation, we show that streams are incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events over behaviors.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the ?-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new ?-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual ?-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

@inproceedings{Manson:2005qo,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the new Java memory model, which has been revised as part of Java 5.0. The model specifies the legal behaviors for a multithreaded program; it defines the semantics of multithreaded Java programs and partially determines legal implementations of Java virtual machines and compilers.The new Java model provides a simple interface for correctly synchronized programs -- it guarantees sequential consistency to data-race-free programs. Its novel contribution is requiring that the behavior of incorrectly synchronized programs be bounded by a well defined notion of causality. The causality requirement is strong enough to respect the safety and security properties of Java and weak enough to allow standard compiler and hardware optimizations. To our knowledge, other models are either too weak because they do not provide for sufficient safety/security, or are too strong because they rely on a strong notion of data and control dependences that precludes some standard compiler transformations.Although the majority of what is currently done in compilers is legal, the new model introduces significant differences, and clearly defines the boundaries of legal transformations. For example, the commonly accepted definition for control dependence is incorrect for Java, and transformations based on it may be invalid.In addition to providing the official memory model for Java, we believe the model described here could prove to be a useful basis for other programming languages that currently lack well-defined models, such as C++ and C#.},
