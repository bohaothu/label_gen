  abstract = {Today, users do not only access learning resources stored in traditional
	repositories. They use any kind of digital resource, often generated
	in the context of social media platforms. When trying to improve
	the learning experience, it is crucial that all resources that are
	potentially useful are accessible; and that the resources are described
	in a way that allows to identify what is relevant. We suggest enriching
	learning resource descriptions by combining metadata generated by
	experts, user interactions, observation components and machine-generated
	metadata. We give a brief example of the compilation of rich metadata
	sets by integrating the social media platform ALOE with resources
	and metadata from the Ariadne knowledge pool and public FlashMeeting

  abstract = {Nowadays, knowledge is constantly changing and it is becoming faster
	and more overwhelmingly available. As a consequence lifelong learning
	is a requirement which people have to meet in their working as well
	as their private life. \elearning systems are likely to support lifelong
	learning. 
	
	The target of the ALOE project which is currently conducted at the
	German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence is the implementation
	of a brokerage service for all sorts of digital learning content
	and its associated metadata. Its aim is to offer efficient information
	retrieval as well as personalized content provision. Further functionalities
	of social software are intended to connect users and that way enable
	interaction and collaboration.
	
	This diploma thesis starts with an introduction to \elearning and
	Web 2.0 as this is the context in which the ALOE system has been
	developed. Next licensing models are introduced which are likely
	to safeguard intellectual property rights of content contributors.
	After having had a closer look at the project itself as well as related
	work, the use cases that had to be implemented are presented. The
	realization of the system will be described consecutively. For this
	purpose the management of metadata, the way of enabling adaptability
	and the means of implementation will be illustrated.},
