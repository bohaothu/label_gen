    abstract = {The OMF Measurement Library (OML) is an instrumentation system which enables an experimenter to process any type of measurements from distributed applications and collect them in a unified way. We present a comprehensive study of the performance of this library. The analysis focuses on the behaviour, accuracy and precision of instrumented applications, as well as the background footprint such as CPU load and memory usage. To this end, we have modified typical network measurement tools (Iperf) and libraries (libtrace, libsigar) to use OML as their reporting channel. Following extensive experiments, we find little or no negative impact of OML when comparing the OML-enhanced tools to their original versions. Moreover, in the case of Iperf, when we find significant differences, they are positive, with improvements in the accuracy of both the network probing and jitter measurements. We discuss the implications of using OML in the context of experiment-based networking research and give recommendations on its use and the analysis of the produced results.},

We argue the benefits of a holistic approach which considers user- and application-centric metrics such as quality, energy consumption and monetary cost, rather than the commonly used network-centric metrics. We thus introduce the multihomed flow management problem which combines network selection, flow distribution and application flow awareness. We formulate it as a constrained optimisation problem and compare it to commonly used techniques: single network selection and load balancing. For selected interactive applications, we use empirical network measurements to evaluate the optimal solutions obtained by the three approaches. We show that, by exploiting the flexibility of application parameters, it is possible to achieve the potentially conflicting goals of maintaining high application quality while reducing both the power consumption and cost of network use.},

In this paper an integral VANET testbed is evaluated, using 802.11b and a multi-hop network managed by the Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. Up to four vehicles are used to study the VANET performance over different traffic environments and different metrics are considered to analyse the results, including a deeper analysis to track the routes followed by packets end to end.

	abstract	= "In the context of driverless automatic road vehicles,
		one interesting and non-trivial problem is that of the passing
		of a crossroads. At an intersection between two roads, the risk
		of collision is much higher due to the presence of other
		vehicles not going in the same direction, and potentially
		crossing each other’s path.  It is necessary to find safe
		algorithms allowing every vehicle to pass this sensitive point
		without colliding.  Moreover, it is important, while doing so,
		to keep efficiency in mind, for the vehicles not to wait
		forever before entering and passing the intersection. Every
		vehicle must pass the crossroad as fast as the safe
		possibilities allow.  This 6 months internship, done with the
		Imara team, tried to come up with an efficient algorithm for
		crossroads passing.  A simulator has been written, giving the
		possibility to test various algorithms and efficiency
		comparisons have been made in order to determine which
		algorithm was the most promising, and where were the behaviors
		that could still be improved.  Finally, an algorithm based on a
		reservation of critical points has seemed to be the most
		interesting. Details about its inner working and implementation
		are given, as well as preliminary results.",

		networks. Cooperation between MANET and NEMO (MANEMO) brings
		several benefits especially for route optimization and
		multihoming. We made a real field vehicle communication
		environment with NEMO and MANET. By switching from NEMO to
		MANET, routes between vehicles are optimized and network
		performances improved in terms of latency and bandwidth.
		Experiment results show that network performances are further
		improved with simultaneous usage of NEMO and MANET. Network
		performances were shown on a web site in real time and mapped at
