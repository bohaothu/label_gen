                 conjecture that numbers of the form $M(n) = 2^{n}-1$
                 are prime for $n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67,
                 127,$ and $257$, but could not test this claim. Euler
                 showed in 1750 that $M(31)$ is prime. Lucas showed in
                 1876 that $M(127)$ is prime. Pervouchine showed in 1883
                 that $M(61)$ is prime, finally disproving the Mersenne
                 conjecture. Powers in the early 1900s showed that
                 $M(89)$ and $M(107)$ are prime, both missed by
                 Mersenne. By 1947, it was known that the correct list
                 is $2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107$, and
                 $127$, so Mersenne had five errors in his list: $67$
                 and $257$ should have been removed, and $61, 89$, and
                 $107$ added. By late 2001, 39 Mersenne primes were
                 known, the five largest having been found by massive
                 distributed computing efforts through the Great
                 Internet Mersenne Primes Search (GIMPS) project. The
                 largest of these is $M(13466917)$, a number containing

                 A specialist code-breaker was brought in to crack the
                 shorthand that Roger Morrice, a Puritan minister turned
                 political journalist, used in part of the diary to stop
                 the King's agents reading it. \ldots{} \par

                 volumes of Morrice's well-informed account of a
                 turbulent period during which England was ruled by
                 three different monarchs will be published in 2005.\par
                 About 40,000 words of the diary were in code and the

  abstract =     "Three cyphers allegedly authored by Thomas Jefferson
                 Beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study
                 for over 100 years. Generations of cryptanalysts have
                 expended untold man-years, thus far without success,
                 attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune
                 hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean
                 labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia
                 trying to locate the promised bonanza. \par

                 The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
                 yet serious students of cryptography have always had
                 nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has
                 been alleged that the ``known solution'' to Cypher
                 Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49, \ldots{} (``I
                 have deposited in the County of Bedford about four
                 miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault
                 \ldots{}'') with the aid of an unsanitized version of
                 the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb,
                 imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago
                 for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could
                 obviously perform signature analyses the process of
                 encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
                 insights into their construction. For the benefit of
                 the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second
                 cypher employs a specified document whose words are
                 simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of
                 these words are sought out at random to match the
                 letters of these words are sought out at random to
                 match the letters of the clear text or message.
                 \par

                 The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
                 is then written down as the final code. While
                 primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
                 security until the source document becomes known; at
                 that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
                 graders. The work now completed with the help of our
                 UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the
                 Beale cyphers and various types of simulations.
                 \par

                 For example, we have turned the entire process of
                 simulated encoding by various schemes over to the
                 machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic
                 codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand,
                 using different texts and a variety of methods to
                 obtain their signatures. These simulations provide
                 convincing evidence that the signatures are both
                 process and data dependent; they indicate also very
                 strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that
                 it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the
                 correct source document and locates the right vault in
                 the common-wealth of Virginia.",

                 subject can acquire a particular right to an object. In
                 restricted cases, it can be shown that this problem is
                 decidable; i.e., there is an algorithm to determine
                 whether a system in a particular configuration is safe.
                 In general, and under surprisingly weak assumptions, it
                 cannot be decided if a situation is safe. Various

                 network can be protected by cryptography. In a data
                 processing environment, cryptography is implemented by
                 an algorithm which utilizes a secret key, or sequence
                 of bits. Any key-controlled cryptographic algorithm,
                 such as the Data Encryption Standard, requires a
                 protocol for the management of its cryptographic keys.
                 The complexity of the key management protocol
                 ultimately depends on the level of functional
                 capability provided by the cryptographic system. This
                 paper discusses a possible key management scheme that
                 provides the support necessary to protect
                 communications between individual end users (end-to-end
                 encryption) and that also can be used to protect data

                 security, it is necessary to transmit a key, by secret
                 means, before encrypted messages can be sent securely.
                 This paper shows that it is possible to select a key
                 over open communications channels in such a fashion
                 that communications security can be maintained. A
                 method is described which forces any enemy to expend an
                 amount of work which increases as the square of the
                 work required of the two communicants to select the
                 key. The method provides a logically new kind of
                 protection against the passive eaves dropper. It
                 suggests that further research on this topic will be

                 functions with certain desirable properties, and
                 introduce two novel applications for hashing which make
                 use of these functions. One class contains a small
                 number of functions, yet is almost universal2. If the
                 functions hash n-bit long names into m-bit indices,
                 then specifying a member of the class requires only
                 O((m + log2 log2(n)) g log2(n)) bits as compared to
                 O(n) bits for earlier techniques. For long names, this
                 is about a factor of m larger than the lower bound of m
                 + log2n log2m bits. An application of this class is a
                 provably secure authentication technique for sending
                 messages over insecure lines. A second class of
                 functions satisfies a much stronger property than
                 universal2. We present the application of testing sets
                 for equality. The authentication technique allows the
                 receiver to be certain that a message is genuine. An
                 ``enemy'' even one with infinite computer resources
                 cannot forge or modify a message without detection. The
                 set equality technique allows operations including
                 ``add member to set,'' ``delete member from set,'' and
                 ``test two sets for equality'' to be performed in
                 expected constant time and with less than a specified
                 probability of error.",

  abstract =     "A new protection mechanism is described that provides
                 general primitives for protection and authentication.
                 The mechanism is based on the idea of sealing an object
                 with a key. Sealed objects are self-authenticating, and
                 in the absence of an appropriate set of keys, only
                 provide information about the size of their contents.
                 New keys can be freely created at any time, and keys
                 can also be derived from existing keys with operators
                 that include Key-And and Key-Or. This flexibility
                 allows the protection mechanism to implement common
                 protection mechanisms such as capabilities, access
                 control lists, and information flow control. The
                 mechanism is enforced with a synthesis of conventional
                 cryptography, public-key cryptography, and a threshold
                 scheme.",

  abstract =     "An encryption method is presented with the novel
                 property that publicly revealing an encryption key does
                 not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key.
                 This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or
                 other secure means are not needed to transmit keys,
                 since a message can be enciphered using an encryption
                 key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only
                 he can decipher the message, since only he knows the
                 corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be
                 ``signed'' using a privately held decryption key.
                 Anyone can verify this signature using the
                 corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.
                 Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later
                 deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious
                 applications in ``electronic mail'' and ``electronic
                 funds transfer'' systems. A message is encrypted by
                 representing it as a number $M$, raising $M$ to a
                 publicly specified power $e$, and then taking the
                 remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
                 specified product, $n$, of two large secret prime
                 numbers $p$ and $q$. Decryption is similar; only a
                 different, secret, power $d$ is used, where $e * d ==
                 1(\mbox{mod}(p-1)*(q-1))$. The security of the system
                 rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the
                 published divisor, n.",

  abstract =     "The unicity distance of a cascade of random ciphers,
                 with respect to known plaintext attack, is shown to be
                 the sum of the key lengths. At time-space trade-off for
                 the exhaustive cracking of a cascade of ciphers is
                 shown. The structure of the set of permutations
                 realized by a cascade is studied; it is shown that only
                 l. 2**k exhaustive experiments are necessary to
                 determine the behavior of a cascade of l stages, each
                 having k key bits. It is concluded that the cascade of
                 random ciphers is not a random cipher. Yet, it is shown
                 that, with probability, the number of permutations
                 realizable by a cascade of l random ciphers, each
                 having k key bits, is 2**l**k. Next, it is shown that
                 two stages are not worse than one, by a simple
                 reduction of the cracking problem of any of the stages
                 to the cracking problem of the cascade. Finally, it is
                 shown that proving a nonpolynomial lower bound on the
                 cracking problem of long cascades is a hard task, since
                 such a bound implies that P does not equal NP.",

                 a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction
                 algorithm to attempt to find this short vector. The

                 broadcast messages reliably in the presence of faulty
                 processes. These protocols are run in a system that
                 consists of n processes, t of which are faulty. The
                 protocols are conducted in synchronous rounds of
                 message exchange. It is shown that, in the absence of
                 eavesdropping, without using cryptography, for any
                 epsilon greater than 0 and t equals n/(3 plus epsilon),
                 there is a randomized protocol with O(log n) expected
                 number of rounds. If cryptographic methods are allowed,
                 then, for epsilon greater than 0 and t equals n/(2 plus
                 epsilon), there is a randomized protocol with O(log n)
                 expected number of rounds. This is an improvement on
                 the lower bound of t plus 1 rounds required for
                 deterministic protocols, and on a previous result of
                 t/log n expected number of rounds for randomized

                 and now in wide use for commercial cryptographic
                 applications. This is a `private key' system; the
                 communicants share a secret key, and the eavesdropper
                 will succeed if he can guess this key among its
                 quadrillions of possibilities. The other is the
                 Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, a typical `public
                 key' cryptographic system. Its security is based on the
                 difficulty of taking `discrete logarithms' (reversing
                 the process of exponentiation in a finite field). We
                 describe the system and some analytic attacks against

                 concerning software are rarely enforced, thereby

                 Technical means of protecting software from illegal
                 duplication are required, but the available means are
                 imperfect. We present protocols that enable software
                 protection, without causing substantial overhead in
                 distribution and maintenance. The protocols may be
                 implemented by a conventional cryptosystem, such as the
                 DES, or by a public key cryptosystem, such as the RSA.

                 encryption and message authentication are essential.
                 Both the PIN and the transaction details are at risk in
                 ATM and EFTPOS systems. The Data Encryption Algorithm
                 can be used to encrypt PINs and generate a message
                 authentication code that can be verified by the
                 receiving party. Since the same key is required for
                 both encryption and decryption, there is the problem of
                 distributing it safely to both ends of the
                 communication line. This difficulty can be resolved
                 either by using public key cryptography or by
                 implementing the Transaction Key scheme proposed in

                 public-key cryptosystems that overcomes the problems of
                 previous signature schemes used for multisignatures is
                 proposed. The principal features of this scheme are (1)
                 the length of a multisignature message is nearly
                 equivalent to that for a single signature message; (2)
                 by using a one-way hash function, multisignature
                 generation and verification are processed in an
                 efficient manner; (3) the order of signing is not
                 restricted; and (4) this scheme can be constructed on
                 any bijective public-key cryptosystem as well as the
                 RSA scheme. In addition, it is shown that the new
                 scheme is considered as safe as the public-key
                 cryptosystem used in this new scheme. Some variations

                 voice in a distributed personal-computing environment.
                 To facilitate sharing, the voice manager stores voice
                 on a special voice file server that is accessible via
                 the local internet. Operations for editing a passage of
                 recorded voice simply build persistent data structures
                 to represent the edited voice. These data structures,
                 implementing an abstraction called voice ropes, are
                 stored in a server database and consist of lists of
                 intervals within voice files. Clients refer to voice
                 ropes solely by reference. Interests, additional
                 persistent data structures maintained by the server,
                 provide a sort of directory service for managing the
                 voice ropes that have been created as well as a
                 reliable reference-counting mechanism, permitting the

                 protocols for authentication in distributed computing
                 systems. In this paper we motivate, set out, and
                 exemplify a logic specifically designed for this
                 analysis; we show how various protocols differ subtly
                 with respect to the required initial assumptions of the
                 participants and their final beliefs. Our formalism has
                 enabled us to isolate and express these differences
                 with a precision that was not previously possible. It
                 has drawn attention to features of protocols of which
                 we and their authors were previously unaware, and
                 allowed us to suggest improvements to the protocols.
                 The reasoning about some protocols has been
                 mechanically verified. This paper starts with an
                 informal account of the problem, goes on to explain the
                 formalism to be used, and gives examples of its
                 application to protocols from the literature, both with
                 conventional shared-key cryptography and with
                 public-key cryptography. Some of the examples are
                 chosen because of their practical importance, while
                 others serve to illustrate subtle points of the logic
                 and to explain how we use it. We discuss extensions of
                 the logic motivated by actual practice -- for example,
                 in order to account for the use of hash functions in
                 signatures. The final sections contain a formal
                 semantics of the logic and some conclusions.",

                 than the mere fact that the theorem is true. For
                 instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it
                 suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however,
                 this seems to contain more knowledge than the single
                 bit Hamiltonian\slash non-Hamiltonian. In this paper a
                 computational complexity theory of the `knowledge'
                 contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge
                 proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no
                 additional knowledge other than the correctness of the
                 proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge
                 proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic
                 residuosity and quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the

                 encryption protocols using machine aided formal
                 verification techniques. The properties that the
                 protocol should preserve are expressed as state

                 guarantee that the cryptographic facility satisfies the
                 invariants are automatically generated by the
                 verification system.'' A formal specification of an
                 example system is presented, and several weaknesses
                 that were revealed by attempting to formally verify and
                 test the specification are discussed.``",

                 safe mechanisms for a variety of cryptographic
                 applications. Their main problem is the very long
                 integer arithmetic. In cryptosystems usually
                 serial-parallel multiplication is employed.
                 Serial-parallel multiplication slows down the
                 encryption to the order of k, where k is log[subscript
                 2]n, and n is the modulus. The approach presented in
                 this paper demonstrates a method of using parallel
                 multiplication schemes at the order of log(k) in
                 combination with incomplete modulus reduction. This
                 method calls for redundant number representations. With
                 this background, the problem of designing a quasi
                 optimal scheme fitting into a defined chip area is
                 elaborated. The two methods, the partial parallel
                 multiplication in redundant number representations and
                 incomplete modulus reduction at fully completed
                 multiplication steps only, seem to allow for RSA
                 encryption at ISDN speed and higher.",

  abstract =     "Andrew is a distributed computing environment that is
                 a synthesis of the personal computing and timesharing
                 paradigms. When mature, it is expected to encompass
                 over 5,000 workstations spanning the Carnegie Mellon
                 University campus. This paper examines the security
                 issues that arise in such an environment and describes
                 the mechanisms that have been developed to address
                 them. These mechanisms include the logical and physical
                 separation of servers and clients, support for secure
                 communication at the remote procedure call level, a
                 distributed authentication service, a file-protection
                 scheme that combines access lists with UNIX mode bits,
                 and the use of encryption as a basic building block.
                 The paper also discusses the assumptions underlying
                 security in Andrew and analyzes the vulnerability of
                 the system. Usage experience reveals that resource
                 control, particularly of workstation CPU cycles, is
                 more important than originally anticipated and that the
                 mechanisms available to address this issue are
                 rudimentary.",

                 the National Buraeu [sic] of Standards in the mid 70's,
                 and has successfully withstood all the attacks
                 published so far in the open literature. In this paper
                 we develop a new type of cryptanalytic attack which can
                 break DES with up to eight rounds in a few minutes on a
                 PC and can break DES with up to 15 rounds faster than
                 an exhaustive search. The new attack can be applied to
                 a variety of DES-like substitution/permutation
                 cryptosystems, and demonstrates the crucial role of the

  abstract =     "Several cryptosystems based on exponentiation have
                 been proposed. Some of these are of the public key
                 variety and offer notable advantages in cryptographic
                 key management, both for secret communication and for
                 message authentication. The need for extensive
                 arithmetic calculations with very large integers
                 (hundreds of digits long) is a drawback of these
                 systems. The paper describes a set of experimental
                 programs that were developed to demonstrate that
                 exponentiation cryptosystems can be efficiently
                 implemented on the IBM Personal Computer (PC). The
                 programs are organized into four layers, comprising
                 procedures for: multiple precision integer arithmetic,
                 modular exponentiation, prime number generation and
                 testing, and cryptographic key generation. The major
                 emphasis is on methods and techniques for improving
                 execution speed. The items discussed include: the use
                 of a specialized squaring procedure; a recursive
                 splitting method to speed up squaring and
                 multiplication; the computation of residues by using
                 multiplication instead of division; the efficient
                 encoding of residue information; and the use of
                 thresholds to select the most effective primality
                 testing algorithm for a given size number. Timing
                 results are presented and discussed. Finally, the paper
                 discusses the advantages of a mixed system that
                 combines the superior key management capabilities
                 inherent in public key cryptosystems with the much
                 higher bulk-encryption speed obtainable with the Data
                 Encryption Algorithm.",

                 for VLSI\slash WSI implementation, namely, dynamically
                 reconfigurable hash tables. In this method, finite
                 storage is allocated for each bucket. Instead of
                 searching the entire table or a part of the table for
                 an empty storage place, the overflowing synonyms are
                 inserted into the successor's bucket (next to the home
                 bucket). If the successor's bucket overflows, the same
                 technique is repeated until the table is stable. The
                 host bucket takes care of all the relative operations
                 for its guest items. As soon as an empty place arises
                 in the original bucket, the host bucket returns the
                 guest element to the original bucket; in essence,
                 dynamically variable capacity buckets have been
                 created. These buckets are designed using systolic

                 key usage based on control vectors. Each cryptographic
                 key has an associated control vector that defines the
                 permitted uses of the key within the cryptographic
                 system. At key generation, the control vector is
                 cryptographically coupled to the key via a special
                 encryption process. Each encrypted key and control
                 vector is stored and distributed within the
                 cryptographic system as a single token. Decryption of a
                 key requires respecification of the control vector. As
                 part of the decryption process, the cryptographic
                 hardware also verifies that the requested use of the
                 key is authorized by the control vector. This paper

                 ring Z[subscript m]. Such an elliptic curve is not a
                 group, but it can be extended to form a group. A first
                 class of functions has the property that assigning an
                 element of the domain or range of the function to a
                 given message requires knowledge of the trapdoor. These
                 functions can therefore be used only in a digital
                 signature scheme, but not in a public-key cryptosystem.
                 A second, preferred class of functions does not suffer
                 from this problem and can be used for the same
                 applications as the RSA trapdoor one-way function,
                 including zero-knowledge identification protocols. Like
                 the RSA system, the new system could be broken when a
                 modulus could be factored, and it is not known whether
                 breaking the system is equivalent to factoring the
                 modulus. However, unless this equivalence holds for the
                 RSA system, our system seems to be more secure than the
                 RSA system. Its encryption speed is half the speed of
                 the RSA system.",

                 new encryption primitive, which encrypts and decrypts a
                 64-bit block of data using a 64-bit key. Furthermore
                 they propose a way to build private versions of LOKI.
                 In this paper we show first that the keyspace of any
                 LOKI-version is only 2p60s, not 2p64 sas claimed.
                 Therefore there are 15 equivalent keys for every key,
                 that encrypts/decrypts texts the same way. An immediate
                 consequence is, that the proposed Single Block Hash
                 Mode is no good. It is very easy to find collisions.
                 Secondly we do differential cryptanalysis on LOKI and
                 show that n-round LOKI, n [< or =] 14 is vulnerable to
                 this kind of attack, at least in principle. We show
                 that we cannot find a characteristic with a probability
                 high enough to break LOKI with 16 rounds. However one
                 might find a private LOKI-version, that is vulnerable
                 to a differential attack for n=16. Finally we consider
                 differentials, introduced in [LMM91], versus
                 characteristics, introduced in [BiSha90].",

                 that implements it. Our theory is based on the notion
                 of principal and a ``speaks for'' relation between
                 principals. A simple principal either has a name or is
                 a communication channel; a compound principal can
                 express an adopted role or delegated authority. The
                 theory shows how to reason about a principal's
                 authority by deducing the other principals that it can
                 speak for; authenticating a channel is one important
                 application. We use the theory to explain many existing
                 and proposed security mechanisms. In particular, we
                 describe the system we have built. It passes principals
                 efficiently as arguments or results of remote procedure
                 calls, and it handles public and shared key encryption,
                 name lookup in a large name space, groups of
                 principals, program loading, delegation, access

                 often used in conjunction with cryptographic schemes.
                 By removing redundancy in the source document, they can
                 significantly increase the difficulty of cryptanalysis.
                 In this thesis we consider the question: `what is the
                 difficulty of breaking a data-compression scheme by
                 itself?' We examine most closely the problem of
                 deciphering a file that has been Huffman-coded, but for
                 which the Huffman code used is unavailable. We find
                 that a Huffman-code can be surprisingly difficult to
                 cryptanalyze. We present a detailed analysis of the
                 situation for a three-symbol source alphabet, and
                 concisely derive the conditions when the source
                 probabilities lead to true ambiguity. We also present
                 some general results for the case of an arbitrary
                 (finite) alphabet, and show that: 1. If the source
                 probabilities are highly skewed, then there is no
                 ambiguity. 2. If the source probabilities are equally
                 likely and the size of the source alphabet is a power
                 of two, then there is total ambiguity.",

  abstract =     "Distribution of security devices such as chips for
                 cryptographic use is [sic] makes sense. It must be
                 managed in a trustworthy way so as not to be forged by
                 an intruder. If, in the hopefully near future, all
                 relevant data processing is attempted to be done in a
                 secure way, the distribution of security devices will
                 be widespread. The only way to prevent fake devices
                 from being substituted in place of secure devices is a
                 trusted distribution and operation. This work
                 concentrates on the problem of delivering and operating
                 an encryption device using public key cryptography. In
                 this context a security architecture for the
                 organization and distribution of an RSA chip is
                 presented. This is done under the assumption that the
                 chip housing is a valid physical security and that
                 reverse engineering of the chip does not reveal
                 internal secrets. On this basis a method is presented
                 that inhibits introduction of fake chips using
                 deliberately built-in security holes. The principal
                 method used is a secret distribution key within the
                 chip. This key is used for distribution and
                 authentication of the chip manufacturer as well as for
                 encrypted key loading in the field during operation.
                 The proposed distribution protocol still allows the
                 loading of freely chosen user keys with a minimum
                 overhead. For special applications, each customer could
                 be assigned a unique distribution key based on a single
                 and identical secret key for a set of cryptographic
                 chips.",

                 provides nonrepudiation via digital signatures and an

                 novel method for extending the control vector concept
                 used in the IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture. Four
                 new key types that separate the public and private key
                 pairs into four classes according to their broad uses
                 within the cryptographic system are defined. The public

                 the nature and role of an associated cryptographic key.
                 The control vector is checked by software and
                 cryptographic hardware in order to limit the range of
                 permissible operations to be undertaken with ciphertext
                 produced with the key. The linking of the control
                 vector and cryptographic key is such that attempts to
                 modify, or substitute, control vectors will cause the
                 subsequent processing to operate with a corrupted key,
                 and hence ensure protection of data encrypted with the
                 genuine key. A potential attack on the control vector
                 approach is described in which the complement of the
                 control vector is substituted. The manner in which such

                 in long integer arithmetic applied to encryption,
                 concentrating mainly on two methods. The first is the
                 multiplication as parallel as possible, combined with a
                 division free modulo reduction [1] and the second is a
                 residue number system-based method [2] for modulo
                 exponentiation. These methods can be used to implement
                 the standard RSA [3] algorithm or a modified RSA
                 algorithm with a reduced key space. Either method is
                 suited to a scalable VLSI design for both single chip
                 and multichip parallelism. Multichip approaches call
                 for extended evaluation as communication among the
                 processors (chips) has a dominating effect. Parallel
                 structures, including pipelining, are investigated to
                 provide suggestions on high performance architectures,
                 for the resulting approach.",

                 cryptographic hash functions. The importance of hash
                 functions for protecting the authenticity of
                 information is demonstrated. Applications include
                 integrity protection, conventional message
                 authentication and digital signatures. Theoretical
                 results on cryptographic hash functions are reviewed.
                 The information theoretic approach to authentication is
                 described, and the practicality of schemes based on
                 universal hash functions is studied. An overview is
                 given of the complexity theoretical definitions and
                 constructions. The main contribution of this thesis
                 lies in the study of practical constructions for hash
                 functions. A general model for hash functions is
                 proposed and taxonomy for attacks is presented. Then
                 all schemes in the literature are divided into three
                 classes: hash functions based on block ciphers, hash
                 functions based on modular arithmetic and dedicated
                 hash functions. An overview is given of existing
                 attacks, new attacks are demonstrated, and new schemes
                 are proposed. The study of basic building blocks of
                 cryptographic hash functions leads to the study of the
                 cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. New
                 criteria are defined and functions satisfying new and
                 existing criteria are studied.",

  abstract =     "The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was developed by an
                 IBM team around 1974 and adopted as a national standard
                 in 1977. Since that time, many cryptanalysts have
                 attempted to find shortcuts for breaking the system. In
                 this paper, we examine one such attempt, the method of
                 differential cryptanalysis, published by Biham and

                 defines a scrambling technique for data confidentiality
                 that uses the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) as the
                 underlying cryptographic algorithm, but weakens the
                 overall cryptographic operation by defining a
                 key-generation method that produces an effective 40-bit
                 DEA key instead of the 56 bits required by the
                 full-strength DEA. In general, products implementing
                 the CDMF algorithm in an appropriate manner may be
                 freely exported from the USA. The algorithm is thus
                 intended as a drop-in replacement for the DEA in
                 cryptographic products. Discussed in this paper are the

  abstract =     "In this paper, we prove the intractability of learning
                 several classes of Boolean functions in the
                 distribution-free model (also called the Probably
                 Approximately Correct or PAC model) of learning from
                 examples. These results are {\em representation
                 independent}, in that they hold regardless of the
                 syntactic form in which the learner chooses to
                 represent its hypotheses.\par

                 Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of
                 well-known public-key cryptosystems to the learning
                 problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning
                 algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite
                 automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would
                 have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number
                 theory. In particular, such an algorithm could be used
                 to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers
                 (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and
                 detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the
                 learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight
                 advantage in prediction over random guessing. The
                 techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality
                 between learning and cryptography.\par

                 We also apply our results to obtain strong
                 intractability results for approximating a
                 generalization of graph coloring.",

                 close to a dictionary word. Other applications include

                 users and require the ability to accurately identify
                 the user making a request. In traditional systems, the
                 user's identity is verified by checking a password
                 typed during login; the system records the identity and
                 uses it to determine what operations may be performed.
                 The process of verifying the user's identity is called
                 authentication. Password-based authentication is not
                 suitable for use on computer networks. Passwords sent
                 across the network can be intercepted and subsequently
                 used by eavesdroppers to impersonate the user. While
                 this vulnerability has been long known, it was recently
                 demonstrated on a major scale with the discovery of
                 planted password collecting programs at critical points

  abstract =     "The problem of Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) is the
                 following: A dealer, who may be honest or cheating, can
                 share a secret $s$, among $n>=2t+1$ players, where $t$
                 players at most are cheaters. The sharing process will
                 cause the dealer to commit himself to a secret $s$. If
                 the dealer is honest, then, during the sharing process,
                 the set of dishonest players will have no information
                 about $s$. When the secret is reconstructed, at a later
                 time, all honest players will reconstruct $s$. The
                 solution that is given is a constant round protocol,
                 with polynomial time local computations and polynomial
                 message size. The protocol assumes private
                 communication lines between every two participants, and
                 a broadcast channel. The protocol achieves the desired
                 properties with an exponentially small probability of
                 error.\par

                 A new tool, called {\em Information Checking}, which
                 provides authentication and is not based on any
                 unproven assumptions, is introduced, and may have wide
                 application elsewhere.\par

                 For the case in which it is known that the dealer is
                 honest, a simple constant round protocol is proposed,
                 without assuming broadcast.\par

                 A weak version of secret sharing is defined: Weak
                 Secret Sharing (WSS). WSS has the same properties as
                 VSS for the sharing process. But, during
                 reconstruction, if the dealer is dishonest, then he
                 might obstruct the reconstruction of $s$. A protocol
                 for WSS is also introduced. This protocol has an
                 exponentially small probability of error. WSS is an
                 essential building block for VSS. For certain
                 applications, the much simpler WSS protocol
                 suffice.\par

                 All protocols introduced in this paper are secure in
                 the Information Theoretic sense.",

                 forward and backwards by given oracles. We study
                 attacks that work for any choice of the black boxes,
                 i.e. we scrutinize the given graph structure. For
                 example we analyze the graph of the fast Fourier
                 transform (FFT). We present optimal black box
                 inversions of FFT-compression functions and black box
                 constructions of collisions. This determines the
                 minimal depth of FFT-compression networks for
                 collision-resistant hashing. We propose the concept of
                 multipermutation, which is a pair of orthogonal latin
                 squares, as a new cryptographic primitive that
                 generalizes the boxes of the FFT. Our examples of

  abstract =     "A {\em program correctness checker\/} is an algorithm
                 for checking the output of a computation. That is,
                 given a program and an instance on which the program is
                 run, the checker certifies whether the output of the
                 program on that instance is correct. This paper defines
                 the concept of a program checker. It designs program
                 checkers for a few specific and carefully chosen
                 problems in the class FP of functions computable in
                 polynomial time. Problems in FP for which checkers are
                 presented in this paper include Sorting, Matrix Rank
                 and GCD. It also applies methods of modern
                 cryptography, especially the idea of a probabilistic
                 interactive proof, to the design of program checkers
                 for group theoretic computations.\par

                 Two structural theorems are proven here. One is a
                 characterization of problems that can be checked. The
                 other theorem establishes equivalence classes of
                 problems such that whenever one problem in a class is
                 checkable, all problems in the class are checkable.",

  abstract =     "This thesis contains a new approach to design block
                 ciphers, synchronous and self-synchronizing stream
                 ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. The goal of
                 this approach is the specification of cryptographic
                 schemes that are secure, simple to describe and that
                 can be implemented efficiently on a wide variety of
                 platforms. Key words are simplicity, symmetry and
                 parallelism. An overview of the different types of
                 ciphers, encryption schemes and hash functions is
                 given, the nature of cryptographic security is
                 discussed and some new security-related definitions are
                 presented. The design is mainly guided by the
                 resistance against differential and linear
                 cryptanalysis. The basic mechanisms of these two
                 attacks are investigated and their structure is
                 clarified by adopting a new formalism for their
                 description and analysis. The resistance against
                 differential and linear cryptanalysis is obtained by
                 applying the new wide trail strategy that emphasizes
                 the mechanism of diffusion. The application of this
                 strategy for the different types of ciphers and hash
                 functions leads to a number of new structures and
                 specific designs. A new self-reciprocal block cipher
                 structure is introduced together with a new type of
                 cryptographic component: the stream/hash module. The
                 design of single-bit self-synchronizing stream ciphers
                 is treated and the potential weaknesses of ciphers that
                 make use of arithmetic operations are analyzed. The
                 design approach is supported by a number of new
                 cryptanalytic results.",

                 know a secret key. She makes the point that encryption
                 can be used to both protect against criminal activity
                 and to conceal criminal activities. She also speaks

                 analyzing a cryptosystem. The Kerberos authentication
                 system is used as an example, and the basis for the
                 analysis is a working draft of the system: version 5
                 revision 5.1. More recent versions of the system have
                 fixed many of the problems described here. The Kerberos
                 authentication system uses a trusted key server to keep
                 track of the private keys of clients and servers, as
                 well as to generate session keys for client-server
                 interaction. If a client were able to determine the
                 private key of a particular server, it could decrypt
                 conversations that other clients have with that server,
                 as well as impersonate other clients to that server.
                 Part of the Kerberos method of client- server
                 conversation is the Kerberos `ticket', a record that is
                 partially encrypted in the private key of the server.
                 The ticket contains the session key, information about
                 the client, and some other useful data. Since the
                 ticket's format is widely available, and most of the
                 contents of the ticket are known to the client, it is
                 potentially vulnerable to chosen or known plaintext
                 attacks.",

                 in many areas of mathematics, computer science and

                 primality testing algorithms have been incorporated in

                 as a standard. In this paper, we discuss primality
                 testing of large numbers in Maple V Release 3, a Maple
                 version newly released in 1994. Our computation
                 experience shows that the Maple primality testing
                 facility is prime, based on a combined use of a strong
                 pseudoprimality test and a Lucas test, is efficient and

  abstract =     "Among those cryptographic hash function which are not
                 based on block ciphers, MD4 and Snefru seemed initially
                 quite attractive for applications requiring fast
                 software hashing. However collisions for Snefru were
                 found in 1990, and recently a collision of MD4 was also
                 found. This casts doubt on how long these functions'
                 variants, such as RIPE-MD, MD5, SHA, SHA1 and Snefru-8,
                 will remain unbroken. Furthermore, all these functions
                 were designed for 32-bit processors, and cannot be
                 implemented efficiently on the new generation of 64-bit
                 processors such as the DEC Alpha. We therefore present
                 a new hash function which we believe to be secure; it
                 is designed to run quickly on 64-bit processors,
                 without being too slow on existing machines.",

                 escrow' techniques for enabling law-enforcement and
                 national security access to encrypted communications.
                 Our proposal allows such access with probability p for
                 each message, for a parameter p between 0 and 1 to be
                 chosen (say, by Congress) to provide an appropriate
                 balance between concerns for individual privacy, on the
                 one hand, and the need for such access by
                 law-enforcement and national security, on the other.
                 For example, with p = 0.4, a law-enforcement agency
                 conducting an authorized wiretap which records 100
                 encrypted conversations would expect to be able to
                 decrypt (approximately) 40 of these conversations; the
                 agency would not be able to decrypt the remaining 60
                 conversations at all. Different values of p can be
                 chosen for different situations, such as for export.
                 Our proposal can be combined with other ideas, such as
                 secret-sharing, to provide additional flexibility. Our
                 scheme is remarkably simple to implement, as it
                 requires no prior escrowing of keys. We provide an
                 efficient implementation of translucent cryptography.
                 It is based on non-interactive oblivious transfer, as
                 pioneered by Bellare and Micali [2], who showed how to
                 transfer a message with probability 1/2. We provide
                 means for non-interactive fractional oblivious
                 transfer, which allows a message to be transmitted with
                 any given probability p. Our protocol is based on the
                 Diffie-Hellman assumption and uses just one El Gamal
                 encryption (two exponentiations), regardless of the
                 value of the transfer probability p. This makes the
                 implementation of translucent cryptography competitive,
                 in efficiency of encryption, with current suggestions
                 for software key escrow such as the fair Diffie-Hellman
                 system [20], so that efficiency, at least, is not a
                 barrier to its consideration.",

  abstract =     "Software protection is one of the most important
                 issues concerning computer practice. There exist many
                 heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the
                 problem as a whole has not received the theoretical
                 treatment it deserves. In this paper, we provide
                 theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce
                 the problem of software protection to the problem of
                 efficient simulation on {\em oblivious\/} RAM.\par

                 A machine is {\em oblivious\/} if the sequence in which
                 it accesses memory locations is equivalent for any two
                 inputs with the same running time. For example, an
                 oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement
                 of the heads on the tapes is identical for each
                 computation. (Thus, the movement is independent of the
                 actual input.) {\em What is the slowdown in the running
                 time of a machine, if it is required to be
                 oblivious?\/} In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer showed how
                 a two-tape {\em oblivious\/} Turing Machine can
                 simulate, on-line, a one-tape Turing Machine, with a
                 logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an
                 analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM)
                 model of computation. In particular, we show how to do
                 an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a
                 probabilistic {\em oblivious\/} RAM with a
                 polylogarithmic slowdown in the running time. On the
                 other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a
                 lower bound.",

                 mystery novel with a cryptographic twist, Enigma's hero

                 working as a member of the team struggling to crack the
                 Nazi Enigma code. Jericho's own struggles include
                 nerve-wracking mental labor, the mysterious
                 disappearance of a former girlfriend, the suspicions of
                 his co-workers within the paranoid high-security
                 project, and the certainty that someone close to him,
                 perhaps the missing girl, is a Nazi spy. The plot is
                 pure fiction but the historical background, Alan
                 Turing's famous wartime computing project that cracked
                 the German U-boat communications code, is real and

                 `hiding' large cliques in random graphs. While the
                 largest clique in a random graph is very likely to be
                 of size about 2 log2 n, it is widely conjectured that
                 no polynomial-time algorithm exists which finds a
                 clique of size (1 + [epsilon]) log2 n with significant
                 probability for any constant [epsilon] > 0. We show
                 that if this conjecture is true, then when a clique of
                 size at most (2 - [delta]) log2 n for constant [delta]
                 > 0 is randomly inserted (`hidden') in a random graph,
                 finding a clique of size (1 + [epsilon]) log2 n remains
                 hard. In particular, we show that if there exists a
                 polynomial-time algorithm which finds cliques of size
                 (1 + [epsilon]) log2 n in such graphs with probability
                 1/poly, then the same algorithm will find cliques in
                 completely random graphs with probability 1/poly. Given
                 the conjectured hardness of finding large cliques in
                 random graphs, we therefore show that hidden cliques
                 may be used as cryptographic keys.",

  abstract =     "Produces a 160-bit representation of the message,
                 called the message digest, when a message with a bit
                 length less than 2 to 64th power is input. The message
                 digest is used during the generation of a signature for
                 the message. The message digest is computed during the
                 generation of a signature for the message. The SHA-1 is
                 also used to compute a message digest for the received
                 version of the message during the process of verifying
                 the signature. Any change to the message in transit
                 will, with a very high probability, result in a
                 different messages digest, and the signature will fail
                 to verify. The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) described
                 in this standard is required for use with the Digital
                 Signature Algorithm and may be used whenever a secure
                 hash algorithm is required.",

  abstract =     "The so-called prisoners' problem, in which two
                 individuals attempt to communicate covertly without
                 alerting a `warden' who controls the communications
                 channel, has taken a number of forms, adorned with
                 various assumptions or requirements which make the
                 problem more or less difficult. One assumption which
                 makes the problem considerably more managable is that
                 the participants are allowed to share some secret
                 information (such as an encryption key) prior to
                 imprisonment. Another assumption, which makes the
                 problem much more difficult, is that the warden be
                 allowed to modify messages sent between the prisoners
                 as well as read them. This paper describes techniques
                 for pure steganography, in which no secret information
                 needs to be shared before imprisonment. First, a
                 modification of an existing protocol will be shown to
                 admit pure steganography if the warden is not allowed
                 to modify the contents of the channel. Then, a
                 technique will be described that allows pure
                 steganography between two prisoners in the presence in
                 the presence [sic] of an active (content-modifying)
                 warden. This technique is possible through the use of
                 two distinct channels rather than one: the subliminal
                 channel for steganographic communication is augmented
                 by a supraliminal channel, one in which information is
                 not hidden from the warden but cannot be modified.",

  abstract =     "Untraceable electronic cash means prepaid digital
                 payment systems, usually with offline payments, that
                 protect user privacy. Such systems have recently been
                 given considerable attention by both theory and
                 development projects. However, in most current schemes,
                 loss of a user device containing electronic cash
                 implies a loss of money, just as with real cash. In
                 comparison with credit schemes, this is considered a
                 serious shortcoming. This article shows how untraceable
                 electronic cash can be made loss tolerant, i.e., how
                 the monetary value of the lost data can be recovered.
                 Security against fraud and preservation of privacy are
                 ensured; strong loss tolerance means that not even
                 denial of recovery is possible. In particular, systems
                 based on electronic coins are treated. We present
                 general design principles and options and their
                 instantiation in one concrete payment system. The
                 measures are practical.",

                 right half of the input block in each round for FEAL-N,
                 we incorporate a substantial strength against both
                 Linear Cryptanalysis --- LC --- and Differential
                 Cryptanalysis --- DC --- at the cost of increasing the
                 encryption software running time in about 10\%. By
                 running the most efficient known searching algorithms
                 on a multi-processor with 32 micro-processors, we found
                 the very likely best linear relations from 3 to 9
                 rounds, with probability deviation (i.e., probability
                 distance from 1/2) ranging from 2[superscript -5] to
                 2[superscript -19], respectively; and we show LC for
                 FEAL-16 with swap, using these linear relations, has
                 complexity 2p67s when the type 0R attack is applied (as
                 opposed to 2p41s with type 0R attack, for the original
                 FEAL-16). Thus its LC complexity is larger than
                 enumerating all possible keys (2p64s). We also show
                 FEAL-16 with swap is as strong as the original FEAL-24
                 against LC. We also found the very likely best
                 differential characteristics for up to 8 rounds for
                 FEAL with swap, and show these characteristics are not
                 useful for DC either --- for FEAL-16 with swap, the DC
                 complexity is 2p72s with type 2R attack (as opposed to
                 2p30s for the original FEAL-16, with type 2R attack).
                 We also show FEAL-16 with swap is stronger against DC
                 than the original FEAL-32.",

  annote =       "Steganography, or information hiding, is the study of
                 methods to hide data within a medium. Handwritten
                 communications, digital images, digital video and
                 digital music are examples of various media in which
                 data can be hidden. A primary application of
                 steganography is the ``watermarking'' of digital
                 information. Just as paper money, governmental
                 documents, and even official school transcripts contain
                 watermarks to prevent unauthorized reproduction,
                 vendors seek to watermark their digital information to
                 prevent piracy. Methods of steganography can also be
                 used to create covert channels. A covert channel is a
                 public medium used to transmit private information.
                 Data can be embedded using a steganographic algorithm
                 in order to transmit private information rather than
                 authenticate ownership. Media such as image data, sound
                 data or even the access times of a file, can be used as
                 covert channels. Minimax algebra is known to have
                 applications to machine scheduling, operations
                 research, and image algebra. Raymond Cuninghame-Green
                 provided the groundbreaking work in this area. Minimax
                 algebra provides parallels to linear algebra by
                 extending the real numbers and introducing new
                 operations with amazing properties. Ritter and Sussner
                 use minimax algebra as the mathematical foundation for
                 a new image transform called the minimax eigenvalue
                 decomposition (MED). This transform avoids
                 computational difficulties encountered with other
                 techniques used for image layering, compression and
                 transmission. This thesis presents research where
                 properties of the MED transform are used to produce a
                 flexible, computationally robust technique for hiding
                 data within digital images. This new technique can be
                 used to watermark an image or to convert an image into
                 a covert channel. A measure is provided to determine
                 how close an image containing message data is to the
                 original image. Inherent in the technique are keys, or
                 information separate from the message data stored in
                 the image, that can establish authenticity of the image
                 data, making this technique different from most
                 steganography techniques that rely on embedded data
                 integrity to establish authenticity. The technique is
                 applied to ten different real images. An analysis of
                 the results and ideas for future research are
                 presented.",

                 resource for retrieving up-to-date information. But
                 they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the
                 user, since a curious database operator can follow the
                 user's queries and infer what the user is after.
                 Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be
                 kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing
                 the database. It can be shown that when accessing a
                 single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of
                 the user, the whole database should be down-loaded;
                 namely $n$ bits should be communicated (where $n$ is
                 the number of bits in the database). In this work, we
                 investigate whether by replicating the database, more
                 efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem
                 can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user
                 to access $k$ replicated copies of a database ($k \geq
                 2$) and {\em privately\/} retrieve information stored
                 in the database. This means that each individual server
                 (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no
                 information on the identity of the item retrieved by
                 the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain
                 substantial saving. In particular, we present a
                 two-server scheme with communication complexity
                 $O(n^{1/3})$.",

                 1994, pp. F1ff: ``Two researchers have independently
                 broken a code used by the German abbot Johannes
                 Trithemius in his trilogy Steganographia. Trithemius'
                 book has been cited as a prime example of 16th-century
                 black magic, and, even today, believers in witchcraft
                 and demons peruse the book for spells to conjure
                 spirits. However, some people always believed that the
                 volume contained a cleverly disguised code. Several
                 years ago, Thomas Ernst, a professor of German at La
                 Roche College, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, examined the
                 book as a problem in cryptography and published his
                 solution to Trithemius' code in 1996 in the Dutch
                 journal Daphnis, where it went largely unnoticed. Last
                 month, Jim Reeds, a mathematician at AT\&T Labs in
                 Florham Park, New Jersey, also solved the code, and his
                 results have been accepted for publication in
                 Cryptologia. However, the messages encrypted by
                 Trithemius in his book turned out to be disappointingly
                 banal.''",

  abstract =     "The Interactive Video Data System (IVDS) project began
                 with an initial abstract concept of achieving
                 interactive television by transmitting hidden digital
                 information in the audio of commercials. Over the
                 course of three years such a communication method was
                 successfully developed, the hardware systems to realize
                 the application were designed and built, and several
                 full-scale field tests were conducted. The novel coding
                 scheme satisfies all of the design constraints imposed
                 by the project sponsors. By taking advantage of
                 psychoacoustic properties, the hidden digital signature
                 is inaudible to most human observers yet is detectable
                 by the hardware decoder. The communication method is
                 also robust against most extraneous room noise as well
                 as the wow and flutter of videotape machines. The
                 hardware systems designed for the application have been
                 tested and work as intended. A triple-stage audio
                 amplifier buffers the input signal, eliminates low
                 frequency interference such as human voices, and boosts
                 the filtered result to an appropriate level. A codec
                 samples the filtered and amplified audio, and feeds it
                 into the digital signal processor. The DSP, after
                 applying a pre-emphasis and compensation filter,
                 performs the data extraction by calculating FFTs,
                 compensating for frequency shifts, estimating the
                 digital signature, and verifying the result via a
                 cyclic redundancy check. It then takes action
                 appropriate for the command specified in the digital
                 signature. If necessary it will verbally prompt and
                 provide information to the user, and will decode
                 infrared signals from a remote control. The results of
                 interactions are transmitted by radio frequency spread
                 spectrum to a cell cite, where they are then forwarded
                 to the host computer. System requirements: PC, World
                 Wide Web browser and PDF reader. Available

                 cryptographic primitive, and the design principles used
                 to develop Yarrow. We then discuss the ways that PRNGs
                 can fail in practice, which motivates our discussion of
                 the components of Yarrow and how they make Yarrow
                 secure. Next, we define a specific instance of a PRNG
                 in the Yarrow family that makes use of available

                 the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, developed by Wheeler and
                 the late Roger Needham (a former Wheeler research
                 student, later head of the Laboratory and the first
                 managing director of Microsoft Research Ltd). The
                 algorithm was designed in part to `inject some sanity'
                 into the imposition of export controls on encryption
                 software by the US Government in the late 1980s.
                 Wheeler's solution was to devise an encryption
                 algorithm so short, simple and general that it could be
                 memorized and encoded in any language. It proved
                 impossible to put an embargo on what ended up as just
                 eight lines of code---another masterpiece in
                 miniature.'' See \cite{Wheeler:1995:TTE} for the
                 algorithm.\par

                 ``In an email collaboration, Wheeler and Burrows
                 devised a data compression technique based on BWT,
                 which was published as a research report in 1994. The
                 idea was picked up by Dr Dobb's Journal and soon
                 diffused into the commons of computing. Not long after,
                 Burrows received a call from Donald Knuth---asking if
                 he was working with {\em the\/} David Wheeler! Today
                 the technique is the basis of the widely used open
                 source bzip and bzip2 file formats.''",
