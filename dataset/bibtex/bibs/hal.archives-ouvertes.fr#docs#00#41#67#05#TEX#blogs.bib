improved. To answer this question we analyse responses of 62 bloggers and 20 would be 
bloggers along four dimensions: motivation, context, technology and personal characteristics. Our 
results suggest that weblogs are still at an early adoption stage, that they are not as easy to use 
as it is claimed and that there is a need for more studies of weblogs emergent uses before 
blogging will look convincing enough for a majority of users.

@article{Java:2006p1948,
	Abstract = {These days Social Media such as forums, wikis and blogs in particular are playing a 
notable role in influencing the buying patterns of consumers. Often a buyer looks for 
opinions, user experiences and reviews on such sources before purchasing a product. 
Detecting influential nodes and opinion leaders and understanding their role in how 
people perceive and adopt a product or service provides a powerful tool for marketing, 
advertising and business intelligence. This requires new algorithms that build on social 
network analysis, community detection and opinion extraction. 
Studies on influence in social networks and collaboration graphs have considered a 
static view of the network and are based purely on link analysis. These techniques have 
been found to be effective in performing analysis at an aggregate level and to identify 
key individuals who play an important role in propagating information. However, in- 
fluence on the Web is often a function of topic. A blog like Daily Kos that is influential 
in politics is less likely to have an impact on the technology related blogs. Similarly, 
Techcrunch, an extremely popular technology blog might not be influential when it 
comes to politics. We propose the notion of `topical influence' and extend existing 
techniques to make them topic sensitive. 
An important component in understanding influence is to detect sentiment and 
opinions. Changes in opinions, aggregated over many users, can be a predictor for 
an interesting trend in a community. Sufficient adoption of this trend could lead to a 
'tipping point' and consequently influencing the rest of the community. Strong opin- 
ions over time indicate biases. It is important to model bias to target the right audience 
for marketing and advertising. A community of ipod fanatics for example, needs little 
or no convincing about the product. Influencing an opinion leader in such already posi- 
tively biased communities is going to have less significant impact for the product. Here 
we also describe BlogVox, a blog analytics system that we developed for TREC opin- 
ion retrieval task. This system finds opinionated blog posts about a topic. We propose 
to extend this system to track aggregated opinions over many users. 
Finally, we propose to model influence as a temporal phenomenon. The Blo- 
gosphere, being a buzzy and dynamic environment, has new topics emerging constantly 
and blogs rising and falling in popularity. Tracking these changes over time allows us 
to find blogs that are influential versus something that is just briefly popular. For ex- 
ample, many thousands of sites linking to a `Coke Mentos' video in one day indicates 
popularity. But thousands of links accumulated consistently over time by a blog in- 
dicate that it is influential. Additionally, by studying how a meme spreads, we can 
identify key individuals that are either buzz generators or early adopters who create 
sufficient interest on the topic. 
In this thesis we develop an improved influence model that includes components for 
community structure, topic categorization, representation of key beliefs and opinions, 
and a temporal analysis of how these change. We show that his model outperforms 
existing, simpler models by evaluating its precision and recall for appropriate tasks.},

	Abstract = {We present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We first introduce the dK-series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs for d=0,1,2,3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d=2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d=3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and protocol researchers.},

@article{Kossinets:2008p1977,
	Abstract = {Social networks are of interest to researchers in part because they are thought to mediate the flow of information in communities and organizations. Here we study the temporal dynamics of communication using on-line data, including e-mail communication among the faculty and staff of a large university over a two-year period. We formulate a temporal notion of "distance" in the underlying social network by measuring the minimum time required for information to spread from one node to another - a concept that draws on the notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and long-range bridges - a finding that sheds new light on the relationship between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.},

	Abstract = {We argue that social networks differ from most other types of networks, including technological and biological networks, in two important ways. First, they have nontrivial clustering or network transitivity and second, they show positive correlations, also called assortative mixing, between the degrees of adjacent vertices. Social networks are often divided into groups or communities, and it has recently been suggested that this division could account for the observed clustering. We demonstrate that group structure in networks can also account for degree correlations. We show using a simple model that we should expect assortative mixing in such networks whenever there is variation in the sizes of the groups and that the predicted level of assortative mixing compares well with that observed in real-world networks.},

@article{Java:2006p1948,
	Abstract = {These days Social Media such as forums, wikis and blogs in particular are playing a 
notable role in influencing the buying patterns of consumers. Often a buyer looks for 
opinions, user experiences and reviews on such sources before purchasing a product. 
Detecting influential nodes and opinion leaders and understanding their role in how 
people perceive and adopt a product or service provides a powerful tool for marketing, 
advertising and business intelligence. This requires new algorithms that build on social 
network analysis, community detection and opinion extraction. 
Studies on influence in social networks and collaboration graphs have considered a 
static view of the network and are based purely on link analysis. These techniques have 
been found to be effective in performing analysis at an aggregate level and to identify 
key individuals who play an important role in propagating information. However, in- 
fluence on the Web is often a function of topic. A blog like Daily Kos that is influential 
in politics is less likely to have an impact on the technology related blogs. Similarly, 
Techcrunch, an extremely popular technology blog might not be influential when it 
comes to politics. We propose the notion of `topical influence' and extend existing 
techniques to make them topic sensitive. 
An important component in understanding influence is to detect sentiment and 
opinions. Changes in opinions, aggregated over many users, can be a predictor for 
an interesting trend in a community. Sufficient adoption of this trend could lead to a 
'tipping point' and consequently influencing the rest of the community. Strong opin- 
ions over time indicate biases. It is important to model bias to target the right audience 
for marketing and advertising. A community of ipod fanatics for example, needs little 
or no convincing about the product. Influencing an opinion leader in such already posi- 
tively biased communities is going to have less significant impact for the product. Here 
we also describe BlogVox, a blog analytics system that we developed for TREC opin- 
ion retrieval task. This system finds opinionated blog posts about a topic. We propose 
to extend this system to track aggregated opinions over many users. 
Finally, we propose to model influence as a temporal phenomenon. The Blo- 
gosphere, being a buzzy and dynamic environment, has new topics emerging constantly 
and blogs rising and falling in popularity. Tracking these changes over time allows us 
to find blogs that are influential versus something that is just briefly popular. For ex- 
ample, many thousands of sites linking to a `Coke Mentos' video in one day indicates 
popularity. But thousands of links accumulated consistently over time by a blog in- 
dicate that it is influential. Additionally, by studying how a meme spreads, we can 
identify key individuals that are either buzz generators or early adopters who create 
sufficient interest on the topic. 
In this thesis we develop an improved influence model that includes components for 
community structure, topic categorization, representation of key beliefs and opinions, 
and a temporal analysis of how these change. We show that his model outperforms 
existing, simpler models by evaluating its precision and recall for appropriate tasks.},

@article{chung.1,
	Abstract = {In the study of the spectra of power-law graphs, there are basically two competing approaches. One is to prove analogues of Wigner's semicircle law, whereas the other predicts that the eigenvalues follow a power-law distribution. Although the semicircle law and the power law have nothing in common, we will show that both approaches are essentially correct if one considers the appropriate matrices. We will prove that (under certain mild conditions) the eigenvalues of the (normalized) Laplacian of a random power-law graph follow the semicircle law, whereas the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a power-law graph obeys the power law. Our results are based on the analysis of random graphs with given expected degrees and their relations to several key invariants. Of interest are a number of (new) values for the exponent beta, where phase transitions for eigenvalue distributions occur. The spectrum distributions have direct implications to numerous graph algorithms such as, for example, randomized algorithms that involve rapidly mixing Markov chains.},
