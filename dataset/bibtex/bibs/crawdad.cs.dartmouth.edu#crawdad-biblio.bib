		popular. They are commonplace on university campuses and
		inside corporations, and they have started to appear in
		public areas. It is thus becoming increasingly important to
		understand user mobility patterns and network usage
		characteristics on wireless networks. Such an understanding
		would guide the design of applications geared toward mobile
		environments (e.g., pervasive computing applications), would
		help improve simulation tools by providing a more
		representative workload and better user mobility models, and
		could result in a more effective deployment of wireless
		network components. \par Several studies have recently been
		performed on wireless university campus networks and public
		networks. In this paper, we complement previous research by
		presenting results from a four week trace collected in a
		large corporate environment. We study user mobility patterns
		and introduce new metrics to model user mobility. We also
		analyze user and load distribution across access points. We
		compare our results with those from previous studies to
		extract and explain several network usage and mobility
		characteristics. <p> We find that average user transfer-rates
		follow a power law. Load is unevenly distributed across
		access points and is influenced more by which users are
		present than by the number of users. We model user mobility
		with persistence and prevalence . Persistence reflects
		session durations whereas prevalence reflects the frequency
		with which users visit various locations. We find that the
		probability distributions of both measures follow power
		laws.},

		loss on a Wi-Fi network in rural areas and propose a model
		that relates distance with packet loss probability. We show
		that a simple double regression propagation model like the
		one used in the ns-2 simulator can miss important
		transmission impairments that are apparent even at short
		transmitter-receiver distances. Measurements also show that
		packet loss at the frame level is a Bernoullian process for
		time spans of few seconds. We relate the packet loss
		probability to the received signal level using standard
		models for additive white Gaussian noise channels. The
		resulting model is much more similar to the measured channels
		than the simple models where all packets are received when
		the distance is below a given threshold and all are lost when
		the threshold is exceeded.},

		which is difficult to deploy and operate in a DTN, where
		connectivity is sporadic. Furthermore, the complexity of such
		mechanisms may dissuade node participation so strongly that
		potential attacker impacts are dwarfed by the loss of
		contributing participants. In this paper, we use connectivity
		traces from our UMass Diesel- Net project and the Haggle
		project to quantify routing attack effectiveness on a DTN
		that lacks security. We introduce plausible attackers and
		attack modalities and provide complexity results for the
		strongest of attackers. We show that the same routing with
		packet replication used to provide robustness in the face of
		unpredictable mobility allows the network to gracefully
		survive attacks. In the case of the most effective attack,
		acknowledgment counterfeiting, we show a straightforward
		defense that uses cryptographic hashes but not a central
		authority. We conclude that disruption-tolerant networks are
		extremely robust to attack; in our trace-driven evaluations,
		an attacker that has compromised 30% of all nodes reduces
		delivery rates from 70% to 55%, and to 20% with knowledge of
		future events. By comparison, contemporaneously connected
		networks are significantly more fragile },

		location systems has focused on precise location in indoor
		environments. However, many location applications (for
		example, location-aware web search) become interesting only
		when the underlying location system is available ubiquitously
		and is not limited to a single office environment.
		Unfortunately, the installation and calibration overhead
		involved for most of the existing research systems is too
		prohibitive to imagine deploying them across, say, an entire
		city. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of building a
		wide-area 802.11 Wi-Fi-based positioning system. We compare a
		suite of wireless-radio-based positioning algorithms to
		understand how they can be adapted for such ubiquitous
		deployment with minimal calibration. In particular, we study
		the impact of this limited calibration on the accuracy of the
		positioning algorithms. Our experiments show that we can
		estimate a user's position with a median positioning error of
		13--40 meters (depending upon the characteristics of the
		environment). Although this accuracy is lower than existing
		positioning systems, it requires substantially lower
		calibration overhead than existing indoor positioning systems
		and provides easy deployment and coverage across large
		metropolitan areas. Moreover, unlike GPS, it does not require
		line of sight to the sky and consequently works in areas
		where GPS does not (indoors and in dense urban
		environments).},

		is difficult due to the fact that the network graph is rarely

		can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end
		delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move
		freely. This paper presents a multidisciplinary solution
		based on the consideration of the socalled small world
		dynamics which have been proposed for economy and social
		studies and have recently revealed to be a successful
		approach to be exploited for characterising information
		propagation in wireless networks. To this purpose, some
		bridge nodes are identified based on their centrality
		characteristics, i.e., on their capability to broker
		information exchange among otherwise disconnected nodes. Due
		to the complexity of the centrality metrics in populated
		networks the concept of ego networks is exploited where nodes
		are not required to exchange information about the entire
		network topology, but only locally available information is
		considered. Then SimBet Routing is proposed which exploits
		the exchange of pre-estimated ‘betweenness’ centrality
		metrics and locally determined social ‘similarity’ to the
		destination node. We present simulations using real trace
		data to demonstrate that SimBet Routing results in delivery
		performance close to Epidemic Routing but with significantly
		reduced overhead. Additionally, we show that Sim- Bet Routing
		outperforms PRoPHET Routing, particularly when the sending
		and receiving nodes have low connectivity. }

  abstract    =	{ In this paper, we present a systematic experimental study
		of the effect of inter-cell interference on IEEE 802.11
		performance. With increasing penetration of WiFi into
		residential areas and usage in ad hoc conference settings,
		chaotic unplanned deployments are becoming the norm rather
		than an exception. These networks often operate many nearby
		access points and stations on the same channel, either due to
		lack of coordination or insufficient available channels.
		Thus, inter-cell interference is common but not
		well-understood. According to conventional wisdom, the
		efficiency of an 802.11 network is determined by the number
		of active clients. Surprisingly, we find that with a typical
		TCP-dominant workload, cumulative system throughput is
		characterized by the number of interfering access points
		rather than the number of clients. We find that due to TCP
		flow control, the number of backlogged stations in such a
		network equals twice the number of access points. Thus, a
		single access point network proved very robust even with over
		one hundred clients. Multiple interfering access points,
		however, lead to an increase in collisions that reduces
		throughput and affects volume of traffic in the network. },

		mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an explicit proactive
		handoff scheme with motion prediction. Since each user has
		patterns of movement, a mobile node predicts its future
		motion and explicitly notifies its old foreign agent which
		subnet it is likely to handoff to. During a handoff, the old
		foreign agent duplicates and forwards packets to the
		predicted subnets. With our scheme, network-layer handoff
		latency can be reduced to the level of link-layer handoff
		latency, and the number of packets lost during handoffs is
		also minimized. With a real network activity trace, we
		demonstrate that this scheme is able to predict motion
		accurately, with only a small overhead in bandwidth
		consumption and computation. },

		"hubs") with some probability. The daily list of hubs, along

		of mobility profiles with certain probabilities associated
		with each of the profiles. Our analysis of the mobility trace

		exploiting it in performing hub-level location predictions.
		Moreover, such profile based location predictions are found
		not only to be more precise than a common statistical
		approach based on observed hub visitation frequencies, but

		our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless users'
		behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network
		logs from two major university campuses. We represent the
		data using location-preference vectors, and utilize
		unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in user
		behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition
		techniques are used to identify (and differentiate between)
		major patterns. We discover multi-modal user behavior and

		understanding of realistic user behavior in wireless

		behaviors are investigated and two classes of metrics are
		devised to capture the underlying structure of such
		behaviors. For individual user behavior we observe distinct
		patterns in which most users are 'on' for a small fraction of
		the time, the number of access points visited is very small
		and the overall online user mobility is quite low. We clearly
		identify categories of heavy and light users. In general,
		users exhibit high degree of similarity over days and weeks.
		For group behavior, we define metrics for encounter patterns
		and friendship. Surprisingly, we find that a user, on
		average, encounters less than 6\% of the network user
		population within a month, and that encounter and friendship
		relations are highly asymmetric. We establish that number of
		encounters follows a biPareto distribution, while friendship
		indexes follow an exponential distribution. We capture the
		encounter graph using a small world model, the
		characteristics of which reach steady state after only one

		dissemination of data amongst mobile users. Cooperation binds
		but also divides human society into communities. Members of
		the same community interact with each other preferentially.
		There is structure in human society. Within society and its
		communities, individuals have varying popularity. Some people
		are more popular and interact with more people than others;
		we may call them hubs. Popularity ranking is one facet of the
		population. In many physical networks, some nodes are more
		highly connected to each other than to the rest of the
		network. The set of such nodes are usually called clusters,
		communities, cohesive groups or modules. There is structure
		to social networking. Different metrics can be used such as
		information flow, Freeman betweenness, closeness and
		inference power, but for all of them, each node in the
		network can be assigned a global centrality value. What can
		be inferred about individual popularity, and the structure of
		human society from measurements within a network? How can the
		local and global characteristics of the network be used
		practically for information dissemination? We present and
		evaluate a sequence of designs for forwarding algorithms for
		Pocket Switched Networks, culminating in Bubble, which
		exploit increasing levels of information about mobility and

		Mobile devices can make more intelligent decisions about how

		computes location coordinates by listening for RF-emissions

		We first consider the distribution of inter-contact times
		between mobile devices. Using a diverse set of measured
		mobility traces, we find as an invariant property that there
		is a characteristic time, order of half a day, beyond which
		the distribution decays exponentially. Up to this value, the
		distribution in many cases follows a power law, as shown in
		recent work. This power law finding was previously used to
		support the hypothesis that inter-contact time has a power
		law tail, and that common mobility models are not adequate.
		However, we observe that the time scale of interest for
		opportunistic forwarding may be of the same order as the
		characteristic time, and thus the exponential tail is
		important. We further show that already simple models such as
		random walk and random waypoint can exhibit the same
		dichotomy in the distribution of inter-contact time asc in
		empirical traces. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis
		of several properties of human mobility patterns across
		several dimensions, and we present empirical evidence that
		the return time of a mobile device to its favorite location
		site may already explain the observed dichotomy. Our findings
		suggest that existing results on the performance of
		forwarding schemes based on power-law tails might be overly
		pessimistic. }

  abstract    =	{ Fingerprinting is a popular technology for 802.11-based
		positioning systems: Radio characteristics from different
		access points are measured at various positions and stored in
		a database. The database is copied to all mobile devices, and
		in case that a position estimate is needed, the device
		compares its currently measured radio characteristics with
		all the database entries. In this paper, we present two
		on-demand fingerprint selection algorithms to avoid the
		cumbersome and time-consuming approach of manually copying
		all fingerprints. Our algorithms only request those
		fingerprints from the database that are currently required to
		compute a position. The two algorithms differ in the way they
		shape the region for which fingerprints are requested.
		On-demand selection also allows storage-restricted mobile
		devices to utilize the positioning system. We carefully
		evaluate our algorithms in a real-world experiment. The
		results show that our algorithms do not harm the position
		accuracy of the positioning system. In addition, we analyze
		the space requirements of our algorithms and show that the
		typical constraints of mobile devices are met. },

		within the target group, which consists of data sinks. We
		conducted an experiment in Cambridge, UK, to gather mobility

		nodes move throughout an environment working to gather and
		process information about their surroundings. As in many
		sensor or wireless systems, nodes have critical resource
		constraints such as processing speed, memory size, and energy
		supply; they also face special hardware issues such as
		sensing device sample time, data storage/access restrictions,
		and wireless transceiver capabilities. This paper discusses
		and evaluates ZebraNet's system design decisions in the face
		of a range of real-world constraints.
		
		Impala-ZebraNet's middleware layer - serves as a light-weight
		operating system, but also has been designed to encourage
		application modularity, simplicity, adaptivity, and
		repairability. Impala is now implemented on ZebraNet hardware
		nodes, which include a 16-bit microcontroller, a low-power
		GPS unit, a 900MHz radio, and 4Mbits of non-volatile FLASH
		memory. This paper discusses Impala's operation scheduling
		and event handling model, and explains how system constraints
		and goals led to the interface designs we chose between the
		application, middleware, and firmware layers. We also
		describe Impala's network interface which unifies media
		access control and transport control into an efficient
		network protocol. With the minimum overhead in communication,
		buffering, and processing, it supports a range of message
		models, all inspired by and tailored to ZebraNet's
		application needs. By discussing design tradeoffs in the
		context of a real hardware system and a real sensor network
		application, this paper's design choices and performance
		measurements offer some concrete experiences with software
		systems issues for the mobile sensor design space. More
		generally, we feel that these experiences can guide design
		choices in a range of related systems. },

		The goal is to select the best AP and beam combination at

		identified using our techniques, but our ability to identify
		users is not uniform; some users are not easily identifiable.
		Nonetheless, we show that even a single implicit identifier

		can be much more difficult than it might first appear. We
		present a number of strategies drawn from experiences for
		avoiding or overcoming some of the pitfalls. In particular,
		we discuss dealing with errors and inaccuracies; the
		importance of associating meta-data with measurements; the
		technique of calibrating measurements by examining outliers
		and testing for consistencies; difficulties that arise with
		large-scale measurements; the utility of developing a
		discipline for reliably reproducing analysis results; and

		framework capable of exploiting this augmented expressive
		power (Haggle). Our solution, Bedouin, enables both systems
		to run on resource-constrained devices. It facilitates
		meaningful data exchanges in challenged networks supporting
		the principle of infrastructure-independent networking, and
		exploiting human mobility and opportunistic connectivity. The

		We show that wireless traces contain sufficient information
		to measure their completeness and clock accuracy.
		Specifically, packet sequence numbers indicate when packets
		have been dropped, and AP beacon intervals help determine the
		accuracy of packet timestamps. We also show that trace
		completeness and clock accuracy can vary based on load. We
		apply these metrics to evaluate fidelity in two ways: (1) to
		visualize the completeness of different 802.11 traces, which
		we show with several traces available on CRAWDAD and (2) to

		reports on the results of the first extensive empirical

		compared the prediction accuracy of several location
		predictors drawn from two major families of
		domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based and
		compression-based predictors. We found that low-order Markov
		predictors performed as well or better than the more complex
		and more space-consuming compression-based predictors.
		Predictors of both families fail to make a prediction when
		the recent context has not been previously seen. To overcome
		this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each
		predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its
		accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the Order-2
		Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor we
		studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72\% for users
		with long trace lengths. We also investigated a
		simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction
		is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past,
		but the most recent, resulting in significant space and
		computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with
		this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard
		Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered
		several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter
		tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered
		that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with
		a discussion and suggestions for further work. },

		reports on the results of the first extensive empirical
		evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of
		the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth's
		campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. We implemented and
		compared the prediction accuracy of several location
		predictors drawn from four major families of
		domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based,
		compression-based, PPM, and SPM predictors. We found that
		low-order Markov predictors performed as well or better than
		the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based
		predictors. Predictors of both families fail to make a
		prediction when the recent context has not been previously
		seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback
		feature to each predictor and found that it significantly
		enhanced its accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the
		Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor
		we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72\% for
		users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a
		simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction
		is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past,
		but the most recent, resulting in significant space and
		computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with
		this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard
		Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered
		several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter
		tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered
		that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with
		a discussion and suggestions for further work.},

		Handoff prediction in wireless networks has long been

		We study the effect of mobility prediction for a large

		traces collected from a large production wireless network to
		evaluate several major families of handoff-location
		prediction techniques, a set of handoff-time predictors, and
		a predictor that jointly predicts handoff location and time.
		We also propose a fallback mechanism, which uses a
		lower-order predictor whenever a higher-order predictor fails
		to predict. We found that low-order Markov predictors, with
		our proposed fallback mechanisms, performed as well or better
		than the more complex and more space-consuming
		compression-based handoff-location predictors. Although our
		handoff-time predictor had modest prediction accuracy, in the
		context of mobile voice applications we found that bandwidth
		reservation strategies can benefit from the combined location
		and time handoff predictor, significantly reducing the
		call-drop rate without significantly increasing the
		call-block rate. We also developed a prediction-based routing
		protocol for mobile opportunistic networks. We evaluated and
		compared our protocol's performance to five existing routing
		protocols, using simulations driven by real mobility traces.
		We found that the basic routing protocols are not practical
		for large-scale opportunistic networks. Prediction-based

  abstract    =	{The simulation of mobile networks calls for a mobility model
		to generate the trajectories of the mobile users (or nodes).
		It has been shown that the mobility model has a major
		influence on the behavior of the system. Therefore, using a
		realistic mobility model is important if we want to increase
		the confidence that simulations of mobile systems are
		meaningful in realistic settings. In this paper we present an
		executable mobility model that uses real-life mobility
		characteristics to generate mobility scenarios that can be
		used for network simulations. We present a structured
		framework for extracting the mobility characteristics from a
		WLAN trace, for processing the mobility characteristics to
		determine a parameter set for the mobility model, and for
		using a parameter set to generate mobility scenarios for
		simulations. To derive the parameters of the mobility model,
		we measure the mobility characteristics of users of a campus
		wireless network. Therefore, we call this model the WLAN
		mobility model. Mobility analysis confirms properties
		observed by other research groups. The validation shows that
		the WLAN model maps the real-world mobility characteristics
		to the abstract world of network simulators with a very small
		error. For users that do not have the possibility to capture
		a WLAN trace, we explore the value space of the WLAN model
		parameters and show how different parameters sets influence
		the mobility of the simulated nodes.},

  abstract    =	{ In many delay tolerant applications, information is
		opportunistically exchanged between mobile devices who
		encounter each other. In order to effect such information
		exchange, mobile devices must have knowledge of other devices
		in their vicinity. We consider scenarios in which there is no
		infrastructure and devices must probe their environment to
		discover other devices. This can be an extremely energy
		consuming process and highlights the need for energy
		conscious contact probing mechanisms. If devices probe very
		infrequently, they might miss many of their contacts. On the
		other hand, frequent contact probing might be energy
		inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off
		between the probability of missing a contact and the contact
		probing frequency. First, via theoretical analysis, we
		characterize the trade-off between the probability of a
		missed contact and the contact probing interval for
		stationary processes. Next, for time varying contact arrival
		rates, we provide an optimization framework to compute the
		optimal contact probing interval as a function of the arrival
		rate. We characterize real world contact patterns via
		Bluetooth phone contact logging experiments and show that the
		contact arrival process is self-similar. We design STAR, a
		contact probing algorithm which adapts to the contact arrival
		process. Via trace driven simulations on our experimental
		data, we show that STAR consumes three times less energy when
