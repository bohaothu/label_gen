  abstract =     "Traffic measurements on a ring local area computer
                 network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                 are presented. The analysis of the arrival pattern
                 shows that the arrival processes are neither Poisson
                 nor compound Poisson. An alternative model called
                 ``Packet Train'' is proposed.\par

                 In the train model, the traffic on the network consists
                 of a number of packet streams between various pairs of
                 nodes on the network. Each node-pair stream (or
                 node-pair process, as we call them) consists of a
                 number of trains. Each train consists of a number of
                 packets (or cars) going in either direction (from node
                 A to B or from node B to A). The intercar gap is large
                 (compared to packet transmission time) and random. The
                 intertrain time is even larger. The Poisson and the
                 compound Poisson arrivals are shown to be special cases
                 of the train arrival model.\par

                 Another important observation is that the packet
                 arrivals exhibit a ``source locality.'' If a packet is
                 seen on the network going from A to B, the probability
                 of the next packet going from A to B or from B to A is
                 very high.\par

                 Implications of the train arrivals and of source
                 locality on the design of bridges, gateways, and
                 reservation protocols are discussed. A number of open
                 problems requiring development of analysis techniques
                 for systems with train arrival processes are also
                 described.",

  abstract =     "Widespread use of computer networks and the use of
                 varied technology for the interconnection of computers
                 has made congestion a significant problem.\par

                 In this report, we summarize our research on congestion
                 avoidance. We compare the concept of congestion
                 avoidance with that of congestion control.\par

                 Briefly, congestion control is a recovery mechanism,
                 while congestion avoidance is a prevention mechanism. A
                 congestion control scheme helps the network to recover
                 from the congestion state while a congestion avoidance
                 scheme allows a network to operate in the region of low
                 delay and high throughput with minimal queuing, thereby
                 preventing it from entering the congested state in
                 which packets are lost due to buffer shortage.\par

                 A number of possible alternatives for congestion
                 avoidance were identified. From these alternatives we
                 selected one called the binary feedback scheme in which
                 the network uses a single bit in the network layer
                 header to feed back the congestion information to its
                 users, which then increase or decrease their load to
                 make optimal use of the resources. The concept of
                 global optimality in a distributed system is defined in
                 terms of efficiency and fairness such that they can be
                 independently quantified and apply to any number of
                 resources and users.\par

                 The proposed scheme has been simulated and shown to be
                 globally efficient, fair, responsive, convergent,
                 robust, distributed, and configuration-independent.",

                 bandwidths, is growing exponentially. To support these
                 large, high-speed networks, it is necessary to be able
                 to forward packets in a few microseconds. One part of
                 the forwarding operation consists of searching through
                 a large address database. This problem is encountered
                 in the design of bridges, routers, gateways and name
                 servers.\par

                 Caching can reduce the lookup time if there is a
                 locality in the address reference pattern. Using a
                 destination reference trace measured on an extended
                 local are a network, we attempt to see if the
                 destination references do have a significant

                 We compared the performance of MIN, LRU, FIFO, and

                 follow the LRU stack model while the noninteractive
                 traffic did. Examples are shown of the environments in
                 which caching can help as well as those in which
                 caching can hurt, unless the cache size is large.",

  abstract =     "In heterogeneous networks, achieving congestion
                 avoidance is difficult because the congestion feedback
                 from one subnetwork may have no meaning to source on
                 other other subnetworks. We propose using changes in
                 round-trip delay as an implicit feedback. Using a
                 black-box model of the network, we derive an expression
                 for the optimal window as a function of the gradient of
                 the delay-window curve.\par

                 The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are
                 also addressed. It is shown that without a careful
                 design, it is possible to get into a race condition
                 during heavy congestion, where each user wants more
                 resources than others, thereby leading to a diverging
                 congestion.\par

                 It is shown that congestion avoidance using round trip
                 delay is a promising approach. The aproach has the
                 advantage that there is absolutely no overhead for the
                 network itself. It is exemplified by a simple scheme.
                 The performance of the scheme is analyzed using a
                 simulation model. The scheme is shown to be efficient,
                 fair, convergent and adaptive to changes in network
                 configuration.\par

                 The scheme as described works only for networks that
                 can ne modelled with queueing servers with constant
                 service times. Further research is required to extend
                 it for implementation in practical networks. Several
                 directions for future research have been suggested.",

                 A simple definition for congestion based on supply and

                 (LAN) standard being developed by the American National
                 Standard Institute (ANSI).\par

                 We analyze the impact of various design decisions on
                 the error detection capability of the protocol. In
                 particular, we quantify frame error rate, token loss
                 rate, and undetected error rate. Several
                 characteristics of the 32-bit frame check sequence
                 (FCS) polynomial, which is also used in IEEE 802 LAN
                 protocols, are discussed.\par

                 The standard uses a ``non-return to zero invert on
                 ones'' (NRZI) signal encoding and a 4 bit-to-5 bit
                 (4B/5B) symbol encoding in the physical layer. Due to
                 the combination of NRZI and 4B/5B encoding, many noise
                 events are detected by code (or symbol) violations. A
                 large percentage of errors is also detected by framing
                 violations. Some of the remaining errors are detected
                 by FCS violations. The errors that escape these three
                 violations remain undetected. The probability of
                 undetected errors due to creation of false starting
                 delimiters, false ending delimiters, or merging of two
                 frames is analyzed.\par

                 It is shown that every noise event results in two
                 code-bit errors, which in turn may result in up to four
                 data-bit errors. The FCS can detect up to two noise
                 events. Creation of a false starting delimiter or
                 ending delimiter on a symbol boundary also requires two
                 noise events. This assumes enhanced frame validity
                 criteria. We justify the enhancements by quantifying
                 their effect.\par

                 This analysis here is limited to noise events not
                 resulting in a change of symbol boundaries. Extensions
                 to the case of changed symbol boundaries is continuing
                 and will be presented at a later time.",

                 configuration and workload parameters such as the
                 extent of the ring, the number of stations on the ring,
                 the number of stations that are waiting to transmit,
                 and the frame size. In addition, one key parameter that
                 network managers can control to improve performance is
                 the target token rotation time (TTRT). Analytical
                 modeling and simulation methods were used to
                 investigate the effect of the TTRT on various
                 performance metrics for different ring configurations.
                 This analysis demonstrated that setting the TTRT at 8
                 milliseconds provides good performance over a wide
                 range of configurations and workloads.",

                 precise determination of location, velocity, direction,
                 and time. The price of GPS receivers is falling rapidly
                 and the applications are growing. PCMCIA receivers that
                 can be connected to any notebook personal computers are
                 available for \$300-400 to end consumers.\par

                 The main goal of this study was to survey current
                 applications of GPS to distributed systems and
                 networks. While GPS is appearing in the computer
                 magazines very often and while many computer companies
                 have announced GPS related efforts, most such efforts
                 are in providing navigational guidance to drivers.
                 Digitized city maps along with a GPS sensor on a mobile
                 computer provide directions to drivers. A number of
                 consortiums have been formed by companies such as IBM,
                 Apple, Toshiba, Sony, and others.\par

                 Currently, applications of GPS for distributed
                 computation and networking are limited to measuring
                 delays in Wolter and Golderman's DA-30 network
                 analyzers and in clock synchronization in synchronous
                 optical networks (SONET) used in telecommunication
                 networks.\par

                 We have identified twenty new applications of GPS for
                 distributed computing and networking. These
                 applications include circuit switching using
                 synchronized clocks, synchronous slotted systems, clock
                 synchronization in distributed systems, database
                 synchronization, connectionless real-time

                 email delivery based on geographic location,
                 distributed robot control and navigation, and equipment
                 location marking for maintenance crew.\par

                 There two main obstacles to applications of GPS. First
                 is that GPS antennas must point to open sky. They
                 cannot be used directly inside a building. Unless this
                 is avoided by new antenna designs or by rebroadcasting
                 GPS data inside a building, the use of GPS techniques
                 is limited to improving the performance of distributed
                 systems rather than proper operation. This is similar
                 to cache memories in computer systems. Systems can
                 operate without cache but perform better with cache.
                 The second obstacle is the pseudo-random noise
                 introduced in the GPS signals by the defense department
                 to disallow other governments from using the full
                 precision of GPS. This is called selective
                 availability. Fortunately, this can be easily overcome
                 by differential GPS techniques.\par

                 Detailed lists of GPS products, current applications,
                 addresses of manufacturers, and sources for further
                 information are included in this report.",

  abstract =     "During the design of ABR traffic management at the ATM
                 Forum, we performed several analyses to ensure that the
                 ABR service will operate efficiently over satellite
                 links. In the cases where the performance was
                 unacceptable, we suggested modifications to the traffic
                 management specifications. This paper describes one
                 such issue related to the count of missing resource
                 management cells (Crm) parameter of the ABR source
                 behavior. The analysis presented here led to the
                 changes which are now part of the ATM traffic
                 management (TM 4.0) specification. In particular, the
                 size of the transient buffer exposure (TBE) parameter
                 was set to 24 bits, and no size was enforced for the
                 Crm parameter. This simple change improved the
                 throughput over OC-3 satellite links from 45 Mbps to
                 140 Mbps.",

                 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). It is hence
                 interesting to study the performance of reliable data
                 transport protocols like TCP over ABR. We study the
                 effect of running large unidirectional file transfer
                 applications on TCP over ABR with an explicit rate
                 algorithm (ERICA) implemented at the ATM switches. The
                 study shows that it is possible to get maximum TCP
                 throughput when there are enough buffers at the
                 switches and the sources are rate-limited by ABR.
                 However, when the number of buffers is smaller, there
                 is a large reduction in throughput even though the Cell
                 Loss Ratio (CLR) is very small and the sources are
                 window-limited by TCP. The primary reason for the large
                 throughput degradation is the TCP timer granularity
                 (which affects the timeout interval) and retransmission
                 of duplicate packets which are discarded at the
                 destination. We show that switch buffers should not be
                 dimensioned based on the ABR Source parameter Transient
                 Buffer Exposure (TBE). When ABR capacity is varied, we
                 find that CLR exhibits high variance and is not a good
                 indicator of TCP performance. Further, larger buffers
                 and a larger number of TCP sources increase TCP
                 throughput. Even when buffers are small, dropping of
                 End of Message (EOM) cells should be avoided. This
                 avoids merging of packets at the destination AAL5 and

                 and computer industries, computer networking is
                 adopting a new paradigm called Asynchronous Transfer
                 Mode (ATM) networking. ATM networks have multiple
                 service classes allow audio, video and data to share
                 the same network. Of these, the Available Bit Rate
                 (ABR) service class is designed to efficiently support
                 data traffic.\par

                 Traffic management involves the design of a set of
                 mechanisms which ensure that the network bandwidth,
                 buffer and computational resources are efficiently
                 utilized while meeting the various Quality of Service
                 (QoS) guarantees given to sources as part of a traffic
                 contract. The general problem of network traffic
                 management involves all the available traffic classes.
                 In this dissertation, we address the problem of
                 designing traffic management mechanisms for one class -
                 the ABR service class in ATM networks.\par

                 We consider five aspects of this problem in this
                 dissertation. First, the ABR service requires a
                 mechanism to carry rate feedback from the network
                 switches to the sources. We design three switch
                 algorithms (the OSU scheme, the ERICA and ERICA+
                 schemes) which calculate the rate allocations to
                 satisfy different sets of goals. Second, we design a
                 set of source end system mechanisms which respond to
                 network feedback, and perform control in the case when
                 feedback is disrupted or is stale. Third, we validate
                 the performance of the service for various ABR and VBR
                 demand patterns. Specifically, we study the case of
                 Internet traffic over ATM-ABR. Fourth, we consider the
                 switch design issues for a specific ABR framework
                 option called the ``Virtual Source/Virtual
                 Destination'' option. Finally, we discuss
                 cost/performance issues pertaining to the
                 implementation of the service.\par

                 In summary, this dissertation work addresses
                 fundamental issues in ATM ABR traffic management, and
                 the techniques developed are applicable to a wider
                 class of high-speed packet networks.",

                 ATM network consists of a space segment of satellites
                 connected by inter-satellite crosslinks, and a ground
                 segment of the various ATM networks. A satellite-ATM
                 interface module connects the satellite network to the
                 ATM networks and performs various call and control
                 functions. A network control center performs various
                 network management and resource allocation functions.
                 Several issues such as the ATM service model, media
                 access protocols, and traffic management issues must be
                 considered when designing a satellite ATM network to
                 effectively transport Internet traffic. We have
                 presented the buffer requirements for TCP/IP traffic
                 over ATM-UBR for satellite latencies. Our results are
                 based on TCP with selective acknowledgments and a
                 per-VC buffer management policy at the switches. A
                 buffer size of about 0.5 * RTT to 1 * RTT is sufficient
                 to provide over 98\% throughput to infinite TCP traffic
                 for long latency networks and a large number of
                 sources. This buffer requirement is independent of the
                 number of sources.The fairness is high for a large
                 numbers of sources because of the per-VC buffer
                 management performed at the switches and the nature of
                 TCP traffic.",

                 a switch needs to determine the effective number of
                 active connections. In this paper, we propose a method
                 for determining the number of active connections and
                 the fair bandwidth share for each. We prove the
                 efficiency and fairness of the proposed method
                 analytically, and simulate it by incorporating it into
                 the ERICA switch algorithm.",

                 and implementation issues for GFR. We present the
                 design of buffer management and policing mechanisms to

                 uses a closed-loop rate-based traffic management
                 framework where the network divides left-over bandwidth
                 among contending sources. The ATM Forum traffic
                 management group also incorporated open-loop control
                 capabilities to make the ABR service robust to
                 temporary network failures and source inactivity. An
                 important problem addressed was whether rate

                 do not use them. The proposed solutions, popularly
