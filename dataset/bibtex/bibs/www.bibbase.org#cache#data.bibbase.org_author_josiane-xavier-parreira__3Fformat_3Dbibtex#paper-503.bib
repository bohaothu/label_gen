  abstract = {We present RDF On the Go, a full-edged RDF storage and SPARQL query processor for mobile devices. Implemented by adapting the widely used Jena and ARQ Semantic Web Toolkit and query engine, it uses Berkeley DB for storing the RDF data, R-Trees for indexing spatial data indexing and a query processor that supports both standard and spatial queries. By storing and querying RDF data locally at the user&#39;s mobile device, RDF On the Go contributes to improving scalability, decreasing transmission costs, and controlling access to user&#39;s personal information. It also enables the development of a next generation of mobile applications. RDF On the Go is available for the Android platform and can be downloaded at http://rdfonthego.googlecode.com/.},
