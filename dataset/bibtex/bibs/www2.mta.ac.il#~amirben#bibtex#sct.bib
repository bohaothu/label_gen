%%% sct.bib - papers on Size-Change Termination, including generation of
%%% size-change data by program analysis.
%%% The purpose of this file is to help you find out what has been done around
%%% size-change termination, and therefore it omits a lot of relevant work
%%% that is not directly related to this project.
%%% It does include some work that does not use the term "size-change
%%% termination" (possibly predating it), but in essence belongs with the
%%% size-change termination approach.

  month = {september},
  abstract = {Lee, Jones and Ben-Amram introduced size-change termination,
a decidable property strictly stronger than termination. They invented a
method called the Size-change Principle to analyze it. Based on the work
of Jones and Bohr, we propose an extension of the size-change principle to
a subset of ML featuring ground type values, higher-order type values and
recursively defined functions. This is the first time that the size-change
principle is applied to a higher-order functional language. The language
handles natively if-then-else and let rec structures. The resulting
algorithm produces the expected result for higher-order values but can
also analyze the size of ground type values. This enhances the scope of
the termination analyzer to some recursively defined function operating on
numbers.},
