                 Gaussian elimination on both local and shared memory
                 parallel computers. There is a natural parallelism to
                 Gaussian elimination that has been frequently
                 exploited. The author takes advantage of this
                 parallelism in addition to that provided by the
                 sparsity itself. He discusses this latter parallelism
                 in some detail. An approach that exploits the
                 parallelism due to the sparsity and that can
                 automatically benefit also from the parallelism of
                 Gaussian elimination is discussed. This approach, which
                 is applicable to quite general systems, is based on a
                 multifrontal technique. The author looks at the
                 implementation of the multifrontal approach on shared
                 memory machines and discusses its implementation on a

  abstract =     "It is now ten years since the first CRAY-1 was
                 delivered to Los Alamos National Laboratory. Since
                 then, supercomputers with vector processing capability
                 have become widespread and important in the solution of
                 problems in many areas of science and engineering
                 involving large-scale computing. Their influence on
                 numerical analysis has been less dramatic but the paper
                 indicates the extent of that influence. In the last
                 year or so, advanced superminis that exhibit various
                 more general forms of parallelism have been developed
                 and marketed. The paper identifies these and gives some
                 general principles which algorithm designers are using
                 to take advantage of these parallel architectures. It
                 argues that parallel processors are having a much
                 stronger influence on numerical analysis than vector
                 processors and illustrates these claims with examples
                 from several areas of numerical analysis including
                 linear algebra, optimization, and the solution of
                 partial differential equations.",

                 computers with a global shared memory using Level 2 and
                 Level 3 BLAS. They demonstrate how the Level 3 BLAS can
                 be used to exploit parallelism, and that, though an
                 optimal implementation of the code depends on the
                 characteristics of the target computer, high
                 performance can be reached by taking advantage of both
                 vectorization and concurrency. Of course, the
                 performance obtained is closely linked to the
                 efficiency of the Level 3 BLAS available on the target
                 computer. The authors have seen that the parallel
                 version of LU factorization only provides a small
                 performance improvement over the version using only
                 parallel BLAS on the CRAY-2 and the IBM 3090. They have
                 observed that, although the CRAY-2 is a very powerful
                 vector computer, it has some limitations in its use in
                 a multiprocessing mode. On the ALLIANT FX/80, they can
                 efficiently parallelize all the BLAS kernels (including
                 Level 1 and Level 2 BLAS) using microtasking so that

                 multiplications and the solution of triangular systems
                 with multiple right-hand sides. They are intended to

                 is now recognized to be a practically useful technique
                 once matrix dimensions exceed about 100. We pay
                 particular attention to the numerical stability of
                 these ``fast BLAS3.'' Error bounds are given and their
                 significance is explained and illustrated with the aid

                 merit careful consideration in many applications.",

                 the BBN TC2000 comes from its interconnection network

                 permutations. It is shown how the basic method can be
                 accelerated by using the conjugate gradient (CG)
                 algorithm. This acceleration is very dependent on a
                 partitioning of the original system and several
                 possible partitionings are discussed. Underdetermined
                 systems corresponding to the subproblems of the
                 partitioned system are solved using the Harwell sparse
                 symmetric indefinite solver MA27 on an augmented
                 system. These systems are independent and can be solved
                 in parallel. An analysis of the iteration matrix for
                 the conjugate gradient acceleration leads to the
                 consideration of rather unusual and novel scalings of
                 the matrix that alter the spectrum of the iteration
                 matrix to reduce the number of CG iterations. The
                 various aspects of this algorithm have been tested by
                 runs on an eight-processor Alliant FX\slash 80 on four
                 block tridiagonal systems, two from fluid dynamics
                 simulations and two from the literature. The effect of
                 partitioning and scaling on the number of iterations
                 and overall elapsed time for solution is studied. In
                 all cases, an accurate solution with rapid convergence
                 can be obtained.",

  abstract =     "Block algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in
                 matrix computations. Since their basic unit of data is
                 a submatrix rather than a scalar, they have a higher
                 level of granularity than point algorithms, and this
                 makes them well suited to high-performance computers.
                 The numerical stability of the block algorithms in the
                 new linear algebra program library LAPACK is
                 investigated here. It is shown that these algorithms
                 have backward error analyses in which the backward
                 error bounds are commensurate with the error bounds for
                 the underlying level-3 BLAS (BLAS3). One implication is
                 that the block algorithms are as stable as the
                 corresponding point algorithms when conventional BLAS3
                 are used. A second implication is that the use of BLAS3
                 based on fast matrix multiplication techniques affects
                 the stability only insofar as it increases the constant
                 terms in the normwise backward error bounds. For linear
                 equation solvers employing {\em LU} factorization, it
                 is shown that fixed precision iterative refinement
                 helps to mitigate the effect of the larger error
                 constants. Despite the positive results presented here,
                 not all plausible block algorithms are stable; we
                 illustrate this with the example of {\em LU}
                 factorization with block triangular factors and
                 describe how to check a block algorithm for stability
                 without doing a full error analysis.",

                 real unsymmetric matrix that are the rightmost,
                 leftmost, or are of the largest modulus. A subspace
                 iteration algorithm is used to compute a sequence of
                 sets of vectors that converge to an orthonormal basis
                 for the invariant subspace corresponding to the
                 required eigenvalues. This algorithm is combined with
                 Chebychev acceleration if the rightmost or leftmost
                 eigenvalues are sought, or if the eigenvalues of
                 largest modulus are known to be the rightmost or
                 leftmost eigenvalues. An option exists for computing
                 the corresponding eigenvectors. The code does not need
                 the matrix explicitly since it only requires the user
                 to multiply sets of vectors by the matrix.
                 Sophisticated and novel iteration controls, stopping
                 criteria, and restart facilities are provided. The code

                 Algebra Subprograms and associated kernels for sparse
                 matrices. A major goal is to design and develop a
                 common framework to enable efficient, and portable,
                 implementations of iterative algorithms for sparse
                 matrices on high-performance computers. We have
                 designed the routines to shield the developer of
                 mathematical software from most of the complexities of
                 the various data structures used for sparse matrices.
                 We have kept the interface and suite of codes as simple
                 as possible while at the same time including sufficient
                 functionality to cover most sparse matrix data
                 structures. An important aspect of our framework is
                 that it can be easily extended to incorporate new
                 kernels if the need arises. We discuss the design,
                 implementation, and use of subprograms for the
                 multiplication of a full matrix by a sparse one and for
                 the solution of sparse triangular systems with one or
                 more (full) right-hand sides. We include a routine for
                 checking the input data, generating a new sparse data
                 structure from that input, and scaling a sparse matrix.
                 The new data structure for the transformation can be
                 specified by the user or can be chosen automatically by
                 vendors to be efficient on their machines. We also
                 include a routine for permuting the columns of a sparse
                 matrix and one for permuting the rows of a full
                 matrix.",

                 multifrontal methods for the solution of large sparse
                 sets of unsymmetric linear equations. In the
                 multifrontal method, work on a frontal matrix can be
                 suspended, the frontal matrix can be stored for later
                 reuse, and a new frontal matrix can be generated. There
                 are thus several frontal matrices stored during the
                 factorization, and one or more of these are assembled
                 (summed) when creating a new frontal matrix. Although
                 this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be
                 handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the
                 frontal matrices together and can be costly because
                 indirect addressing is required. The (uni)frontal
                 method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix
                 with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are
                 added to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns
                 are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher
                 fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted
                 into a variable-band form with small profile. We
                 consider a combined unifrontal/multifrontal algorithm
                 to enable general fill-in reduction orderings to be
                 applied without the data movement of previous
                 multifrontal approaches. We discuss this technique in
                 the context of a code designed for the solution of
                 sparse systems with unsymmetric pattern.",
