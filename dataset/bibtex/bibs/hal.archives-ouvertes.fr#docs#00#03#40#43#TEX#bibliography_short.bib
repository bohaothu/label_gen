   abstract = {We investigate the problem of defining Hilbertian metrics resp.
positive definite kernels on probability measures, continuing previous work. This type of kernels has shown very good
results in text classification and has a wide range of possible
applications. In this paper we extend the two-parameter family of
Hilbertian metrics of Topsoe such that it now includes all
commonly used Hilbertian metrics on probability measures. This
allows us to do model selection among these metrics in an elegant
and unified way. Second we investigate further our approach to
incorporate similarity information of the probability space into
the kernel. The analysis provides a better understanding of these
kernels and gives in some cases a more efficient way to compute
them. Finally we compare all proposed kernels in two text and two
image classification problems.}

  ABSTRACT = {
We propose a new system for predicting the splice form of Caenorhabditis elegans
genes. As a first step we generate a clean set of genes from available exressed
sequence tags (EST) and complete complementary (cDNA) sequences. From all
such genes we then generate potential acceptor and donor sites as they would be
required by any gene finder. This leads to a clean set of true and decoy splice
sites. In a second step we use support vector machines (SVMs) with appropriately
designed kernels to learn to distinguish between true and decoy sites. Using the
newly generated data and the novel kernels we could considerably improve our
previous results on the same task.
   In the last step we design and test a new splice finder system that combines the
SVM predictions with additional statistical information about splicing. Using this
system we are able to predict the exon-intron structure of a given gene with known
translation initiation and stop co don site. The system has been tested successfully
on a newly generated set of genes and compared with GenScan. We found that our
system predicts the correct splice form for more than 92\% of these genes, whereas
GenScan only achieves 77.5\% accuracy.}

   abstract = {Traditional classification approaches generalize poorly on image
classification tasks, because of the high dimensionality of the feature space.
This paper shows that Support Vector Machines (SVM) can generalize well on
difficult image classification problems where the only features are high
dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form
$K(mathbf{x},mathbf{y})=e^{-rhosum_i |x_i^a-y_i^a|^{b}}$ with $aleq 1$
and $b leq 2$ are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from
the Corel Stock Photo Collection and shown to far outperform traditional
polynomial or Gaussian RBF kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple
remapping of the input $x_i rightarrow x_i^a$ improves the performance of
linear SVMs to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid
alternative to RBF kernels.}

  abstract =     "A family of kernels for statistical learning is
                 introduced that exploits the geometric structure of
                 statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat
                 equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the
                 Fisher information metric associated with a statistical
                 family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean
                 space. As an important special case, kernels based on
                 the geometry of multinomial families are derived,
                 leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply
                 naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers
                 and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved
                 using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on
                 Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are
                 presented for document classification, for which the
                 use of multinomial geometry is natural and well
                 motivated, and improvements are obtained over the
                 standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have
                 been the standard for text classification.",
