		builds semantic network descriptions of shapes based on Brady's ``smoothed

		a substantially modified version of Winston's ANALOGY program. A generalization
		of Gray coding enables the representation to be extended and also allows
		a single operation, called ``ablation'', to achieve the effects of many
		standard induction heuristics. The program can learn disjunctions, and
		can learn concepts using only positive examples. We discuss learnability

		optimal when k is a constant and almost optimal for all other values of

		problem, using operations such as consistency, before embarking on an exhaustive
		search for solutions. Neighbourhood substitution is such a simplification
		operation. Whenever a value x for a variable is such that it can be replaced
		in all constraints by another value y, then x is eliminated. This paper
		shows that neighbourhood substitutions are important whether the aim is
		to find one or all solutions. It is proved that the result of a convergent
		sequence of neighbourhood substitutions is invariant modulo isomorphism.
		An efficient algorithm is given to find such a sequence. It is also shown
		that to combine consistency (of any order) and neighbourhood substitution,
		we only need to establish consistency once.}

		straight lines, colinear or coplanar points, parallel lines and vanishing
		points. These linear features give rise to linear constraints on the 3D
		position of scene points. The resulting problem can be solved by standard
		linear programming techniques. An important characteristic of this approach
		is that instead of making a strong assumption, such as all surfaces are
		planar, only a very weak assumption, which disallows coincidences and highly
		improbable objects, needs to be made to be able to deduce planarity. The
		linear constraints, combined with junction-labelling constraints, are a
		powerful means of discriminating between possible and impossible line drawings.
		They provide an important tool for the machine reconstruction of a 3D scene
		from a human-entered line drawing. }

		for arc consistency is given, expressed as a digital circuit. For a constraint
		satisfaction problem with n variables and a labels, this algorithm has
		a worst-case time complexity of O(na), significantly better than that of
		the optimal uniprocessor algorithm. An algorithm of intermediate parallelism
		suitable for implementation on a SIMD machine is also given. Analyses and
		implementation experiments are shown for both algorithms. A method for
		exploiting characteristics of a problem domain to achieve arc consistency
		algorithms with better time and space complexity is also discussed. A general
		technique for expressing domain knowledge and using it to develop optimized
		arc consistency algorithms is described. The domain-specific optimizations
		can be applied analogously to any of the arc consistency algorithms along
		the sequential/parallel spectrum.}
