        abstract = {The development of the Internet has boosted prosperity of the World Wide Web, which is now a
huge information source. Because of characteristics of the web, in most cases, traditional databasebased
technologies are no longer suitable for web information retrieval and management. To
effectively manage web information, it is necessary to reveal intrinsic relationships/structures
among web information objects by eliminating noise factors. This paper proposes a mechanism that
could be widely used in information processing, including web information processing and noise
factor elimination for getting more intrinsic relationships. As an application case of this
mechanism, one relevant web page finding algorithm is proposed to uncover intrinsic relationship
among web pages from their hyperlink patterns, and find more semantic relevant web pages. The
experimental evaluation shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrates
the potential of the proposed mechanism in web applications.}
