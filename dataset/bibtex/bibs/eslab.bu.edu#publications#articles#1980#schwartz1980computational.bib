  abstract =     {The spatial inhomogeneity of the retino-striate
                  system is summarized by the vector cortical
                  magnification factor. The logarithm of retinal
                  eccentricity provides a good fit to the integrated
                  cortical magnification factor. Under the assumption
                  that the cortical map is analytic (conformal), this
                  implies that a complex logarithmic function of
                  retinal coordinates describes the two-dimensional
                  structure of the cortical representation of a visual
                  stimulus. This hypothesis is in good agreement with
                  the measured global structure of rhesus, squirrel,
                  and owl monkey retino-striate mappings, as well as
                  that of the upper visual field of the cat. A
                  quantitative model of the human visual cortex is
                  developed and used to portray the detailed structure
                  of certain visual stimuli, as they would appear at
                  the level of the striate cortex. The local and
                  global geometric structure of the striate map
                  suggests a simple explanation for several visual
                  illusions. Thus, it is demonstrated that the
                  geometric structure of visual stimuli, at the level
                  of striate cortex, may be of significance to
                  perception},
