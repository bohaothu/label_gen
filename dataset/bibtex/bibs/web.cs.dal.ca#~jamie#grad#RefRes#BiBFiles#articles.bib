          `The {\em graph-traversal approach} to HT IR is a
          conceptualization of HT in which the structural aspects of the
          nodes are emphasized.  A user navigates through such HT systems
          by evaluating the semantics associated with links between nodes
          as well as info contained in nodes.  In this paper we describe a
          hierarchical struture which effectively supports the graphical
          traversal of a document collection in a HT system.  We provide an
          overview of an interactive browser based on cluster hierachies.
          Initial results obtained from the use of the browser in an
          experimental HT systems are presented.'

      Experiments with a catalogue of 800 000 book citations have shown
      two useful ways of dealing with the `too many hits' problem.  One
      is a display of phrases containing the excessively frequent
      words; another is a display of titles by hierarchical category.
      The same techniques should apply to other text-based retrieval
      systems.  In general, interactive solutions seem more promising

              develop a more complete theory of IR from HT docs.  Viewing
              HTs as large information spaces, we compare two general
              classes of navigation methods, classes we call local and
              global.  We argue that global methods necessitate some form
              of {"}information space{"} conceptually seperate from the
              HT {"}doc space{"}.  We note that the architecture of both
              spaces effect the ease with which once can apply various

              index space and doc space architectures and we discuss some
              of the associated tradeoffs between HT functionality and
              computational complexity.  We show how some index space
              architectures can be exploited for enhancing IR, query

      \item Abstract:
         `Textnet is a new system for structuring text.  The {TN} approach
         approach uses 1 uniform data structure to capture graphlike pools
         of text, as well as embedded hierarchical structures.  By using a
         semantic network formalism of nodes connected by typed links, the
         relationships between neighbouring pieces of text are made
         explicit.  Also described is our partical implementation of the
         {TN} approach, which makes use of an {OO} window/menu-driven
         interface.  Users peruse the network by moving among objects menus
         or by reading text along a path through the network.  In addition,
         critiquing, reader linking, searching and jumping are easily
         accessible operations.  Finally, the results of a short trial with
         users are presented.'

          presented.  In the 2nd part, the model, entitled {EXPLICIT}, is
          introduced.  {EXPLICIT} is based on a 2-level architecture which
          holds the 2 main parts of the info resource managed by an {IR}
          tool: the collection of documents and the indexing term
          structure.  The term structure is managed as a schema of concepts
          which can be used by the final user as a frame of reference in
          the query formulation process.  The model supports the concurrent
          use of different schemas of concepts to satisfy info needs of
          different categories of users.  In the 3rd part of the paper, the
          main characteristics of the experimental prototype, named
          {HyperLaw}, are presented.'

     today is useless unless it can be effectively and efficiently
     searched. The goal in information retrieval is to find documents that
     are relevant to a given user query. We can represent and document
     collection by a matrix whose $(i,j)$ entry is nonzero only if the
     $i$th term appears in the $j$th document; thus each document
     corresponds to a columm vector. The query is also represented as a
     column vector whose $i$th term is nonzero only if the $i$th term
     appears in the query. We score each document for relevancy by taking
     its inner product with the query. The highest-scoring documents are
     considered the most relevant. Unfortunately, this method does not
     necessarily retrieve all relevant documents because it is based on
     literal term matching. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) replaces the
     document matrix with an approximation generated by the truncated
     singular-value decomposition (SVD). This method has been shown to
     overcome many difficulties associated with literal term matching. In
     this article we propose replacing the SVD with the semidiscrete
     decomposition (SDD). We will describe the SDD approximation, show how
     to compute it, and compare the SDD-based LSI method to the SVD-based
     LSI methods. We will show that SDD-based LSI does as well as SVD-based
     LSI in terms of document retrieval while requiring only one-twentieth
     the storage and one-half the time to compute each query. We will also
     show how to update the SDD approximation when documents are added or
     deleted from the document collection.'"

     \item[Abstract] `Hypertext allows students to select information for
     study according to their individual needs. This flexibility
     potentially increases study efficiency, but may consequently decrease
     breadth of learning. The current research examined this trade-off for
     hypertext segmented either into many small units (more segmented) or
     fewer larger units (less segmented). It compared study strategies and
     text recall with a more- and less-segmented hypertext when (a)~the
     more specific units of the more-segmented hypertext facilitated
     information location for the study goal, and (b)~the location of
     goal-related information was equally apparent with both
     hypertexts.  Readers with a more-segmented hypertext focused on
     goal-related content, resulting in detailed memory for goal units but
     narrower overall recall. Readers with a less-segmented hypertext
     explored unrelated units, and recalled a broader range of
     content. However, when the larger size of these less-segmented units
     made information location more difficult, fewer readers completed the
     goal. This research suggests that different content segmentations may
     be appropriate for different types of goals with hypertext. When the
     text segmentation is incompatible with the study goal, effective use
     of hypertext may depend on learner characteristics influencing study
     persistence (e.g., prior knowledge, motivation, study skills, etc.).'
     \item[notes] `different content segmentations may be appropriate for

     two-dimensional networks (connected graphs) of links and
     nodes. Because these network tend to be large and quite complex,
     people often perfer to view part or all of the network at varying
     levels of detail. Hierarchical clustering provides a framework for
     viewing the network at different levels of detail by superimposing a
     hierarchy on it. Nodes are grouped into clusters, and clusters are
     themselves place into other clusters. Users can then navigate these
     clusters until an appropiate level of detail is reached. This article
     describes an experiment comparing two methods for viewing
     hierarchically clustered networks. Traditional full-zoom techniques
     provide details of only the current level of the hierarchy.
     \\\indent
       In contrast, fisheye views, generated by the ``variable-zoom''
     algorithm described in this article, provide information about higher
     levels as well.  Subjects using both viewing methods were given
     problem-solving tasks requiring them to navigate a network, in this
     case, a simulated telephone system, and to reroute links in
     it. Results suggest that the greater context provided by fisheye views
     significantly improved user performance. Users were quicker to
     complete their task and made fewer unnecessary navigational steps
     through the hierarchy. This validation of fisheye views in important
     for designers of interfaces to complicated monitoring systems, such as
     control rooms for supervisory control and data acquistion systems,
     where efficient human performance is often critical. However, control
     room operators remained concerned about the size and visibility
     tradeoffs between the fine room operators remained concerned about the
     size and visibility tradeoffs between the fine detail provided by
     full-zoom techniques and the global context supplied by fisheye
     views. Specific interface feaures are required to reconcile the

      correlations between shortest paths in the hypertext structure

      first method show the degree to which the hypertext conversion
      process approximates semantic similarity.  The semantic measure
      is in turn only an approximation of a user's internal model of
      the corpus.  Therefore we propose a second evaluation method
      based on measuring user's performance using hypertext.  Finally,
      we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computer versus

     \item From Discussion (p.\,9):
       `It was expected that certain cognitive abilities would be
       associated with processing of spatial representations of
       information.  The findings supported this idea, but in an unexpected
       manner.  One might have expected that users with higher levels of
       spatial abilities would have been most able to make use of spatial
       representations of information, and so derive the most benefit from
       these representations.  In fact the opposite occurred.  Users with
       lower levels of spatial abilities benefitted most from the design
       features that made use of two-dimensional information
       representation.

           semantic analysis. We studied the search strategies and general
           preferences of eleven subjects who used this system to find
           papers on various topics. The study has led to a number of
           interesting findings, which should be valuable for designers and
           evaluators of 3D user interfaces. The results highlight the
           importance of structural elements in the design of a
           semantically based user interface, because search strategies of
           users relied heavily on these mechanisms in the design. The
           results of this study also demonstrate that we are able to
           characterise and learn from users' search strategies in a visual
           environment strongly shaped by semantic relationships of the
           information content. Implications for user interface design
           based on users' psychological models of a semantic space are
           described.'

       In this paper, we present the development of a new measure of
      perceived disorientation that helps to explain experiences with
      Web-based systems. Two studies, incorporating over 300
      participants, provide evidence for the measure's construct
      validity. The first study is a survey that develops this new
      measure and distinguishes it from ease of use. The second study,
      an experiment investigating users performing an information
      retrieval task on the Web, further distinguishes disorientation
      from ease of use, and relates it to actions. Moreover, the study
      compares the effects of Web designs containing simple and global
      navigation systems; these systems related to perceived
      disorientation but not to ease of use or actions. Finally, the
      study examines disorientation's relationship with user
      performance and demonstrates that perceived disorientation
      relates more strongly than actions to performance. Our perceived
      disorientation measure is simple and quick to administer to
      users, and we conclude by suggesting that designers will find it
      useful in assessing and comparing Web designs.

   ,Year=2008
   ,Volume=27 ,Number=6 ,Pages=475#"--"#482
   ,Abstract="Intuitive systems are usable systems. Design guidelines
      advocate intuitiveness and vendors claim it – but what does it
      mean for a user interface, interactive system, or device to be
      intuitive? A review of the use of the term ‘intuitive’ indicates
      that it has two distinct but overlapping meanings, namely
      intuitiveness based on familiarity and intuitiveness reflecting
      our embodiment (and frequently both). While everyday usage
      indicates that familiarity means either a passing acquaintance
      or an intimacy with something or someone, it will be concluded
      that familiarity might best be equated with ‘know-how’, which in
      turn is based on a deep, often tacit, understanding. The
      intuitive nature of tangible user interfaces will in turn be
      attributed to embodiment rather than tangibility per
      se. Merleau-Ponty writes that it is through our bodies that we
      ‘prehend’ the world. A number of disciplines now regard
      action–perception as so closely coupled that they are better
      considered as a dyad rather than separately. A modified
      treatment of action–perception coupling is proposed, with
      familiarity providing an epistemic core, as the basis of
      intuitiveness."

     evaluate whether simple hyperlink annotations --- traffic lights that
     represent Internet connection speeds --- can facilitate web
     navigation.  Traffic lights are small red, yellow or green images
     added around the anchor text of each link indicating its connection
     speed, red for for slow, yellow for somewhat fast and green for
     fastest.  The first two experiments showed that traffic lights do not
     facilitate perceptual processes involved in web navigation (i.e. link
     localization and visual search).  However, traffic lights also
     \emph{do not distract from the process of finding links in hypertext
     documents and, thus have no perceptual performance cost}.  The third
     experiment showed that \emph{traffic lights facilitate web navigation
     performance by improving link evaluation and decision processes.  This
     improvement is particularly marked when link relevance is low or
     undifferentiated}.  It was concluded that supplying users with
     information about Internet connection speeds improves web navigation
     performance.  Thus, traffic lights provide functional cues for
     efficiently navigating the web.'  (emphasis added)",

    \begin{quotation}
      Most psychometric tests of spatial ability are paper-and-pencil
     tasks at the ``figural'' scale of space, in that they involve
     inspecting, imagining or mentally transforming small shapes or
     manipulable objects. Environmental spatial tasks, such as
     wayfinding or learning the layout of a building or city, are
     carried out in larger spaces that surround the body and involve
     integration of the sequence of views that change with one's
     movement in the environment. In a correlational study, 221
     participants were tested on psychometric measures of spatial
     abilities, spatial updating, verbal abilities and working
     memory. They also learned the layout of large environments from
     direct experience walking through a real environment, and via two
     different media: a desktop virtual environment (VE) and a
     videotape of a walk through an environment. In an exploratory
     factor analysis, measures of environmental learning from direct
     experience defined a separate factor from measures of learning
     based on VE and video media. In structural-equation models,
     smallscale spatial abilities predicted performance on the
     environmental-learning tasks, but were more predictive of
     learning from media than from direct experience. The results
     indicate that spatial abilities at different scales of space are
     partially but not totally dissociated.  They specify the degree
     of overlap between small-scale and large-scale spatial abilities,
     inform theories of sex differences in these abilities, and
     provide new insights about what these abilities have in common
     and how they differ.

       \item[Abstract] \begin{quotation}\noindent
            This study examined the effectiveness of a map and a textual
            contents list on the navigation performance of subjects with
            and without prior knowledge of the text topic. After reading
            the text, subjects used the document to answer ten
            questions. The results showed that performance in the map
            condition was superior to that of the contents list condition,
            which in turn was superior to that of the hypertext only
            condition (no navigational aid). In addition, knowledgeable
            subjects performed better than non-knowledgeable subjects,
            except in the map condition where their performance was
            equivalent. The results also show that non-knowledgeable users
            tend to rely more heavily on navigational aids than
            knowledgeable users, and that aids were used primarily during
            browsing. These results are discussed in relation to the ways
            in which navigational aids interact with the prior knowledge of
            the user to enhance or impede performance.

       \item Abstract:
          `Virtual environments enable a given information space to be
         traversed in different ways by different individuals, using
         different routes and navigation tools. However, we urgently need
         robust user models to enable us to optimize the deployment of such
         facilities. Research into individual differences suggests that the
         notion of cognitive style may be useful in this process. Many such
         styles have been identified. However, it is argued that Pask's
         work on holist and serialist strategies and associated styles of
         information processing are particularly promising in terms of the
         development of adaptive information systems. These constructs are
         reviewed, and their potential utility in ``real-world'' situations
         assessed. Suggestions are made for ways in which they could be
         used in the development of virtual environments capable of
         optimizing the stylistic strengths and complementing the
         weaknesses of individual users. The role of neural networks in
         handling the essentially fuzzy nature of user models is
         discussed. Neural networks may be useful in dynamically mapping
         users' navigational behavior onto user models to enable them to
         generate appropriate adaptive responses. However, their learning
         capacity may also be particularly useful in the process of
         improving system performance and in the cumulative development of
         more robust user models.' (from BUBL~\cite{BUBL})

       \item Description from JASIS webpage 
           (\url{http://www.asis.org/Publications/JASIS/vol51n0600.html}):
         {}
           Nigel Ford's article focuses on the distinction between holists
         and serialists in learning, and its implications for supporting
         individual users through user interface design.  Of particular
         interest to the theme of this special issue, Ford addresses some
         interesting behavioral patterns of holists and serialists. While
         holists like to use concept maps, serialists prefer keyword
         indices. A concept map, or the overview of an underlying
         structure, is designed for global orientation regarding the
         overall structure of the subject matter.
          \\\indent
           Having recognized the fuzzy nature of identifying individuals'
         cognitive styles and learning strategies, Ford introduces a
         modeling approach based on Kohonen self-organizing feature maps,
         an artificial neural-network based classification technique. This
         self-organized approach has potential as a possible route for
         further research and development of adaptive virtual
         environments. Virtual environments provide a wider framework for
         integrating and directly manipulating global and analytic aspects
         of an information space.
          \\\indent
           Ford's article also draws our attention to the connection
         between field-dependence and cognitive styles in terms of
         individuals' behavioral patterns in navigation of hyperspace. Like
         holists, field-dependent individuals use overview maps more often
         than field-independent individuals. In the next article, Palmquist
         and Kim examine the effects of field-dependence in Web search.'

     large information spaces is one that is crucial to the ever expanding
     and interlinking of computer systems. There are many ways of dealing
     with the issue of navigation one of which is to provide different
     dialogue styles to suit individual capabilities.  The performance of
     users was compared on a menu style interface to a database system,
     which minimised navigation and constrained the dialogue, and a command
     style interface, which allowed an open and flexible dialogue. The
     results showed that some users did perform better on the interface
     which minimised navigational issues, and some better on the more open
     interface; and that users' performance related to their levels of
     spatial ability and experience with using command style
     interfaces. The menu interface proved suitable for users with both a
     low spatial ability and low experience of using command style
     interfaces. The command interface proved suitable for all users with a
     high spatial ability, whatever their previous experience, and for
     users with a low spatial ability but high experience of using command
     style interfaces. The results of this small scale experiment have
     potentially important ramifications for designers of interfaces to
     large information spaces.'

     (including measures of general, reasoning, spatial, perceptual speed,
     and perceptual/psychomotor abilities) and individual differences in
     skill acquisition over protracted skill-learning sessions. Laboratory
     studies examine individual differences in the acquisition of skills on

     changes in strategy resulted in a performance advantage for the
     graphical interface, the relative performance difference between high

     participated in an interactive scheduling task with two levels of task

     alternatives, with each alternative being represented by a screen, to
     allocate resources. The subjects were administered with Myers-Briggs
     Type Indicator (MBTI) tests and a battery of psychometric
     tests. Cognitive time, total number of menu selections, total number
     of assignments, and the distribution of cognitive time into
     intelligence, design and choice activities were the performance
     measures. Variables derived from measurements of personality traits

     performance. The personality trait for sensing/knowing was significant

     personality trait of extrovert/introvert was found to be significant

     hypertext linkage, content similarity and usage patterns. Salient
     patterns in these relationships are extracted and visualised in a
     simple and intuitive associated network. The spatial layout of a
     visualisation is optimised such that closely related documents are
     placed near to each other and only those intrinsic connections among
     them are shown to users as automatically generated virtual links. This
     approach supports self-organised information space transformation

  ,Abstract="`Icons are a very important component of graphical user
     interfaces. However, icon design is still predominantly artistic in
     nature and as a result icon selection is generally based on usability
     evaluations after a set of alternative icons are developed. This
     process tends to be time-consuming and costly. In this research, we
     address the issues ofwhat should be depicted in an icon, given the
     function it should represent, and how training affects the performance
     of novice users when using an iconic interface. A set of 36 concrete
     icons (12 functions) were selected and tested with a total of 30
     participants. The experimental results indicate that complete
     representations are generally superior for both untrained and trained
     participants. Results also show that trained participants had shorter
     response times when compared to untrained participants. Further
     analysis suggests that ambiguity, uniqueness and dominance are three
     important aspects to consider when designing and developing
     icons. Applications of this research include the design of appropriate
     icons for graphical user interfaces prior to usability testing and the
     importance of a short training period to illustrate the composition of
     an icon in an effort to improve the mental model associated with each
     design.'"

      Information seeking skills are becoming increasingly important as
      rapid and widespread developments in technology have made information
      available in more formats and from more sources than ever
      before. Research in human computer interaction (HCI) has demonstrated
      that primary cognitive abilities represent a powerful predictor of
      information-seeking success in electronic information
      systems. Specifically, spatial visualization ability (SVA) seems to
      be particularly related to hierarchical menus systems navigation
      within databases, online learning environments, information archival
      systems, and virtually all internet web sites. Research indicates
      that individuals with low SVA take longer to complete tasks and
      experience more errors on first attempts to find information in
      hierarchical databases compared to those with high SVA. Understanding
      the influences of SVA as well as its interaction with other aspects
      of individual differences, such as domain expertise, is critical to
      the design of systems intended to accommodate individual differences
      in users.
     \newline
      Thirty-five college students (23 males and 12 females) were selected
      from the general student body of two universities and assigned to
      groups based upon their self-reported membership in one of two
      specific disciplines: business (n=26) or biology (n=9). Participants
      were then assigned to groups based upon scores on tests of SVA using
      a median-split. Each participant conducted five searches: one neutral
      search, two searches for business related information, and two
      searches for biology related information using the FirstSearch
      archival search tool.
     \newline
      A $2 \times 2$ factorial Analysis of Variance with one between-groups
      variable (high vs. low SVA) and one within-group variable (high
      vs. low domain expertise) indicated a significant main effect of SVA
      as well as a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on the time
      required to find their first relevant article on the search
      topic. The analysis also revealed that there was no main effect for
      SVA on the total number of relevant articles found during the search
      period but there was a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on
      the total total-number-of-relevant-articles found. There was no
      interaction between SVA and Domain Expertise on either time to first
      article or total number of articles found.
     \newline
      Results of the study extend existing knowledge regarding the effects
      of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking by demonstrating a
      strong effect of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking
      skills. The results of this study also provide evidence in support of
      interface designs that are friendlier to information seekers who have
      low SVA. Related findings and suggestions for further research are
      discussed.\end{quotation}

   ,Abstract="	
      Computer system security is traditionally regarded as a primarily
      technological concern; the fundamental questions to which security
      researchers address themselves are those of the mathematical
      guarantees that can be made for the performance of various
      communication and computational challenges. However, in our research,
      we focus on a different question. For us, the fundamental security
      question is one that end-users routinely encounter and resolve for
      themselves many times day athe question of whether a system is secure
      enough for their immediate needs.

      In this paper, we will describe our explorations of this issue. In
      particular, we will draw on three major elements of our research to
      date. The first is empirical investigation into everyday security
      practices, looking at how people manage security as a practical,
      day-to-day concern, and exploring the context in which security
      decisions are made. This empirical work provides a foundation for our
      reconsideration of the problems of security to a large degree as an
      interactional problem. The second is our systems approach, based on
      visualization and event-based architectures. This technical approach
      provides a broad platform for investigating security and interaction,
      based on a set of general principles. The third is our initial
      experiences in a prototype deployment of these mechanisms in an
      application for peer-to-peer file sharing in face-to-face
      collaborative settings. We have been using this application as the
      basis of an initial evaluation of our technology in support of
      everyday security practices in collaborative workgroups."

      end-user acquisition and management of credentials, something which
      grid security inherits from its PKI foundation. In this paper, we
      describe two parallel efforts to apply the concept of ``Plug-and-Play

      development of technologies that can implement such policies. The
      research reported here describes our efforts to design a system which
      facilitates privacy policy authoring, implementation, and compliance
      monitoring. We employed a variety of user-centered design methods
      with 109 target users across the four steps of the research reported
      here. This case study highlights the work of identifying
      organizational privacy requirements, iteratively designing and
      validating a prototype with target users, and conducting laboratory
      tests to guide specific design decisions to meet the needs of
      providing flexible privacy enabling technologies. Each of the four
      steps in our work is identified and described, and directions for
      future work in privacy are suggested."

   ,Abstract="
      An understanding `communities of practice' can help to make sense of
      existing security and privacy issues within organizations; the same
      understanding can be used proactively to help bridge the gap between
      organizational and end-user perspectives on these matters. Findings
      from two studies within the health domain reveal contrasting
      perspectives on enemy approach to organizational
      security. Ethnographic evaluations involving in-depth interviews,
      focus groups and observations with 93 participants (clinical staff,
      managers, library staff and IT department members) were conducted in
      two hospitals. All of the data was analysed using the social science
      `grounded theory'. In one hospital, a community and user-centred
      approach to the development of an organizational privacy and security
      application produced a new communication medium that improved
      corporate awareness across the organization. User involvement in the
      development of this application increased the perceived importance,
      for the designers, of application usability, quality and
      aesthetics. However, other initiatives within this organization
      produced clashes with informal working practices and communities of
      practice. Within the second hospital, poor communication from IT
      about security mechanisms resulted in their misuse by some employees,
      who viewed them as a socially controlling force. Authentication
      mechanisms were used to socially exclude users who were formally
      authorized to access systems but whose access was unacceptable within
      some local communities of practice. The importance of security
      awareness and control are reviewed within the context of communities
      of practice."

     \item Abstract:
           `Adaptive systems should be able to accommodate the preferred
         interface styles of different users.  An experiment was conducted
         in order to determine whether significant differences exist
         between individuals performing the same task, using different
         interfaces.  Individual users' performances on five different
         interfaces to a computer database system, after the initial
         learning stage, were compared with their scores on various
         cognitive and personality tests.  The results suggested that two
         interface styles are necessary for database systems in order for
         them to suit a range of users: an aided-navigation interface with
         a constrained dialogue for low spatial ability users, and a
         non-aided navigation interface with a flexible dialogue for high
         spatial ability users. Both interfaces should minimize the amount
         of verbal input necessary.'

   ,Abstract="
      Several recent surveys conclude that people are concerned about
      privacy and consider it to be an important factor in their online
      decision making. This paper reports on a study in which (1)~user
      concerns were analysed more deeply and (2)~what users said was
      contrasted with what they did in an experimental e-commerce
      scenario. Eleven independent variables were shown to affect the
      online behavior of at least some groups of users. Most significant
      were trust marks present on web pages and the existence of a privacy
      policy, though users seldom consulted the policy when one existed. We
      also find that many users have inaccurate perceptions of their own
      knowledge about privacy technology and vulnerabilities, and that
      important user groups, like those similar to the Westin ``privacy
      fundamentalists'', do not appear to form a cohesive group for
      privacy-related decision making.
     \newline
      In this study we adopt an experimental economic research paradigm, a
      method for examining user behavior which challenges the current
      emphasis on survey data. We discuss these issues and the implications
      of our results on user interpretation of trust marks and interaction
      design. Although broad policy implications are beyond the scope of
      this paper, we conclude by questioning the application of the
      ethical/legal doctrine of informed consent to online transactions in
      the light of the evidence that users frequently do not consult
      privacy policies."

   ,Abstract="As with all the major advances in information and
      communication technology, ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) introduces
      new risks to individual privacy. Our analysis of privacy protection
      in ubicomp has identified four layers through which users must
      navigate: the regulatory regime they are currently in, the type of
      ubicomp service required, the type of data being disclosed, and their
      personal privacy policy. We illustrate and compare the protection
      afforded by regulation and by some major models for user control of
      privacy. We identify the shortcomings of each and propose a model
      which allows user control of privacy levels in a ubicomp
      environment. Our model balances the user's privacy preferences
      against the applicable privacy regulations and incorporates five
      types of user controlled ``noise'' to protect location privacy by
      introducing ambiguities. We also incorporate an economics-based
      approach to assist users in balancing the trade-offs between giving
      up privacy and receiving ubicomp services. We conclude with a
      scenario and heuristic evaluation which suggests that regulation can
      have both positive and negative influences on privacy interfaces in
      ubicomp and that social translucence is an important heuristic for
      ubicomp privacy interface functionality."

      privacy. Current guidelines aimed at improving accessibility may
      impact users perceptions of privacy. The aim of this study was to
      explore whether different screen sizes affect  perceptions of
      privacy. Also, if partitioning around screens influences privacy
      perceptions. An opportunity sample of 60 participants took part in
      the study. The results that revealed 12'' screens were perceived as
      more private by users than 15 and 17'' screens. Adding privacy
      partitions improved user's perceptions of privacy on the 12 and 15''
      screens but not on the 17''. These findings provide evidence that
      slight changes in the physical design of systems can increase
      perceived levels of privacy and therefore satisfaction."

     This study investigates predictions from Wittrock's model of
     generative teaching regarding the effects of reader generation of
     summaries and analogies upon the learning of a block of 50 paragraphs
     of text. In this study, 59 students were individually assigned at
     random to three treatments that were predicted and found to rank in
     the following high to low order on the reading test:
      (a)~Generate Summaries ($\overline{x} = 29.8$),
      (b)~Generate Analogies ($\overline{x} = 27.2$), and
      (c)~Read Text          ($\overline{x} = 22.4$).
     We also hypothesized and found that the
     generation of analogies or summaries during reading differentially
     stimulates learners' analytic and holistic (i.e., imagery)
     abilities. In the Read Text treatment, only holistic ability
     correlated with learning the high imagery text. In the Generate
     Analogies treatment, only analytic ability correlated with learning

  ,Abstract="\begin{quotation}
      We consider a network of autonomous peers forming a logically global
    but physically distributed search engine, where every peer has its own
    local collection generated by independently crawling the Web. A
    challenging task in such systems is to efficiently route user queries
    to peers that can deliver high quality results and be able to rank
    these returned results, thus satisfying the users' information
    need. However, the problem inherent with this scenario is selecting a
    few promising peers out of an a priori unlimited number of peers. In
    recent research a rather strict notion of semantic overlay networks has
    been established. In most approaches, peers are connected to other
    peers based on a rigid semantic profile by clustering them based on
    their contents. In contrast, our strategy follows the spirit of peer
    autonomy and creates semantic overlay networks based on the notion of
    `peer-to-peer dating'. Peers are free to decide which connections they
    create and which they want to avoid based on various usefulness
    estimators. The proposed techniques can be easily integrated into
    existing systems as they require only small additional bandwidth
    consumption as most messages can be piggybacked onto established
    communication. We show how we can greatly benefit from these additional
    semantic relations during query routing in search engines, such as
    Minerva, and in the JXP algorithm, which computes the PageRank
    authority measure in a completely decentralized manner.

        A thesaurus and an ontology provide a set of structured terms,

     decisions that should be made when including a term, deciding whether
     a term should be subdivided into its subclasses, or determining which
     of more than one set of possible subclasses should be used. Based on
     retrospective measurements or estimates of future performance when
     using thesaurus terms in document ordering, decisions are made so as
     to maximize performance. These decisions may be used in the automatic
     construction of a thesaurus. The evaluation of an existing thesaurus
     is described, consistent with the decision criteria developed
     here. These kinds of user-focused decision-theoretic techniques may be
     applied to other hierarchical applications, such as faceted
     classification systems used in information architecture or the use of
     hierarchical terms in 'breadcrumb navigation.'\end{quotation}"

      The World Wide Web provides us with a widely accessible technology,

      our basic conceptualization of this new environment; an environment we
      can view as having a cognitive component (hyperspace) and a social
      component (cyberspace). This review argues that cognitive psychologists
      have a key role to play in the identification and analysis of how the
      processes of the mind interact with the Web. The body of literature on
      cognitive processes provides us with knowledge about spatial
      perceptions, strategies for navigation in space, memory functions and
      limitations, and the formation of mental representations of
      environments. Researchers of human cognition can offer established

   ,Abstract="Whenever decisions are made based upon a person's level
     of computer literacy, it is important that such expertise is
     accurately assessed. This paper takes a thorough methodological
     approach to the measurement of computer literacy using both
     objective and self-appraisal tests. While objective tests have
     been used on many occasions to measure computer literacy, they
     suffer from generalizability problems. Self-appraisal tests, on
     the other hand, are subject to leniency bias by the
     respondents. Taken together, though, the potential exists for the
     establishment of a computer literacy assessment instrument with
     high levels of generalizability and accuracy. For this research,
     an objective test for computer literacy was developed and an
     existing self-appraisal test was extended for use in a computer
     literacy assessment experiment. It was found that the
     self-appraisal test is a more lenient performance indicator than
     the objective test. Both male and female subjects exhibited
     substantial self-leniency in their self-appraisals, but both
     self-leniency and gender-based differences in self-appraisal
     decreased as the subjects' level of computer expertise
     increased. Finally, the low level of convergence between the
     self-appraisal test and the objective test found in this study
     cast doubt on the ability of any self-appraisal test to assess
     accurately computer literacy by itself. A combination of
     different measures may be more appropriate when it is important
     to determine computer literacy levels accurately."

       Metacognition, a person's knowledge of her or his own cognitive
      processes, is a concept that can be applied to many areas of
      human-computer interaction. This article reviews the state of
      contemporary knowledge regarding metacognition and describes
      implications for the domain of human-computer interaction. A
      conceptual framework is presented that distinguishes monitoring
      and regulation processes of metacognition. One aspect of
      metacognition, self-evaluation of knowledge, was investigated
      for a word processing application as an
      illustration.  An experiment was conducted to evaluate which of
      four methods of self-assessment of expertise was the best
      predictor of declarative knowledge (accuracy and completeness of
      descriptions on how to perform a task). In addition, the
      experiment examined whether classifying users based on
      self-reported estimates of expertise would produce differences
      in their declarative descriptions. Results showed that
      individuals' ratings of their overall knowledge were better
      predictors than were estimations of frequency of use, as would
      be expected from the literature on metacognitive monitoring. In
      addition, classifying users based on their self-ratings of
      expertise showed differences in accuracy of declarative
      knowledge and strategy chosen to perform a task. Experts were
      more accurate in their descriptions of how to complete a task
      compared to novices and used more complex strategies to complete
      hard tasks.

      A process model of hypertext reading was used to generate
      predictions about the effects of hypertext features on cognitive
      processing during text navigation and comprehension. We
      evaluated the predictions of the model with respect to the
      extant literature, focusing on studies in which versions of
      hypertexts were compared. Consistent with our predictions, the
      increased demands of decision-making and visual processing in
      hypertext impaired reading performance. Individual differences
      in readers, such as working memory capacity and prior knowledge,
      mediated the impact of hypertext features. For example, readers
      with low working memory and low prior knowledge were usually
      disadvantaged in hypertext. Some benefits were observed for
      learners with low prior knowledge, however, if the hypertext
      structure was hierarchical and consistent with that of the
      knowledge domain. We also surveyed the effectiveness of
      structural features designed to reduce cognitive load, including
      graphical overviews, restricted access to links, and visible
      link types. Complex graphical overviews did not reliably enable
      learning and navigation, whereas navigational support from
      restricted access and visible link types were helpful. We
      identified gaps in the empirical literature and suggested future
      studies to investigate cognitive processes in hypertext reading.

       with a hypermedia presentation. A sample of 306 undergraduates
       was pre-tested both on their cognitive style and on their
       self-reported frequency and ability in using computers. From
       the initial sample, 40 students were selected to form four
       groups with the following characteristics: (a)~10 high computer
       users --- sequential thinkers, (b)~10 high computer users ---
       holistic thinkers, (c)~10 low computer users --- sequential
       thinkers and (d)~10 low computer users --- holistic thinkers. All
       participants completed a self-report questionnaire measuring
       spatial orientation and were then requested to browse freely a
       hypermedia presentation on the ancient Mayan
       civilisation. Finally, the students completed a post-test to
       assess the recall of the hypermedia presentation and the
       cognitive organisation of the acquired knowledge. The results
       indicated that hypermedia navigation behaviour was linked to
       computer skills rather than to cognitive style and that
       learning outcomes were unaffected by cognitive style or by
       computer skills. However, learning outcomes were positively
       affected by specific search patterns, that is by re-visiting
       hypermedia sections and visiting overview sections in the early
       stages of hypermedia browsing. Further, navigating overview
       sections and holistic processing fostered knowledge
       representation in the form of maps. These findings suggest that
       individual differences can affect hypermedia navigation even
       though their role in learning is complex and the impact of
       cognitive style on learning outcomes was proved to be less
       important than initially predicted.

      \item [p.\,129]
        In the most extensive study to date, Carroll (1993) surveyed
        and reanalyzed more than 90 data sets that bear on the factor
        structure of visuospatial ability.  Carroll examined the
        support for five visuospatial factors in the category that he
        referred to as ``abilities in the domain of visual perception.''
        These were visualization (VZ), spatial relations (SR),
        closure speed (CS), flexibility of closure (CF), and
        perceptual speed (P).  A fifth factor, visual memory (MV) is
        described in a chapter of Carroll's book on the domains of
        learning and memory.  It should be noted that Carroll's
        definition is somewhat broader that those of McGee (1979b) and
        Lohman (1979).  For example, Lohman acknowledged the existence
        of [CS], [P], and [MV], but referred to them as minor factors
        that are not central to what is meant by ``spatial ability.''
        %
     \item[p.\,131]
        A somewhat surprising result of Carroll's study is that he
        failed to find strong and consistent evidence for the
        separability of spatial relations from the spatial
        visualization factor; only 7 of the 94 data sets that he
        examined showed such a distinction. \ldots Despite this
        observation, the distinction between spatial relations and
        spatial visualization has remained important in the cognitive
        analysis of spatial test performance.
        %
     \item[p.\,140]
        Thus, it appears that to some extent spatial visualization
        tests measure the ability to choose the optimal strategy for
        solving a particular item, given one's abilities.

        can never be conceived of in purely literal of ``Euclidean''
        terms.\ldots But in her survey, Boechler makes clear that we
        have hardly any evidence on the working of spatial notions and
        metaphorical extensions in the minds of computer users.'
        [p.\,9]  (See notes about Boechler (2001)~\cite{Bo:HSiHT})
      \item `After exploring the website, participants were asked to
        draw the website's information structure.  The analysis of
        these drawings indicated that the participants did not draw
        the spatial information structure of the websites, but they
        drew conceptual relations between the information items
        instead.  Therefore, Farris et al. (2002) concluded that the

        `Hypertext users can be said to be mentally engaged in surface
        (i.e., executing physical motional, perceptual actions),
        propositional (e.g. understanding the content and structure of
        hypertext) and mental/situational (e.g. planning and
        monitoring) actions' [p.\,12]  This partition into three
        categories is not intended as a description of users mental

      \item All stats (except inter-rater reliability) used $\chi^2$
        tests
      \item Results: `users predominantly used spatial expressions to

        although more experienced users used spatial descriptions
        more. [p.\,18]
      \item `Thinking alound users have to conceptualize their
        thoughts immediately on the fly, which may incite them to
        verbalize the here and now of each and every screen, instead
        of stepping back and talk [sic] about global structure or task
        progress.' [p.\,18]

    We investigated the influence of spatial visualization, spatial
    reasoning, and environmental cognition skills on students' use of
    instructional hypermedia navigation tools. Forty undergraduate
    cognitive science students were randomly assigned to one of two
    hypermedia system conditions: a map-like navigation tool
    (``spatial'' representation) or a menu-like navigation tool
    (``less spatial''). All students performed a searching activity,
    then browsed freely through the system. Students then commented on
    their perceptions of the system and drew concept maps of the
    contents. Regression analyses indicate that performance with the
    map-like navigation tool is positively correlated with
    environmental cognition, whereas performance with the menu-like
    navigation tool is positively correlated with spatial
    visualization and reasoning. The general findings suggest that
    spatial navigation tools should be incorporated into instructional
    hypermedia with less spatial navigation methods to complement
    students' spatial cognitive abilities.\end{quotation}"

    This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of the

    constraints. In this paper, we first present an experiment in
    which professional and novice designers have to evaluate a web
    site developed for reflecting usability errors identified in web
    sites. Then, the results obtained in this evaluation task are
    compared with results previously obtained in a design task, in
    which professional and novice designers had to create a web
    site. Data analyses focused on the number and nature of
    constraints articulated by designers in these two types of tasks
    (evaluation vs design). In particular, we distinguished
    constraints linked with the client of the site and constraints
    linked with the future web users. The obtained results show
    effects of both the level of expertise and the task. While
    designing, all of the designers focused mainly on constraints
    linked with the client. In contrast, while evaluating the web
    site, novices focused on constraints linked with the user, whereas
    professionals shared their attention between these two kinds of
    constraints (client vs user-oriented constraints). Based on these
    results, we conclude with ways for supporting designers'

     This study examined users' schemata of hypermedia. It is
     frequently assumed that users' schemata contain spatial
     information about how the pages of a website are
     interconnected. However, it is not clear how these schemata could
     contain such information when none is presented to the user while
     he/she is exploring the website. Unfortunately, there has been
     little research addressing this assumption. Toward that end, the
     reported study examined the mental representations
     (i.e. schemata) acquired when using hypermedia by systematically
     varying the interconnections within a website while holding the
     information that the website contained constant. Analyses of 40
     participants' drawings of the website's organization indicate
     that drawings largely reflected conceptual (i.e. semantic)
     relationships, and not the true nature of the website's
     interconnections. In light of this research, it is suggested that
     we reevaluate the conjecture that hypermedia is mentally
     represented in ways similar to the physical world.\end{quotation}

      This article reports on a study that uses a new analysis and

      public library users were observed searching the Web and/or a

      categories, distinguished by the number of search approaches
      employed. These included linking, use of search engines, URL
      use, on-line catalog searching, and searching within a specific
      Web-site domain. Results conclude that experience and
      motivation, elements of situational goals and mental models,
      work in tandem to determine search approaches, Web sites
      visited, and sources used. People who sought information for
      job-related or educational purposes were highly motivated. Thus,
      they were persistent. Those who had a great deal of Internet
      experience used an array of tools; while those with immature
      mental models of the Internet relied more heavily on the Web
      on-line catalog or off-line sources. People seeking information
      for recreational or personal use were not highly
      motivated. Whether experienced or not, they relied on
      serendipity, linking, and other tasks that were not cognitively
      overbearing. When searching became too difficult, they abandoned
      the Internet as an information source.

         hyperspace'.  Individuals with high spatial ability appear to
         demonstrate superior navigational skills within hypertext,
         completing tasks more quickly and with fewer errors then
         those with low spatial ability. They tend to form more
         accurate internal representations, or cognitive maps, of
         hypertext systems that correspond better to the underlying
         physical structure. Little research has been carried out with
         children to assess their formation of cognitive maps of
         hyperspace. In this study, 32 children aged 10--11 years from
         a primary school in the UK were given search tasks to
         complete on an environmental Web site. Various measures were
         made of their navigational efficiency, their degree of
         lostness, and their ability to complete a map of the routes
         they had traversed. Those with high spatial ability completed
         the tasks in shorter time, became lost less frequently, and
         completed the maps more accurately. This paper discusses the
         implications of these results to the success of hypertext
         learning environments for learners with low spatial ability.

      Task modelling has been entering the development process of web
      applications. However, modelling web processes from a
      usage-centred perspective is still challenging due to the strong
      distinctions of traditional interactive systems and
      state-of-the-art web applications. This paper proposes the
      WebTaskModel approach, by which task model concepts are adapted
      for the purpose of modelling interactive web applications. The
      main difference to existing task models is the introduction and
      build-time usage of a generic task lifecycle. Hereby the
      descriptions of exceptions and error cases of task performance
      (caused by, e.g., the stateless protocol or Browser
      interactions) are on the one hand appended to the task while, on
      the other hand, being clearly separated.

    " In an effort to understand the impact of designing for digital
    genres on users' mental representations of structure, a two-phase
    study was conducted. In phase~1, six expert news readers and a
    panel of HCI experts were solicited for input regarding
    genre-conforming and genre-violating web news page design,
    navigation, and story categorization. In phase~2, a longitudinal
    experiment with a group of 25 novice web news readers who were
    exposed to one of the two designs over 5 sessions is
    reported. During these sessions a variety of user data were
    captured, including: comprehension (recall, recognition),
    usability (time on task, accuracy, user satisfaction), and
    navigation (path length, category node hits).
    \newline
      The between-group difference of web site design was significant
    for comprehension, usability, and navigation with the users of the
    genre-conforming design demonstrating better performance. The
    within-group difference of time was significant across these three
    measures as well, with performance improving over time. No
    interaction effect was found between web site design and time on
    comprehension or usability. However, a surprising interaction
    effect was found on navigation; specifically the breadth of
    navigation (i.e. the number of nodes visited for two classes of
    tasks) increased over time more dramatically for the
    genre-violating group than for the genre-conforming group. By
    examining the changes in these data over time and between the two
    designs, evidence for the development of users' mental
    representations of structure was captured."

    to consult a mental representation of the mapping between the
    content of documents and their structure. We report three
    experiments that investigate the construction and use of such
    `structure maps.' In each experiment people read multiple on-line
    texts on the same topic, and then searched for specific pieces of
    information in those texts. Search performance was compared with
    people who had not read the texts. People who had read multiple
    texts were, to some extent, able to recall where information was
    in the texts as shown by the locations in which they first
    searched (Experiments 1 and 2) or the number of pages opened
    during a search (Experiment~3). We also found that readers of
    multiple texts were able to find facts in those texts faster than
    were people who had not read the texts, and that this speedup was
    not a simple effect of faster reading while scanning for facts
    (Experiments 1 and 2) or of greater familiarity with the general
    topic (Experiment~3). These incidental effects of reading occurred
    whether or not participants were warned before reading that they
    would have subsequently to search the texts and were not
    compromised by transformations in the appearance of text (double
    column to single column) that disrupted the positions of facts on
    pages (Experiment~2). We conclude that readers spontaneously
    construct structure maps of multiple electronic texts, even when
    their reading goal stresses abstraction of meaning across
    sources. Structure maps likely play a vital role in many aspects
    of text use, such as re-reading and knowledge updating, so that
    their support is an important consideration in the design of
    on-line texts."

     interested in web designers' difficulties or in comparing their

     studies presented in this article compare the strategies
     developed both by professional web designers and (novice
     vs. experienced) web users while searching for information on web
     sites of varying ergonomic quality. More precisely, we
     investigated whether web designers can effectively use their own
     strategies as web users when designing web sites. We presented a
     comparison of novice web users, experienced web users and
     professional web designers searching behavior and cognitive load
     when using ergonomic and non-ergonomic web sites. In addition, we
     asked web designers to predict the strategy used by novice web
     users. Based on the results obtained in the two experiments, we
     conclude that web designers are not able to predict strategies of
     novice users and do not behave like novice users. Consequently,
     ways for supporting web designers in developing a user-centered
     activity are necessary, and certain ways are suggested at the end
     of this article."

     that a perspective supported by semiotic and cognitively oriented

     representational requirements for the semantics of tools for
     contesting meaning. We introduce our semiotic approach,
     highlighting its implications for discourse representation,
     before describing a research system (ClaiMaker) designed to
     support the construction of scholarly argumentation by allowing
     analysts to publish and contest [`]claims' about scientific
     contributions. We show how ClaiMaker's representational scheme is
     grounded in specific assumptions concerning the nature of
     explicit modelling, and the evolution of meaning within a
     discourse community. These characteristics allow the system to
     represent scholarly discourse as a dynamic process, in the form
     of continuously evolving structures. A cognitively oriented
     discourse analysis then shows how the use of a small set of
     cognitive relational primitives in the underlying ontology opens
     possibilities for offering users advanced forms of computational
     service for analysing collectively constructed argumentation

      a cyclic model. Using this model as a framework, the
      relationships among perceived goal difficulty, goal success, and
      self-efficacy were examined. Self-efficacy was conceptualized as
      a mediating mechanism and intrinsic motivation (IM) in the task
      was examined as a moderator. Data were collected as repeated
      measures over 20 cycles during an hour-long session of
      information seeking when students were given that task of
      designing a travel plan for a trip to China. The findings
      suggest that success in meeting information goals in one cycle
      resulted in an increase in self-efficacy, which in turn reduced
      the perceived difficulty of information goals in the upcoming
      cycle. At the same time, self-efficacy from previous cycles
      seemed to provide the impetus for formulating more challenging
      information goals in subsequent cycles. Besides this dual role
      of self-efficacy, the moderating role of IM was also
      evident. For participants relatively high in baseline IM for the
      task, the link between self-efficacy and goal success was
      weaker. However, for participants with relatively low levels of
      baseline IM for the task, goal success has a stronger effect on
      self-efficacy."

     task significantly faster, committing fewer mistakes, rating it
     significantly better on subjective scales as well as when compared
     to the GUIs from other websites they had visited. However,
     performance did not improve with the ETI on the navigation task,
     the main reason presumed to be labeling problems. We conclude that
     the ETI is an improvement over the GUI, but that it cannot help in
     overcoming one major weakness of most websites: If users do not
     understand navigation labels, even the best user interface cannot
     help them navigate."

   ,Abstract = "An important aspect of the empirical study of user
      experience is the process by which users form aesthetic and
      other judgements of interactive products. The current study
      extends previous research by presenting test users with a
      context (mode of use) in which to make their judgements, using
      sets of web pages from specific domains rather than unrelated
      pages, studying the congruence of perceptions of aesthetic value
      over time, including judgements after use of a web site,
      manipulating the aesthetic design of web pages and studying the
      relationship between usability and aesthetic value. The results
      from two experiments demonstrate that context increases the
      stability of judgements from perceptions after brief exposure to
      those after self-paced exposure and from perceptions after
      self-paced exposure to those of after site use. Experiment~1
      shows that relatively attractive pages are preferred over
      relatively unattractive pages after brief exposure, but only if
      no context is provided. Experiment 2 shows that after brief
      exposure, classically aesthetic pages that are information
      oriented are rated as more attractive than expressively
      aesthetic pages. Perceptions are not correlated with measures of
      task performance or mental effort. We conclude that context is a
      pivotal factor influencing the stability of users' perceptions,
      which must be explicitly addressed in the study of users'
      product experience. Furthermore, the type of aesthetics that is
      relevant to users' perceptions appears to depend on the
      application domain. The principle [`]what is beautiful is
      usable' is not confirmed."

      the concepts in the narrative text of a medical document is
      necessary to provide semantically accurate information for
      further processing steps. The MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) program is
      a semantic annotation system that generates a rough mapping of
      concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
      Metathesaurus to free medical text, but this mapping still
      contains erroneous and ambiguous bits of information. Since
      manually correcting the mapping is an extremely cumbersome and
      time-consuming task, we have developed the MapFace editor.
     \newline
        The editor provides a convenient way of navigating the
      annotated information gained from information on both a
      conceptual and a syntactical level, and thus it greatly
      facilitates the handling of the MMTx program. Additionally, the
      editor provides enhanced visualization features to support the
      correct interpretation of medical concepts within the text. We
      paid special attention to ensure that the MapFace editor is an
      intuitive and convenient tool to work with. Therefore, we
      recently conducted a usability study in order to create a well
      founded background serving as a starting point for further
      improvement of the editor's usability."

     with a paragraph of Chinese texts as the stimuli. Contrastly, the

     stimuli. The positions of the text overlay were determined by
     varying the balance and symmetry in order to validate
     computational aesthetic quantification algorithms with subjective
     ratings. The stimuli were rated by 20 subjects in each experiment
     using the ratio-scale magnitude estimation method against a
     benchmark image for each photo. Results from both experiments
     show that subjects are adept at judging symmetry and balance in
     both the horizontal and vertical directions. Subjects are also
     adept at judging radial symmetry about the center point of an
     image. The experiments also established a relationship between a
     higher averaged visual balance and the aesthetic appeal of
     text-overlaid images. Symmetry in either direction, however, did

        Better understanding learners' mental models will help us to assess
      advanced knowledge and problem solving skills acquired while

      are the internal, conceptual and operational representations that
      humans develop while interacting with complex systems. In this paper,
      we argue that they are also embedded in the activities engaged in by
      a community of practice, the social relations among members of that
      community, the discourse used by that community to negotiate meaning,
      and in the artifacts that are used and produced by the community
      during their activity. This paper describes two studies: one aimed at
      eliciting mental models in the heads of novice refrigeration
      technicians and the other an ethnographic study eliciting knowledge

   ,Abstract = "Recent research on annotation interfaces provides
     provocative evidence that anchored, annotation-based discussion
     environments may lead to better conversations about a text. However,
     annotation interfaces raise complicated tradeoffs regarding screen
     real estate and positioning. It is argued that solving this screen
     real estate problem requires limiting the number of annotations
     displayed to users. In order to understand which annotations have the
     most learning value for students, this paper presents two
     complementary studies examining the effects of annotations on students
     performing a reading-to-write task. The first study used think-aloud
     protocols and a within-subjects methodology, finding that annotations
     appeared to provoke students to reflect more critically upon the
     primary text. This effect was particularly strong when students
     encountered pairs of annotations presenting different viewpoints on
     the same section of text. Student interviews suggested that
     annotations were most helpful when they caused the reader to consider
     and weigh conflicting viewpoints. The second study used a
     between-subjects methodology and a more naturalistic task to provide
     complementary evidence that annotations encourage more reflective
     responses to a text. This study found that students who received
     annotated materials both perceived themselves and were perceived by
     instructors as less reliant on unreflective summary strategies than
     students who received the same content but in a different
     format. These findings indicate that the learning value of an
     annotation lies in its ability to provoke students to consider and
     weigh new perspectives on the primary text. When selected effectively,
     annotations provide a critical scaffolding that can support students’
     critical thinking and argumentation activities. Collaborative digital
     libraries and applications for the Web 2.0 should be designed with
     this learning framework in mind."
