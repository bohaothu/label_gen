    abstract =  {This specification defines Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1 (CSS 2.1). CSS 2.1 is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS 2.1 simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance. CSS 2.1 builds on CSS2 which builds on CSS1. It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation. CSS 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace CSS2. Some parts of CSS2 are unchanged in CSS 2.1, some parts have been altered, and some parts removed. The removed portions may be used in a future CSS3 specification. Future specs should refer to CSS 2.1 (unless they need features from CSS2 which have been dropped in CSS 2.1, and then they should only reference CSS2 for those features, or preferably reference such feature(s) in the respective CSS3 Module that includes those feature(s)).}

Some users and specifications would like to use XML Schema processors which process XML 1.1 documents, and some implementors of XML Schema processors would like to provide XML 1.1 support. This Note suggests an implementation strategy for implementors to adopt to enable users and specifications to get such support in a consistent way. All aspects of XML Schema which are liable to re-interpretation as a result of changes in XML 1.1 are discussed. An implementation of schema-validity assessment employing such a strategy is strictly speaking non-conformant to the current version of the XML Schema specification. The XML Schema WG none-the-less believes that interoperability will best be served by such non-conformant processors being made available to users, until such time as a subsequent version of XML Schema addressing this issue normatively is approved."
