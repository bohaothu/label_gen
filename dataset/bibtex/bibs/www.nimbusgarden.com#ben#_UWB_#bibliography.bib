	Abstract = { We propose a MAC protocol for use in multihop wireless networks that deploy an underlying UWB (Ultra Wide Band)-based physical layer. We consider a multiband approach to better utilize the available spectrum, where each transmitter sends longer pulses in one of many narrower frequency bands. The motivation comes from the observation that, in the absence of a sophisticated equalizer, the size of a slot for transmitting a UWB pulse is typically dictated by the delay spread of the channel. Therefore, using a wider frequency band to shorten the transmission time for each pulse does not increase the data rate in proportion to the available bandwidth. Our approach allows data transmissions to be contiguous and practically interference free, and, thus, highly efficient. For practicality, we ensure the conformance of our approach to FCC-imposed emission limits. We evaluate our approach via extensive simulations, and our results demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach over single-band solutions: The throughput increases significantly and the number of collisions decreases considerably. Finally, we analyze the behavior of our MAC protocol in a single-hop setting in terms of its efficiency in utilizing the multiple bands.

	Abstract = {We present Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the synchronization of UWB signals which should be tight lower bounds for the theoretical performance limits of UWB synchronizers. The CRLBs are investigated for both single-pulse systems and time-hopping systems in AWGN and multipath channels. Insights are given into the relationship between CRLBs for different Gaussian monocycles. An approximation method of the CRLBs is discussed when nuisance parameters exist. CRLBs in multipath channels are studied and formulated for three scenarios depending on the waymultipath interference is treated. We find that a larger number of multipaths implies higher CRLBs and inferior performance of the synchronizers, and multipath interference on CRLBs cannot be eliminated completely except in very special cases. As every estimate of time delay could not be perfect, the least influence of the synchronization error on the performance of receivers is quantified.}}

	Abstract = {In ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, conventionally, the synchronization is to align time phases of a locally generated template and any of multipath components to within an allowable range. However, the synchronization with a low-power multipath component could incur significant performance degradation in receiver operation (e.g., detection) after the synchronization. On the other hand, the synchronization with a high-power multipath component can improve the performance in receiver operation after the synchronization. Generally, the first one among multipath components has the largest power. Thus, the synchronization with the first path component can make better performance than that with a low-power component in receiver operations after the synchronization. Based on which, we first propose an optimal decision rule based on a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, and then, develope a simpler suboptimal decision rule for selecting the first path component. Simulation results show that the optimal and suboptimal decision rules have better performance than the conventional decision rule in UWB multipath channels.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of coarse synchronization of ultra wideband signals in the dense multipath channel, following the widely used hypothesis testing approach in which the uncertainty region for the timing offset is divided into a certain number of cells. We propose a novel strategy for the search of the correct cells, within the constant increment perspective. We show that under a simple model the proposed strategy achieves practically the minimum possible mean acquisition time, independently of the length of the channel impulse response, as opposed to previous constant increment approaches. A comparative analysis of the proposed strategy and another convenient one reveals that, strictly speaking, none of them can be considered optimum from the point of view of the mean acquisition time. The proposed method is advantageous from the point of view of computational complexity in the general case. Simulations with a realistic channel model confirm that the proposed strategy is very appropriate for the problem of coarse synchronization of UWB signals.

	Url = {http://www.merl.com/projects/timesync/},
	Urldate = {2007},
	Abstract = {A problem in wireless communications is processing symbols received via a time dispersive channel causing intersymbol interferences.  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is an effective modulation technique for such channels.  To further reduce OFDM symbol interferences, the OFDM symbols are sent through multiple frequency bands.
     Proper decoding of the received OFDM symbols requires an accurate synchronization, i.e. a correct estimation of the arrival time at the receiver of the OFDM symbols.  Detecting and synchronizing to the packets and estimating the related parameters becomes more difficult, however, when the symbols are transmitted over different frequency bands according to a frequency hopping pattern.  Furthermore a new device attempting to join a network does not know a priori the sequence being used by the network.
     MERL proposed synchronization techniques to detect frequency hopped packets and to synchronize, providing an optimal time for processing blocks of symbols during the preamble, in addition to an estimate of a carrier frequency offset.

Background & Objective:  Concurrently to its activities as contributor to WiMedia and co-author of the first UWB standard approved by ECMA International, MERL worked on some implementation issues of the Multiband OFDM receiver.  One main achievement of this work is the invention of two patents on synchronization.

Technical Discussion:  The first aspect of this work focused on synchronizing OFDM symbols provided in the preamble, considering these symbols do not have a cyclic prefix and including the effect of channels with different delay spread.  The second aspect of this work looked at the challenge of a device joining a network without any prior knowledge of its frequency hopping pattern.  To achieve a successful detection, the analysis of the signal received in the selected frequency sub-band relative to the periodicities associated with the respective predefined groups of partitioned frequency hopping patterns is performed. }}

	Abstract = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication systems are based on the transmission of extremely narrow pulses, with a duration inferior to a nanosecond. The application of transmit reference (TR) to UWB systems allows to side-step channel estimation at the receiver, with a tradeoff of the effective transmission bandwidth, which is reduced by the usage of a reference pulse. Similar to CDMA systems, different users can share the same available bandwidth by means of different spreading codes. This allows the receiver to separate users, and to recover the timing information of the transmitted data packets. The nature of UWB transmissions--short, burst-like packets--requires a fast synchronization algorithm, that can accommodate several asynchronous users. Exploiting the fact that a shift in time corresponds to a phase rotation in the frequency domain, a blind and computationally effcient synchronization algorithm that takes advantage of the shift invariance structure in the frequency domain is proposed in this paper. Integer and fractional delay estimations are considered, along with a subsequent symbol estimation step. This results in a collision-avoiding multiuser algorithm, readily applicable to a fast acquisition procedure in a UWB ad hoc network.},

	Abstract = {Precise localization and reliable exchange of information among distributed sensors, soldiers and unmanned aerial/ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs) are important for tactical communications. To this end, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology emerges as a promising candidate, providing high performance wireless links with low complexity and low probability of detection (LPD). Rapid timing synchronization constitutes a major challenge in realizing these promises. Synchronization faces accentuated difficulties in the UWB regime because its waveforms are impulse-like and have low amplitude, and the propagation channel is unknown at the receiver. These explain why synchronization has attracted so much interest in UWB research 3, 1, 4, 6, 5. But each of existing approaches requires a number of restrictive assumptions. Without invoking any of the assumptions required by existing algorithms, we develop timing algorithms that remain operational in general UWB settings with fast time hopping (TH), unknown multipath propagation and even when multiple users are present. Our synchronizers rely on symbol-rate samples and thus entail low complexity. Most existing synchronizers are based on the unique maximum of the received pulse s autocorrelation function, which requires a clean template of the received pulse to be available. The latter is not feasible when the multipath channel is unknown. Our novel criterion relies on the unique maximum that emerges by cross correlating dirty templates extracted from the received waveform. These dirty templates render channel information unnecessary since it is embedded in the received waveform.}}

	Abstract = {In this letter, we propose a novel packet detection and symbol timing synchronization algorithm for MB-OFDM UWB system over multi-path channel. To find more reliable and exact symbol timing, we utilize the merits of the auto- and cross-correlation at the same time. The auto-correlator can gather the energy of the received signal which is distorted by multipath fading. And, the cross-correlator can estimate symbol timing to sample level precision. We define the detection and symbol timing metric as the moving sum of autocorrelation of the pre-computed cross-correlated signals over zero pad duration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can detect the presence of a signal with less than --4 dB SNR and find DFT window with at most 0.1 dB SNR reduction upon the receipt of two symbols.}}

PDF of All 3 Essays  |  Discussion Page

The following essays by Jack W. Reeves offer three perspectives on a single theme, namely that programming is fundamentally a design activity and that the only final and true representation of "the design" is the source code itself. This simple assertion gives rise to a rich discussion---one which Reeves explores fully in these three essays.

What Is Software Design?  Read Online  |  Printable Version

The first essay, "What Is Software Design?," was first published in the Fall 1992 issue of the now defunct C++ Journal. After a period of obscurity, in recent years the essay has entered the flow of ideas and discussion in the software development community at large, largely due to its exposure on the web and in Robert Martin's book Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices. The essay is published here in its entirety and in its original form.

What Is Software Design: 13 Years Later  Read Online  |  Printable Version

The second essay, "What Is Software Design: 13 Years Later," is the author's first writing on the subject of "code as design" since 1992. Over the years Reeves has followed the discussion that grew from the original essay, and here for the first time he responds to the most common arguments he has encountered. In the course of this task, Reeves also considers certain ideas from the original essay in light of more current trends and techniques.

Letter to the Editor  Read Online  |  Printable Version

The third essay, titled simply "Letter to the Editor," is the original letter written by Jack W. Reeves to C++ Journal. The letter is published here for the first time. It stands as a rewarding essay in its own right, giving first written expression to the themes and ideas found in "What is Software Design?" In some aspects it is even more comprehensive and spirited than the essay it inspired.

In the thirteen years since their original publication, these ideas---even today still fresh, challenging, and controversial---have taken hold (in different ways and to differing degrees) as key concepts underlying new, increasingly popular techniques and schools of thought such as Agile and craft-based methodologies; test-first design and test-driven development; and refactoring.}}

Mishupishu
the Great Horned Lynx
	
Rock Art, Scent Mark

By Don Jordan
Scattered around the world, from Siberia to the Sahara, from the caves of Lascaux to caverns in Guatemala and rock shelters in the Austrailian outback, prehistoric people have left curious runes. Called rock art, rock paintings, petroglyphs and pictographs, they have intrigued anthropologists and others continuously for decades, centuries.

In fact, interest in these ancient doodles reaches far from academic realms and is one of those things, like Egyptology, that fascinates the larger public. National Geographic, that journal of popular everything, finds its readers so enthralled that the magazine publishes regular reports on new rock art discoveries.

Governments have financed expeditions in search of both more rock art and their meanings. It was Napolean's interest in Egyptian artifiacts that "dug up" the Rosetta Stone, after all, and some individuals have spent major portions of their life's work recording and searching.

North America has not escaped the hunt. And, in Great Lakes country, especially in Ontario, interest has reached a fever pitch. University students trek into the bush every summer to record red ocre paintings which abound in the region, and many non-academic types have adopted the hunt as a hobby.

At Parks Canada's Marathon, Ont., office I met a naturalist with an avid interest in rock art. We talked for hours one afternoon, and that conversation led me to a known but unrecorded site called Les Petits Escrits. More on that later.

The key to all this interest in rock art is the problematic nature of their existance and meaning. Practially all investigators, popular and academic journals have resorted to religious explanations to explain their meanings.

The Lascaux and other French cave paintings are said to be information revealed to cult members during ceremonial "hunts" deep in the bowels of the labyrinths. In describing his rock art finds in Baja, Harry Crosby used the word "ritual" and suggested that paintings atop other paintings might have some special ceremonial significance. Since then, some researchers have theorized that paintings atop of paintings represent a "rekilling" of certain animals depicted and that this must certainly have been part of some kind of ritual.

Selwyn Dewdney, whose decade-long work in Ontario sparked much of the interest there, thought ther was some connection between the rock pictographs (as he called them) and the Mide' Society, a politico-religious cult that flourished in North America, but especially among the Ojibwa-Chippewa around the time of European contact (1500 to 1800).

Both Dewdney and anthropologist Kenneth Kidd of Trent University made this link, because certain of the pictographic symbols also appear in Ojibwa bark scrolls. Such scrolls are known to have been part of the Mide' shaman's kitbag and were apparently used to record both creation myths and ceremonial rules and directions.

Such links obviously exist. The monster Mishupishu, for example, is frequently seen in both rock pictographs and surviving bark scrolls. Mishupishu means something like "great horned underwater lynx" (the Ojibwa didn't know what to call Lake Superior's own version of Nessie).

Kidd wrote in is epilogue to Dewdney's site recording quest: "All the pictures were presumably placed on the rocks for some purpose, the most obvious being to convey a message. If they were intended as messages, some were probably addressed to the attention of other Indians; some to the inhabitants of the spirit world. Any which were not, strictly speaking, messages, may have been memorials of one sort or another, illustrations of myths, or markers of spots of some ritual or other significance."

That covers about everything, but beyond this sort of stdatement, Kidd and others sink into an abyss of detailed confusion about meaning and motivation.

Businessmen, when faced with similar conundrums, often say it is time to "redefine" the problem.

That is what I do here--suggest a new frame of reference that hasn't been tried that can get us beyond references to magic, spirts, myth, mysticism, ritual and religion.

I suggest looking at rock art as evidence of human behavior in a biological sense. Instead of the fruitless search for a Great Lakes Rosetta Stone, why not attempt to figure out the "adaptive" significance on a Darwinian sense. What is their survival value, and what were the motiviations of the artists? I call it the Graffiti Hypothesis.

Agawa Rock

Of the hundreds of known Ontario sites, Agawa Rock is the most well-known and by far the most dramatic. Today, a large sign marks its location off Highway 17 on the northeast shore of Lake Superior. Special visitor's pamphlets are provided by the provincial government as an aide to tourist, and improved trails with wooden stairs have been built to accomodate people making a land approach to the site.

It is very rough terrain, complete with deep crevasses and shear rock faces common along a geologic fault. The trails are an engineering feat that emphasizes the difficulty of approaching Agawa Rock by land. Ancient approaches were made by water, and it is obvious at least some were painted from a canoe bobbing in Lake Superior, because they are impossible to reach by foot.

There are, or were, 37 pictographs on Agawa Rock. Some are considered to belong to a set or sets and others stand alone and were clearly rendered by different artists.

The Agawa site is one of the few with an ethnohistoric explanation. Henry Schoolcraft, the Indian agent and ethnographer who lived at Sault Ste. Marie in the early 19th Century, got the story from an Ojibwa shaman named Chingwauk.

He gave Schoolcraft two bark scrolls upon which he had scribed figures he had seen at Agawa Rock, about 170 miles to the north of the Soo. Chingwauk claimed these figures were rendered by another Ojibwa shaman, Myeegun.

According to the story, Myeegun led a war party across dreaded Lake Superior from Keweenaw Peninsula on the south shore to a battle at Agawa Bay. Many of the paintings are said to be an account of the crossing and ensuing battle.

Other figures at the site are thought to be representative of clan symbols and religious symbols associated with Ojibwa vision quests.

The official Canadian government hand-out says: "For the Algonkians, the clan symbol was an important aspect of one's identity, and persons of different tribes who shared a class sign might feel greater loyalty to each other than to their fellow tribesmen or even family members." Furthermore, visitor pamplet notes that "the Agawa symbols are in many cases then, probably indicative" of vision quests for "manitou personal".

There is no evidence to support either claim, although both statements fit in well with contemporary beliefs and Schoolcraft's report.

Schoolcraft reported in 1851 that native rock figures were usually painted in hard-to-reach spots on the faces of perpendicular cliffs. He believed their purpose was "to produce a feeling of surprise or mystery."

Dewdney, whose passing is now commemorated by a bronze plaque set in granite next to Agawa Rock, believed the figures were demonstrations of native thought and were "baffling to early traders and missionaries" who were "incapable of understanding the native style of thinking: subtle, indirect, and highly allegorical, the more so when the concept was a focus of fear..."

None of these proposed exclamations get close to meaning and offer only generalizations about motivation of the artists. Even more telling is that none of the sociological explanations offered to date tie all the various painting themes together in any kind of consistent hypothesis.

Take a look at the Agawa paintings. Among them is a man on a horse. This figure sticks out from the others--canoes, turtles, fish, serpents, birds, Mishupishu (the great "horned" lynx of the lake) and other items from daily Ojibwa life. Besides providing arough dating clue (the first horses didn't appear at the Soo until after 1600), the horse must be a strong referent to the painter. How many Ojibwa could have seen or ridden a horse at the time? An Ojibwa man who saw or even rode a horse would have gained considerable fame among his fellows.

Note that the horse appears with the set that is supposed to mean Myeegun crossed the lake in four days. A turtle, also in this group, could refer to landfall, homage to the painter's personal manitou, or a clan. It could also be just a painting of a turtle.

Les Petits Ecrits

The next closest known set of paintings is 150 miles to the north and west along Superior's isolated north shore, near the town of Terrace Bay, Ontario. It bears little resemblance to Agawa Rock. Although unrecorded in academic or popular litrature, Dewdney found an historical reference and sought the site without success. The site is known as Les Petits Ecrits (the small writings).

He probably didn't ask local people about the site, because I found it was well-known by Terrace Bay residents. A Ministry of Natural Resources employee took me there in the summer of 1980.

This small set of pictographs is painted in red ocre, but they are on two faces of an overhanging granite boulder at the back of a small bay, surrounded by a gravel beach.

One face sports a large Maymaygawish (little horned man that lives in the rocks) and an accompanying arrow. The other face, high in the corner of the overhang on a tiny flat space, includes three clear figures and one or two faded ones. Included are a circle with a dot in the middle, a small Maymaygawish and two anthropomorphic figures.

Maymaygawish appear on many rock faces in the Canadian Shield country, as do circles and anthropomorphic figures. Mishupishu is another common figure among the pictographs elswhere but is not depicted at Les Petits Ecrits.

Viewed as graffiti behavior, the individual symbols are less important than their combinations. At Agawa Rock, the horse with rider was probably a clear identification of the painter. The four circles there could easily respresent Myeegun's fourth degree membership in the Mide'.

Perhaps he did cross the lake in four days, but considering the mystical nature of the number four in Ojibwa mythology, he may hve put down four "suns" no matter how long it took to make the crossing. The turtle, if it is a turtle, could be an ally or a clan symbol. In any case, it would be easy enough to read this set as a signature of a fourth degree shaman who had seen or ridden a horse, or maybe even owned one. As already mentioned, horses were not seen at The Soo until after 1600. Anyone who had seen, riden or owned a horse among the Ojibwa would have been known for it.

At Les Petits Ecrits, the diversity of symbols is less marked, and only one circle is used. The painter also used mystical references and abstract ones. As graffiti, the smallest set could again be a signature. In this case, the signator would have been a first degree Mide' initiate (one circle) who had mystical knowledge of the Maymaygawish, and, perhaps, Nanebosho, the Great Hare.

Pictographic interpretations aside, there is stronger evidence of the graffiti-like nature of the pictographs.

The Doodling Traveller

The overhanging boulder at Les Petits Ecrits offers a natural shelter. Empty cans, remains of a fire and even a pair of discarded underwear were present under the boulder's shelf when I visited.

These artifacts could have been left as an offering to the spirits, an Ojibwa behavior that is as strong as it ever was; or they could have been left by some weather-bound canoeist, trapper or hunter who laid up at the site.

No matter. It was the litter that forced me to bigin thinking of the pictographs as graffiti.

Because even though Schoolcraft reported that pictographs were only found in out-of-the-way places, my surveys found that just the opposite is the case.

It was true that Agawa Rock was out-of-the-way for a white man at The Soo, but for people who moved along the shore and around the lake on a regular basis, the shoreline would have been a familiar roadside. Les Petits Ecrits would have been and still is a handy spot for a weatherbound traveller. Agawa Rock would have been one of the most spectacular billboards on the route.

These days the older water routes have been abandoned by all but tourist canoeists. The highways are now jammed with travellers. And, it is hard not to notice the modern "rock art" that colors the roadside cliffs and boulders along Highway 17. Graffiti is ubiquitous, especially where there are dramatic granite billboards to use for canvas.

In the days of the red ocre painters, the major trade routes were along Superior's shores and through the Rainy River lake country to the west. Ojibwa and Sioux are known to have contended over the territory, and the heaviest concentration of pictographs (native graffiti) is in the much-travelled region. What is now the Quetico-Superior boundary waters area was a major canoe route 600 years ago.

Contemporary Ojibwa people living in this country are enthusiastic rock painters to this day. One concentration at the Heron Bay reserve matches Agawa Rock in numbers of symbols and confusion of meaning.

Contemporary graffiti at Heron Bay includes initials, place names, political statements ("Get High" or "Fuck You"), religious ones ("Jesus Saves"), calls for native unity, smiling faces and countless undecipherable signs. Much of this modern graffiti is meant to be cryptic--the graffitist wants his or her intellect, hometown, political interests and so forth known to passers-by, but seldom leaves his or her full name. However, the people who live at Heron Bay can tell you who wrote what on their rock wall just by what they did paint. So, in a way, simply recording what is "on their heart" is identification in itself.

As an anthropologist with a strong interest in animal behavior, this behavior looks very much like mammalian scent marking, although it has a peculiar an appropriate human twist.

First, the graffitist seems to want his or her passing known, while, at the same time maintaining anonymity, at least from police. In the case of organized urban gangs, symbols represent each gang much as the Agawa Rock animal figures are supposed to represent clans. Individual gang members are known by some cyptic nickname which is often stylized into a sort of "logo" or trademark that other gang members recognize but the outside world doesn't.

Seen in this way, graffiti behavior is highly individualized on one level but also reinforces gang or clan bonds by creating and sharing exclusive symbols understood fully by the group alone.

Graffiti and pictographs are both statements by individuals who are laying some kind of claim to the spot painted. Graffiti behavior is more intense where population densities are high, or at boundaries where group or individual claims overlap.

This is exactly what one sees in scent-marking mammals. Where one coyote makes a scent mark, every coyote that passes there will also mark the spot.

In contemporary society we mark our territories with symbols in the form of deeds and property lines. We are plainly symbolic scent markers, and there is no reason to suppose the Ojibwa shamans, or all people everywhere, are any different.

If we are to believe Ruth Landes' account of Ojibwa religion, shamans were incredibly egotistic and individualistic persons. They would have been eager to mark their territories.

Finally, viewing pictographs as graffiti behavior or symbolic scent marking opens new kinds of inquiry and completes our historical knowledge of graffiti.

Graffiti can be traced at least as far back as Pompeii where citizens adorned their alleyways with sexually explicit drawings, names, dates and all sorts of other information. Soldiers of every army since written language began have left symbolic marks along their routes.

But our historical record of graffiti only goes back to the point where written languages appear. Drawings in caves and on rock faces around the world, done by ancient peoples are classified as "pictographs" or "petroglyphs" or cave "paintings" and rock "art."

However, rock art fits the graffiti bill like a glove, and to anthropologists, it clearly demonstrates behavioral continuity through time.

Such continuity is easily seen in North American rock graffiti (sic, art). At Picture Lake near Thunder Bay, Ont., someone, perhaps an early trapper, wrote "Simo" on the rock face as part of a set of native pictographs that includes canoes, men, serpents and hand prints. In Utah, native artists have chipped historical events on among older symbols. There are bearded men with guns riding a train, as well as a commemoration of the first moon landing.

What all this suggests to me is the value of studying contemporary graffiti. It ought to be possible, for example, to record contemporary Ojibwa thoughts on artistic motivation through observation and interview. Any information derived could be applied to similar behavior in white society, or at least lead us to a new understanding of our biocultural nature, because graffiti is one of those nexuses of individual and group behavior.

Finally, there has to be a conection between grafffiti/scent marking and development of written language. North American native people may have been on the verge of developing their own written languages, but that's another story for another time.

	Abstract = {This paper applies network coding to wireless mesh networks
and presents the first implementation results. It
introduces COPE, an opportunistic approach to network
coding, where each node snoops on the medium, learns the
status of its neighbors, detects coding opportunities, and
codes as long as the recipients can decode. This flexible
design allows COPE to efficiently support multiple unicast
flows, even when traffic demands are unknown and bursty,
and the senders and receivers are dynamic. We evaluate
COPE using both emulation and testbed implementation.
Our results show that COPE substantially improves the
network throughput, and as the number of flows and the
contention level increases, COPE's throughput becomes
many times higher than current 802.11 mesh networks.}}

Introduction:

Over the years, our research has combined interests and inventions in computer science (object-oriented programming, reflective whole systems, networking), graphics (bit-map screens and ``bitblt''), UI (overlapping windows and icons, modeless editing and interactions), education (particularly for children), design (aiming for beauty as well as problem solving), and computer engineering (learning how to efficiently make whole HW & SW systems). The latter has allowed us to tackle new approaches on a large scale, deploy and test real solutions without huge teams or being bound to particular computational models, tools or platforms. Some of the alternative approaches we've invented have become mainstream (and some not), but a very important process in our work over the years is to be able to control our own HW & SW destinies by making high-enough-level languages with powerful enough tools to allow our small but critical mass research group to successfully implement anything we want to try.

In short, we've been very interested in the ideas and ideals of personal computing since its inception, and have strived to come up with real advances for real users, by making real systems, deploying and testing them.
These alternative systems have been small in comparison with standard practice, e.g. today's Squeak Smalltalk[Sq1] covers much of personal computing, includes its own applications, operating environment, UI and development tools, runable specifications, etc., in about 2.8MB of code (about 200,000 lines). But our intuitive sense of ``mathematical entropy'' insists that an even more comprehensive design approach to whole-system personal computing could be smaller by a factor of 10 or more (a factor of 2 from removing non-used code, and another factor of 5 or more via a different, more advanced architecture and design).}}

Programming Team Earns Slot in World Finals

December 2007 -- A three-student team of Michigan Tech Computer Science majors finished second out of 195 teams from 63 colleges and universities in the North Central North American Region of the International Collegiate Programming Contest and qualified for the world finals in Banff, Alberta, Canada in early April.

The students, Mikola Lysenko, Ryan Richards and Nicholas Smolinske, were narrowly edged out of first place by a team from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in the last few minutes of a very exciting contest.

The team joins 92 other teams from around the world in the largest and most prestigious contest of its kind in the world. Worldwide over 7000 teams competed in various regionals, putting MTU's team in the top 1.3%, no small feat considering the competition came form schools the likes of MIT, Cal tech, and the University of Michigan. 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


March 2007 -- CS Majors Win Programming Contest

    MTU Computer Science students placed first among five schools partipating in the 8th annual NMU programming contest held at Northern Michigan University on March 31st. MTU's top three-man teams took second (Scott Carroll, Kishor Joshi, Oystein Thorsen), fifth (Merrill Dynes, John Earnest, Richard Pringle) and seventh (Craig Koenigs, Dave Stanich, Chris Swisher) place among 24 teams to secure the victory for MTU. The contest involves writing programs to correctly solve up to six problems in five hours using a single computer. Winners were determined by a combination of the number of problems correctly solved and the time it took to solve them. This tests the students' ability to quickly formulate solution methods, code them, and then thoroughly test them before submitting them for judging, and requires knowledge of algorithms and data structures, attention to detail, and a team approach to problem solving.

	Abstract = {Secure device pairing is especially difficult for spontaneous 
interaction in ubiquitous computing environments because of wireless 
communication, lack of powerful user interfaces, and scalability issues. 
We demonstrate a method to address this problem for small, mobile 
devices that does not require explicit user interfaces like displays or key 
pads. By shaking devices together in one hand for a few seconds, they 
are securely paired. Device authentication happens implicitly as part of 
the pairing process without the need for explicit user interaction ``just 
for security''. Our method has been implemented in two variants: first, 
for high-quality data collection using wired accelerometers; second, using 
built-in accelerometers in standard Nokia 5500 mobile phones.

	Abstract = {Rationale		

Bonobos and chimpanzees are the apes that are genetically closest to human beings. Yet the former tend to be friendly with each other and prone to collaborate, whereas the latter are usually more nasty and selfish. A similar difference has been observed lately between the research efforts of physical layer specialists on one hand and those of wireless networkers on the other hand: the former focus on cooperation between wireless devices (beamforming,...), whereas the latter are obsessed by selfish (or non-cooperative) behavior. Yet, these behaviors are not necessarily exclusive: in some cases, the most egoistic attitude consists in cooperating.

The purpose of this panel is to bring together (human) specialists of each of the two camps. In particular, they will address the following issues:

Does the word 'cooperation' mean the same thing in each camp?
How relevant are these issues in practice?
Can a device be cooperative at the physical layer and non-cooperative at the other layers?
How does cross-layer design come into the picture?
What are the security implications (or requirements) of non-cooperative and cooperative behavior?
Are the players only wireless devices, or can larger bodies (even wireless operators) exhibit (non)-cooperative behavior?
Is game theory useful in designing distributed algorithms for cooperative wireless systems?
Is the distinction made in game theory between cooperative and non-cooperative games of some use in this framework?
How do limits on available information affect the knowledge and rationality assumptions inherent in game theoretic models applied to wireless networks?
What are the implications of all the above questions on cognitive radios and software-defined radios?
The audience will then be invited to participate in the debate.

	Volume = {1},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of spectrum co-existence between IEEE 802.11b and 802.16a networks in the same shared frequency band using cognitive radio techniques with different levels of complexity. Simple reactive interference avoidance algorithms as well as proactive spectrum coordination policies based on etiquette protocols are proposed and compared in terms of achievable spectrum efficiency in a shared Wi-Fi/Wi-Max scenario. In reactive interference avoidance methods, radio nodes coordinate spectrum usage without exchange of explicit control information-this is done by adaptively adjusting transmit PHY parameters such as frequency, power and time occupancy based on local observations of the radio band. Because local observations provide information only about transmitters, they may not be sufficient for resolving spectrum contention in scenarios with 'hidden receivers'. Proactive coordination techniques solve the hidden-receiver problem by utilizing a common spectrum coordination channel (CSCC) for exchange of transmitter and receiver parameters. Radio nodes can cooperatively select key PHY-layer variables such as frequency and power by broadcasting messages in the CSCC channel and then following specified spectrum etiquette policies. An ns2 simulation model is developed to evaluate both reactive and proactive etiquette policies in scenarios with co-existing IEEE 802.11b and 802.16a networks. The density of radio nodes in the coverage region, and their degree of spatial clustering are key parameters in the system evaluation. Detailed simulation studies were carried out for a variety of scenarios including both single and multiple 802.11b hotspots per 802.16a cell with and without spatial clustering. Our results show that simple reactive algorithms can improve system throughput when sufficient 'free space' (in frequency, power or time) is available for PHY adaptation. In more congested scenarios with spatially clustered nodes and hidden receivers, the proposed CSCC etiquette can significantly improve overall system performance over reactive schemes.}}

	Abstract = {This paper describes a framework for research on architectural tradeoffs and protocol designs for cognitive radio networks at both the local network and the global internetwork levels. Several key architectural issues for cognitive radio networks are discussed, including control and management protocols, support for collaborative PHY, dynamic spectrum coordination, flexible MAC layer protocols, ad hoc group formation and cross-layer adaptation. The overall goal of this work is the design and validation of the control/management and data interfaces between cognitive radio nodes in a local network, and also between cognitive radio networks and the global Internet. Protocol design and implementation based on this framework will result in the CogNet architecture, a prototype open-source cognitive radio protocol stack. Experimental evaluations on emerging cognitive radio platforms are planned for future work, first in a wireless local-area radio network scenario using wireless testbeds such as ORBIT, and later as part of several end-to-end experiments using a wide-area network testbed such as PlanetLab (and GENI in the future).}}

This paper shows how the protocol is resistant to specific security attacks and can accommodate for privacy concerns. Existing connection-establishment protocols for Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 have known security flaws, and can be compromised using well-known techniques and off-the-shelf hardware. In addition, these protocols require explicit user intervention, like entering a passkey.}}

the baseband processing makes the MPSoC design a difficult task. This paper presents a design technology for mapping flexible OFDM baseband for Cognitive Radio on a multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC).}}

We consider a multiband/wideband system with two users in which the primary (licensed) user and the secondary (cognitive) user wish to communicate to the base station, subject to mutual interference. We introduce the notion of the virtual noise-threshold which represents a proxy for the primary user to allow cognitive communications. We determine, under the assumption that each user knows only his own channel, the acceptable interference level within a given quality of service. Moreover, we obtain a characterization of the distributed power allocation for each user, as well as the resulting virtual noise threshold. We prove that a cognitive user can vary its transmit power in order to maximize the sum capacity while maintaining a guarantee of service to the primary user.}}

	Url = {http://www.eurecom.fr/util/publidownload.fr.htm?id=1964},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {Ultra-WideBand (UWB) has been recently presented as a promising radio technology due to the large bandwidth available. This feature enables point to point high data rates at short range as well as high temporal resolution with long Channel Impulse Responses (CIR). Due to the their large bandwidth, UWB systems enables high temporal resolution with long CIR. In this paper, we evaluate an original multiple access scheme called Channel Division Multiple Access (ChDMA), where we use the CIR as a user signature. The signature code is given by the channel and the users are separated by their position: this signature is uniquely determined by the user's position, which changes from one position to another. This signature locationdependent property provides decentralized flexible multiple access as the codes are naturally generated by the radio channel. The framework is analyzed and validated by capacity assessments using UWB measurements performed at Eurecom and compared with classical CDMA schemes with random spreading codes. The analysis is focused on the impact of the user's asynchronism and the period of symbol on system performance. Two structures are considered at the receiver: single-user matched filter and MMSE receiver with Gaussian and BPSK signaling schemes.}}

	Abstract = {This study focuses on orthogonal channel allocation strategies yielding multiuser diversity with a deterministic channel use in a N-user system with N parallel sub-channels. The techniques are applicable, for instance, in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple- Access (OFDMA) systems with dynamic sub-carrier allocation. We show that multiuser diversity, and thus an increase of aggregate data rates with the size of the user population, can still be successfully achieved even under a hard fairness constraint. Furthermore, we provide algorithms which perform channel allocation yielding variable-rate with constant power and fixed-rate with variable power. We show the effect of system bandwidth (and thus sub-channel correlation) on multiuser diversity. The techniques considered here do not require phase information in the channel allocation process, which, from a practical point-of-view is particularly important for time-division duplex systems exploiting channel reciprocity.

Dynamic channel resource allocation (DCA) exploiting wideband multiuser diversity can provide data transmission with 
very high spectral efficiency by scheduling at each dimension (time, frequency, space) the user with the best channel 
conditions. The main issue arising from this allocation is fairness. Base station or users have to wait until their channel is 
most favorable to transmit. It is commonly considered that fairness comes at the cost of a significant system capacity 
penalty. In this paper we show that multiuser diversity, and thus an increase of aggregate data rates with the size of the user 
population, can still be successfully achieved even with deterministic channel use and that even under a hard fairness 
constraint we can achieve performance which comes close to those of the optimal unfair policy for K-user systems with K 
parallel sub-channels. We propose and compare different algorithms which perform channel allocation yielding variable- 
rate/constant-power (Max--Min allocation and maximum total rate allocation) and fixed-rate/variable-power (fixed rate 
allocation). We show the effect of system bandwidth (and thus sub-channel correlation) on wideband multiuser diversity. 
This paper also investigates the performance of combined orthogonal channel and antenna allocation algorithms in 
multiple-antenna multi-channel systems. We extend the proposed Max-Min allocation algorithm to the multiple-antenna 
systems and compare its performance in two different transmission scenarios (spatial multiplexing and space time coding). 
An extension of the Max--Min allocation algorithm to the general case of an arbitrary number of users is also given. The 
proposed techniques are applicable, for instance, in orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) systems with 
dynamic sub-carrier allocation.}}

	Abstract = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is a new emerging technology which promises to bring a real revolution in the field of local area wireless communications. UWB is based on a shift in spectrum management paradigm which consists on allowing users to transmit over a shared bandwidth of several GHz rather than allocating private bandwidth to each user. No significant interference is caused to other UWB users nor to other systems coexisting on the same frequency bandwidth thanks to the fact that the transmitted power is constrained to have a very low spectral density. Given the huge bandwidth used by UWB systems, the latter operates in the low spectral efficiency regime. In our work we investigate the impact of UWB characteristics on the design of adequate signalling and coding schemes. Motivated by the fact that channel knowledge is not required to achieve channel capacity for vanishing spectral efficiency, we consider non-coherent type of detection. We first evaluate the performance of practical non-coherent schemes using on-off signalling. We then investigate the impact of channel estimation, made possible by channel stationary, on system performance and show at which extinct practical coherent UWB systems can outperform non-coherent ones. Later we introduce a multi-carrier UWB signalling scheme which generalizes the concept of on-off signalling to the time-frequency 2-dimentional signalling space. We analyze the performance of this signalling scheme by deriving lower and upper bounds on its achievable data rates over the set of all frequency taps correlation profiles. We then consider UWB on-off signalling in the context of peer-to-peer multiple access networks. We propose a quantized threshold-based non-coherent receiver whose performance is shown to approach the performance of a genie aided receiver. Finally we propose some practical channel code constructions that are specially designed for non-coherent UWB m-ary PPM systems. The code design uses an exit chart analysis. Code performance is then measured through simulations.}}

In particular, a system model is developed in which the two wireless systems share radio resources in frequency, space and time, and reactive coordination methods are used to reduce the mutual interference and improve link throughput. Reactive cognitive radio schemes utilize the available degrees of freedom in frequency, power and time, and react to observations in these dimensions to avoid interference. Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) enables radios to choose the band with the least interference.}}

We evaluate our solution under both scenarios, line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). Based on AIC and the MDL criterion, we find that this number is large; this has important consequences on the receiver design. We show also, that in opposition to the accepted idea in the literature, the number of DoF does not increase linearly with the channel bandwidth.}}

Moreover, we study the slope of spectral efficiency curve versus$ E_b/N_0 $(dB), and we quantify the penalty incurred by time-division multiple access (TDMA) over superposition coding in the low-power regime.}}

The TR-STBC reduces the Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) frequency-selective channel to a standard Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) channel affected by Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). Hence, we apply reduced-state sequence detection based on combined equalization and Viterbi decoding in order to decode the outer TCM code. We motivate this structure via an information theoretic argument, and we show that for sufficiently large interleaving depth it achieves the maximum diversity offered by the channel. Our scheme achieves better spectral efficiency than space-time spreading and much lower complexity with similar/superior performance than other proposed schemes with the same spectral efficiency.}}

	Abstract = {  
A driving feature of future network architectures will be the mobile user. Users increasingly will 
access information resources while on the move, whether when in a vehicle, attending a business 
meeting, or working in remote locations. Wireless technology is necessary to support the mobile 
user and adaptive and efficient use of radio spectrum is an important aspect of developing future 
network architectures. Cognitive Radios (CRs) integrate radio technology and networking 
technology to provide efficient use of radio spectrum, a natural resource, and advanced user 
services. 
The cognitive radio wireless network is intended as an advanced technology integration 
environment with focus on building adaptive, spectrum-efficient systems with emerging 
programmable radios. The emerging cognitive radio scenario is of current interest to both policy 
makers and technologists because of the potential for order-of-magnitude gains in spectral 
efficiency and network performance. NSF and industry funded R&D projects aimed at 
developing cognitive radio platforms are currently in progress and are expected to lead to 
equipment that can be used for GENI in the 2007-08 timeframe. Protocol research to be 
supported with the planned experimental system includes discovery and self-organization, cross- 
layer protocols for PHY adaptation, cooperation and competition mechanisms, spectrum 
etiquette procedures, and cognitive radio hardware/software performance optimization. 
Cognitive Radio Features 
The idea of a cognitive radio extends the concepts of a hardware radio and a software defined 
radio (SDR) from a simple, single function device to a radio that senses and reacts to its 
operating environment. A Cognitive Radio incorporates multiple sources of information, 
determines its current operating settings, and collaborates with other cognitive radios in a 
wireless network. The promise of cognitive radios is improved use of spectrum resources, 
reduced engineering and planning time, and adaptation to current operating conditions. Some 
features of cognitive radios include: 
Sensing the current radio frequency spectrum environment: This includes measuring which 
frequencies are being used, when are they used, estimating the location of transmitters and 
receivers, and determining signal modulation. Results from sensing the environment would be 
used to determine radio settings. 
Policy and configuration databases: Policies specifying how the radio can be operated and 
physical limitations of radio operation can be included in the radio or accessed over the network. 
Policies might specify which frequencies can be used in which locations. Configuration 
databases would describe the operating characteristics of the physical radio. These databases 
would normally be used to constrain the operation of the radio to stay within regulatory or 
physical limits. 
Self-configuration: Radios may be assembled from several modules. For example, a radio 
frequency front-end, a digital signal processor, and a control processor. Each module should be 
self-describing and the radio should automatically configure itself for operation from the 
available modules. Some might call this ``plug-and-play.'' 
 - 2 - 
Mission-oriented configuration: Software defined radios can meet a wide set of operational 
requirements. Configuring a SDR to meet a given set of mission requirements is called mission- 
oriented configuration. Typical mission requirements might include operation within buildings, 
substantial capacity, operation over long distances, and operation while moving at high speed. 
Mission-oriented configuration involves selecting a set of radio software modules from a library 
of modules and connecting them into an operational radio. 
Adaptive algorithms: During radio operation, the cognitive radio is sensing its environment, 
adhering to policy and configuration constraints, and negotiating with peers to best utilize the 
radio spectrum and meet user demands. 
Distributed collaboration: Cognitive radios will exchange current information on their local 
environment, user demand, and radio performance between themselves on a regular bases. 
Radios will use their local information and peer information to determine their operating settings.  
Security: Radios will join and leave wireless networks.  
Cognitive Radio Research Questions 
The capabilities outlined above for cognitive radios, and the questions they generate, are just 
forming in the wireless research community. In a truly integrated network, once one node is 
mobile, the entire network needs to deal with mobility. Routing is one of the first functions that 
must address mobility. Resource management under the constraints of mobile users is another 
open issue. A sample of research questions include: 
1. How does a richly connected mobile wireless network affect the architecture, design, and 
implementation of a global internet? How do local resource allocation algorithms, say the 
allocation of RF spectrum resources, interact with fixed infrastructure resource allocation? 
2. How does one reliably sense the radio spectrum environment? How does one detect weak 
signals with constrained processing capacity? How does one use measurements to set the 
operating parameters of the radio? How does one reliably exchange measurement 
information with peers? 
3. How does one express regulatory and operational policies? How are policies securely 
updated? What method does one use to interpret policies? How are policies affected by 
different market models, e.g. property based, unlicensed, or brokered? 
4. What language should be used to describe radio module capabilities? What radio interface 
should be presented to the application? How does one derive a common application interface 
from a specific module description? 
5. How does one quantify mission requirements? How does one describe the capabilities of 
radio software modules? What techniques effectively translate from mission requirements to 
a radio configuration? 
6. Given all the information available to a radio, how are operating settings derived? 
7. How do multiple radios collaborate? What information is exchanged and what protocols are 
used? How are setting changes coordinated across the wireless networks? 
8. How are each of these adaptive techniques secured against intruders? 
 - 3 - 
These early research questions call for a active and rigorous research program. Investigators 
should be encouraged to develop and analyze the necessary measurement and adaptive 
algorithms. The most promising algorithms should be tested and evaluated in numerous testbeds 
and field-based experiments and integrated with the larger fixed infrastructure. The interactions 
between CR networks through the fixed infrastructure and with the fixed infrastructure need to 
be investigated. 
Cognitive radios will operate in a dynamic radio environment. They will sense the environment, 
user demand, and radio performance and react to those measurements. Cognitive radios will 
exchange information with peers to use the radio spectrum efficiently, meet user demands, and 
achieve robust operation. 
Impact of Cognitive Radio Research on GENI 
Many of the research questions essential to building cognitive radio networks are, in some sense, 
extreme problems of wired networks. For example, both wired and wireless networks need to 
deal with links going up and down. However, in the wireless network, the frequency of link 
status changes is much higher than in today's wired network. So, wireless network architectures 
must pay closer attention to link status changes and react faster to these changes. This work 
would carry over into wired network.  
Some characteristics of cognitive radio networks that are applicable to the larger, end-to-end 
network are: 
1. Operating environment sensing -- Cognitive radios measure and react to the environment they are 
operating in. This environment is multi-dimensional; including cooperative and non-cooperative 
emitters turning on and off, CRs adapting to their local changes, and traffic loads; and rapidly 
varying. CRs must rapidly adapt to this changing environment and communicate their changing 
operation settings to other wireless devices in the network. The mechanisms and techniques to sense, 
adapt, and communicate operation state are necessary in CR networks and applicable to networks in 
general. 
2. Robust communications services with unreliable links -- The radio links, by their very nature, have 
intermittent outages. A link outage may result from the temporary location of the receiver, 
transmitter, and other objects in the environment. CRs, by their very design, must deal with these very 
short term link outages, and do so through a variety of techniques. It is through this large set of 
techniques and mechanisms that wireless networks implement a robust and reliable communications 
service with unreliable links. The techniques and design patterns used in wireless architectures are 
applicable to the larger network architecture. 
3. Operational state languages -- CRs, as they adapt, must communicate their observations and 
operation state to other CRs in the network. A few ``languages'' will be needed to describe 
observations and operation state. This information is likely to be much richer than common link status 
information. For example, one radio might send a list of all emitters it has recently sensed to other 
CRs in the network. The entry for each emitter might include a frequency range, time, and spatial 
location, and signal format (e.g. spread spectrum or narrow-band FM). The language used to describe 
observations and operation state will be much richer than conventional node or link state information. 
The language(s) and protocols necessary for CR networks should influence general network 
architectures. 
4. Distributed Resource Management -- The radio spectrum is a distributed resource. Use of the 
spectrum in one location affects the availability of that spectrum in other network locations. 
Allocation of the radio spectrum resource must be carried out in a cooperative manner and balanced 
between (quick) local decisions and (optimal) global allocation. The algorithms developed to allocate 
the distributed radio spectrum and mobile network resources based on traffic loads and operating 
environment are applicable to the GENI infrastructure -- and will require demanding new services 
within the GENI network. 
These examples show how techniques and mechanisms necessary to CR networks will have an 
influence on the architecture, design, and implementations of networks in general.

	Abstract = {OSCR, a framework for the implementation of a cognitive 
radio, is designed to facilitate the integration of a cognitive 
engine with one or more existing Software Communications 
Architecture (SCA) based radios. It consists of two 
components: a multiplexer, which acts as the cognitive 
engine's point of control for each individual radio within the 
system, and an SCA resource within each radio, which 
translates between the radio's native control API and the 
OSCR API. OSCR is designed to integrate multiple radios, 
which may all have differing capabilities, under a single 
cognitive engine. To demonstrate the usefulness of OSCR, 
used it to construct a cognitive radio composed of a basic 
SCA-compliant software radio and a cognitive engine 
designed to maximize channel capacity by monitoring 
channel statistics and varying radio parameters.

	Title = {Kinetic mobility management applied to vehicular ad hoc network protocols},
	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a particular category of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) characterized by a high mobility and a reduced connectivity. In order to develop protocols for vehicular networks, the community may either create VANET specific approaches, or adapt already existing protocols to VANET. While the former may provide efficient specialized solutions, the latter offers an increased interoperability and universality, which is a key issue for industrial partners involved in the deployment of VANET and Intelligent Transportation Technologies (ITS). An important aspect in the porting of ad hoc networks solutions to VANET and ITS is an efficient management of vehicular mobility. Mobility Management is a principle aimed at updating network routes or structures in order to keep them coherent with mobile topologies. Mobility management may be proactive or reactive, depending if the updates are triggered with or without topology changes, or if and only if a change in the topology effectively requires to update the structure. Failure to develop efficient mobility management heuristics leads to a waste of network resources and suboptimal routes or structures. The optimal solution is obviously the reactive mobility management, as updates are optimally triggered only when necessary. However, due to its complexity, the reactive mobility management has not attracted as much attention as its proactive counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a location-aware framework, called Kinetic Graphs, that may be followed by ad hoc protocols in order to implement a reactive mobility management. The Kinetic Graph framework is able to capture the dynamics of mobile structures, and is composed of four steps: (i) a representation of the trajectories, (ii) a common message format for the posting of those trajectories, (iii) a time varying weight for building the kinetic structures, (iv) an aperiodic neighborhood maintenance. We eventually provide a example of a successful application of this framework to broadcasting and routing in VANET.},

	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have been recently attracting an increasing attention from both research and industry communities. One of the challenges posed by the study of VANETs is the definition of a generic mobility model providing an accurate, realistic vehicular mobility description at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Today, most mobility models for vehicular studies only consider a limited macro-mobility, involving restricted vehicles movements, while little or no attention is paid to micro-mobility and its interaction with the macro-mobility counterpart. On the other hand, the research community cannot have access to realistic traffic generator which have not been designed to collaborate with network simulators. In this paper, we first introduce a classification of existing methods for the generation of vehicular mobility models, then we describe the various approaches used by the community for realistic VANET simulations. Finally, we provide an overview and comparison of a large range of mobility models proposed for vehicular ad hoc networks.},
