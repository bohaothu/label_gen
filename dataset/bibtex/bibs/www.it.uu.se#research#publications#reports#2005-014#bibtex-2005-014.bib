  abstract	= {We present Daigan, a tool for constructing distributed
		  proxy networks using the SelNet indirection layer. Using
		  the indirection capabilities of SelNet, we can construct
		  on-demand chains of proxies for adapting content for mobile
		  devices. Daigan takes a specification of a device's
		  capabilities and from that identifies which proxies are
		  needed to meet these requirements. Based on this
		  specification Daigan sets up a chain of proxies and
		  transparently redirects an application's traffic to the
		  proxy chain. We demonstrate Daigan's abilities through a
		  scenario which performs the instantiation of a proxy chain
		  consisting of a proxy cache, an image transcoder/compressor
		  and a TCP header compression proxy. We describe this
		  scenario in detail and report on implementation progress.}
