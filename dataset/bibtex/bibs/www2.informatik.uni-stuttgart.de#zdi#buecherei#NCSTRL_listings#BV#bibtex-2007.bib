   abstract = {Network-centricity and autonomy are two buzzwords that have found increasing
      attention since the beginning of this decade in both, the military and civil
      domain. Although various conceptions exist of which capabilities are required
      for a system to be considered network-centric or autonomous, there can hardly
      be found proposals or prototypes that describe concrete transformations for
      both capabilities into software. The presented paper reviews work accomplished
      at EADS Military Air Systems driven by the need to develop an infrastructure
      that supports the realisation of both concepts in software with respect to
      traditional and modern software engineering principles, e.g., re-use and
      service-oriented development. This infrastructure is provided in form of a
      prototypical framework, accompanied by configuration and monitoring tools.
      Tests in a complex scenario requiring network-centricity and autonomy have
      shown that a significant technical readiness level can be reached by using the
      framework for mission software development.},

   abstract = {In this work we consider two families of piecewise-linear maps with a
      discontinuity, which is motivated by modeling of several power electronic
      circuits (DC/DC converters, Sigma-Delta modulators) and which is already
      investigated by many authors. However, the focus of these works lie on the
      investigation of the dynamics by variation of one or at most two system
      parameters. In many of these publications a great variety of bifurcation
      phenomena is revealed but unfortunately, a profound explanation of the
      complicated and often self-similar bifurcation structures and the systematics
      behind is missing. In contrast to that, we investigate the full 3D parameter
      space of these families of systems and detect a number of discontinuity induced
      codimension-3 bifurcations. Some of them belong to an already known generic
      type [1,2], while others represent some new types not investigated so far.
      Unfolding these bifurcations we are able to explain the systematics for a large
      number of the above mentioned bifurcation phenomena. In particular, several
      bifurcation scenarios observed under variation of one or two parameters
      represent an intersection of the extended bifurcation structures induced by
      codimension-3 bifurcation with the corresponding 1D or 2D parameter subspace.
      The codimension-3 bifurcations reported here are characterized by two manifolds
      in the 3D parameter space, a 1D and a 2D one. The 1D manifold represents a
      codimension-2 bifurcation curve, whereas in the 2D manifold an infinite number
      of codimension-2 bifurcation curves are located. At the codimension-3
      bifurcation point all these curves intersect. The reported bifurcations serve
      as organizing centers of periodic and aperiodic dynamics in the overall
      parameter space. [1] V. Avrutin and M. Schanz, Nonlinearity 19, 531 (2006). [2]

   abstract = {An aperiodic and especially a chaotic attractor may consist of some number K $>$=
      1 of bands (also denoted as connected components). Multi-band chaotic
      attractors (MBCAs) defined by the bandcount K $>$ 1, represent a well-known
      phenomenon on the field of nonlinear dynamics and are often involved in several
      bifurcations. It is for instance well-known, that the period doubling cascade
      is typically followed by an inverse band merging cascade, which represents a
      sequence of MBCAs with p0 2^n bands, whereby n decreases from infinity to zero.
      We report a novel bifurcation scenario (bandcount adding scenario), which
      involves an infinite number of MBCAs organized not sequentially, but according
      to an infinite adding scheme. This adding scheme which is similar to the
      well-known Farey-trees, implies that between two MBCAs with bandcounts K1 and
      K2 there is an MBCA with K1 + K2 - K0 bands (with some constant offset K0).
      This scenario continues ad infinitum and resembles the period adding scenario
      known from many applications, but in contrast to this is formed by chaotic and
      not by periodic attractors. We study this scenario using a discontinuous map,
      which is actually considered by many authors as some kind of normal form of the
      discrete-time representation of many non-smooth systems of practical interest
      in the neighborhood of the point of discontinuity. By investigation of the
      structure of the 2D parameter space, we find out, that the bandcount adding
      scenario is related with discontinuityinduced codimension-1 bifurcations of
      unstable periodic orbits and with some specific discontinuity-induced
      codimension-2 bifurcations. Consequently, we describe the self-similarity of
      the chaotic area in parameter space and show, that in this area there are much
      more non-robust chaotic attractors than typically assumed.},
