 abstract =     {In dense traffic areas, wireless local area networks (WLANs) suffer from interference problems due to  congestion of the open and unlicensed ISM band. To mitigate these problems, a terminal-embedded beamforming framework is proposed --- this beamforming is capable of focusing the transmission and the reception in the direction of the relevant access point. At the same time the framework is backward compatible with existing WLAN networks. The beamforming enabled terminal benefits in terms of capacity, security, and energy efficiency while not requiring any changes on the network side costing network providers new investments. The beamforming solution is seen as an attractive value-added feature as well as low cost solution for the future WLAN terminal design. This opens the door for mobile device manufacturers to include the proposed solution into their product line. In this work, the backwards compatibility challenges are addressed and some possible solutions and the limitations are discussed. Also shown is a prototype design built on a laptop computer. The experimental results show a significant capacity increase in both an interference free scenario and an interference limited scenario.}

  year =     2007,
  abstract =     {In dense traffic areas, wireless local area networks (WLANs) suffer from interference problems due to the usage of the crowded unlicensed ISM band and the lack of available spectrum. To mitigate these problems, a terminal side beamforming framework is proposed --- this beamforming is capable of focusing the transmission and the reception in the relevant direction of the access point to exploit the directivity of the indoor propagation channel. It provides network transparency to achieve the backward compatibility to the existing WLAN networks, and vendor transparency to ease the system design process and thereby achieve low complexity and costs. The beamforming enabled terminal benefits in terms of capacity, power efficiency and security while it does not require any change on the network side costing network providers new investments. It will be an attractive value-added feature as well as low cost solution for the future WLAN terminal design opening the door for WLAN terminal manufacturers to include the proposed solution into their product line. In this work, a WLAN terminal beamforming demonstrator has been developed to demonstrate the capacity enhancement in real environments. Signal to interference ratio (SIR) improvement as well as array gain were investigated by simulations with IEEE 802.11n cluster channel models and by experiments with the demonstrator in a typical office environment. The comparable results of simulations and experiments show significant array gain and SIR improvement. The significant capacity increase has been demonstrated in the experiments in both an interference free scenario and an interference limited scenario. }

  abstract =     {Interworking between wireless local area networks (WLANs) and cellular networks (such as 2G and 3G) is expected to break new ground for sophisticated business models. Omnipresent cellular networks have a well-defined infrastructure, but lack capability to provide broadband and/or real-time services (e.g., streaming video and gaming). Conversely, WLANs supports high data rates, while the infrastructure for service provision is vague. Therefore, the combination of the cellular core network infrastructure with its service centers and accounting capabilities with the achievable data rate of WLANs can provide the possibility of offering new services to the customer. This interworking is being considered in different standardization and operational activities. WLAN hotspots are already on the way, but the high installation costs of WLANs, especially for larger hotspots, is repressing a faster evolution. The installation costs are mainly driven by the cabling infrastructure. To reduce these costs and to gain flexibility, we advocate exploiting multihop capability for WLAN coverage extension by introducing the concept of virtual access points. However, the high data rates of WLAN solutions are hindered by the standard IEEE8O2. 11 MAC protocol, which has been shown to be inappropriate for multihop operation. In this article we consider an improved version of the IEEE8O2. 11 MAC that involves only minor changes to the existing standard, which allows for a faster deployment and the usability of the approach in existing interworking scenarios. The specific contribution of this article is a thorough exploration, by means of simulation, of the performance of such an approach. In particular, we demonstrate that the enhanced MAC is capable of offering high data rates in multihop WLAN extensions to the cellular network. Besides the networking structure, a pertinent issue in the WLAN cellular symbiosis is security. In this respect we discuss multihop operation in light of current interworking (security) activities.}

  month =    oct,
  abstract = {The wireless connectivity, essential for pervasive
computing, has ephemeral character and can be used for creating ad hoc
networks, sensor networks, connection with RFID tags etc. The
communication tasks in such wireless networks often involve an inquiry
over a shared channel, which can be invoked for: discovery of
neighboring devices in ad hoc networks, counting the number of active
sensors in sensor networks, estimating the mean value contained in a
group of sensors etc. Such inquiry solicits replies from possibly
large number of terminals n. This necessitates the usage of algorithms
for resolving batch conflicts with unknown conflict multiplicity n. In
this paper we present a novel approach to the batch conflict
resolution. We show how the conventional tree algorithms for conflict
resolution can be used to obtain progressively accurate estimation of
the multiplicity. We use the estimation to propose a more efficient
binary tree algorithm, termed Estimating Binary Tree (EBT)
algorithm. We extend the approach to design the Interval Estimation
Conflict Resolution (IECR) algorithm. For n ! 1 we prove that the
efficiency achieved by IECR for batch arrivals is identical with the
efficiency that Gallagers FCFS algorithm achieves for Poisson packet
arrivals. For finite n, the simulation results show that IECR is, to
the best of our knowledge, the most efficient batch resolution
algorithm reported to date.}

the large protocol header overhead when transmitting voice and other
continuous media over IP based protocol stacks in wireless
networks. In this paper we evaluate the real-time transmission of GSM
encoded voice and H.26L encoded video with ROHC over a wireless
link. For the voice transmission we examine the impact of ROHC on the
consumed bandwidth, the voice quality, and the delay jitter in the
voice signal. We find that for a wide range of error probabilities on
the wireless link, ROHC roughly cuts the bandwidth required for the
transmission of GSM encoded voice in half. In addition, ROHC improves
the voice quality compared to transmissions without ROHC, especially
for large bit error probabilities on the wireless link. The
improvement reaches 0.26 on the 5-point Mean Opinion Score for a bit
error probability of 10 percent. For the video transmission we examine
the impact of ROHC on the consumed bandwidth. We find that the
bandwidth savings with ROHC depend on the quantization scale used for
the video encoding and the video content and ranges between 5 percent
for typical scenarios.},

Furthermore it has the capability to support heterogeneous terminals

twelve well known video sequences, in different video formats, we
generate the frame size traces and evaluate the multiple description

objective quality measurement at the application layer, we investigate
the video quality in dependency of lost and error-prone

their network models directly into video quality values.  This step
makes the work unique as single layer coded video streams would always
need further postprocessing to retrieve the video quality.}

multicast video streaming in UMTS networks where a video
content has to be conveyed to multiple users in the same cell.
Efficient multicast data delivery in UMTS is still an open issue.
In particular, suitable solutions have to be found to cope with
wireless channel errors, while maintaining both an acceptable
channel utilization and a controlled delivery delay over the
wireless link between the serving base station and the mobile
terminals. Here, we first highlight that standard solutions such as
unequal error protection (UEP) of the video flow are ineffective in
the UMTS systems due to its inherent large feedback delay at the
link layer (Radio Link Control, RLC). Subsequently, we propose
a local approach to solve errors directly at the UMTS link layer
while keeping a reasonably high channel efficiency and saving, as
much as possible, system resources. The solution that we propose
in this paper is based on the usage of the common channel
to serve all the interested users in a cell. In this way, we can
save resources with respect to the case where multiple dedicated
channels are allocated for every user. In addition to that, we
present a hybrid ARQ (HARQ) proactive protocol that, at the
cost of some redundancy (added to the link layer flow), is able
to consistently improve the channel efficiency with respect to the
plain ARQ case, by therefore making the use of a single common
channel for multicast data delivery feasible. In the last part of the
paper we give some hints for future research, by envisioning the
usage of the aforementioned error control protocols with suitably
encoded video streams.}

widespread use of UDP, however, has a number of drawbacks, such as
unfairness and possible congestion collapse, which are avoided by
TCP. In this paper we investigate the use of TCP as the transport
layer protocol for streaming video in a multi-code CDMA cellular
wireless system. Our approach is to stabilize the TCP throughput over
the wireless links by employing a recently developed simultaneous MAC
packet transmission (SMPT) approach at the link layer. We study the
capacity, i.e. the number of customers per cell, and the quality of
service for streaming video in the uplink direction. Our extensive
simulations indicate that streaming over TCP in conjunction with SMPT
gives good performance for video encoded in a closed loop, i.e. with
rate control. We have also found that TCP is unsuitable (even in
conjunction with SMPT) for streaming the more variable open-loop

                  supported in a cell/cluster. We develop an
                  analytical framework for the class of SMPT
                  mechanisms and analyze the link-layer buffer
                  occupancy and the code usage in a wireless system
                  running some form of SMPT. Our analysis quantifies
                  the tradeoff between increased link-layer quality of
                  service and reduced number of supported flows in
                  SMPT with good accuracy, as verified by
                  simulations. In a typical scenario, SMPT reduces the
                  probability of link-layer buffer overflow by over
                  two orders of magnitude (thus enabling high-quality
                  multimedia services, such as real-time video
                  streaming) while supporting roughly 20 percent
                  fewer flows than conventional ARQ. Our analytical
                  framework provides a basis for resource management
                  in wireless systems running some form of SMPT and
                  optimizing SMPT mechanisms.}  }

                  times, not only for pure ad hoc communication
                  networks but also as a viable solution for coverage
                  extension in wireless networks. Especially for
                  upcoming WLAN hotspots this is an interesting option
                  to decrease installation costs. In this paper we
                  introduce a new MAC protocol that needs only
                  marginal changes to the standard and enables
                  efficient multi-hop networking. We advocate the use
                  of multiple IEEE802.11 channels, where one channel
                  is reserved as a common signaling channel for the
                  task of assigning the others data channels among
                  wireless terminals. The proposed MAC protocol is
                  based on a four way handshake over the common
                  signaling channel, while data transmission occurs on
                  a dedicated channel. We propose a further
                  optimization applying multiple wireless network
                  interface cards. This improvement in performance
                  comes at the price of a slightly more complex
                  hardware. Two different simulation models are
                  implemented to investigate our approach. The first
                  model investigates the MAC protocol and its
                  improvements while the second model analyzes the
                  multi-hop performance in terms of delivery ratio and
                  transmission delay. By means of numerous simulations
                  we present the performance of our MAC approach in
                  comparison with two standard approaches in terms of
                  bandwidth, packet delivery, and transmission
                  delay. For our performance evaluation we apply the
                  IEEE802.11a technology, but we note that our
                  approach can also be used for IEEE802.11b.}

                  quality between two or three YUV video sequences and
                  includes also a player for YUV video streams. In a

                  the quality assessment of videos that have been
                  encoded with some lossy compression scheme and
                  transported over a lossy network. The tool can be
                  used to simultaneously play (1) the original YUV
                  video sequence, (2) the encoded (and subsequently
                  decoded) video sequence, and (3) the video sequence
                  obtained after encoding, network transport, and

                  after encoding and network transport. The VideoMeter
                  also displays the difference pictures for the Y
                  (luminance) component to visualize the errors. The

                  provided. VideoMeter takes YUV video in the 4:2:0
                  format as input. Both the CIF (352x288 pixels) and
                  the QCIF (176x144 pixels) video frame format are
                  supported. Synchronization in the case of frame
                  drops (either in a rate-adaptive encoder or in the
                  network) is achieved by supplying the VideoMeter
                  with a freeze file. This file gives the frames that
                  are to be held for comparison since the following
                  frame(s) have been dropped. The VideoMeter has been

                  RedHat 7.3) and requires an X11 terminal with 16,
                  24, or 32 bit display depth.}

                  approach at the data link layer (in conjunction with
                  UDP at the transport layer). We consider the
                  real-time transmission of both video encoded in an
                  open loop (i.e., without rate control) and video
                  encoded in a closed loop (i.e., with rate
                  control). We conduct extensive simulations and study
                  quantitatively the trade-off between video quality,
                  transmission delay (and jitter), and number of
                  supported video streams (capacity). We find that the

                  significantly higher video quality and smaller
                  delays than the conventional sequential transmission
                  approach, while ensuring high capacity. In typical
                  scenarios, with SMPT the probability of in-time
                  video frame delivery is more than twice as large as
                  with sequential transmission (for given delay
                  bounds). Our results provide guidelines for the
