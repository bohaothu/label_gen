@inproceedings{moeller2010lod_usage_analysis,
	Abstract = {Although the cloud of Linked Open Data has been growing continuously for several years, little is known about the particular features of linked data usage. Motivating why it is important to understand the usage of Linked Data, we describe typical linked data usage scenarios and contrast the so derived requirement with conventional server access analysis. Then, we report on usage patterns found through an in-depth analysis of access logs of four popular LOD datasets. Eventually, based on the usage patterns we found in the analysis, we propose metrics for assessing Linked Data usage from the human and the machine perspective, taking into account different agent types and resource representations.},

for visual scripting with RDF data. Based on the idea of the semantic 
desktop, non-technical users can create, manipulate and mash-up RDF

which are aimed to simplify their everyday work by automating repetitive 
tasks. The platform allows to combine data from both web and desktop

	Abstract = {The FAST environment [1] allows users to graphically compose intelligent, i.e. semantically annotated gadgets from predefined building blocks and deploy them on various mashup platforms, thus enabling the interconnection of different systems and services. Since different parties involved in the creation of gadgets and building blocks conceptualise knowledge in different ontologies, using ontology matching as a means to reconcile differences in the various conceptualisations is a crucial issue. This paper discusses first steps in our effort to integrate ontology matching in an end-user-oriented environment such as FAST, using an e-commerce-related scenario. We evaluate a number of tools and approaches for solving different levels of complexity in ontology matching and define the direction of integrating ontology matching into the FAST environment.},

In this paper, we present the architecture of the FAST platform which allows creating enterprise-class and multi-channel visual building blocks (so called gadgets) in an ad-hoc manner. The design of complex enterprise-class gadgets is supported by an integrated semantic concept which hides the complexity from the actual users. The architectural components of the platform, a technical life cycle model for enterprise mashups, and the FAST gadget ontology are presented. By means of a cross-organizational real-world scenario from the marketing/ promotion event area, we demonstrate the value and potential of the FAST platform.},

@article{moeller2009ontology_soft_skills,
	Abstract = {In this paper we argue for the importance of soft ontology factors, or ``ontology soft skills'' as an important aspect for the quality of an ontology. Ontology soft skills are those features of an ontology which relate less to technical and structural issues, but rather to how well an ontology manages to attract new users and implementers and how well it manages to achieve adoption and uptake. We present a set of five guidelines for good ontology soft skills and illustrate them with concrete examples from the Semantic Web Conference Ontology (SWC). We argue that greater adoption and uptake mean greater sharedness, and therefore ultimately a more ``beautiful'' ontology.},

@inproceedings{moeller2004corpus,
	Abstract = {When faced with the task of incorporating legacy web data from existing HTML pages into the Semantic Web (SW), a widespread approach is to use Information Extraction (IE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. Natural language texts are annotated automatically or semi-automatically, and thus formal data is extracted from the texts. While this allows to add new sets of data to the SW, the process cannot stop there. It is necessary to integrate the newly created formal data with existing formal data, i.e. to identify entities which are identical in both sets. To summarize, two main problems have to be tackled to allow the integration of information from unstructured data into the SW: 1. Find the set of entities E in a document (NER), and probably detect coreference chains within the document. 2. Find matches between the elements of E and entities in a pre-existing knowledge base. In order to evaluate any system trying to tackle both of these problems (e.g. KIM or Semtag and Seeker), conventional corpora are not suitable, since these are mostly tailord towards IE and NER only. These corpora can be used to evaluate a system's performance on an inner-document basis, i.e. how well it can detect entities in a document and probably chains of co-reference between them. However, what is needed is a means of evaluating a system with respect to how well it is able to match between the entities in a document and corresponding entities in a database. This problem falls into the area of Object Consolidation. We therefore propose a novel kind of corpus, which we will call an Integrated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition and Object Consolidation. The first incentive for proposing such a corpus came when we were looking for a way to evaluate the Geco project. },

In this paper, we propose that the recent phenomenon of blogging, combined with a tool to easily generate SWdata from existing formal desktop data, can result in a form of semantic blogging which would help to overcome the aforementioned problem and make the SW vision a reality. We discuss how semantic metadata could be represented in a blog, and present a prototype of the semiBlog editor, which was created with the purpose of semantic blogging in mind. We argue that such a semantic blog editor should integrate tightly with a user's desktop environment, as this would make integration of existing data into the blog as easy as possible and would also increase the motivation to add to the Semantic Web.},

from the addition of semantic metadata. The result --- which we will call 
Semantic Blogging --- provides improved capabilities with respect to search, 
connectivity and browsing compared to current blogging technology. More- 
over, Semantic Blogging will allow new ways of convenient data exchange 
between the actors within the blogosphere --- blog authors and blog users 
alike. This paper identifies structural and content-related metadata as the 
kinds of semantic metadata which are relevant in the domain of blogging. 
We present in detail the nature of these two kinds of metadata, and discuss 
ways of creating such metadata in a convenient and non-obstrusive way for 
the user, how to publish such metadata on the web, and how to best make 
use of such metadata from the point of view of a blog consumer.},
