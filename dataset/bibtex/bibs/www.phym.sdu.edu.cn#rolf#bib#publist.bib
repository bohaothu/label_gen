  have been studied extensively in behavioral 2-AFC - experiments
  employing the playback of artificial echoes to the animals'
  echolocation pulses. Such procedures are thought to generate the
  impression of phantom targets located at different distances. These
  tests made use of two paradigms: range difference (RD), the
  discrimination between different echo delays, and jitter versus
  non-jitter (JNJ), the detection of a regularly alternating,
  'jittering' delay against a reference of constant delay values. The
  perceptional equivalence of these paradigms hypothesized by some
  workers has been doubted by others and a third paradigm,
  jitter-versus-jitter (JJ), which would require the discrimination of
  different jitter amplitudes, has been proposed for the purpose of
  clarifying this unresolved issue. In order to obtain a first glimpse
  of the psychophysical properties of the stimuli delivered in the
  ranging experiments, passive listening tasks with sequences of
  repeated artificial 'pulse-echo-pairs' where designed for human
  subjects according to all three mentioned rules and thresholds were
  measured in an adaptive 3-AFC procedure. It could be demonstrated,
  that the subjects' performance depended on a variety of stimulus
  parameters (e.g., repetition rate, reference value of the
  pulse-echo-delay and the characteristics of the individual
  pulses). The nature of these relationships depended on the tested
  paradigm, hinting at possible differences in the involved
  mechanisms. Each paradigm seems to constitute an individual
  perceptual task, with a somewhat closer relationship existing
  between JNJ and JJ. The JNJ-performance depended on the
  pulse-echo-delay of the reference stimulus, which weakens the view
  that a grossly similar effect found in bats can be regarded as proof
  for a specific internal representation of the stimuli along a range
  axis in these animals. In several experiments qualitative,
  individual differences among the subjects surfaced, which might be
  interpreted as a hint towards the existence of individual
  strategies. This would imply, that the solution of these tasks
  allows for different approaches. In the tasks studied here, several
  evidences from the performance as well as from it's subjective
  corollaries seem to point to the involvement of higher cognitive
  functions, such as pattern recognition and stream segregation, which
  have not been considered in the study of ranging so far. The
  subjects of this study were carrying out passive hearing tasks,
  whereas ranging bats are making use of an active sensory
  system. Furthermore, modifications to the stimuli were necessary for
  adapting to the requirements of the human subjects. Therefore, no
  attempt is made to purport that problems associated with experiments
  in bats have been solved by means of our experiments once for
  all. Rather, we regard our results as hypotheses, which we consider
  worth for further testing with bats.",

  echolocation information. The most likely candidate for the
  underlying perceptual process would in general be a combination of
  ranging by means of time-of-flight measurements and binaural
  direction-of-arrival determination. In looking for alternative
  solutions to this problem, we choose the group of so-called CF-bats
  (CF = constant frequency) as a model system. These species can be
  observed to travel at high flight speeds (3-7 m/s) through obstacle
  rich forest habitats, maintaining an approximately constant height
  above ground. This situation may thus be thought of as a 2-D
  obstacle avoidance task. The signal design of the animals'
  echolocation pulses (narrow-band, hence the name, and comparatively
  long duration) does not lend itself easily as a substrate for range
  and angle estimation in the manner depicted above. The presence of
  multiple targets might be aggravating this difficulty by causing a
  resolution and a correspondence problem among the individual echoes
  received at each ear. We therefore explored the informational
  content of the proportional changes in center frequency (due to
  Doppler shifts) and amplitude (due to geometric attenuation,
  absorption and compound directivity of emitter and receiver) of the
  echoes in a rough, abstract-functional analogy to the
  time-to-contact variable of the optic flow field. It can be shown,
  that a combination of these two putative sensory variables allows in
  principal for a metrical reconstruction of the target position
  relative to the animals flight vector within a hemifield. It needs
  to be stated for the sake of honesty, that proportional frequency
  and amplitude changes by no means constitute an optimal foundation
  for a geometrical reconstruction of obstacle position: The cosine
  mapping angle to Doppler shift has minimal slope straight ahead,
  thus adversely affecting the precision of position estimation, where
  obstacle avoidance presumably requires most of it. Furthermore,
  depending on the assumed compound directivity function of receiver
  and emitter, positional ambiguities might be introduced. It should
  be noted, however, that optimality is not a necessary precondition
  of physiological plausibility and the error in positional judgment
  associated with a given precision of estimating the sensory
  variables' magnitude can be found to decrease as a function of
  distance to target, thereby accommodating the task's demands. Along
  the same line of thought, it may be argued, that the ambiguities
  eventually introduced by the directivity are confined to single
  positional estimates and could be pruned by looking at successive
  measurements. We arrived at the tentative conjecture, that an
  adequate obstacle avoidance maneuver, as observed in the animals,
  based on echolocation is most likely to require a measure for the
  situation's gravity (i.e. distance of obstacle to flight path) as
  well as urgency (i.e. distance to obstacle along flight path). The
  need for the latter may be attributed to the fact, that target
  strength could differ considerably among obstacles, thus affecting
  the extent of the echolocation system's field of view. Having
  demonstrated, that a metrical reconstruction is principally feasible
  (albeit not necessarily performed by the animals), we have good
  reason to believe, that both demands can be met by evaluation of our
  postulated sensory variables.},

  been investigated already as a potential substrate for spatial
  judgments based on auditory cues in humans as well as in bats. Among
  the parameters discussed in this context are the derivatives of
  signal amplitude and (Doppler-) frequency with respect to time.  The
  design of the pulses emitted by cf-bats offers a certain coding
  potential for these signal attributes by virtue of prolonged
  narrow-band portions. Additionally, the magnitude of these variables
  is augmented by the fact, that in an echolocation situation both -
  emitter and receiver - are moving.It was demonstrated that observing
  the ratios formed by the derivatives of signal envelope and carrier
  frequencies with the magnitude of these variables (i.e. the
  ``proportional changes'') for narrow-band echoes reflected of a
  single idealized reflector allows in principle for a reconstruction
  of target position with respect to the bat. Hence, it was speculated
  that these cues might subserve obstacle avoidance in cf-bats. Unlike
  prey capture in midair, obstacle avoidance is immanently prone to
  constitute a multiple-target problem, where a spatial location
  estimate has to be attached to more than one echo at a time. Albeit
  the derivatives of carrier frequency and envelope amplitude might at
  first glance appear as local features in the time-frequency plane,

  echo is analyzed and an overlap of signal energies in the

  information subserving collision avoidance. Yet, their predominantly
  narrow-band signal design appears to be poorly suited for conveying
  many of the conventional localization cues. A set of alternative
  cues might be available by monitoring changes in echo parameters
  over time.  Taking into account a lack of apriori knowledge about a
  target's scattering coefficient, a restricted field of view and a
  decision basis consisting of small number of echoes, it is
  conjectured that coordinated obstacle avoidance requires obtaining
  information equivalent to complete knowledge of target position
  (Even if this would turn out not to constitute a necessary
  condition, it would in any case be a sufficient one).  Since
  obstacle avoidance is immanently prone to constitute a multi-target
  task, information bearing parameters must be accessible in the
  presence of other signals.  Relationships between reflector location
  and signal parameters were established; echoes based on these were
  calculated and passed through a gammatone filter bank, the
  parameters of which were fitted to physiological data. Additive
  white gaussian noise was added and then tackled with using a leaky
  integrator lowpass. Parameter extraction in the presence of multiple
  targets was attempted by augmenting this processing cascade with
  lowpass filters designed to work on envelope detected filter
  outputs.It was demonstrated that in an idealized setting consisting
  of a single point scatterer, target location in a plane may be
  obtained from the proportional changes in echo amplitude (due to
  time varying values of the various sources of attenuation) and
  carrier frequency (time varying Doppler). This procedure is
  plausible in a biological signal processing context and may be
  endowed with sufficient robustness against additive white gaussian
  noise.  One of the most fundamental of the nonlinearities pertinent
  to the transform linking the acoustic waveform with the auditory
  system's primal sketch arises from the process of envelope
  formation. A time-frequency representation derived from
  envelope-detected bandpass outputs is susceptible to the occurrence
  of interference phenomena, for which filter magnitude transfer
  functions wide enough to integrate energy from more than one of the
  superimposed signals are sufficient. This hampers the evaluation of
  derivatives. The properties of envelope formation, however, seem to
  open a window in amplitude ratios of the interfering components
  within which separation of components by a modulation filter bank
  might still be feasible.Usage of proportional changes in amplitude
  and carrier frequency is a viable hypothesis for the single
  reflector case. In presence of more than one signal, occurrence of
  interference phenomena impose resolution limits. Whether these are
  permissive of obstacle avoidance remains to be established.}

abstract = {Biosonar is often touted as a model system for sensory signal
  processing by the brain, mainly because of the easy access to the
  sonar pulses and the low dimensionality of these signals. However,
  the information content of the echoes is generated in the
  interaction of the sonar pulse with a target. In most cases, the
  resulting relationship between signals and target geometry is not
  obvious. This is particularly true for the extended targets which
  bats encounter in behavioral tasks such as navigation or judgment of
  habitat quality. For these targets, which are typically composed of
  many reflecting facets, the acoustic inverse problem is heavily
  underdetermined. This implies that echo waveforms for different
  positions and orientations of emitter and receivers are
  unpredictable beyond extremely short correlation distances. This
  lack of predictability necessitates treating the echoes as
  realizations of random processes. At the same time these random
  processes are in general non-stationary in space.  This can for
  instance be due to a preferred direction of the surface normals of
  the reflecting facets making up an object.
  
  Knowing the properties of the echo-generating process is a
  precondition for understanding the sensory tasks bats can perform on
  signals from these targets. In particular, it can be investigated,
  how the random stimulus ensembles can be partitioned in order to
  allow for target classification and how adaptive mobility can follow
  slowly varying spatial gradients to arrive at advantageous views.
  
  Here a synthetic observer for studying these issues is introduced.
  This system meets all requirements as to mobility, reach,
  acceleration as well as repeatability and precision. This is
  achieved by mounting a sonarhead (an array of a sonar emitter and
  two receivers) on a humanoid, industrial robot arm. The system
  matches bats in its mobility; the whole sonar head can be moved with
  6 degrees of freedom, in addition both receivers can be rotated
  individually in azimuth and elevation.  It combines this with
  sufficient reach to view extended objects from different sides. For
  this purpose the \unit[71]{cm}-reach of the arm itself is
  supplemented with the capability to move the entire arm on a
  \unit[2]{m}-linear track. It can be expected that a thorough
  characterization of the echo-generating process for a typical target
  requires roughly $10^5$ echoes. In order to reduce the cycle-time
  for acquiring these echoes, the sonarhead must be moved quickly
  between positions and then be brought to a complete halt at each of
  them (if measurements without Doppler-shift are intended).  This
  requires swift acceleration and deceleration (the robot arm achieves
  between $879$ and $\unit[1098]{deg/sec^2}$, depending on the joint).
  Repeatability and precision are crucial for aligning all
  measurements made on one target into a single frame of reference. If
  necessary, the robot arm can be positioned with a repeatability of
  $\pm\unit[0.05]{mm}$. In order to allow for interactive
  experimentation with the synthetic observer, a fast software
  implementation of an auditory model (all-pole gammatone filterbank)
  has been written. The model interfaces directly with data
  acquisition allowing signals to be visualized immediately. At the
  same time echo data can be stored along with the position of the
  sonarhead and other experimental parameters in a relational
  database.}

  abstract = {Echolocating bats achieve a surprising amount of
                  autonomy primarily based on sonar sensing. In order
                  to use insights from biosonar function to improve
                  technical designs, it is necessary to understand the
                  biosonar tasks (e.g., obstacle avoidance, prey
                  capture, navigation), which provide the context for
                  this function. To facilitate the study of these
                  tasks, a system was designed, which combines the
                  following aspects: It allows for interaction with
                  the real world and mobility by mounting a sonarhead
                  with 6 rotational degrees of freedom on a mobile
                  platform. At the same time the system is capable of
                  displaying the output of a parsimonious auditory
                  model at an appropriate update-rate. This allows for
                  interactive exploration of the echoes associated
                  with a particular echolocation scenario. The use of
                  the system in exploring biosonar tasks is
                  demonstrated by several examples, namely continuous
                  estimation of Doppler shifts as part of an acoustic
                  flow analysis, two-target resolution with
                  fm-signals, acoustic glints and foliage echoes as an
                  example of extended natural targets made up of many
                  reflecting facets. In all cases several important
                  insights into the nature of the respective biosonar
                  problem can by obtained readily by experimenting
                  with the system interactively.}

  acoustic and neural domain renders the biosonar system of bats a
  prime example of intelligent, integrated systems in
  biology. Previous attempts at technical reproductions of this system
  have studied a few functional aspects but did not produce convincing
  replicas of the integrated system. In particular, none of them could
  provide for beamforming pinnae, ear mobility, signal bandwidth and
  an adequate number of primary elements in the signal representation
  at the scale of the biological paragon. The CIRCE
  (Chiroptera-Inspired Robotic Cephaloid) project brings together an
  interdisciplinary consortium with all competences necessary for
  addressing these aspects in conjunction. Well-integrated solutions
  to the following technological key challenges are sought: a)
  Evolution of pinna shapes to optimize performance in natural
  biosonar tasks. b) Adaptation of state-of-the-art ultrasonic
  transducer technology for matching bats in terms of bandwidth and
  sound pressure level/sensitivity. c) Actuation of mobile pinnae
  (including the possibility of non-rigid transformations) within the
  scale-constraints of a bat's head. d) Custom-designed DSP hardware
  providing a qualitative and quantitative reproduction of the neural
  signal representation at the level of the auditory nerve. (funded by

  ferroelectret material with a diameter of 1.5 cm was de- veloped for
  emitting a chirp signal with a sound pressure level of more than 90
  dB at a distance of 1 m for an artifi- cial bat head. Compared to a
  single layer transmitter, the resonance frequency of a two layer
  stack actuator is shifted down to 100 kHz. This frequency shift
  enables the transmit- ter half-power bandwidth to be in the range of
  30-200 kHz.  With the same material, an ultrasonic receiver with a
  diame- ter of 1 cm was designed. The ferroelectric material in com-
  bination with a special pre-amplifier allows an equivalent acoustic
  noise level of 45 dB and a sensitivity of 500 {\textmu}V/Pa.  This sensor
  matches the bandwidth of the transmitter. In addition, we
  investigate the nonlinear acoustic behaviour of the ferroelectric
  material by applying 2D finite element simulations of various
  transducer designs. Therewith, we fully solve the piezoelectric
  partial differential equations in- cluding the complex geometric
  structure of cellular ferro- electric films. In our paper, we will
  discuss the measurement results for various designs of transmitters
  and receivers as well as corresponding simulation data.}

  directivities are presented. The predictions are based on finite
  element meshes generated from computer-tomographic cross-section
  images of pinna samples obtained from several bat species. A
  time-domain finite element model was combined with a near-field to
  far-field transformation to yield high-resolution directivity
  estimates. The data obtained enables the introduction of new
  visualization approaches to the study of bat biosonar. These
  techniques portray the spatial and frequency dimension of the
  patterns, facilitate quantitative analysis, and reveal functional
  properties relevant to specific sensing tasks, like scanning the
  surface of an extended target. The computer graphics representations
  of the pinna shapes (voxel arrays, volume and surface meshes) can be
  readily manipulated to shed light onto how the observed properties
  arise. For example, appendages have been removed by "Boolean
  surgery" or altered in orientation or shape by standard computer
  graphics transformations. The results of these manipulations are
  compared with respect to wave field amplitudes as well as with
  respect to directivity patterns. Supported by the European Union

  strength of an extensive asymmetric side-lobe which points in a

  in the strongest side-lobe sensitivity.  Using a bootstrap
  validation paradigm, the results were found to be robust against
  small perturbations of the finite element mesh
  boundaries. Furthermore, it was established that a major aspect of
  the tragus effect (position dependence) can be studied in a simple
  shape model, an obliquely truncated horn augmented by a flap

  abstract = {Animals have evolved intricate shapes which diffract
  emitted or received sound and thereby generate a specific
  directivity pattern. Computer-tomographic methods can generate
  high-resolution digital representations of these morphological
  structures in the form of three-dimensional voxel arrays. However,
  predicting acoustic directivity patterns from these representations
  with numerical methods can incur high computational cost, e.g., for
  large structures with fine detail and/or high wave numbers (as in
  bats and dolphins). Here, the design of a toolchain is described
  which can handle all steps of deriving a directivity prediction from
  a voxel representation: generation of a finite-element mesh,
  assembly of the system matrix, computation of an approximate
  solution, forward projection into the far field. All individual
  operations are performed by self-contained tools, which communicate
  through files. This gives access to intermediate results and limits
  re-execution upon parameter changes to downstream steps. At each
  stage, optimizations can be made based on the specifics of the
  problem such as the regular structure of the voxel array and the
  distance independence of the directivity. Use of these optimizations
  has resulted in a highly efficient performance, which is documented
  by measures for execution speed, memory usage, and accuracy}

  abstract = {Horseshoe bats emit their ultrasonic biosonar pulses
  through nostrils surrounded by intricately shaped protuberances
  (noseleaves). While these noseleaves have been hypothesized to
  affect the sonar beam, their physical function has never been
  analyzed. Using numerical methods, we show that conspicuous furrows
  in the noseleaf act as resonance cavities shaping the sonar
  beam. This demonstrates that (a) animals can use resonances in
  external, half-open cavities to direct sound emissions, (b)
  structural detail in the faces of bats can have acoustic effects
  even if it is not adjacent to the emission sites, and (c)
  specializations in the biosonar system of horseshoe bats allow for
  differential processing of subbands of the pulse in the acoustic
  domain.},

% Aug. 31, 2005 Robotic Bat 'Sees' with Sound By Tracy Staedter, Discovery News
% Bats, which do some of their best work in the dark, can navigate
% through the air using sound. Now a bionic head that mimics a bat's
% sensory talent is not only helping scientists understand how the
% animals maneuver, but could also lead to much more advanced
% sonar-based navigation methods for land-based robots. "There are some
% niches for using in-air sonar and bats have found one niche," said
% Herbert Peremans, head of the Active Perception Lab of the University
% of Antwerp and coordinator for the EU-financed CIRCE (Chiroptera
% Inspired Robotic Cephaloid) bat head project.
