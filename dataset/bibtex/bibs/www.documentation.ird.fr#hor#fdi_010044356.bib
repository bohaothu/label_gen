  abstract = {{T}his paper aimed at estimating albedo and {L}eaf {A}rea {I}ndex ({LAI}) from {FORMOSAT}-2 satellite that offers a unique source of high spatial resolution (eight meters) images with a high revisit frequency (one to three days). {I}t mainly consisted of assessing the {FORMOSAT}-2 spectral and directional configurations that are unusual, with a single off nadir viewing angle over four visible-near infra red wavebands. {I}mages were collected over an agricultural region located in {S}outh {E}astern {F}rance, with a three day frequency from the growing season to post-harvest. {S}imultaneously, numerous ground based measurements were performed over various crops such as wheat, meadow, rice and maize. {A}lbedo and {LAI} were estimated using empirical approaches that have been widely used for usual directional and spectral configurations (i.e. multidirectional or single nadir viewing angle over visible-near infrared wavebands). {T}wo methods devoted to albedo estimation were assessed. based on stepwise multiple regression and neural network ({NNT}). {A}lthough both methods gave satisfactory results, the {NNT} performed better (relative {RMSE}=3.5% versus 7.3%), especially for low vegetation covers over dark or wet soils that corresponded to albedo values lower than 0.20. {F}our approaches for {LAI} estimation were assessed. {T}he first approach based on a stepwise multiple regression over reflectances had the worst performance (relative {RMSE}=65%), when compared to the equally performing {NDVI} based heuristic relationship and reflectance based {NNT} approach (relative {RMSE}=34%).{T}he {NDVI} based neural network approach had the best performance (relative {RMSE}=27.5%), due to the combination of {NDVI} efficient normalization properties and {NNT} flexibility. {T}he high {FORMOSAT}-2 revisit frequency allowed next replicating the dynamics of albedo and {LAI}, and detecting to some extents cultural practices like vegetation cuts. {I}t also allowed investigating possible relationships between albedo and {LAI}. {T}he latter depicted specific trends according to vegetation types, and were very similar when derived from ground based data, remotely sensed observations or radiative transfer simulations. {T}hese relationships also depicted large albedo variabilities for low {LAI} values, which confirmed that estimating one variable from the other would yield poor performances for low vegetation cover with varying soil backgrounds. {F}inally, this empirical study demonstrated, in the context of exhaustively describing the spatiotemporal variability of surface properties, the potential synergy between 1) ground based web-sensors that continuously monitor specific biophysical variables over few locations, and 2) high spatial resolution satellite with high revisit frequencies.},
