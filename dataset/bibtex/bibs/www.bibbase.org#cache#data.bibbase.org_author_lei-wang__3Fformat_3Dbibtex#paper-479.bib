  abstract = {Mobile devices contain more personal data such as GPS location, contacts and music, with which users can create innovative and pragmatic mashup applications for different areas such as social networking, E-commerce, and entertainment. We propose a semantic-based mobile mashup platform which enables users to create mashup applications by simply selecting service nodes, linking them together and configuring some connection parameters. Our platform also offers a recommendation mechanism on linkable services by adding semantic annotation to service description, so that users do not need to read specifications of web services in order to find out linkable ones. Therefore, users can focus more on the innovation and practicability of their mashup applications, which will surely result in the emergence of abundant mobile mashup applications.},
