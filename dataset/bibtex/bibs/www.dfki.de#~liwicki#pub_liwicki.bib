Recognising lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting
cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to assimilate context information, has led
to low recognition rates for even the best current recognisers. Most recent progress in the field has been
made either through improved preprocessing, or through advances in language modelling. Relatively
little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same
hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite
their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of
recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labelling tasks where the data is hard to
segment and contains long-range, bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two unconstrained
handwriting databases, the new approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7\% on online data
and 74.1\% on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition,
we demonstrate the network�s robustness to lexicon size, measure the influence of its hidden layers,
and analyse its use of context. Lastly we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the
network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network�s superior performance.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a writer-dependent handwriting recognition system
based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). This system, which has been developed in the context of research on smart meeting rooms, operates in two stages.
First, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based writer identification system developed for smart meeting rooms identifies the person writing on the whiteboard.
Then a recognition system adapted to the individual writer is applied.
Two different methods for obtaining writer-dependent recognizers are proposed. The first method uses the available writer-specific data to train an individual recognition system for each writer from scratch,
while the second method takes a writer-independent recognizer and adapts it with the data from the considered writer.
The experiments have been performed on the IAM-OnDB.
In the first stage, the writer identification system produces a perfect identification rate.
In the second stage, the writer-specific recognition system gets significantly better recognition results, compared to the writer-independent recognizer.
The final word recognition rate on the IAM-OnDB-t1 benchmark task is close to $80$\,\%.

general off-line handwriting database. The second approach
is unconventional in the sense that the language

for testing. In our experiments with several training sets

is adapting the previously trained recognizer on a writer

  This book addresses the issue of processing online handwritten notes acquired from an electronic whiteboard.
Notes written on a whiteboard is a new modality in handwriting recognition research that has received relatively little attention in the past.
The main motivation for this book is smart meeting room applications, where not only speech and video data of a meeting are recorded, but also notes written on a whiteboard are captured.
The aim of a smart meeting room is to automate standard tasks usually performed by humans in a meeting. In order to allow for retrieval of the meeting data by means of a browser, semantic information needs to be extracted from the raw sensory data.

The main achievements of this book can be summarized as follows. A new online handwritten database has been compiled, and four handwriting recognition systems have been developed. These are an offline and an online recognition system, a system combining offline and online data, and a writer-dependent recognition system.
The online recognition system includes novel preprocessing and normalization strategies which have been developed especially for whiteboard notes. A novel classification strategy based on bidirectional long short-term memory networks has been applied for the first time in the field of handwriting recognition.
In the combination experiments both the offline and online system were integrated into a single recognizer.
To the best of the authors' knowledge these are the first experiments in the field of online sentence recognition combining systems based on offline and online features.
Furthermore, external recognition systems were included in the combination experiments.
The experimental results on the test set show a highly significant improvement of the recognition performance over the individual systems.
The optimal combination achieved a word level accuracy of more than 86\,\%, implying a relative error reduction of about 26\,\%, compared to the best individual classifier.

feature set. A hidden Markov model and a neural network based recognizer have been
 used as recognition engines. In our experiments we obtained interesting results. Using
a set of only five features, we achieved a performance similar to that of the reference
 system that uses all 25 features. The five selected features have a low correlation and
have been the top choices during the first iterations of the forward search with both
 recognizers. Furthermore, for both recognizers subsets have been identified that outperform
the reference system with statistical significance. In order to assess the results more
 rigorously, we have compared our recognizer with the widely used commercial recognizer
from Microsoft.

for gender detection is investigated for the first time

  Building recognition systems for historical documents
is a difficult task. Especially, when it comes to medieval
scripts. The complexity is mainly affected by the poor quality
and the small quantity of the data available. In this paper
we apply an HMM based recognition system to medieval
manuscripts from the 13th century written in Middle High
German. The recognition system, which was originally developed
for modern scripts, has been adapted to medieval
scripts. Beside the data processing, one of the major challenges
is to create a suitable language model. Because of
the lack of appropriate independent text corpora for medieval
languages, the language model has to be created
on the base of a rather small number of manuscripts only.
Due to the small size of the corpus, optimizing the language
model parameters can quickly lead to the problem of overfitting.
In this paper we describe a strategy to integrate all
available information into the language model and to optimize
the language model parameters without suffering from
this problem.

  In this paper we propose a new strategy for combining
the outputs of several alignment systems. Based on the word
boundaries retrieved from a number of individual alignment
systems, the new boundaries are estimated. We investigate
three strategies for this estimation. First, the mean value
of the individual boundaries is taken, second the median
is selected, and third, confidence values of the alignment
systems are considered. We apply the combination strategies
on a word mapping system for historical handwritten
manuscripts. After some preprocessing and normalizing
steps, three differently trained hidden Markov model
based handwriting recognizers are applied to the text lines
in forced alignment mode. As a result, the positions of the
word boundaries are obtained. In in a number of experiments
it is shown that a combination strategy based on the
median outperforms the others and all individual alignment
systems with a word mapping rate of about 95\%.

	abstract = {Architects’ daily routine means working with drawings. They use either a pen or a computer sketching their ideas or drawing to scale. When beginning a new project they often have to search for similar projects in the past. In this paper a sketch-based approach is proposed to query the floor plan repository. The user searches for semantically similar floor plans just by drawing the new plan. An algorithm extracts the semantic structure sketched by the architect on DFKI’s Touch \& Write table and compares the structure of the sketch with the ones from the floor plan repository. The a.SCatch system enables the user to easily access knowledge from past projects. While in the current pro- totype only sketches with a predefined structure are recognized, we will extend the system to work with normal floor plans.},

    abstract = {In this chapter we describe various methods for the automatic recognition of handwritten
whiteboard notes. A handwriting recognition system for Roman Script
is usually divided into units which iteratively process the handwritten input data
to finally obtain the desired ASCII transcription: the preprocessing, where noise
in the raw data is reduced; the normalization, where various steps take place to
remove writer-specific characteristics of the handwriting; the feature extraction,
where the normalized data is transformed into a sequence of feature vectors; the
recognition, where a classifier generates a list of word sequence candidates; and
the post-processing, where language information is used to improve the results.
We review different approaches for all of these stages and describe selected approaches
in more detail. Furthermore, we introduce some preprocessing steps
which have been developed especially for whiteboard notes. In order to assess the
advantages of different methods, we present the results of a broad experimental
analysis on a large database of handwritten whiteboard notes.},
