  abstract = {Instant messaging has become a part of our daily live. Instant communication,
	either with a mobile device or with a computer based application,
	is an increasingly used form of communication. In this paper we analyze
	how current instant messaging can be extended to a new and more general
	form of what we call 'ubiquitous presence systems'. We discuss how
	ubiquitous presence systems become a part of our daily live, extending
	the current systems, which only use states like 'online' and 'away',
	to location- and context-aware systems. We present the design space
	for ubiquitous presence systems together with a classification of
	those systems. We discuss information acquisition and also shortly
	address related privacy issues. We present an architecture for connecting
	arbitrary devices into the presence system, according to the vision
	of ubiquitous computing. We conclude the paper by presenting a fully
	working and deployed prototypical implementation following the developed
	architecture.},
