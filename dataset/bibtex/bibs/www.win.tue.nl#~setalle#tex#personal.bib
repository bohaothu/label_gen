For this reason, only few companies take their products through a common criteria evaluation. To support security evaluation, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has developed a threat, vulnerability, risk analysis (eTVRA) method for the Telecommunication (Telco) domain. eTVRA builds on the security risk management methodology CORAS and is structured in such a way that it provides output that can be directly fed into a common criteria security evaluation. In this paper, we evaluate the time and resource efficiency of parts of eTVRA and the quality of the result produced by following eTVRA compared to a more pragmatic approach (protection profile-based checklists). We use both approaches to identify and analyze risks of a new SIM card currently under joint development by a small hardware company and a large Telco provider.},

Therefore, a policy change of one principal will often affect who gets authorized by another principal. In such a system of influenceable authorization a number of principals may want to coordinate their policies to achieve long time guarantees on a set of safety goals. 
The problem we tackle in this paper is to find minimal restrictions to the policies of a set of principals that achieve their safety goals. This will enable building useful DTM systems that are safe by design, simply by relying on the policy restrictions of the collaborating principals. To this end we will model DTM safety problems in Scoll [1], an approach that proved useful to model confinement in object capability systems [2].},

Ontologies enable mutual understanding among peers by providing a precise semantics to concepts and relationships in a domain.

The alignment should be flexible and accurate to not undermine the autonomy and reliability of peers.

Nowadays, attacks aim mainly to exploit vulnerabilities at application level: thus, the payload contains the most important information to differentiate normal traffic from anomalous activity. To support our thesis, we present a comparison between different anomaly-based NIDSs, focusing in particular on the data analyzed by the detection engine to discover possible malicious activities. Furthermore, we present a comparison of two payload and anomaly-based NIDSs: PAYL and POSEIDON.},

          abstract = {Large and distributed access control systems are increasingly common, for example in health care. In such settings, access control policies may become very complex, thus complicating correct and efficient adminstration of the access control system. Despite being one of the most widely used access control standards, RBAC does not include an administration model for distributed systems. In this paper we fill this gap. We present a model for the administration of RBAC in a distributed system and propose an administration procedure supporting the principle that different systems protect different sets of objects. We demonstrate that our procedure fulfills the formal requirements deriving from safety and availability, and we show how it can be translated to a practical implementation. Finally, we show how our model can be extended with multiple decentralized administrative systems.},

The approach is based on a model integrating information assets and the IT infrastructure that they rely on for distributed systems. IT infrastructures enable one to analyse risk propagation possibilities and calculate the impact of confidentiality incidents. Furthermore, our approach is a mean to bridge the technical and businessoriented views of information systems, since the importance of information assets, which is leading the technical decisions, is set by the business.},

The framework consists of a simple policy language, modeling ownership of data and administrative policies. Users can create documents, and authorize others to process the documents. To control compliance to the document policies, we define a formal audit procedure by which users may be audited and asked to justify that an action was in compliance with a policy. In this paper we focus on the implementation of our framework.We present a formal proof system, which was only informally described in earlier work. We derive an important tractability result (a cut-elimination theorem), and we use this result to implement a proof-finder, a key component in this framework. We argue that in a number of settings, such as collaborative work environments, where a small group of users create and manage document in a decentralized way, our framework is a more flexible approach for controlling the compliance to policies.},

The mission of this paper is twofold: (1) to put a spotlight on these advantages, (2) at the same time justifying some of our design rationales in LicenseScript. We accomplish this by giving examples of licensing models that are greatly facilitated by the use of Prolog as a component of LicenseScript.

The confidentiality and integrity of the license or parts thereof can be assured with our protection scheme. In addition, the keys to unlock the protected content are always protected and stored securely as part of the license. We verifiy secrecy and authentication aspects of one of our protocols.

        annote = {abstract Security policies are rules that constrain the behaviour of a system. Different, largely unrelated sets of rules typically govern the physical and logical worlds. However, increased hardware and software mobility forces us to consider those rules in an integrated fashion. We present SPIN models of four case studies where mobility plays a role. In each case the model captures both the system of interest and its security policy. The model is then formally checked against a property that represents a principle from the problem domain. The model checking activity shows many examples of policies that are too weak to cope with mobility.}}

Architectures based on Parlay/OSA APIs allow third party service providers to develop new services that can access, in a controlled and secure way, to those network capabilities offered by the network operator. Role of the TSM protocol, run by network gateways, is to authenticate the client applications trying to access and use the network capabilities features offered. For this reason potential security flaws in its authentication strategy can bring to unauthorized use of network with evident damages to the operator and to the quality of the services. This paper shows how a rigorous formal analysis of TSM underlines serious weaknesses in the model describing its authentication procedure. This usually means that also the original system (i.e., the TSM protocol itself) hides the same flaws. The paper relates about the design activity of the formal model, the tool-aided verification performed and the security flaws discovered. This will allow us to discuss about how the security of the TSM protocol can be generally improved.}}

Then we merge the extension with Directed Diffusion (DD). The resulting protocol, LKHW, combines the advantages of both LKH and DD. In particular, LKHW enforces both backward and forward secrecy, while incurring only limited overhead in terms of the number of messages required. This is the first security protocol that leverages DD, and it shows that such a paradigm is also viable for other applications than routing. Finally, a few new research directions that originate from this paper are discussed.}}

Our contribution is three-fold: firstly, we present a survey, where we discuss the dominant issues of energy-security trade-off in the network protocol and key management design space. From there we set out future research directions for our security framework. Secondly, we propose an assessment framework based on system profile, with which we have managed to carve out manageable design spaces from the seemingly infinite possibilities of ad hoc mobile wireless networks. Finally, we have benchmarked some well-known cryptographic algorithms in search for the best compromise in security and energy-efficiency, on a typical sensor node. Our preliminary investigations also cover an important parameter in the design space: the resource requirements of the symmetric key algorithms RC5 and TEA. from becoming a part of the network to communicate with the sensors.},

Our architecture is based on a clear set of assumptions and guidelines. Key deployment uses minimal key storage while key refreshment is based on the well studied scheme of Abdalla et al. The keying protocols involved uses only symmetric cryptography and have all been verified with our constraint solving-based protocol verification tool CoProVe.},
