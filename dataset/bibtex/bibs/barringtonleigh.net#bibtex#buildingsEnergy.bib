abstract={
Autocorrelated residuals from regression models of building energy use present problems when attempting to estimate retrofit energy savings and the uncertainty of the savings. This paper discusses the causes of autocorrelation in energy use models and proposes methods to deal with autocorrelation. A hybrid of ordinary least squares (OLS) and autoregressive (AR) models is developed to accurately predict energy use and give realistic uncertainty estimates. A procedure for model selection is presented and tested on data from three commercial buildings participating in the Texas LoanSTAR program. In every case examined, the hybrid OLS-AR model provided an uncertainty estimate for energy use far more accurate than the OLS estimate.

abstract={Development of methodologies to determine energy retrofit savings in commercial buildings (institutional buildings, schools, hospitals, offices, county and state buildings,...) has been the object of active research during the last 5 years in the framework of the Texas LoanSTAR program. We have been able to formulate a global perspective to this problem and identify/develop analysis techniques specific to different sets of conditions. These conditions involve different combinations of: (a) level of monitoring data available (utility bill, whole-building hourly, disaggregated hourly,...); (b) type of energy use (weather or schedule dependent or independent); and (c) amount of data available (length of preand post-retrofit periods).

The objective of this report is to present the various analysis techniques in a logical fashion, briefly discussing and illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of each technique with monitored data from several of the LoanSTAR buildings, and providing the reader with complete references of work previously published. As of December 1993, we are reporting retrofit savings on a monthly basis in 34 sites consisting of 50 buildings. Some of the issues addressed relate to determining conditions when statistical regression techniques are preferable to engineering models, to the different forms of single variable and multiple variable regression models and their advantages or disadvantages, to when a specific regression model is to be used and to why inspection of model residuals is important. Other issues such as the uncertainty associated with the savings estimates and the effect of building operating schedules have also been addressed in this report. The framework laid out in this report should be useful for both the practicing professional and the researcher involved or interested in energy conservation as a whole.
