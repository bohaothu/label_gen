%%%                        During this work, several instances of
%%%                        missing article were uncovered in the IEEE

                 isolated from the main operations of the company. Some
                 review is made of the design process as well as the
                 unique features of the machine. The article also

  content =      "Schwartz describes two early computers used at the
                 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (whose German
                 acronym is ETH) during the 1950s. Despite the more
                 general title, he does not mention any non-ETH
                 computers in this article. According to Schwartz, the
                 first programmable computer in Switzerland was the Z4
                 developed by Konrad Zuse in Germany during World War II
                 and installed at the ETH in 1950. Except for the ERMETH
                 (also at the ETH), he does not mention any subsequent
                 Swiss installations during the period, leaving a weak
                 implication that there were none.\par

                 The Z4 was an electromechanical machine with a total
                 data memory of 64 32-bit words and no program memory.
                 Programs were executed while being read from punched
                 tape. Conditional test instructions permitted
                 instructions on the tape to be skipped; other control
                 instructions caused an alternate tape reader to begin
                 processing a program (a form of subroutine-call). The
                 arithmetic unit could perform true floating-point
                 operations. This arithmetic unit contained built-in
                 functions for computing squares, reciprocals, and
                 square roots. (Ten years later, mere integer division
                 was still optional at an extra cost on the IBM 1401.)
                 There were special representations for infinity and
                 ``undefined'' so that operations such as division by
                 zero could continue without interruption but with a
                 meaningful result.",

  remark =       "The author has this remark about Metropolis on page
                 194: ``What are the architectural consequences of this
                 kind of influence? [of Los Alamos on computer design]
                 One apparent in Stretch is that machine's noisy mode
                 facility (Los Alamos interviews). The inspiration of
                 these was Los Alamos Nicholas Metropolis, who in the
                 1950s developed what he called significance arithmetic:
                 the attempt to determine the consequences, for the
                 reliability of results, of errors caused by the need to
                 represent numbers by words of finite length. In noisy
                 mode the effects of truncation were handled differently
                 from in normal operation so as to allow errors caused
                 by truncation to be detected.

                 By definition of ordinary normalized [floating-point]
                 operations, numbers are frequently extended on the
                 right by attaching zeros. During addition the $n$-digit
                 operand that is not preshifted is extended with n
                 zeros, so as to provide the extra positions to which
                 the preshifted operand can be added. Any operand or
                 result that is shifted left to be normalized requires a
                 corresponding number of zeros to be shifted in at the
                 right. Both sets of zeros tend to produce numbers
                 smaller in absolute value than they would have been if
                 more digits had been carried. In the noisy mode these
                 numbers are simply extended with 1s instead of zeros
                 (1s in a binary machine, 9s in a decimal machine). Now
                 all numbers tend to be too large in absolute value. The
                 true value, if there had been no significance loss,
                 should lie between these two extremes. Hence, two runs,
                 one made without and one made with the noisy mode,
                 should show differences in result that indicate which
                 digits may have been affected by significance loss
                 (Buchholz 1962, p. 102).''

                 See \cite{Buchholz:1962:PCS} for more information about
                 the Stretch noisy mode.",

                 ``Byte denotes a group of bits used to encode a
                 character, or the number of bits transmitted in
                 parallel to and from input-output units. A term other
                 than character is used here because a given character
                 may be represented in different applications by more
                 than one code, and different codes may use different
                 numbers of bits (i.e., different byte sizes). In
                 input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be
                 completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual
                 characters. (The term is coined from bite, but
                 respelled to avoid accidental mutation to bit.)''.",

                 See \cite{MacKenzie:1991:IAL} for a remark about the
                 noisy mode for floating-point arithmetic in the IBM
                 7030 Stretch. That mode is first mentioned on page 25
                 of this book, and described in detail on page 102,
                 which states:

                 ``By definition of ordinary normalized FLP operations,
                 numbers are frequently extended on the right by
                 attaching zeros. During addition the n-digit operand
                 that is not preshifted is extended with n zeros, so as
                 to provide the extra positions to which the preshifted
                 operand can be added. Any operand or result that is
                 shifted left to be normalized requires a corresponding
                 number of zeros to be shifted in at the right. Both
                 sets of zeros tend to produce numbers smaller in
                 absolute value than they would have been if more digits
                 had been carried. In the noisy mode these numbers are
                 simply extended with 1 s instead of zeros (1 s in a
                 binary machine, 9s in a decimal machine). Sow all
                 numbers tend to be too large in absolute value. The
                 true value, if there had been no significance loss,
                 should lie between these two extremes. Hence, two runs,
                 one made without and one made with the noisy mode,
                 should show differences in result that indicate which
                 digits may have been affected by significance loss.

                 The principal weakness of the noisy-mode procedure is
                 that it requires two runs for the same problem. A much
                 less important weakness is that the loss of
                 significance cannot be guaranteed to show up-it merely
                 has a very high probability of showing up-whereas
                 built-in significance checks can be made slightly
                 pessimistic, so that actual significance loss will not
                 be greater than indicated. On the other hand, little
                 extra hardware and no extra storage are required for
                 the noisy-mode approach. Furthermore, significance loss
                 is relatively rare, so that running a problem twice
                 when Significance loss is suspected does not pose a
                 serious problem. What is serious is the possibility of
                 unsuspected significance loss.

                 In discussions of significance two points are often
                 overlooked. The first of these is trivial: the best way
                 of ensuring significant results is to use an adequate
                 number of fraction digits. The second is almost equally
                 mundane: for a given procedure, normalized FLP
                 arithmetic will ordinarily produce the greatest
                 precision possible for the number of fraction digits
                 used. Normalized FLP arithmetic has been criticized
                 with respect to significance loss, because such loss is
                 not indicated by the creation of leading zeros, as it
                 is with fixed-point arithmetic. In other words, the
                 contention is not that normalized FLP arithmetic is
                 more prone to significance loss than equivalent
                 fixed-point arithmetic, which would be untrue, but that
                 an equivalent indication of such loss is not provided.
                 Loss of significance, however, is also a serious
                 problem in fixed-point arithmetic; multiplication and
                 division do not handle it at all correctly by means of
                 leading zeros. (In particular, fixed-point
                 multiplication may lead to serious or even total
                 significance loss, which would not have occurred with
                 normalized FLP arithmetic: and although leading zeros
                 in addition and subtraction of fixed-point operands do
                 give correct significance indications, the use of other
                 operations and of built-in waling loops frequently
                 destroys entirely the leading-zeros method of counting
                 significance.)''",

                 an imaginary computer known as the Turing Machine; in
                 an age before computers, he explored the concept of
                 what it meant to be computable, creating the field of
                 computability theory in the process, a foundation of
                 present-day computer programming. The book expands
                 Turing's original 36-page paper with additional
                 background chapters and extensive annotations; the
                 author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing's
                 statements, making the original difficult-to-read
                 document accessible to present day programmers,
                 computer science majors, math geeks, and others.
                 Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of
                 Turing's own life: his years at Cambridge and
                 Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during
                 World War II, his involvement in seminal computer
                 projects, his speculations about artificial
                 intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime
                 of ``gross indecency,'' and his early death by apparent
                 suicide at the age of 41.''",

                 a bar on the Illinois--Iowa border, John Vincent
                 Atanasoff, a professor of physics at Iowa State
                 University, after a frustrating day performing tedious
                 mathematical calculations in his lab, hit on the idea
                 that the binary number system and electronic switches,
                 combined with an array of capacitors on a moving drum
                 to serve as memory, could yield a computing machine
                 that would make his life easier. Then he went back and
                 built the machine. It worked, but he never patented the
                 device, and the developers of the far-better-known
                 ENIAC almost certainly stole critical ideas from
                 him. But in 1973 a court declared that the patent on
                 that Sperry Rand device was invalid, opening the gates
                 to the computer revolution. Biographer Jane Smiley
                 makes the race to develop digital computing as gripping
                 as a real-life techno-thriller.''",
