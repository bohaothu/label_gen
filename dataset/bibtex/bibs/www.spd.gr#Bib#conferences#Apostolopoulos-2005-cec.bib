	abstract = {Smart cards are cards with memory and a processor, ideal for authentication and secure applications. Mobile devices have an extraordinary spread; people carry them along at all times. The ability to combine the features of those two devices is quite compelling. We used technologies of the Java family in order to achieve this. In our work, we designed an architecture for the management of smart cards by mobile devices. The system is built up from three components, the Java card applet, the mobile application and the Java card-mobile device gateway. For the purposes of our work and as proof of concept, we developed a sample electronic wallet application. Finally, we extended the proposed system's functionality and described a business case, where the system could be used in the future.}
