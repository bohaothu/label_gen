                  Applied $\pi$ which characterises
                  observational equivalence on processes. The
                  motivation is similar to that of Applied
                  $\pi$ itself, namely generality: the logic
                  can be adapted to a particular application simply by
                  defining a suitable equational theory on
                  terms.\bibpar As a first step towards the logic for
                  Applied $\pi$, a strong version of static
                  equivalence on frames is introduced in which term
                  reductions are observable in addition to equality on
                  terms. We argue that the strong version is
                  meaningful in applications and give two refined
                  definitions based on the notion of cores introduced
                  in work by Boreale et al. for the Spi calculus. The
                  refined definitions are useful because they do not
                  involve universal quantification over arbitrary
                  terms and hence are amenable to a logical
                  characterisation. We show that the refined
                  definitions coincide with the original definition of
                  strong static equivalence under certain general
                  conditions.\bibpar A first order logic for frames
                  which characterises strong static equivalence and
                  which yields characteristic formulae is then given
                  based on the refined definitions of strong static
                  equivalence. This logic facilitates direct reasoning
                  about terms in a frame as well as indirect reasoning
                  about knowledge deducible from a frame. The logic
                  for Applied $\pi$ is then obtained by adding
                  suitable Hennessy-Milner style modalities to the
                  logic for frames, hence facilitating reasoning about
                  both static and dynamic properties of processes. We
                  finally demonstrate the logic with an application to
                  the analysis of the Needham-Schroeder Public Key
                  Protocol",

                  for functional languages. It was specified with an
                  extension of the SECD machine, which was the first
                  abstract machine for functional languages. We
                  present a family of compositional evaluation
                  functions corresponding to this extension of the
                  SECD machine, using a series of elementary
                  transformations (transformation into
                  continuation-passing style (CPS) and
                  defunctionalization, chiefly) and their left
                  inverses (transformation into direct style and
                  refunctionalization). To this end, we modernize the
                  SECD machine into a bisimilar one that operates in
                  lock step with the original one but that (1) does
                  not use a data stack and (2) uses the caller-save
                  rather than the callee-save convention for
                  environments. We then characterize the J operator in
                  terms of CPS and in terms of delimited-control
                  operators in the CPS hierarchy. As a byproduct, we
                  also present a reduction semantics for applicative
                  expressions with the J operator, based on Curien's
                  original calculus of explicit substitutions. This
                  reduction semantics mechanically corresponds to the
                  modernized version of the SECD machine and to the
                  best of our knowledge, it provides the first
                  syntactic theory of applicative expressions with the
                  J operator.\bibpar The present work is concluded by
                  a motivated wish to see Landin's name added to the
                  list of co-discoverers of
                  continuations. Methodologically, however, it mainly
                  illustrates the value of Reynolds's
                  defunctionalization and of refunctionalization as
                  well as the expressive power of the CPS hierarchy

                  the first abstract machine for functional languages

                  is compositional, is in continuation+state passing
                  style and threads a trail of delimited continuations

                  grammars are used as models of real-world physical

                  approximate the problem based on local regular
                  approximations and grammar unfoldings. As an
                  application, we consider grammars that occur in RNA

                  checking on labelled transition systems generated by
                  prefix rewrite rules on words. Stirling (1996, 1998)
                  proved the decidability of bisimilarity for normed
                  pushdown processes. This result was substantially
                  extended by S\'{e}nizergues (1998, 2005) who showed
                  the decidability for regular (or equational) graphs
                  of finite out-degree (which include unnormed
                  pushdown processes). The question of decidability of
                  bisimilarity for a more general class of so called
                  Type -1 systems (generated by prefix rewrite rules
                  of the form $R \stackrel{a}{\longrightarrow} w$
                  where $R$ is a regular language) was left open; this

                  negatively, i.e., we show undecidability of
                  bisimilarity on Type -1 systems, even in the normed
                  case. We complete the picture by considering classes
                  of systems that use rewrite rules of the form $w
                  \stackrel{a}{\longrightarrow} R$ and $R_1
                  \stackrel{a}{\longrightarrow} R_2$ and show when

                  ($\Pi^0_1$-completeness) and when high
                  undecidability ($\Sigma^1_1$-completeness), all with

                  strategies, and we methodically derive a series of
