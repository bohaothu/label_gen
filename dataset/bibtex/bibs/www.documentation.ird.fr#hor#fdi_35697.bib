  abstract = {{V}arious equations allowing for the introduction of an environmental variable into different surplus production models were proposed by the first author. {CLIMPROD} is an experimental expert-system, using artificial intelligence, which provides a statistical and graphical description of the data set and helps the user to select the model corresponding to his case according to objective criteria. {T}he software fits the model to the data set using a non-linear regression routine, and assesses the fit with parametric and non-parametric tests, and provides a graphical representation of the results. {A}n example is provided on a pelagic stock, showing the strong effect of environment on long-term variability.
