       In this paper we investigate the use of a specialized data
       warehousing database management system as a data back-end for
       web applications and assess the performance of this solution.
       We have used the Monet database as a drop-in replacement for
       traditional databases, and performed benchmarks comparing its
       performance to the performance of two of the most commonly used
       databases for web applications: MySQL and PostgreSQL.  Our main
       contribution is to show for the first time how a read-optimized
       database performs in comparison to established general purpose
       database management systems for the domain of web applications.
       Monet's performance in relation to MySQL and PostgresSQL allows
       us to affirm that the widely accepted assumption that
       relational database management systems are fit for all
       applications can be reconsidered in the case of dynamic web
       applications.
