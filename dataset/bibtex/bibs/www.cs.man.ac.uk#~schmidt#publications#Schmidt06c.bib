ABSTRACT ={This volume contains the joint proceedings of the 9th International
Conference on \emph{Relational Methods in Computer Science
(RelMiCS-9)} and the 4th International Workshop on
\emph{Applications of Kleene Algebra (AKA'06)}.  The joint event was
hosted by the School of Computer Science at the University of
Manchester, UK, from August 29 to September 2, 2006.  RelMiCS/AKA is
the main forum for the relational calculus as a conceptual and
methodological tool and for topics related to Kleene algebras.  Within
this general theme, the conference series is devoted to the theory of
relation algebras, Kleene algebras and related formalisms as well as
to their diverse applications in software engineering, data bases and
artificial intelligence.  This year, special focus was on formal
methods, logics of programs and links with neighbouring disciplines.
This diversity is reflected by the contributions to this volume.
