ABSTRACT:: 
Academic conferences are a long-standing and effective form of
multimedia communication.  Conference participants can transmit and
recieve information through sight, speech, gesture, text, and touch.
This same-time, same-place communication is sufficiently valuable to
justify large investments in time and travel funds.  Printed
conference proceedings are attempts to recapture the value of a life
conference, but they are limited by a fragmented and inefficient
approach to the problem.  We addressed this problem in the multimedia
proceedings of the DAGS'92 conference.  The recently published CD-ROM
delibers text, graphic, audio, and video information as an integrated
whole, with extensive provisions for random access and hypermedia
linking.  We belive that this project provides a model for future
conference publications and highlights some of the research issues
that must be resolved before similar publications can be quickly and
inexpensively produced.
