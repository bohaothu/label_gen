 abstract = {Security, privacy and governance are increasingly the focus of government
regulations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. This trend
has created the "regulation compliance" problem, whereby companies
and developers are required to ensure that their software
systems comply with relevant regulations, either through design or
reengineering. We previously proposed a methodology for extracting
stakeholder requirements, called rights and obligations, from
regulations. In this paper, we examine the challenges of developing
tool support for this process. Specifically, we apply the Cerno
framework for textual semantic annotation to propose a tool for
semi-automatic semantic annotation that yields models of objects
found in regulation texts. These objects include actors, rights and
obligations that must be incorporated into software requirements
to comply with the relevant regulation. Finally, we present preliminary
studies on the evaluation of the quality of the resulting
models, as well as the tool's effectiveness in reducing human effort
of deriving requirements from regulatory texts.},
