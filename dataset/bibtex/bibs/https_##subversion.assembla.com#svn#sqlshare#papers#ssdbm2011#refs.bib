@article{velvet,
	abstract = {We have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called Velvet, to manipulate de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) which is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50bp) datasets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50Kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3Kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa datasets without readpairs, Velvet generated contigs of around 8Kb in a prokaryote and 2Kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without readpair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly which can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies. 10.1101/gr.074492.107},

% Euler-USR

@article{eulerusr,
	abstract = {Abstract Increasing read length is currently viewed as the crucial condition for fragment assembly with next-generation sequencing technologies. However, introducing mate-paired reads (separated by a gap of length GapLength) opens a possibility to transform short mate-pairs into long mate-reads of length GapLength and thus raises the question whether the read length (as opposed to GapLength) even matters. We describe a new tool, EULER-USR, for assembling mate-paired short reads and use it to analyze the question whether the read length matters. We further complement the ongoing experimental efforts to maximize read length by a new computational approach for increasing the effective read length. While the common practice is to trim the error-prone tails of the reads, we present an approach that substitutes trimming with error correction using repeat graphs. An important and counterintuitive implication of this result is that one may extend sequencing reactions that degrade with length "past their prime" to where the error rate grows above what is normally acceptable for fragment assembly.},

% CABOG
@article{celera,
	abstract = {Motivation: DNA sequence reads from Sanger and pyrosequencing platforms differ in cost, accuracy, typical coverage, average read length, and the variety of available paired-end protocols. Both read types can complement one another in a "hybrid" approach to whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects, but assembly software must be modified to accommodate their different characteristics.  This is true even of pyrosequencing mated and unmated read combinations. Without special modifications, assemblers tuned for homogeneous sequence data may perform poorly on hybrid data.  Results: Celera Assembler was modified for combinations of ABI 3730 and 454 FLX reads. The revised pipeline called CABOG (Celera Assembler with the Best Overlap Graph) is robust to homopolymer run length uncertainty, high read coverage, and heterogeneous read lengths. In tests on four genomes, it generated the longest contigs among all assemblers tested. It exploited the mate constraints provided by paired-end reads from either platform to build larger contigs and scaffolds, which were validated by comparison to a finished reference sequence. A low rate of contig mis-assembly was detected in some CABOG assemblies, but this was reduced in the presence of sufficient mate pair data.
