  abstract     = {Tackling the current volume of graph-structured data
                  requires parallel tools.  We extend our work on
                  analyzing such massive graph data with the first
                  massively parallel algorithm for community detection
                  that scales to current data sizes, scaling to graphs
                  of over 122 million vertices and nearly 2 billion
                  edges in under 7300 seconds on a massively
                  multithreaded Cray XMT.  Our algorithm achieves
                  moderate parallel scalability without sacrificing
                  sequential operational complexity.  Community
                  detection partitions a graph into subgraphs more
                  densely connected within the subgraph than to the
                  rest of the graph.  We take an agglomerative
                  approach similar to Clauset, Newman, and Moore's
                  sequential algorithm, merging pairs of connected
                  intermediate subgraphs to optimize different graph
                  properties.  Working in parallel opens new
                  approaches to high performance.  On smaller data
                  sets, we find the output's modularity compares well
                  with the standard sequential algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Current online social networks are massive and still
                  growing.  For example, Facebook has over 500 million
                  active users sharing over 30 billion items per
                  month.  The scale within these data streams has
                  outstripped traditional graph analysis methods.
                  Monitoring requires dynamic analysis rather than
                  repeated static analysis.  The massive state behind
                  multiple persistent queries requires shared data
                  structures and not problem-specific representations.
                  We present a framework based on the STINGER data
                  structure that can monitor a global property,
                  connected components, on a graph of 16 million
                  vertices at rates of up to 240\,000 updates per
                  second on a 32 processor Cray XMT.  For very large
                  scale-free graphs, our implementation uses novel
                  batching techniques that exploit the scale-free
                  nature of the data and run over three times faster
                  than prior methods.  Our framework handles, for the
                  first time, real-world data rates, opening the door
                  to higher-level analytics such as community and
                  anomaly detection.},
