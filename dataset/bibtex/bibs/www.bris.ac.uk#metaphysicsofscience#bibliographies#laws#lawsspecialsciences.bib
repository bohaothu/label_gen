  title = {Does Biology Have Laws? The Experimental Evidence},
  journal = {Philosophy of Science},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {64},
  pages = {S444--S457},
  abstract = {In this paper I argue that we can best make sense of the practice
	of experimental evolutionary biology if we see it as investigating
	contingent, rather than lawlike, regularities. This understanding
	is contrasted with the experimental practice of certain areas of
	physics. However, this presents a problem for those who accept the
	Logical Positivist conception of law and its essential role in scientific
	explanation. I address this problem by arguing that the contingent
	regularities of evolutionary biology have a limited range of nomic
	necessity and a limited range of explanatory power even though they
	lack the unlimited projectibility that has been seen by some as a
	hallmark of scientific laws.},

	that the epistemic functions of a priori biological laws in biology
	are the same as those of empirical laws in physics. Thus, the requirement
	that laws be empirical is idle in connection with how laws operate
	in science. This result presents a choice between sticking with an
	unmotivated philosophical requirement and taking the functional equivalence
	of laws seriously and modifying our philosophical account. I favor
	the latter.},

	"structural" and/or "functional" kinds, in order to explain generalizations
	about "historical" kinds (such as biological taxa)-rather than vice
	versa. This practice is justified, since structural and functional
	kinds tend to correlate better with important ecological phenomena
	than do historical kinds. I support these contentions with three
	recent case studies. In one sense, therefore, ecology is, and should
	be, more nomothetic, or law-oriented, than idiographic, or historically
	oriented. This conclusion challenges several recent philosophical
	claims about the nature of ecological science.},

	I suggest two additional approaches: paradigmatic and pragmatic.
	Only the pragmatic represents varying kinds and degrees of contingency
	and exposes the multiple relationships found among scientific generalizations.
	It emphasizes the function of laws in grounding expectation and promotes
	the evaluation of generalizations along continua of ontological and
	representational parameters. Stability of conditions and strength
	of determination in nature govern projectibility. Accuracy, ontological
	level, simplicity, and manageability provide additional measures
	of usefulness.},
