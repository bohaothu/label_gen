ABSTRACT::
We describe a set of natural image statistics that are built upon two multi-scale
image decompositions, the quadrature mirror filter pyramid decomposition and the
local angular harmonic decomposition. These image statistics consist of first- and
higher-order statistics that capture certain statistical regularities of natural
images. We propose to apply these image statistics, together with classification
techniques, to three problems in digital image forensics: (1) differentiating photographic
images from computer-generated photorealistic images, (2) generic steganalysis;
(3) rebroadcast image detection. We also apply these image statistics to the traditional
art authentication for forgery detection and identification of artists in an art
work. For each application we show the effectiveness of these image statistics and
analyze their sensitivity and robustness.
