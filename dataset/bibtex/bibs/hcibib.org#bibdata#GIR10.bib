%X The performance of some tasks in Information Retrieval is strongly related
to the extent and quality of the geographic knowledge about named places. This
paper presents a conceptualization of the geographic knowledge, the Geo-Net
vocabulary, and a tool for building large knowledge bases of named places, the
GKB management system, developed in the GREASE-II project. The Geo-Net
vocabulary is a conceptual model for describing geographic places, including
their names, types, relationships and footprints. It uses URIs and the RDF data
model to expose, share and connect pieces of geographic knowledge each other
and to related data on the Web. The GKB system is a multi-paradigm knowledge
management system that enables the development of geographic ontologies with
the Geo-Net vocabulary. This paper also presents a geographic ontology of
Portugal, Geo-Net-PT 02, created with the Geo-Net vocabulary and the GKB
system.

on geocoding toponyms and route descriptions in these accounts. Mountaineering
accounts contain a wealth of geographic information but its extraction for
purposes of geographic information retrieval poses specific challenges, in

those mentioned in descriptions of panoramas. We describe some preliminary
considerations for natural language cues to distinguish between these two types
of occurrences.

study, 13 topics from the GeoCLEF topics 2005-2008 aiming at documents on
rivers, oceans, or sea names were selected and the corresponding relevant
documents retrieved and manually annotated.
   Results of the geographic annotation indicate that i) topics aiming at
locations close to water contain a wide variety of spatial relations (indicated
by different prepositions), ii) unnamed locations can be generated on-the-fly
by referring to movable objects (e.g. ships, planes) travelling along a path,
iii) underspecified regions are referenced by proximity or distance or
directional relations. In addition, several generic expressions (e.g. "in
international waters") are frequently used, but refer to different
underspecified regions.

associating a place type with its typical service types, which is reflected in
the ontology construction methodology. Preliminary results, as well as an

%X Geotagging is the process of recognizing textual references to geographic
locations, known as toponyms, and resolving these references by assigning each
lat/long values. Typical geotagging algorithms use a variety of heuristic
evidence to select the correct interpretation for each toponym. A study is
presented of one such heuristic which aids in recognizing and resolving lists
of toponyms, referred to as comma groups. Comma groups of toponyms are
recognized and resolved by inferring the common threads that bind them
together, based on the toponyms' shared geographic attributes. Three such
common threads are proposed and studied -- population-based prominence,
distance-based proximity, and sibling relationships in a geographic hierarchy
-- and examples of each are noted. In addition, measurements are made of these
comma groups' usage and variety in a large dataset of news articles, indicating
that the proposed heuristics, and in particular the proximity and sibling
heuristics, are useful for resolving comma group toponyms.

this paper is the evaluation of georesolution and we discuss evaluation methods

%X Most geographic queries include references to entities (geographic and
non-geographic). Grounding such entities is essential to properly understand
the user's information need. As statistical-based query reformulation
strategies work at term level, not entity level, they don't use the semantic
information given by such entities, which is considerably relevant for the
types of queries that should be handled by GIR systems. We motivate the need of
a semantic-flavored query reformulation approach for geographic information
retrieval systems and describe a GIR architecture where query reformulation
focuses on i) grounding entities in the query, ii) selecting a reasoning
strategy according to the user information need, and iii) generating a
reformulated query containing answers and related entities for a more focused
retrieval step. Reformulated queries obtain the answers by accessing a
knowledge base.

%X In the present world scenario, where the search engines wars are becoming
fiercer than ever, it becomes necessary for each search engine to realize the
intent of the user query to be able to provide him with more relevant search
results. Amongst the various categories of search queries, a major portion is
constituted by those having news intent. Seeing the tremendous growth of social
media users, the spatial-temporal nature of the media can prove to be a very
useful tool to improve the search quality. In our work we examine the
development of such a tool that combines social media in improving the quality
of web search and predicting whether the user is looking for news or not. We go
one step beyond the previous research by mining Twitter messages, assigning
weights to them and determining keywords that can be added to the search query
to act as pointers to the existing search engine algorithms suggesting to it
that the user is looking for news. We conduct a series of experiments and show
the impact that TWinner has on the results.

%X Tags clouds are a well-established concept for organizing and visualizing
large amounts of user-generated content annotated with keywords. Applied on
mobile devices, so-called 'ambient tag clouds' which are based on surrounding
georeferenced and tagged resources may act as compact location descriptors.
This paper presents our on-going work towards more expressive ambient tag
clouds. By analyzing locative textual Web content, such representations
summarizing available background information can be generated without
explicitly assigned tags. Thus, these ambient tag clouds enable the mobile
exploration of a place's semantic beyond visible objects and common
points-of-interest.

%X Obtaining or approximating a geographic location for search results often
motivates users to include place names and other geography-related terms in
their queries. Previous work shows that queries that include geography-related
terms correspond to a significant share of the users' demand. Therefore, it is
important to recognize the association of documents to places in order to
adequately respond to such queries. This paper describes strategies for text
classification into geography-related categories, using evidence extracted from
Wikipedia. We use terms that correspond to entry titles and the connections
between entries in Wikipedia's graph to establish a semantic network from which
classification features are generated. Results of experiments using a news
data-set, classified over Brazilian states, show that such terms constitute
valid evidence for the geographical classification of documents, and
demonstrate the potential of this technique for text classification.

no large collection of informal place names associated with type and footprint
data is currently available to the GIR community. The present contribution
discusses the implementation of a web platform to collect such an evaluation
data set. Design considerations of the user interface are addressed and we
present first results of a nationwide attempt to collect the vernacular place
names of Great Britain. Our result will aid further research in automatic

show that frequent toponyms are usually less ambiguous than rare toponyms. The
resolution of ambiguities on a sample of 1,042 toponyms with different features
confirms that ambiguous toponyms are spatially autocorrelated.

%X In the past couple of years, there have been significant advances in the
areas of temporal information retrieval (TIR) and geographic information
retrieval (GIR), each focusing on extracting and utilizing temporal and
geographic information, respectively, from documents for search and exploration
tasks. Interestingly, there is only little work that combines models,
techniques and applications from these two areas to support scenarios and
applications where temporal and geographic information in combination provide
interesting meaningful nuggets in document exploration tasks, such as
visualizing a chronological sequence of events with their locations.
   In this paper, we present an approach that combines the two areas of TIR and
GIR. Using temporal and geographic information extracted from documents and
recorded in temporal and geographic document profiles, we show how
co-occurrences of such information are determined and spatio-temporal document
profiles are computed. Such profiles then provide the basis for a variety of
document search and exploration tasks, such as visualizing the sequences of
events on a map. We present a prototypical implementation of our system and
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GIR and TIR in the context of
document exploration tasks.

%X Georeferenced data are a key factor in many decision-making systems.
However, their interpretation is user and context dependent so that, for each
situation, data analysts have to interpret them, a time-consuming task. One
approach to alleviate this task, is the use of semantic annotations to store
the produced information. Annotating data is however hard to perform and prone
to errors, especially when executed manually. This difficulty increases with
the amount of data to annotate. Moreover, annotation requires
multi-disciplinary collaboration of researchers, with access to heterogeneous
and distributed data sources and scientific computations. This paper
illustrates our solution to approach this problem by means of a case study in
agriculture. It shows how our implementation of a framework to automate the
annotation of geospatial data can be used to process real data from remote
sensing images and other official Brazilian data sources.

goal is to design and apply machine learning methods to automatically learn a

growing research area, addressing the retrieval of textual documents according
to geographic criteria of relevance. In this paper, we explore the usage of a
learning to rank approach for geographic information retrieval, leveraging on
the datasets made available in the context of the previous GeoCLEF evaluation
campaigns. The idea is to combine different metrics of textual and geographic
similarity into a single ranking function, through the use of the SV Mmap
framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform
baselines based on heuristic combinations of features.
