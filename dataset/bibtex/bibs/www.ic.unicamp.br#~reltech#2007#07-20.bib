       Groupware scheduling is an essential and continuous
       activity. Complexities on conciliating schedules of several
       people make proper time management a challenge. It involves
       sophisticated communication mechanisms to support information
       sharing and scheduling negotiation among users of diverse
       systems. Also, scheduling on group demands application support
       to deal with over-constrained schedules and rescheduling, but
       such needs have not yet been fulfilled. Based on a review of
       past approaches for this problem, their successes and failures,
       new approaches for groupware scheduling are presented. The
       development of calendaring and scheduling protocols is
       reviewed, as well as the application of promising techniques on
       the fields of optimization, artificial intelligence and
       mixed-initiative interfaces. Towards a new generation of more
       intelligent and powerful groupware scheduling tools that will
       increase productivity by minimizing coordination effort, a
       multidisciplinary application of knowledge from these areas is
       proposed.
