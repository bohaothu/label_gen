 abstract = {
Location awareness is a key ingredient to many applications of mobile
devices. Devices with the ability to determine their own position can
retrieve, filter or present information depending on this position in
space. There are, however two different ways to view this situation
resulting in different distributions of computational resources. We
argue that in many cases it will be better and easier to put some
computational effort and design wits into the environment and
infrastructure than into the actual mobile device. In this sense we
claim that there should be more artificial intelligence around mobile
devices than in them.},
