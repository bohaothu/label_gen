  abstract = {Due to their light weight, low power, and practically unlimited identification
	capacity, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and associated
	devices offer distinctive advantages and are widely recognized for
	their promising potential in context-aware computing; by tagging
	objects with RFID tags, the environment can be sensed in a cost-
	and energy-efficient means. However, a prerequisite to fully realizing
	the potential is accurate localization of RFID tags, which will enable
	and enhance a wide range of applications. In this paper we show how
	to exploit the phase difference between two or more receiving antennas
	to compute accurate localization. Phase difference based localization
	has better accuracy, robustness and sensitivity when integrated with
	other measurements compared to the currently popular technique of
	localization using received signal strength. Using a software-defined
	radio setup, we show experimental results that support accurate localization
	of RFID tags and activity recognition based on phase difference.},

	Problem}},
  journal = {INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING},
  year = {2009},
  pages = {ijoc.1080.0315},
  abstract = {Given a set [A] of m points in n-dimensional space with corresponding
	positive weights, the weighted Euclidean one-center problem, which
	is a generalization of the minimum enclosing ball problem, involves
	the computation of a point c[A] [isin] [R]n that minimizes the maximum
	weighted Euclidean distance from c[A] to each point in [A]. In this
	paper, given {epsilon} > 0, we propose and analyze an algorithm that
	computes a (1 + {epsilon})-approximate solution to the weighted Euclidean
	one-center problem. Our algorithm explicitly constructs a small subset
	[X] [subE] [A], called an {epsilon}-core set of [A], for which the
	optimal solution of the corresponding weighted Euclidean one-center
	problem is a close approximation to that of [A]. In addition, we
	establish that |[X]| depends only on {epsilon} and on the ratio of
	the smallest and largest weights, but is independent of the number
	of points m and the dimension n. This result subsumes and generalizes
	the previously known core set results for the minimum enclosing ball
	problem. Our algorithm computes a (1 + {epsilon})-approximate solution
	to the weighted Euclidean one-center problem for [A] in [O] (mn|[X]|)
	arithmetic operations. Our computational results indicate that the
	size of the {epsilon}-core set computed by the algorithm is, in general,
	significantly smaller than the theoretical worst-case estimate, which
	contributes to the efficiency of the algorithm, especially for large-scale
	instances. We shed some light on the possible reasons for this discrepancy
	between the theoretical estimate and the practical performance.},

  abstract = {Finding the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of a query point, or a set of
	query points (kNN-Join) are fundamental problems in many application
	domains. Many previous efforts to solve these problems focused on
	spatial databases or stand-alone systems, where changes to the database
	engine may be required, which may limit their application on large
	data sets that are stored in a relational database management system.
	Furthermore, these methods may not automatically optimize kNN queries
	or kNN-Joins when additional query conditions are specified. In this
	work, we study both the kNN query and the kNN-Join in a relational
	database, possibly augmented with additional query conditions. We
	search for relational algorithms that require no changes to the database
	engine. The straightforward solution uses the user-defined-function
	(UDF) that a query optimizer cannot optimize.We design algorithms
	that could be implemented by SQL operators without changes to the
	database engine, hence enabling the query optimizer to understand
	and generate tht 
	
	
	yienn. Using only a small constant number of random shifts for databases
	in any fixed dimension, our approach guarantees to find the approximate
	kNN with only logarithmic number of page accesses in expectation
	with a constant approximation ratio and it could be extended to find
	the exact kNN efficiently in any fixed dimension. Our design paradigm
	easily supports the kNN-Join and updates. Extensive experiments on
	large, real and synthetic, data sets confirm the efficiency and practicality
	of our approach.},

  abstract = {Given a set of points P and a query point q, the reverse furthest
	neighbor (Rfn) query fetches the set of points p isin P such that
	q is their furthest neighbor among all points in PU{q}. This is the
	monochromatic Rfn (Mrfn) query. Another interesting version of Rfn
	query is the bichromatic reverse furthest neighbor (Brfn) query.
	Given a set of points P, a query set Q and a query point q isin Q,
	a Brfn query fetches the set of points p isin P such that q is the
	furthest neighbor of p among all points in Q. The Rrfn query has
	many interesting applications in spatial databases and beyond. For
	instance, given a large residential database (as P) and a set of
	potential sites (as Q) for building a chemical plant complex, the
	construction site should be selected as the one that has the maximum
	number of reverse furthest neighbors. This is an instance of the
	Brfn query. This paper presents the challenges associated with such
	queries and proposes efficient, R-tree based algorithms for both
	monochromatic and bichromatic versions of the Rrfn queries. We analyze
	properties of the Rrfn query that differentiate it from the widely
	studied reverse nearest neighbor queries and enable the design of
	novel algorithms. Our approach takes advantage of the furthest Voronoi
	diagrams as well as the convex hulls of either the data set P (in
	the Mrfn case) or the query set Q (in the Brfn case). For the Brfn
	queries, we also extend the analysis to the situation when Q is large
	in size and becomes disk-resident. Experiments on both synthetic
	and real data sets confirm the efficiency and scalability of proposed
	algorithms over the brute-force search based approach.},
