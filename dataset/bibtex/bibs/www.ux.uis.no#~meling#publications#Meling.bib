    {We present the design and implementation of a replication
    management framework for partition-aware applications based on
    Jgroup. Jgroup offers an extension to Java RMI based on the group
    communication paradigm, enabling development of dependable
    applications in partitionable distributed systems. The replication
    management framework simplifies the development of fault tolerant
    applications by providing exchangeable replica distribution schemes
    and application specific recovery strategies. The framework is
    extensible to several replication and recovery strategies. The only
    user interaction required is the creation and removal of object
    groups, i.e., enabling autonomous replication management.}
