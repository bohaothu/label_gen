	abstract = {Herbert Blumer?s writings on the relationship between movies and sex ? including a ?private monograph? that has only recently resurfaced ? represent politically provocative and historically important studies, works that make up a substantial portion of Blumer?s early sociological output. These works, however, have largely receded from the view of American sociologists concerned with Blumer?s methodology and theoretical perspective. Yet their reconsideration, as I will attempt to demonstrate, can shed new light on his early sociological practice, and particularly on the seeming disconnect between his practical and theoretical invocations of scientific authority. By reading the material on the movies and sex alongside Blumer?s more polished and theoretically interesting publications, we can see how his later and more developed figuration of sociological authority amounted to an implicit repudiation of his earlier sociological practice. The insights of such a consideration, however, need not be limited to a reassessment of Blumer?s own sociological trajectory. Bearing in mind both their historical and political context, we can see in Blumer?s studies of the movies a set of more general tensions bound up in the relationship between empirical investigations and cultural authority, social science and public sociology.

	abstract = {This paper presents and analyzes four approaches to the use of participatory action research (PAR), a form of experiential learning, in the university classroom. Two of the courses described could fairly be classified as service learning, while the other two entail the use of (PAR) primarily as an object of teaching and secondarily as a pedagogical vehicle for the learning of sociological concepts, theories, and investigative methods. After reviewing the empirical and pedagogical literature on experiential learning and PAR, the authors present their respective courses as case studies distinct points on an ideal type continuum of experiential learning. Following this, they elucidate common challenges and resources in the development and implementation of PAR courses. Finally, they reflect on their experience generating intended and unintended (and unfavorable) outcomes using PAR in the classroom. A discussion of how PAR advances ?public sociology? concludes the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

	abstract = {This paper examines the space of media intellectuals, as a crucial site where public sociology happens. We begin by defining three main characteristics of the media intellectual, as an ideal type. Next, we look at the relationship between media intellectuals and academics. We argue that media intellectuals occupy a boundary zone between the journalistic field and the academic field. This boundary zone is defined by a structural contradiction; while columnists write from a position of absolute privilege in the journalistic field, academic media intellectuals write from a position of relative disadvantage and suspicion within the academic field. This creates significant disincentives for academics to participate in the space of media intellectuals, and it presents a significant challenge for the project of public sociology. There is, however, an alternative strategy available within the academic field, which is more consistent with the project of public sociology. After outlining this alternative strategy, we end the paper with a preliminary analysis of op-eds in the New York Times. While columnists dominate the op-ed page, academic social scientists and law faculty have a strong presence, which appears to be increasing. These findings present interesting challenges and opportunities for public sociology in the media. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper focuses primarily on older-child (i.e., non-infant) and sibling-group adoptions. The author asks: What does it take to increase the chances that an adoptee will fit well and function effectively in his/her/their new family? Connversely, what factors put family functioning at risk and increase the probability of disruption? She frames the answer in the context of an examination of the empirical literature-especially on older-child and sibling-group domestic adoptions, as well as on survey data she obtained from parents who adopted one or more children internationally-primarily from Russia and other Eastern European countries. Available empirical evidence indicates that the answer to the question depends on several categories of factors: Primary among them are 1) Adequate Pre-Adoption Preparation: A thorough grounding in the issues and risk factors involved in adopting an older, special needs child is paramount. 2) Information: The accuracy and completeness of all information known, and shared, about the child/children before pre-adoptive parents agree to the adoption. 3) The Likelihood of Long-Term Problems in the New Family, Connected to Factors Related to the Child’s Pre-Adoption History. 4) Adoptive Parents’ Expectations of What Family Life Will be Like Post-Placement in Comparison to What Family Life Is Really Like. 5) The Availability, or Lack, of Necessary Post- Adoption Services and Support for the Child/Children and the Family: Once the child/children are home and the "honeymoon" ends, what are the issues and how does s/he function in the new family? What services and support are available to the child and the family down the road? This paper is policy and practice-relevant and supports the ASA conference theme that sociological work needs to "transcend" academic boundaries and "engage wider audiences" in discourse about policy and practice shifts needed in older-child/special needs adoption, both...

	abstract = {This paper explores north south transnational organizing for economic justice, human rights, indigenous sovereignty, and women’s health and the tensions which emerge between grassroots movements, international actors, and NGOS in the context of Chiapas, Mexico. It identifies security as a multifaceted project with economic, political, social, health, cultural, gendered, and environmental dimensions, all of which are interconnected and embodied in indigenous organizing, accords, and worldview as collective rights and argues that security, in part, is forged through international and local NGO networking but fundamentally through grassroots movements which emphasize social justice, economic solidarity, popular democracy, and people-centered development. Activist, solidarity work informs the analysis of the case of Chiapas, Mexico, where threats to indigenous women’s security are rooted in neoliberal development, systemic racism, and sexism. Such threats manifest themselves in poverty, political exclusion, and militarization. It is perhaps in the arena of women’s health where the lethal intersection of these forces is demonstrated most forcefully. To challenge militarization, globalization, and political exclusion, a vibrant, global, civil society movement has been created, north and south. Personal experience with women’s transnational organizing and alliance building, models for solidarity, and key challenges to forming long term successful and sustainable relationships North and South are presented.

	abstract = {Reflecting on Michael Burawoy?s classificaton of sociology into professional, critical, policy, and public types, and the adoption of the latter as the theme of the ASA?s 99th Annual Meeting, in this paper I argue that the drive towards increasingly global and world-historical public sociologies may prove hazardous in the absence of a parallel emphasis on the development and practice of private inter/intrapersonal sociologies. This requires self-critical revisitation of our basic definitions and theories in sociology in order to develop unified theoretical frameworks that meet the challenges of understanding and practicing the dialectics of public and private social processes in the twenty-first century. We need to move beyond Newtonian definitions and theorizations of sociology and embrace new quantal sociological imaginations that integrally engage our macro and micro sociologies in favor of simultaneously world-historical and inter/intrapersonal frameworks. Public sociologies can not advance our theoretical and applied sociologies of what is or what can be in the absence of parallel efforts in invigorating our sociological imaginations in our private, inter/intrapersonal social landscapes. Although personal troubles can best be understood in relationship to broader public issues, the latter themselves can most effectively be addressed and resolved through the action of specific individual agencies who champion the need for broader socio-historical interpretation and change as deeply personal exercises in self-knowledge and self-liberation. As Mills reminded us, what sparks the sociological imagination is the meeting of public and private sociologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

In sociology, the division of ?knowledge power? ? that is, who defines, produces and consumes what knowledge where and how ? is routinely assumed more than problematized. This paper argues for a public sociology which works for a more democratic division of knowledge power, and particularly for bridging the yawning gap that exists between sociologists and larger, uninterested publics. The paper ends with proposals to build a more public sociology, including, among other things, reform in tenure requirements and graduate training, and the development of visual sociology, deliberative democracy, and a popular magazine Sociology Today.

In this paper, we look at how the use of public funding for new professional sports stadiums is a prime example of the need for a public sociology. Approximately \$10 billion of public money have gone toward sports stadiums since the 1980s (Keating, 1999), while urban areas suffer through rising inequality and inadequately funded social services. We argue that ?local growth coalitions? are a driving force to build new stadiums with public money, even in the face of evidence that it is not a particularly wise investment. Stadium building has become part of the accepted ?growth strategy? of many local growth coalitions in their efforts to revitalize cities. We suggest this policy is misguided and may contribute to rising inequality. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },
