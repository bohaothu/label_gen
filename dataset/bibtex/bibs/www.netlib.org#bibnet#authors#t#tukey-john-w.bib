%%%                        Tukey is believed to have worked on
%%%                        cryptographic analysis of German Enigma codes
%%%                        during World War II, but there is (as yet) no
%%%                        published evidence of that work in this
%%%                        bibliography. He was also involved in the
%%%                        design of the US U2 spy plane in the early
%%%                        1950s (McCullagh:2003:JWT, page 542).
%%%
%%%                        Tukey served as scientific advisor to US
%%%                        Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and
%%%                        Nixon, and a 1965 report that he wrote
%%%                        (Tukey:1965:RQO) led the US Congress to
%%%                        create the Environmental Protection Agency
%%%                        (EPA).  His 1976 report (Tukey:1976:HEE)
%%%                        confirmed the threat of halocarbons to ozone
%%%                        in the stratosphere.
%%%
%%%                        Tukey chaired the National Research Council
%%%                        (NRC) Committee on Impacts of Stratospheric
%%%                        Change (1975--1979), which was convened to
%%%                        study the 1974 report by Molina and Rowland
%%%                        on the catalytic destruction of atmospheric
%%%                        ozone by certain stable fluorohydrocarbons
%%%                        used in aerosol propellants and refrigerants.
%%%                        Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland received the
%%%                        1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their
%%%                        important work on the ozone layer:

%%%                        Tukey developed statistical tools for

%%%                        Tukey received the S. S. Wilks award of the
%%%                        American Statistical Association in 1965,

%%%                        US National Medal of Science in 1973.
%%%
%%%                        Although Tukey preferred colored pens and
%%%                        paper to computers, he was influential in
%%%                        the design of the S programming language
%%%                        at Bell Laboratories; its modern descendants
%%%                        are the languages S-Plus and R.
%%%
%%%                        Tukey was a proponent of graphical techniques
%%%                        for understanding data, and he invented many
%%%                        such, including stem-and-leaf plots and
%%%                        box-and-whiskers plots.
%%%
%%%                        Tukey was involved in the broadcast news
%%%                        analysis of US Presidential Election results.
%%%                        He also contributed to nine patents on
%%%                        information retrieval awarded to Xerox
%%%                        Corporation.
%%%
%%%                        Tukey is credited with coining the words
%%%                        `bit' (Shannon:1948:MTCa) and `software'
%%%                        (Tukey:1958:TCM).

%%%                        With James W. Cooley, he (re)discovered and

%%%                        The FFT surely ranks as one of the top
%%%                        computer algorithms of the Twentieth Century.
%%%                        A search for it in the MathSciNet database
%%%                        finds about 500 publications, and another in
%%%                        the EMS Zentralblatt database find almost
%%%                        600.  The IEEE eXplore database has more than
%%%                        8700 entries on DCT, DFT, FFT, and Fast
%%%                        Fourier Transform, and the ACM Portal
%%%                        database has more than 1500 for those search
%%%                        terms.  A Google search in 2011 turns up more
%%%                        than 15,000,000 references to the FFT in Web
%%%                        pages.  As described in the memoir
%%%                        (McCullagh:2003:JWT, bottom of page 548), the
%%%                        FFT was ``the major event of the decade in
%%%                        signal processing: up to that point, much of
%%%                        signal processing was done electronically by
%%%                        analogue devices; afterwards, all was
%%%                        digital''.
%%%
%%%                        It was John Tukey who realized that if the
%%%                        number of terms in the expansion, N, is
%%%                        itself a product of two integers, then a work
%%%                        reduction is possible for the numerical
%%%                        computation of the coefficients of the
%%%                        Fourier series.  In the case that N = 2**n,
%%%                        the reduction is dramatic: from N**2 to
%%%                        N * log2(N).  If N = 1000, the speedup is
%%%                        about 100, and if N = 1,000,000, the
%%%                        speedup is more than 50,000.
%%%
%%%                        Although there were many precursors of the
%%%                        Cooley/Tukey algorithm, they were usually
%%%                        less general, less widely known (the paper
%%%                        Cooley:1987:HFG discusses the reasons, one of
%%%                        which is ``do not publish papers in
%%%                        neo-classic Latin'' (especially after you're
%%%                        dead)), and the work reduction was not
%%%                        significant until computers became available.
%%%
%%%                        One widely-used application of the FFT is the
%%%                        special case of the DCT (discrete cosine
%%%                        transform) in the JPEG image compression
%%%                        algorithm, and implemented in digital cameras
%%%                        to reduce storage requirements.  One variant
%%%                        of the MPEG video-compression algorithm
%%%                        family also uses the DCT, and thus the FFT is
%%%                        possibly used in all digital television
%%%                        broadcasting.
%%%
%%%                        The FFT is one of several methods in computer
%%%                        science known as divide-and-conquer
%%%                        algorithms, the first of which was Tony
%%%                        Hoare's 1961 discovery of the famous
%%%                        Quicksort algorithm family (Hoare:1961:AF,
%%%                        Hoare:1961:AP, Hoare:1961:AQ).
%%%
%%%                        Tukey's collected works fill eight volumes,
%%%                        all published during his lifetime so that he
%%%                        could comment on them (see

  abstract =     "The integral representing the intensity distribution
                 of x-ray [sic] diffraction in liquids can be evaluated
                 by the method of trigonometric interpolation instead of
                 approximating the integral by the sum of a large number
                 of terms. This reduces considerably the number of
                 ordinates required in the calculation without
                 decreasing the accuracy. As an example, the diffraction
                 patterns of vitreous selenium and liquid KCl and LiCI,
                 obtained and analyzed by K. Lark-Horovitz and E. P.
                 Miller, have been interpreted. For the curves so far
                 analyzed, 36 ordinates were found to be sufficient.
                 Owing to symmetry properties the Fourier coefficients
                 can be found with a minimum of calculation. This yields
                 directly the value of the distribution function in
                 discrete equidistant points. The value of the function
                 for any intermediate point may then be determined in a
                 simple manner by pure calculation. The resulting curves
                 agree very closely with those obtained by Lark-Horovitz
                 and Miller.",

  abstract =     "Some time ago the writer reported (1949) on an
                 empirical approximation to the upper 5\% point of
                 Fisher's B distribution, the distribution of the square
                 root of a non-central $\chi^2$ comparing the
                 approximation with certain of the exact, values given
                 by Fisher (1928) and suggesting that the empirical
                 formula might be useful for moderate extrapolation . At
                 about the same time Patnaik (1949), and later Abdel-Aty
                 (1954), studied the problem of approximating the
                 distribution of non-central $\chi^2$. Through the
                 efforts and courtesy of Dr. B. I. Harley, of University
                 College, it is now possible to present a comparative
                 table of the results of various approximations,
                 including the streamlined use of moment-fitted Pearson
                 curves by the aid of Table 42 of the new Biometrika
                 tables (Pearson \& Hartley, 1954).\par

                 While the empirical approximation is restricted to the
                 upper 5\% point, only the moment-fitting approach seems
                 likely to give more accurate values in the range
                 considered. Because of its simplicity, the empirical
                 formula may prove useful.",

                 forced statisticians to combine security and
                 insecurity. The ASA is 10/8 century old; about 5/8 ago
                 algebra began to appear in statistician's Journals.
                 Only 2/8 ago came the programmable calculator. Today
                 ``software'', connecting ``hardware'' to both data and
                 ``brainware'', offers statistics far more than most
                 statisticians realize,. They offer us factories, not
                 just machines, and ought to be used flexibly, fluidly,

                 can be extended to configurations. Averaging over

                 configurations by using numerical integration. The
                 second stage ordinarily involves experimental sampling.

                 information retrieval tool. Objections to its use fall
                 into two main categories: first, that clustering is too
                 slow for large corpora (with running time often
                 quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that
                 clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We
                 argue that these problems arise only when clustering is
                 used in an attempt to improve conventional search
                 techniques. However, looking at clustering as an
                 information access tool in its own right obviates these
                 objections, and provides a powerful new access
                 paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that
                 employs document clustering as its primary operation.
                 We also present fast (linear time) clustering
                 algorithms which support this interactive browsing
                 paradigm.",

                 computing complex Fourier transform and have shown
                 major time savings in using it to compute large
                 transforms on a digital computer. With $n$ a power of
                 two, computing time for this algorithm is proportional
                 to $n \log_2 n$, a major improvement over other methods
                 with computing time proportional to $n^2$. In this
                 paper, the fast Fourier transform algorithm is briefly
                 reviewed and fast difference equation methods for
                 accurately computing the needed trigonometric function
                 values are given. The problem of computing a large
                 Fourier transform on a system with virtual memory is
                 considered, and a solution is proposed. This method has
                 been used to compute complex Fourier transforms of size
                 $n = 2^{16}$ on a computer with $2^{15}$ words of core
                 storage; this exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum
                 radix two transform size with fixed allocation of this
                 amount of core storage. The method has also been used
                 to compute large mixed radix transforms. A scaling plan

                 fixed-point arithmetic is also given.",

                 of the real world. His life's work consisted largely in
                 discovering how to collect and analyze data. As he
                 learned, he gladly taught us ways of coping with a
                 world in which there was not only uncertainty but
                 uncertainty about uncertainty. As an academic couple,
                 John and Elizabeth Tukey achieved the highest standards

  abstract =     "Bayes' rule appears to be a straightforward, one-line
                 theorem: by updating our initial beliefs with objective
                 new information, we get a new and improved belief. To
                 its adherents, it is an elegant statement about
                 learning from experience. To its opponents, it is
                 subjectivity run amok. In the first-ever account of
                 Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch
                 McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the
                 human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its
                 discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s
                 through its development into roughly its modern form by
                 French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why
                 respected statisticians rendered it professionally
                 taboo for 150 years --- at the same time that
                 practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving
                 great uncertainty and scanty information, even breaking
                 Germany's Enigma code during World War II, and explains
                 how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in
                 the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes'
                 rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland
                 Security. Drawing on primary source material and
                 interviews with statisticians and other scientists, The
                 Theory That Would Not Die is the riveting account of
                 how a seemingly simple theorem ignited one of the
                 greatest controversies of all time.",

                 world's most distinguished statisticians to discuss a
                 wide array of the most important recent developments in
                 data analysis. The book honors John W. Tukey, one of
                 the most influential statisticians of the twentieth
                 century, on the occasion of his eightieth birthday.
                 Contributors, some of them Tukey's former students, use
                 his general theoretical work and his specific
                 contributions to Exploratory Data Analysis as the point
                 of departure for their papers. They cover topics from
                 ``pure'' data analysis, such as gaussianizing
                 transformations and regression estimates, and from
                 ``applied'' subjects, such as the best way to rank the
                 abilities of chess players or to estimate the abundance
                 of birds in a particular area.\par

                 Tukey may be best known for coining the common computer
                 term ``bit,'' for binary digit, but his broader work
                 has revolutionized the way statisticians think about
                 and analyze sets of data. In a personal interview that
                 opens the book, he reviews these extraordinary
                 contributions and his life with characteristic modesty,
                 humor, and intelligence. The book will be valuable both
                 to researchers and students interested in current
                 theoretical and practical data analysis and as a
                 testament to Tukey's lasting influence.\par
