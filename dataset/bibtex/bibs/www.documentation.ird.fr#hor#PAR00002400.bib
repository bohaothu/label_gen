  abstract = {{A}erosol concentrations in the {S}outhern {H}emisphere are largely undersampled. {T}his study presents a chemical and physical description of dust particles collected on board research vessels in the southeast {P}acific ({SEPS}) and the {S}outhern {O}cean ({SOKS}). {C}oncentrations of dust were 6.1 +/- 2.4 ng m(-3) for {SEPS} and 13.0 +/- 6.3 ng m(-3) for {SOKS}. {D}ust fluxes, derived from those concentrations, were 9.9 +/- 3.7 mg m(-2) d(-1) for {SEPS} and 38 +/- 14 mg m(-2) d(-1) for {SOKS} and are shown to be representative of actual fluxes in those areas. {D}ust and iron deposition are up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than former predictions. {A} map of dust deposition on the {S}outhern {H}emisphere is proposed by incorporating those in situ measurements into a dust model. {T}his study confirms that dust deposition is not the dominant source of iron to the large high-nutrient low-chlorophyll {S}outhern {O}cean.},
