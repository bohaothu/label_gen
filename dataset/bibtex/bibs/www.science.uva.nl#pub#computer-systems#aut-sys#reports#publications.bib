 ABSTRACT = {In this paper we present a graphical model for polyphonic music
transcription. Our model, formulated as a Dynamical Bayesian
Network, embodies a transparent and computationally tractable
approach to this acoustic analysis problem. An advantage of our
approach is that it places emphasis on explicitly modelling the sound
generation procedure. It provides a clear framework in which both
high level (cognitive) prior information on music structure can be
coupled with low level (acoustic physical) information in a
principled manner to perform the analysis. The model is a special
case of the, generally intractable, Switching Kalman Filters.
Where possible, we derive, exact polynomial time inference
procedures, and otherwise efficient approximations. We argue that our
generative model based approach is computationally feasible for many music
applications
and is readily extensible to more general auditory scene analysis
scenarios.}

  allows a multiagent system to learn where and how to coordinate.
  The method starts with uncoordinated learners and maintains
  statistics on expected returns.  Coordination dependencies are
  dynamically added if the statistics indicate a statistically
  significant benefit. This results in a compact state representation
  because only necessary coordination is modeled.  We apply our method
  within the framework of coordination graphs in which value rules
  represent the coordination dependencies between the agents for a
  specific context.  The algorithm is first applied on a small
  illustrative problem, and next on a large predator-prey problem in
  which two predators have to capture a single prey.}

  abstract = {Within a group of cooperating agents the decision
  making of an individual agent depends on the actions of the
  other agents. In dynamic environments, these dependencies will
  change rapidly as a result of the continuously changing state.
  Via a context-specific decomposition of the problem into smaller
  subproblems, coordination graphs offer scalable solutions to the
  problem of multiagent decision making. In this work, we apply
  coordination graphs to a continuous (robotic) domain by assigning
  roles to the agents and then coordinating the different roles.
  Moreover, we demonstrate that, with some additional assumptions,
  an agent can predict the actions of the other agents, rendering
  communication superfluous. We have successfully implemented the
  proposed method into our UvA Trilearn simulated robot soccer team
  which won the RoboCup-2003 World Championship in Padova, Italy. },

 ABSTRACT    = {We review the essential ideas of Bayesian
polyphonic pitch identification with simple examples. We describe
a signal model and  a simple greedy algorithm to infer the
pitch classes in a sound mixture with unknown number of notes. An important
advantage of our approach is that it provides a clear framework in which
both
high level prior information on music structure can be
coupled with low level acoustic-physical knowledge in a
principled manner to perform the analysis.}

                robust method for finding the position of a local mode (local

                robust algorithm is given here that presents a natural extension
                of the 'mean-shift' procedure. The new algorithm simultaneously
                estimates the position of the local mode and the covariance matrix
                that describes the approximate shape of the local mode. We apply
                the new method to develop a new 5-degrees of freedom (DOF) color
                histogram based non-rigid object tracking algorithm.},

                to model multivariate data: the selection of the number of
                components and the initialization. In this paper we propose an
                on-line (recursive) algorithm that estimates the parameters of the
                mixture and that simultaneously selects the number of components.
                The new algorithm starts with a large number of randomly
                initialized components. A prior is used as a bias for maximally
                structured models. A stochastic approximation recursive learning
                algorithm is proposed to search for the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
                solution and to discard the irrelevant components.},

  abstract   = {For a flexible camera-to-camera tracking of multiple objects we
                model the object's behavior with a Bayesian network and combine it
                with the multiple hypothesis framework that associates observations with
                objects. Bayesian networks offer a possibility to factor complex,
                joint distributions into a product of intuitive conditional densities
                describing and predicting the object's path. Yet, these models do not
                distinguish unambiguously between the object's observations. The resulting
                uncertainty is explored by a multiple hypothesis evaluation. The paper
                provides experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed method.

                measurements (targets) are assumed. A set of globally uncorrelated
                features of the original sensor measurements are obtained by applying
                principal component analysis on the target set. A parametrized model of
                the conditional density function of the sensor features given the robot
                positions is built based on an unbiased estimation procedure that fits
                interpolants for both the mean and the variance of each feature
                independently. The simulation results show that the average Bayesian

                the extraction of relevant features from the raw measurements to be
                used by the robot for self-localization. Recently, a Bayesian

                localization that is based on information-theoretic concepts and that
                is more efficient to compute, and we compare with the localization
                error criterion. We discuss the case of linear projection with PCA and
                carry out an analysis thereof. Finally, we show experimental results
                for supervised data obtained by a real robot in a typical office

  abstract   = {For navigation to a desired state, a mobile robot needs some sort of global 
                information about the environment it is operating in. Usually this is provided 
                in the form of a map, giving locations of objects and free space in the working 
                space of the robot. Such a map can be provided by the programmer or learned by 
                the system itself. In this paper an approach is described where the global 
                information is not cast in a model of the geometry of the environment but in a 
                model of all sensory data of the robot. Experimental results are presented.},

  abstract   = {Estimation of image motion, also known as the optic flow, from a 
                sequence of images is known to be difficult. This is due to: the sensitivity of 
                the image motion model to noise (the derivative property), the limited 
                observability of the image motion from the luminance (the aperture problem), 
                and, the non-validity of the optic flow constraint (the assumption of intensity 
                conservation). In this paper we analyze measures that assign a confidence value 
                to the estimated image motion: the sensitivity of the model to noise, the 
                validity of the model and the estimated variance of the image motion. 
                Experiments show that selection of image motion vectors based on these measures 
                dramatically  improve the estimates of the image motion while keeping as 
                much image motion vectors as possible. We conclude that the 
                proposed estimated variance of the image motion optimizes 
                this trade-off.},

                scales, and somehow leads to behavior such as the parallel parking maneuver, the 
                three-point turn, free Euclidean driving in a desert, following a road, and 
                translationally passing other vehicles at high speed. In the study of autonomous 
                systems, it is desirable to find a representation in which such different 
                behaviors of a system can related to each other, and to find precisely how and under what 
                conditions a change of representation and corresponding choice of motions occurs.
                In this paper, we formulate an abstraction mechanism based on
                approximations of flows of commutators of vector fields.
                We apply it to the goal-directed motion of a car and show 
                how the environmental constraints induce, through this 
                abstraction mechanism, a recognizable hierarchy of descriptions of the car's

  abstract   = {An ADS (Automatic Debiting System) is a toll-collecting system on a 
                freeway, which interacts with a transponder in each car, and subtracts a fee 
                from a credit card. Non-payers are to be photographed and fined. In requirements 
                on such systems in The Netherlands, privacy laws demand separation between the 
                financial transaction and the 
                registration; the system should not be usable for tracking 
                citizens. There are also very strict demands on performance, 
                with error rates of the order of $10^{-5}$ to minimize the 
                number of incorrect enforcements. Both demands combined 
                require complex ADS systems.  This paper describes a 
                simulation of the proposed ADS's of bidders, to be used for 
                their quantitative evaluation. It is highly important to 
                chose the proper level for the abstraction of the simulated 
                system, both to keep the simulation within reasonable cost 
                and time, and also to establish that the simulated system 
                indeed represents the actual proposal. In this paper, we 
                show how a consistent application of the concept of {\em 
                virtual sensors} can be applied to clarify the choice of 
                the proper level of abstraction for the ADS proposals, and 
                its implementation. It leads to a simulation that is faster, 
                but no less specific in its quantitative results than a full 
                implementation of the ADS.},

  abstract   = {Research in the psychology of music dealing with expression is often
                concerned with the discrete aspects of music performance, and mainly
                concentrates on the study of piano music (partly because of the ease with
                which piano music can be reduced to discrete note events). However, on
                other instruments, what happens during and in-between notes can be
                even more relevant then the realization of the note onsets and offsets, an
                issue not often addressed in music psychology. A noteworthy exception
                is the work of Seashore (1938) who pointed out the importance of
                continuous aspects in music performance. It is remarkable that, since
                these early exploratory studies, this field received little attention. A
                reason for this could be the relative inaccessibility for psychologists and
                musicologists of the data processing techniques needed. Another reason
                could be the sheer amount of information present in these modulation
                signals. Compared to discrete data there are many more degrees of
                freedom to explain. And finally, direct experimentation without a model is
                not likely to give results that go beyond the exploratory studies of
                Seashore and his colleagues. However, while the availability of current
                signal processing techniques makes the modulation signals (of e.g. pitch
                or dynamics) easier to extract, their shape is still quite complex. It is
                difficult to analyze and model them directly. In this presentation we
                describe an approach in which measured modulation signals (of pitch and
                amplitude) are modeled by a composition of idealized components using
                an analysis-by-synthesis method. This proposed decomposition can be
                formalized and verified using the notion of generalized time functions that
                was developed for the construction of control functions for sound
                synthesis (Desain & Honing, 1992; 1995). These functions describe
                abstract temporal behavior. Once modeled, the continuous behavior for
                each note and each transition can be expressed again as a discrete set of
                parameters, whose evolution over a series of notes can be linked to
                structural descriptions of the music. In this way we can adapt the
                methods developed specifically for discrete expressive attributes to the
                study of continuous aspects of musical expression. },

  abstract   = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a model-free tuning and adaptation
                method for control of dynamic systems. Contrary to supervised learning,
                based usually on gradient descent techniques, RL does not require any
                model or sensitivity function of the process. Hence, RL can be applied
                to systems that are poorly understood, uncertain, nonlinear or for other
                reasons untractable with conventional methods. In reinforcement learning,
                the overall controller performance is evaluated by a scalar measure, called
                reinforcement. Depending on the type of the control task, reinforcement may
                represent an evaluation of the most recent control action or, more often, of
                an entire sequence of past control moves. In the latter case, the RL system
                learns how to predict the outcome of each individual control action. This
                prediction is then used to adjust the parameters of the controller. The
                mathematical background of RL is closely related to optimal control and
                dynamic programming. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the RL
                methods and presents an application to the attitude control of a satellite.
                Some well known applications from the literature are reviewed as well.},

                OSCAR-robot manipulator has to track an object which moves arbitrarily
                on a table. The desired camera-joint mapping is approximated by a 
                feedforward neural network. Through the use of time derivatives of the
                position of the object and of the manipulator, the controller can inherently
                predict the next position of the moving target object. In this paper 
                several `anticipative' controllers are described, and successfully
                applied to track a moving object.},

                based on the reflection of a colour coded, Pseudo Random 
                Binary Array (PRBA), stimulus by the eye. The special 
                properties of the PRBA enable unique characterization 
                of positions both in the stimulus and in the reflected 
                image. This allows for a sophisticated surface 
                reconstruction. The shape of the cornea is described 
                by a set of tensor splines. Starting out from the 
                reflected image we are, assuming a shape for the cornea, 
                capable to calculate the associated stimulus
                pattern (backward raytracing). The best approximation of 
                the corneal shape is determined by minimizing the 
                difference between calculated and actual stimulus. To 
                allow interpretation of the data at the various stages 
                visualization is necessary. The processing of the data 
                falls into two steps: first using image processing 
                techniques - matched filters - the measured image is 
                transformed into a set of coordinates and subsequently 
                made into a graph, then the corneal shape is determined 
                by the minimization procedure outlined above.Visual 
                representation of the results at all intermediate stages 
                is necessary both in the development of the prototype 
                instrument and for the users of the instrument. We have 
                chosen IBM's Data Explorer as platform to develop the

                of incremental training for a feedforward network with a single 
                hidden layer. OIL is based on the idea to describe the output 
                weights (but not the hidden nodes) as a set of orthogonal basis 
                functions. Hidden nodes are treated just as the orthogonal 
                representation of the network in the output weights domain. 
                We showed that the network training can be performed incrementally, 
                one node at time, and there is no need to use an additional 
                constraint to support a consistent optimization among the hidden 
                nodes. An advantage of OIL over existing algorithms is extremely 
                fast learning. This approach can be also easily extended to 
                build-up incrementally an arbitrary function as a linear 
                composition of adjustable functions which are not necessarily 
                orthogonal. We tested this approach on a standard "two-spirals"

                We will mainly consider a mobile robot. We derive the collision

                This invariant couples the rotational velocity of the robot to 
                its translational velocity and is closely related to the 
                curvature of the mobile robot's path. We show that the spatial

                surfaces.  It generalizes the classical dilation, but is 
                invertible. It is shown that line segments are eigenfunctions 
                of this dilation, and are parallel-transported, and that 
                curvature is additive. We then present the slope transform 
                which is a re-representation of morphology onto the morphological
                eigenfunctions. As such, the slope transform provides for 
                tangential morphology the same analytical power as the Fourier 
                transform provides for linear signal processing. Under the 
                slope transform dilation becomes addition (just as under a 
                Fourier transform, convolution becomes multiplication). We 
                give a discrete slope transform suited for implementation, 
                and discuss the relationships to the Legendre transform, 
                Young-Fenchel conjugate, and A-transform. 
                We exhibit a logarithmic correspondence of this tangential 
                morphology to linear systems theory, and touch on the 
                consequences for morphological data analysis of a scanning

  abstract   = {A neural map algorithm has been employed
                to control a five-joint pneumatic robot arm
                and gripper through feedback from two video cameras.
                The pneumatically driven robot arm
                (SoftArm) employed in this investigation shares
                essential mechanical characteristics with skeletal
                muscle systems. To control the position of the arm,
                200 neurons formed a network representing the
                three-dimensional workspace embedded in a
                four-dimensional system of coordinates from the two
                cameras, and learned a three-dimensional set of
                pressures corresponding to the end effector
                positions, as well as a set of 3x4 Jacobian matrices
                for interpolating between these positions. The
                gripper orientation was achieved through adaptation
                of a 1x4 Jacobian matrix for a fourth joint.
                Because of the properties of the rubber-tube
                actuators of the SoftArm, the position as a function of
                supplied pressure is nonlinear, nonseparable, and
                exhibits hysteresis. Nevertheless, through the
                neural network learning algorithm the position could
                be controlled to an accuracy of about one pixel
                (3 mm) after two hundred learning steps and the
                orientation could be controlled to two pixels after
                eight hundred learning steps. This was achieved
                through employment of a linear correction
                algorithm using the Jacobian matrices mentioned above.
                Applications of repeated corrections in
                each positioning and grasping step leads to a very
                robust control algorithm since the Jacobians
                learned by the network have to satisfy the weak
                requirement that the Jacobian yields a reduction of
                the distance between gripper and target.},

                as the test case. One of the sources of the limit cycle

                a neural critic. In our approach, the estimated cost

                where no explicit model of the data is assumed.  Therefore, and

                of the training problem through use of orthogonal basis
                functions is not desirable.  The focus is on function

                Three feed-forward learning problems are tested with five methods.
                It is shown that, due to the fixed stepsize,
                standard error back-propagation performs well in
                avoiding local minima.  However, by using not only the

                my research in neural networks for robot arm
                control. 
                Simderella is intended to be a tool for speeding
                development of controllers for robot arms.
                Computational efficiency is essential for controllers,
                and can be best evaluated by separating
                controller and simulator processes. Such a separation
                facilitates code modularity and code migration
                to extant platforms connected to real robot arms. 
                The operation of the separate processes is synchronised
                by message passing. Under Unix, sockets
                are the most widely supported method for interprocess
                communication. For example, shell pipes are
                implemented using sockets. The three programs which
                constitute Simderella: connel, simmel, and
                bemmel, communicate over sockets. Connel is the
                controller, and should be programmed by the
                neural network experimenter. Simmel is the actual
                robot simulator, and calculates (among other
                things) the forward kinematics. Bemmel is an

  abstract   = {When a mobile robot moves around in an unknown world, without a way of 
                establishing its position, it needs to use its sensor data to navigate. The 
                common approach is to interpret the sensor data to a geometrical model of 
                the environment, and base the navigation and exploration 
                strategies on that model. In this paper, we attempt to 
                generate explorative motions based on the raw sensor data, 
                for the special, idealized  case of a robot with exact 
                noise-free distance sensors in a rectangular room. In the 
                space spanned by the sensor values, the environment is 
                represented by subsurface of a dimensionality equal to the 
                number of degrees of freedom of motion. Exploration is: 
                establishing this surface; navigation is: using it to 
                generate goal-directed motions.  We show that the approach 
                seems promising in simple cases, but touch on the 
                difficulties in extending it to more realistic situations, 
                arising from the awkward properties of the sensor space 
                subsurface in the general case: discontinuity, 
                self-intersection, and degeneracy.},

                mapping is approximated by feedforward neural networks. However, if the

                time to preprocess the visual information and to move the manipulator.
                Through the use of time derivatives of the position of the object and
                of the manipulator, the controller can inherently predict the
                next position of the object. In this paper several predictive
                controllers are proposed, and successfully applied to track a moving

  abstract   = {This paper focuses on static hand-eye
                coordination. The key issue that will be addressed is the
                construction of a controller that eliminates the need
                for calibration. Instead, the system should be
                self-learning and must be able to adapt itself to
                changes in the environment. In this application, only
                positional information in the system will be used; hence
                the above reference `static.'  Three
                coordinate domains are used to describe the system:
                the Cartesian world-domain, the vision
                domain, and the robot domain. The task that is set out
                to be solved is the following. A robot
                manipulator has to be positioned directly above a
                pre-specified target, such that it can be grasped.
                The target is specified in terms of visual parameters.
                Only the (x,y,z) position of the end-effector
                Only the (x,y,z) position of the end-effector
                relative to the target is taken into account; this
                suffices for many pick-and-place problems
                encountered in industry. (In a number of cases, also
                the rotation of the hand is of importance, but this
                rotation can be executed separate from the 3D
                positioning problem.) Thus the remaining problem is
                3 degrees-of-freedom (DoF).},

                for a function approximation by a feedforward network. The optimality
                is considered under the minimal learning time constraint for a given
                degree of accuracy which is an essential point for real-time learning.
                The approximation error is modeled as a function of the number of hidden
                units and the number of learning samples. Two models are presented:
                the first one is based on general bounds of approximation
                and the second one on an asymptotic expansion
                of the approximation error.
                This approach was applied to optimize the learning of
                the camera-robot mapping of a visually guided robot arm and
                a complex logarithm function approximation.
                The results of this investigation
                suggested that the actual approximation errors
                differ considerably from the theoretical upper bounds.},
