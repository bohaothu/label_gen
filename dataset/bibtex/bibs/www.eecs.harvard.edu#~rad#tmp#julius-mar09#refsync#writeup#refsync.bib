This is a collection of surveys of over 200 problems
of various areas of theoretical graph coloring.
It has a short survey on algorithms, mostly related to negative
complexity results.It has many surveys of generalizations and special
cases and is highly recommended for a theoretic background survey.

This article looks at coupling physical circuits together. Phase-locking
naturally occurs, but there are phase offsets that result somehow (I'm vague on
this) that are then mapped to colors. No theoretical results.
