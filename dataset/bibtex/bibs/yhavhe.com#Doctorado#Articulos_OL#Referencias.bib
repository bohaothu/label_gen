  abstract = {The promise of the Semantic Web is that future web pages will be annotated not only with bright colors and fancy fonts as they are now, but with annotation extracted from large domain ontologies that specify, to a computer in a way that it can exploit, what information is contained on the given web page. The presence of this information will allow software agents to examine pages and to make decisions about content as humans are able to do now. The classic method of building an ontology is to gather a committee of experts in the domain to be modeled by the ontology, and to have this committee agree on which concepts cover the domain, on which terms describe which concepts, on what relations exist between each concept and what the possible attributes of each concept are. All ontology learning systems begin with an ontology structure, which may just be an empty logical structure, and a collection of texts in the domain to be modeled. An ontology learning system can be seen as an interplay between three things: an existing ontology, a collection of texts, and lexical syntactic patterns. The Semantic Web will only be a reality if we can create structured, unambiguous ontologies that model domain knowledge that computers can handle. The creation of vast arrays of such ontologies, to be used to mark-up web pages for the Semantic Web, can only be accomplished by computer tools that can extract and build large parts of these ontologies automatically. This book provides the state-of-art of many automatic extraction and modeling techniques for ontology building. The maturation of these techniques will lead to the creation of the Semantic Web.}

The first perspective looks at methodologies that have been proposed to automatically extract information from texts and to give a structured organization to such knowledge, including approaches based on machine learning techniques. Then there are evaluation methods for ontology learning, aiming at defining procedures and metrics for a quantitative evaluation of the ontology learning task; and finally application scenarios that make ontology learning a challenging area in the context of real applications such as bio-informatics. According to the three perspectives mentioned above, the book is divided into three sections, each including a selection of papers addressing respectively the methods, the applications and the evaluation of ontology learning approaches.}

The OntoLT approach provides an environment for the integration of linguistic analysis in ontology engineering through the definition of mapping rules that map linguistic entities in annotated text collections to concept and attribute candidates (i.e. Protégé classes and slots). The paper ex-plains this approach in more detail and discusses some initial experiments on deriving a shallow ontology for the neurology domain from a corresponding collection of neurological scientific abstracts.}
