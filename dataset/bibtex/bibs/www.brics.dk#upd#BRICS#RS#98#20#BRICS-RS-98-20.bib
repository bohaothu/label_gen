  abstract = 	 "This paper is motivated by a link between
                  algebraic proof complexity and the
                  representation theory of the finite symmetric
                  groups. Our perspective leads to a series of
                  non-traditional problems in the representation
                  theory of $S_n$.\bibpar
                  
                  Most of our technical results concern the
                  structure of ``uniformly'' generated submodules
                  of permutation modules. We consider (for
                  example) sequences $W_n$ of submodules of the
                  permutation modules $M^{(n-k,1^k)}$ and prove
                  that if the modules $W_n$ are given in a
                  uniform way - which we make precise - the
                  dimension $p(n)$ of $W_n$ (as a vector space)
                  is a single polynomial with rational
                  coefficients, for all but finitely many
                  ``singular'' values of $n$. Furthermore, we
                  show that ${\rm dim}(W_n)<p(n)$ for each
                  singular value of $n \geq 4k$. The results have
                  a non-traditional flavor arising from the study
                  of the irreducible structure of the submodules
                  $W_n$ {\it beyond} isomorphism types.\bibpar
                  
                  We sketch the link between our structure
                  theorems and proof complexity questions, which
                  can be viewed as special cases of the famous
                  $NP$ vs. co-$NP$ problem in complexity theory.
                  In particular, we focus on the efficiency of
                  proof systems for showing membership in
                  polynomial ideals, for example, based on
                  Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.",
