  abstract	= {The complexity of solving parity games is an important
		  open problem in verification, automata theory, and
		  complexity theory. In this paper we develop an abstract
		  setting for studying parity games and related problems,
		  based on function optimization over certain discrete
		  structures. We introduce new classes of \emph{completely
		  local-global (CLG)} and \emph{recursively local-global
		  (RLG)} functions, and show that strategy evaluation
		  functions for parity games belong to these classes. We also
		  establish a relation to the previously well-studied
		  \emph{completely unimodal (CU)} and \emph{local-global}
		  functions. A number of nice properties of CLG-functions are
		  proved.
		  
		  In this setting, we survey several randomized optimization
		  algorithms appropriate for CU-, CLG-, and RLG-functions. We
		  show that the subexponential algorithms for linear
		  programming by Kalai and Matou\v{s}ek, Sharir, and Welzl,
		  can be adapted to optimizing the functions we study, with
		  preserved subexponential expected running time. We examine
		  the relations to two other abstract frameworks for
		  subexponential optimization, the LP-type problems of
		  Matou{\v{s}}ek, Sharir, and Welzl, and the abstract
		  optimization problems of G{\"a}rtner. The applicability of
		  our abstract optimization approach to parity games builds
		  upon a discrete strategy evaluation measure.
		  
		  We also consider local search type algorithms, and settle
		  two nontrivial, but still exponential, upper bounds. As
		  applications we address some complexity-theoretic issues
		  including non-PLS-completeness of the problems studied.}
