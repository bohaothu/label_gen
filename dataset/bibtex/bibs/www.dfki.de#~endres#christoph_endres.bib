  ABSTRACT  = {Texting while driving is dangerous and illegal in most countries.
			   But both social as well as business forces led to a
               widespread ignorance of those bans and in turn to a potential
			   lethal situation. We argue that, in addition to legislative regulations,
			   in-car texting should be made less distracting and
			   dangerous. We offer a solution for one specific communication
			   goal, namely staying connected to a social network. We
			   propose a semi-automatic status-posting system and present
			   a prototype based on a Pleo. We argue that our approach
			   should be extended by automated answering mechanisms.
			   The aim of this paper is to foster discussion on texting while
			   driving. The solution for one type of semi-atomatic texting
			   is outlined, other types of texting need to be looked at separately.}

  ABSTRACT  = {We introduce the "Geremin" approach on in-car 2D microgesture recognition, which belongs to the 
               category of electric field sensing techniques detecting the presence of a human hand near a 
               conductive object (not affected by light and dynamic backgrounds, fast response times). The 
               core component is essentially a modified "Theremin", an early electronic musical instrument 
               named after the Russian inventor Professor Leon Theremin. Gesture recognition is done using a
               Dynamic Time Warp DTW algorithm. With respect to the application domain, we follow the direction 
               of "selective mapping to theme or function" suggested in the literature. For gesture location, 
               we propose the immediate proximity of the steering wheel, which has the advantage of providing 
               gesture-based interaction without requiring the driver to take off hand(s). The major motivating 
               factor for the proposed approach is reducing installation costs. Although, we use a single-antenna
               setup for this study, our results indicate that the gain in recognition accuracy justifies the 
               use of two or more.}

               have the drawback of affecting uninvolved (road) users. We argue further that augmented reality as 
               an alternative is error prone because objects need to be tracked. Our system implements the hybrid 
               reality modality model, where directed information emanates from the objects themselves and therefore 
               no object recognition/tracking is needed. We describe the components of a functional demonstrator 
               based on standard compliant car-to-car communication components.}

              interface (HMI). Successful personalization bears the potential of increasing both safety
              as well as customer satisfaction. In order to reveal innovative concepts in automotive
              personalization, we present in this paper a cinematic study -- an analysis of what the movie
              industry "invented" and what might be worthwhile following up upon in research. Thereby,
              our notion of personalization is twofold: a) tailoring the car or parts of the car to a
              specific user (group) and b) the car or parts of the car becoming a persona -- the latter
              being relevant with respect to current automotive research activities on the "emotional" car.
              Based on the analysis of popular movies and TV series from the last four decades, we introduce
              a scheme that describes personalization concepts as imagined (and maybe even anticipated) by
              film-makers, who's creative drives have not been slowed down by the restraints of
              feasibility and costs.}

               Augmented Reality (AR), Intelligent Environments, and Distributed Mobile Systems. In their

               infrastructure for reuse, or to get an overview before designing a new one. It tries to provide
               a systematic, relatively broad (and necessarily not very deep) overview, while pointing to
               relevant literature for in-depth study of the systems discussed.}

  ABSTRACT  = {Intelligent environments frequently embed a varying number of output means. In this paper, we present an analysis of the task of
               generating a coherent presentation across multiple displays. We review problems and requirements, and propose a multi-layer 
               approach aimed at addressing some of the previously identified issues. We introduce a low-level architecture for the handling 
               of devices as well as mechanism for distributing coherent presentations to multiple displays. We then discuss what further steps 
               are needed on the way from an abstract presentation goal to a concrete realization.Intelligent environments frequently embed a

  ABSTRACT  = {Two major differences between ubiquitous computing and a
               traditional desktop scenario consist of the number of users
               interacting simultaneously with a system, and the number of
               devices that they use. This paper focuses on the physical user
               interfaces problem of how device control is allocated, shared, and
               released by services and users. Based on a classification of
               different types of devices, we analyze in which ways a device can
               be controlled. We then identify several influencing factors in
               allocating devices, and conclude by sketching out a high-level
               strategy for the (semi) automatic handling of device allocation.}

  ABSTRACT  = {Internet agents require fast, concurrent access to many web pages. This service
               should be stable, central, and easy to access independently from the actual implementation
               language. This paper describes the MultiHttpServer (MHS), a parallel
               pull engine implemented in Java with a TCP/IP interface for communication with
               other programs. A second TCP/IP interface provides information for administration 
               purposes. A simple config-file allows application-oriented tuning of the MultiHttpServer. 
               An optional JAVA-Servlet can remotely start up the MultiHttpServer
               on demand.
               The focus of this report is on a user oriented description of functionality and usage
               of the system. Sample clients in several languages are discussed.}

  ABSTRACT  = {Es wird die Funktionsweise eines Netbot vorgestellt, der nach Eingabe eines Personennamen 
               im World Wide Web (WWW) nach Photos dieser Person sucht und die gefundenen Bilder zusammen 
               mit einem Hinweis auf die Fundstelle ausgibt. Dazu werden zun{\"a}chst durch eine parallele 
               Metasuche relevante Webseiten gefunden, aus deren HTML-Code dann alle Bilddateien extrahiert 
               werden. Der Netbot nutzt dann eine Kombination verschiedener Heuristiken aus seiner Wissensbasis, 
               um die Bilddateien mit Personenphotos aufgrund effizient zu berechnender Bildmerkmale zu extrahieren 
               und alle anderen Bilddateien wegzufiltern. Durch verschiedene Lerntechniken, die als Eingabe die 
               Bewertungen von Suchergebnissen durch eine gro�e Zahl von Benutzern haben, adaptiert der Netbot 
               seine Bildfilter und erh�ht damit die Precision-Werte beim Retrieval. Durch die Verwendung der 
               Parallel Pull - Technologie und eine Kombination von Java Scripts, Applets und Servlets 
               wird eine hohe Performanz des Systems erreicht.}

  ABSTRACT  = {Diese Dokumentation beschreibt die Implementierung und Erweiterung der
               Sprache ALCP. ALCP ist eine von Heinsohn entwickelte Erweiterung der
               terminologischen Wissensrepr{\"a}sentationssprache ALC um eine probabilistische
               Komponente, so da{\3} auch unsicheres Wissen repr{\"a}sentiert und f{\"u}r Inferenzen
               verwendet werden kann. Nach einer Einf{\"u}hrung in die grundlegenden Bereiche
               der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und der Wissensrepr{\"a}sentation erfolgt eine kurze
               Beschreibung der Sprache ALCP. Anschlie{\3}end werden die bei der Implementierung
               verwendeten Konzepte vorgestellt und die benutzten Datenstrukturen
               und Algorithmen werden beschrieben und erl{\"a}utert. Der praktische Aspekt der
               Verwendung der Sprache ALCP wird durch eine Beschreibung der verwendbaren
               Funktionen, eine Bedienungsanleitung und eine Beispielsitzung abgedeckt.
               Desweiteren wird die M{\"a}chtigkeit der Sprache ALCP anhand einiger Beispiele
               veranschaulicht.}
