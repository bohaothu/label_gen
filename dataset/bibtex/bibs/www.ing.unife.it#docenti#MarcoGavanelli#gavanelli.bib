  abstract = "Artificial Vision is an important field of Artificial
Intelligence: the human brain is able to derive various types of
information about the outer world from vision. However, the
semantic interpretation of objects is a hard task for a computer.
Constraints have been widely used for visual recognition, because
they are able to describe very complex models and situations in a
natural way.

Constraint Logic Programming is a new paradigm of
declarative programming languages that is able to deal
declaratively and efficiently with problems described with
constraints.

In this thesis, we addressed problems that stem from Artificial
Vision with constraints. We developed a 3D visual search system
able to detect an object described with constraints in an image.
We provide constraint models for dealing with the problems in
Artificial Vision. We generalize the applied techniques to other
important fields of Artificial Intelligence, developing new tools
of Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization in  Constraint Logic
Programming. In order to obtain {\em efficiency}, we propose a
tight interaction between the Constraint Solver and the provider
of visual features. We give a theoretical model, solving algorithm
and a language extension.

We model 3D objects with an object-centered model, based on visual
information. From each viewpoint, only part of the visual features
of a 3D object can be seen; we model objects by adding {\em
invisible features} in the domains and select only the most
informative assignments by means of a partial order.",

"Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are an effective
framework for modeling a variety of real life applications and
many techniques have been proposed for solving them efficiently.
CSPs are based on the assumption that all constrained data (values
in variable domains) are available at the beginning of the
computation. However, many non-toy problems derive their
parameters from an external environment. Data retrieval can be a
hard task, because data can come from a third-party system that
has to convert information encoded with signals (derived from
sensors) into symbolic information (exploitable by a CSP solver).
Also, data can be provided by the user or have to be queried to a
database.

For this purpose, we introduce an extension of the widely used CSP model,
called Interactive Constraint Satisfaction Problem (ICSP) model. The
variable domain values can be acquired when needed during the resolution
process by means of Interactive Constraints, which retrieve (possibly
consistent) information. A general framework for constraint propagation
algorithms is proposed which is parametric in the number of acquisitions
performed at each step. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Some applications which can benefit from the proposed
solution are also discussed.",

  abstract = "This paper addresses the 3D object recognition problem modelled as a
Constraint Satisfaction Problem. In this setting, each object view can be
modelled as a constraint graph where nodes are object parts and constraints
are topological and geometrical relationships among them. By modelling the
problem as a CSP, we can recognize an object when all constraints are
satisfied by exploiting results from the CSP field. However, in classical
CSPs variable domains have to be statically defined at the beginning of the
constraint propagation process. Thus, not only feature acquisition should
be completed before the constraint solving process starts, but all image
features should be extracted even if not belonging to significant image
parts. In visual applications, this requirement turns out to be inefficient
since visual features acquisition is a very time consuming task.
 We present an {\em Interactive
Constraint Satisfaction} model for problems where variable domains may not
be completely known at the beginning of the computation, and can be
interactively acquired during the computational process only when needed (on demand).
The constraint propagation
process works on already known domain values and adds new constraints on
unknown domain parts. These new constraints can be used to incrementally
process new information without restarting the constraint propagation
process from scratch each time new information is available. In addition,
these constraints can guide the feature acquisition process, thus focussing
attention on significant image parts.  We present the Interactive CSP model
and a propagation algorithm for it. We propose an implementation of the
framework in Constraint Logic Programming on Finite Domains,
CLP(FD)."

"Real-life problems often exhibit a multi-criteria structure: user
requirements are many and possibly conflicting. In combinatorial
optimization, criteria are functions, ranging on the set of
possible solutions.

A widely used approach suggests to compute a weighted sum of the
different criteria. Unluckily, deciding the weights beforehand is
not always straightforward; moreover, the weighted sum approach
often provides extreme solutions, while the user usually prefers
balanced solutions.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute Pareto optimal
solutions in Constraint Satisfaction Problems. A solution is
Pareto optimal if it is not possible an improvement in one
criterion without worsening other criteria. The algorithm is
complete, and can provide the whole set of Pareto optimal
solutions.

Since the set of Pareto optimal solutions can be huge and the
algorithm needs to access them efficiently, we propose to arrange
them in a suitable data structure, namely Point Quad-Trees.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.",

"Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) represent a widely used
framework for many real-life problems. Constraint Logic
Programming (CLP) languages are an effective tool for modeling
problems in terms of CSPs and solving them efficiently.

Lazy domain evaluation is a solving technique that has proven
effective for solving CSPs, allowing the minimization of the
number of constraint checks. However, exploiting lazy domain
evaluation in CLP is not very effective, mainly because of the
chronological backtracking rule used in CLP. After each
backtracking step, in fact, all the obtained results are lost,
even if they had nothing to do with the culprit of the failure.
The intelligent backtracking rule widely studied in the past does
not solve the problem either.

In this paper, we propose a backtracking rule useful for dealing
efficiently and declaratively with lazy domain evaluation in CLP,
and we show a simple implementation of a metainterpreter providing
the depicted functionality.", }

  abstract =     "Agent communication is one of the key issues in multi-agent systems.
  Traditional interprocess communication formalisms are usually
  considered insufficient for this purpose because of their lack of
  expressiveness; thus, in most proposals for multi-agent
  architectures, an Agent Communication Language (ACL) is designed to
  provide for agent communication. However, a universally accepted
  standard for ACLs is still missing. Agent communication in open
  societies of heterogeneous agents poses requirements on ACLs
  semantics (formal syntax and semantics, declarativeness,
  verifiability, meaningfulness) which a social approach
  seems to meet best.

  In this paper we propose a logic-based social approach for ACL
  semantics. We give a functional abstract model of societies and
  agents. Then we propose a formalism (deontic constraints) to express
  interaction protocols and give a social semantics to the behavior of
  agents, focusing on communicative acts. Finally, we sketch a
  prototypical implementation of deontic constraints exploiting the
  Constraint Handling Rules language.",

introduce integrity constraints about social acts (called Social
Integrity Constraints) as a formalism to express interaction
protocols and give a social semantics to the behavior of agents,
focusing on communicative acts. Then, we discuss several possible
kinds of verification of agent interaction, and we show how social
integrity constraints can be used to verify some properties in
this respect. We focus our interest on static verification of the
compliance of agent specifications to interaction protocols, and
on run-time verification, based on agents' observable behavior. We
adopt as a running example the NetBill security transaction
protocol for the selling and delivery of information goods.",

  abstract =
"The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a good framework for
dealing with combinatorial problems, but it does not take into
account the interactive acquisition of the problem parameters. For
this reason, an extension of the CSP model, the Interactive CSP
model \cite{IJCAI99}, has been proposed. Various ICSP solving
algorithms have been discussed as well. In order to verify for
which kind of problems the ICSP model is most promising, we
performed a series of systematic tests. However, in order to
evaluate the performance of an interactive CSP solving algorithm,
classical parameters used by the CSP community (e.g., number of
constraint checks, number of explored nodes, ...) are not good
indicators, as they consider just the computational effort of the
solver component. ICSP solving algorithms are capable of
exploiting the interaction between subsystems, so more indicators
have to be considered.

In this work, we show how to esteem the efficiency of an ICSP
solving algorithm, considering the computational effort of both
the subsystems and the communication cost. We show that the total
effort can be considered as a combination of four different
counters that depend only on the given CSP problem. To obtain the
total complexity, these counters have to be combined using some
parameters that depend only on the solving architecture. We
performed a series of tests recording these counters and here we
show the corresponding results for two algorithms.",
