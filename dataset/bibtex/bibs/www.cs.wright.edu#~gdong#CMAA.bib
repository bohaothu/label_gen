  abstract={The single coverage constraint discourages a decisiontree to contain many significant rules.
  The loss of significant rules leads to a loss in accuracy. On the other hand,
  the fragmentation problem causes a decision tree to contain too many minor rules.
  The presence of minor rules decreases accuracy. We propose to use emerging patterns
  to solvethese problems. In our approach, many globally significant rules can be discovered.
  Extensive experimental results on gene expression datasets show that our approach are more accurate than
  single C4.5 trees, and are also better than bagged or boosted C4.5 trees.}

  abstract={The application of frequent patterns in classification has demonstrated its power
  in recent studies. It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule)
   mining followed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However, this two-step process could be
   computationally expensive, especially when the problem scale is large or the minimum support
    is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge number of
    "patterns" that could not only slow down the mining process
    but also make feature selection hard to complete. In this paper,
    we propose a direct discriminative pattern mining approach,
    DDPMine, to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach.
    DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative
    patterns without generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best
    patterns in a batch, we introduce a "feature-centered" mining approach that generates
    discriminative patterns sequentially on a progressively shrinking
    FP-tree by incrementally eliminating training instances. The instance elimination
    effectively reduces the problem size iteratively and expedites the mining process.
    Empirical results show that DDPMine achieves orders of magnitude speedup without
    any downgrade of classification accuracy. It outperforms the state-of-the-art
    associative classification methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},
