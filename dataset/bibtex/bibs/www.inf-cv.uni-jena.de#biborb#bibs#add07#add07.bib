abstract = {When artists portray human faces, they generally endow their portraits with properties that render the faces esthetically more pleasing. To obtain insight into the changes introduced by artists, we compared Fourier power spectra in photographs of faces and in portraits by artists. Our analysis was restricted to a large set of monochrome or lightly colored portraits from various Western cultures and revealed a paradoxical result. Although face photographs are not scale-invariant, artists draw human faces with statistical properties that deviate from the face 
photographs and approximate the scaleinvariant,
fractal-like properties of complex natural scenes. This result cannot be explained by systematic differences in the complexity of patterns surrounding the faces or by reproduction artefacts. In particular, a moderate change in gamma gradation has little influence on the results. Moreover, the scale-invariant rendering of faces in artists' portraits was found to be independent of cultural variables, such as century of origin or artistic techniques. We suggest that artists have implicit
knowledge of image statistics and prefer natural scene statistics (or some other rules associated with them) in their creations.
Fractal-like statistics have been demonstrated previously in other forms of visual art and may be a general attribute of esthetic visual stimuli.},

title = {Fractal-Like Image Statistics in Visual Art: Similarity to Natural Scenes},
journal = {Vision Science and Art},
year = {2007},
abstract = {Both natural scenes and visual art are often perceived as esthetically pleasing. It is 
therefore conceivable that the two types of visual stimuli share statistical properties. For example, natural scenes display a Fourier power spectrum that tends to fall with spatial frequency according to a power-law. This result indicates that natural scenes have fractal-like, scaleinvariant properties. In the present study, we asked whether visual art displays similar statistical properties by measuring their Fourier power spectra. Our analysis
was restricted to graphic art from the Western hemisphere. For comparison, we also analyzed images, which generally display relatively low or no esthetic quality (household and laboratory objects, parts of plants, and scientific illustrations). Graphic art, but not the other image categories, resembles natural scenes in showing fractal-like, scale-invariant statistics. This property is universal in our sample of graphic art; it is independent of cultural
variables, such as century and country of origin, techniques used or subject matters. 
We speculate that both graphic art and natural scenes share statistical properties because visual art is adapted to the structure of the visual system, which in turn, is adapted to process optimally the image statistics of natural scenes.

abstract = {The problem of planning the Next Best View (NBV) still poses many questions. However, the achieved methods and algorithms are hard to compare, since researchers use their own test objects for planning and reconstruction and compute specific quality measures. Consequently, these numbers make different statements about different objects. Thus, the quality of the results and the performance of the methods are not easily comparable. In order to mend this lack of measure and comparability, this paper suggests a test object together with a reference benchmark. These allow comparison of reconstruction results from different NBV algorithms achieved with different techniques and various kinds of sensors.},

However, it requires storing the complete training data, and classification time is linear in the amount of data. There are several approaches to improve runtime and/or memory requirements of nearest eighbor methods: Thinning methods select and store only part of the training data for the classifier. Efficient query structures reduce query times. In this paper, we present an experimental comparison and analysis of such methods using the ETH-80 database. We evaluate the following algorithms. Thinning: condensed nearest neighbor, reduced nearest neighbor, Baram’s algorithm, the Baram-RNN hybrid algorithm,
Gabriel and GSASH thinning. Query structures: kd-tree and approximate nearest neighbor. For the first four thinning algorithms, we also present an extension
to k-NN which allows tuning the trade-off between data reduction and classifier degradation. The experiments show that most of the above methods are well suited for generic object recognition.},

It extends our previous work for 2D fitting problems and for fitting rectangular boxes in 3D. Our technique can be used as a valuable tool for solving this fitting task for 3D data. If the exponents describing the superellipsoids to be fitted are known in advance, the method is extremely robust even against major distortions of the object to be fitted.},

We present extended self-calibration algorithms which use such knowledge. In systematic simulations, we show that our new algorithms are less sensitive to noise. Experiments on real data result in a systematic error caused by non-ideal hardware. However, our algorithms can reduce the systematic error.

We present methods to detect physically present 3D planes in scenes imaged with a handheld camera. Such planes induce homographies, which provides a necessary, but not a sufficient criterion to detect them. Especially in handheld image sequences degenerate cases are abundant, where the whole image underlies the same homography. We provide methods to verify, that a homography does carry information about coplanarity and the 3D scene structure. This allows deciding, whether planes can be detected from the images or not. Different methods for both known and unknown intrinsic camera parameters are compared experimentally.},

abstract = {In the past decades, most object recognition systems were based on passive approaches. But in the last few years a lot of research was done in the field of active object recognition, that is selectively moving a sensor/camera around a considered object in order to acquire as much information about it as possible. In this paper we present an active object recognition approach that solves the problem of choosing optimal views (viewpoint selection) and iteratively fuses the gained information for an optimal 3D object recognition (viewpoint fusion) in an integrated manner. Therefore, we apply a method for the fusion of multiple views with respect to the knowledge about the assumed camera movement between them.
For viewpoint selection we formally deine the choice of additional views as an optimization problem. We show how to use reinforcement learning for this purpose and perform a training without user interaction. In this context we focus on the modeling of continuous states, continuous, one-dimensional actions and supporting rewards for an optimized recognition of real objects.
The experimental results show that our combined viewpoint selection and viewpoint fusion approach is able to significantly improve the recognition rates compared to passive object recognition with randomly chosen views.},

By choosing a suitable optimization criterion, we are able to determine the camera positions which minimize our reconstruction error.
We verify our results using two experiments with real images: one experiment uses a calibration pattern for comparison to a ground-truth state, the other reconstructs a real world object.},

year = {2006},
abstract = {The paper outlines a new method for 3D measurement explicitly targeting at practical applications. In particular, in order to realize this intention, robust mathematical techniques, the usage of standard or even low resolution cameras and minimal user interaction have to be claimed. The extended single-view reconstruction satisfies these claims by the use of special knowledge and a clear problem separation. The algorithm expects a planar quadrangle with known geometry inside the scene as well as the intrinsic and radial distortion camera parameters to be noted. From two or more digital images of the scene, the algorithm in general returns the 3D coordinates of the world points (up to an unknown Euclidean transformation), whose mapped points have been selected. With the marked image mappings of two world points, the spatial distance between these points can simply be calculated from the reconstructions. With more than two photographs error compensation is achieved (errors due to noise and possibly imprecise inputs).},

title = {3D shape measurement with phase correlation based fringe projection},
year = {2007},
abstract = {Here we propose a method for 3D shape measurement by means of phase correlation based fringe projection in a stereo arrangement. The novelty in the approach is characterized by following features. Correlation between phase values of the images of two cameras is used for the co-ordinate calculation. This work stands in contrast to the sole usage of phase values (phasogrammetry) or classical triangulation (phase values and image co-ordinates - camera raster values) for the determination of the co-ordinates. The method's main advantage is the insensitivity of the 3D-coordinates from the absolute phase values. Thus it prevents errors in the determination of the co-ordinates and improves robustness in areas with interreflections artefacts and inhomogeneous regions of intensity. A technical advantage is the fact that the accuracy of the 3D co-ordinates does not depend on the projection resolution. Thus the achievable quality of the 3D co-ordinates can be selectively improved by the use of high quality camera lenses and can participate in improvements in modern camera technologies. The presented new solution of the stereo based fringe projection with phase correlation makes a flexible, errortolerant realization of measuring systems within different applications like quality control, rapid prototyping, design and CAD/CAM possible. In the paper the phase correlation method will be described in detail. Furthermore, different realizations will be shown, i.e. a mobile system for the measurement of large objects and an endoscopic like system for CAD/CAM in dental industry.},

The sensor consist of a digital projection unit and two cameras in a stereo arrangement, whereby both are battery powered. The data transfer to a base station will be done via WLAN. This gives the possibility to use the system in complicate, remote measurement situations, which are typical in archaeology and architecture. In the measurement procedure the sensor will be hand-held by the user, illuminating the object with a sequence of less than 10 fringe patterns, within a time below 200 ms. This short sequence duration was achieved by a new approach, which combines the epipolar constraint with robust phase correlation utilizing a pre-calibrated sensor head, containing two cameras and a digital fringe projector. Furthermore, the system can be utilized to acquire the all around shape of objects by using the phasogrammetric approach with virtual land marks introduced by the authors1, 2. This way no matching procedures or markers are necessary for the registration of multiple views, which makes the system very flexible in accomplishing different measurement tasks. The realized measurement field is approx. 100 mm up to 400 mm in diameter. The mobile character makes the measurement system useful for a wide range of applications in arts, architecture, archaeology and criminology, which will be shown in the paper.},
