   abstract = {Scaling heterogeneous information systems (HIS) to thousands of sources poses
      particular challenges to source discovery. It requires a powerful formalism for
      describing the contents of the sources in a concise manner and for formulating
      compatible queries as well as a suitable structure for indexing and retrieving
      the source descriptions efficiently.
      
      We propose an extended logic-based description formalism for large-scale HIS
      with structured sources and a shared ontology. The formalism refines existing
      approaches that describe the sources by constraints on the attribute value
      ranges in several ways: It allows for complex, nested descriptions based on
      defined classes. It supports alternative descriptions to express that a source
      may be discovered by different combinations of constraints. Finally, it allows
      to adjust between positive matching, similar to keyword-based discovery, and
      negative matching, as used in existing logic-based approaches.
      
      We further propose the SDC-Tree for indexing such source descriptions. To allow
      for efficient discovery, the SDC-Tree features multidimensional indexing
      capabilities for the different attributes and the IS-A hierarchy of the shared
      ontology, but also incorporates the existence or absence of constraints. For
      this purpose, it supports three different types of node split operations which
      exploit the expressiveness of the description formalism. Therefore, we also
      propose a generic split algorithm which can be used with arbitrary ontologies.},

   abstract = {Self-adaptive pervasive systems often implement adaptation in a centralised
      manner, where one component holds all the necessary knowledge to identify when
      and how the system needs to adapt. In self-adaptive pervasive systems, composed
      of autonomous components with different authorities (such as security,
      distribution, etc.), this approach cannot be implemented as composing a
      centralised knowledge is not feasible and it also obstructs the system's
      ability to dynamically change its components. A simple alternative would be to
      allow each component to adapt independently but this can quickly give rise to
      conflicts, race conditions and oscillations between multiple independent
      adaptations. To avoid these problems, we propose to coordinate individual
      adaptations so that each component's adaptation goals are satisfied. Each
      component proposes an adaptation which is reviewed by other components who may
      propose their own adaptations that they may need to do. This continues until a
      complete adaptation plan is agreed upon. In cases where certain individual
      adaptations conflict with some components' goals, components are instructed to
      seek alternative proposals. The Adaptation Manager component is in charge of
      the negotiation process and it also has the authority to resolve certain
      conflicts between adaptations. Our approach is evaluated in the context of
      pervasive workflow systems where the failure probability and execution times

   abstract = {Real-time simulations are one challenging application domain that is expected
      to introduce high requirements to global sensor applications. Besides having
      hard constraints on latency bounds at which data needs to be processed,
      simulation applications will impose high requirements with respect to available
      bandwidth. Predictors, originally introduced in the domain of wireless sensor
      networks for energy saving, are one appealing solution to provide real-time
      estimates and at the same time significantly reduce the data rates. While in
      the setting of wireless sensor networks many prediction models have been
      analyzed, their behavior and use is unclear when applied to distributed data
      streams where aggregation results are typically processed over multilevel
      hierarchies.
      
      In the context of weather simulations, we propose a distributed R-Tree-based
      aggregation algorithm that allows for efficient reuse of aggregate queries. In
      the setting of real temperature readings taken from weather stations during one
      month, we study the trade-off between updates of the prediction model and the
      precision of the predicted values. Our evaluations indicate that even in
      situations where complex prediction models are expected to perform best, simple
      prediction models give higher benefits with respect to saving bandwidth while

      ad-hoc networks. This has led to the design of a large number of mobility
      models for simulating realistic user movement under physical constraints
      (obstacles, acceleration, inertia etc.). In recent years, the new breed of
      social mobility models (SMMs) has risen. These SMMs model the $\backslash$emph{social
      aspects of human mobility}, i.e. which users meet, when and how often. Such
      information is indispensable for the simulation of a wide range of
      socially-aware communication protocols mostly based on delay-tolerant networks,
      including opportunistic ad-hoc routing and data dissemination systems. Each SMM
      needs a model of the relations between a set of relevant people (called social
      network model -- SNM) in order to simulate their mobility. Existing SMMs lack
      flexibility since each of them is implicitly restricted to a specific,
      simplifying SNM.
      
      We present GeSoMo, a new SMM that separates the core mobility model from the
      structural description of the social network underlying the simulation. This
      simple and elegant design principle gives GeSoMo generalizing power: Arbitrary
      existing and future SNMs can be used without changing GeSoMo itself. Our

      large-scale distributed systems. Although point queries are well supported by
      current P2P systems -- in particular systems based on distributed hash tables
      (DHTs) --, providing efficient support for more complex queries remains a
      challenge. Our research focuses on the efficient support for multi-attribute
      range (MAR) queries over DHT-based information discovery systems.
      Traditionally, the support for MAR queries over DHTs has been provided either
      by creating an individual index for each data attribute or by creating a single
      index using the combination of all data attributes. In contrast to these
      approaches, we propose to create a set of indices over selected attribute
      combinations. In order to limit the overhead induced by index maintenance, the
      total number of created indices has to be limited. Thus, the resulting problem
      is to create a limited number of indices such that the overall system
      performance is optimal for MAR queries. In this paper, we propose an index
      recommendation tool that implements heuristic solutions to this NP-hard
      problem. Our evaluations show that these heuristics lead to a close-to-optimal

      observable context information, are necessary. Several context reasoning
      mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. Usually these mechanisms are
      centralized, leading to suboptimal utilization of network resources and poor
      system performance in case of large-scale scenarios. Therefore to increase the
      scalability of context reasoning systems the development of methods that
      distribute the reasoning process is necessary. Existing distributed approaches
      are method specific and do not provide a generic formalization for distributed
      reasoning. In this paper we introduce a novel system which enables distributed
      context reasoning in a generic way that is independent of the reasoning
      algorithm.},

   abstract = {A context-based communication system enables the indirect addressing and
      routing of messages according to the users' contexts. This provides, for
      example, the means to send a message to all students on campus who attend a
      certain class, with information about an upcoming exam. However, for a targeted
      forwarding of messages towards users, the routers need information about the
      context of connected users. Global knowledge, i.e., each router knowing about
      every user, is not scalable, though, because of the necessary update messages
      to keep this information up-to-date.
      
      To address this challenge, a router can aggregate similar contexts and only
      provide such an aggregated view to neighboring routers. In this paper, we
      present an approach to aggregate similar contexts, based on a similarity
      measure for user contexts. The algorithm can be adjusted according to the
      observed messages and user contexts in the system by specifying a similarity
      threshold to determine when contexts are aggregated.
      
      The aggregation of user contexts improves the scalability of our approach by
      significantly reducing the load of context updates by up to 30\%, depending on
      the usage of the system. This improvement comes at the cost of a negligible
      increase in false positive messages due to the loss of information used for
      forwarding messages.},

      However, in many real-world applications, the message delay tolerance of

      maintain the publish/subscribe overlay in a decentralized manner by
      establishing connections to peers that provide messages meeting exactly their

   abstract = {Network emulation is an efficient method for evaluating distributed
      applications and communication protocols by combining the benefits of real
      world experiments and network simulation. The process of network emulation
      involves execution of thousands of connected virtual nodes running the software
      under test in a controlled environment. Along with the quality of the
      experiment results, the runtime of network experiments strongly influences the
      convenience of users and operators of emulation testbeds. The goal of this
      paper is, therefore, to minimize the experiment runtime of network emulations.
      
      In order to achieve this goal, we make the following contributions in this
      paper: First, we present a highly scalable emulation architecture to
      efficiently support network emulation testbeds with multicore CPUs. Second, we
      propose a detailed and generic cost model for the communication costs of
      emulation testbeds. Third, we present an efficient placement strategy
      (NETplace) to assign virtual nodes to physical nodes of the testbed while
      minimizing the runtime of network experiments. Therefore, we combine graph
      partitioning and greedy approaches. Our evaluations show that our placement
      strategy outperforms existing methods by reducing the experiment runtime up to
      64\%.},

      system. Authentication of publishers and subscribers is difficult to achieve
      due to the loose coupling of publishers and subscribers. Similarly,
      confidentiality of events and subscriptions conflicts with contentbased
      routing. In particular, content-based approaches in broker-less environments do
      not address confidentiality at all. This paper presents a novel approach to
      provide confidentiality and authentication in a broker-less content-based

      to the needs of publish/subscribe authentication of publisher and subscriber as

      cluster subscribers according to their subscriptions preserves a weak notion of
      subscription confidentiality. Our approach provides fine grained key management
      and the cost for encryption, decryption and routing is in the order of
      subscribed attributes. Moreover, the simulation results verify that supporting

      efficient usage also has to consider what kind of and when power is consumed.
      By matching the availability of electrical power with the current demands, the
      amount of unused energy and therefore overall energy production can be reduced.
      The so called smart grid aims to provide this matching with a broad deployment
      of smart meters to acquire the current demand. However, current approaches to
      the smart grid cannot handle the huge amount of sensors and energy sources
      involved in a scalable way. Most data acquisition systems focus on the lookup

      large scale power grid simulation. We propose a Global Sensor Grid (GSG) which
      provides consumers with data preprocessed to their needs instead of delivering
      raw sensor data. With this decoupling from the actual sensors, multiple
      consumers can benefit from improvements in data acquisition and avoidance of
      the redundant processing of data by each consumer. By integrating so-called
      diagnostic simulations into the GSG, gaps in sensor coverage can be filled with

   abstract = {In partially-trusted system environments like the WWW, the management of
      private user positions is a great challenge. On the one hand, location-based
      services of different partially-trusted providers have to be provided with
      position information. On the other hand, location servers, which are
      responsible for the management of user positions, might as well be operated by
      only partially-trusted providers. Therefore, in order to protect his privacy, a
      user might only want to store position information of limited precision on
      location servers, and also provide location-based services with position
      information of limited precision.
      
      In this position paper, we sketch a novel position sharing approach that
      enables the user to tightly control the precision of position information
      stored on servers and provided to location-based services. This approach is
      based on the idea of distributing position information among a set of servers
      of different providers such that a compromised server only reveals information
      of strictly limited precision.},

   abstract = {Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based peer-to-peer information discovery systems
      have emerged as highly scalable systems for information storage and discovery
      in massively distributed networks. Originally DHTs supported only point
      queries. However, recently they have been extended to support more complex
      queries, such as multi-attribute range (MAR) queries. Generally, the support
      for MAR queries over DHTs has been provided either by creating an individual
      index for each data attribute or by creating a single index using the
      combination of all data attributes. In contrast to these approaches, we propose
      to create and modify indices using the attribute combinations that dynamically
      appear in MAR queries in the system.
      
      In this paper, we present an adaptive information discovery system that adapts
      the set of indices according to the dynamic set of MAR queries in the system.
      The main contribution of this paper is a four-phase scalable index adaptation
      process. Our evaluations show that the adaptive information discovery system
      continuously optimizes the overall system performance for MAR queries.
      Moreover, compared to a non-adaptive system, the adaptive information discovery
      system shows several orders of magnitude improved performance.},

   abstract = {As the size and complexity of Pervasive Computing environments increases,
      configuration and adaptation of distributed applications gains importance.
      These tasks require automated system support, since users must not be
      distracted by the (re-)composition of applications. In homogeneous ad hoc
      scenarios, relying on decentralized configuration schemes is obviously
      mandatory, while centralized approaches may help to reduce latencies in weakly
      heterogeneous infrastructure-based environments. However, in case of strongly
      heterogeneous pervasive environments including several resource-rich and
      resource-weak devices, both approaches may lead to suboptimal results
      concerning configuration latencies: While the resource-weak devices represent
      bottlenecks for decentralized configuration, the centralized approach faces the
      problem of not utilizing parallelism. Instead, a hybrid approach that involves
      only the subset of resource-rich devices is capable of rendering configuration
      and adaptation processes more efficiently. In this paper, we present such a
      resource-aware hybrid scheme that effectively reduces the time required for
      configuration processes. This is accomplished by a balanced-load clustering
      scheme that exploits the computational power of resource-rich devices, while
      avoiding bottlenecks in (re-)configurations. We present real-world evaluations
      which confirm that our approach reduces configuration latencies in
      heterogeneous environments by more than 30 \% compared to totally centralized
      and totally decentralized approaches. This is an important step towards
      seamless application configuration.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose to use the open industrial-strength eXtensible
      Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to build a network substrate for
      Peer-to-Peer Grid computing called Orbweb. We describe how to employ XMPP to
      tackle domain-specific challenges, including high scalability, support for
      volatility, NAT/Firewall traversal, and protocol efficiency. Where XMPP fails
      to meet these requirements, we contribute pertinent extensions. In particular,
      we boost the scalability of XMPP by taking load of the XMPP servers through
      dynamically negotiated direct Peer-to-Peer communication channels between XMPP
      peers. We pave the way for scalable group membership management by substituting
      the existing XMPP Multi-User Chat protocol for one that does not suffer from
      limitations imposed by a everyone knows everyone visibility model and allows
      for selecting a membership model that matches the requirements of a given
      application. As efficient multicasting is an essential prerequisite for many
      distributed algorithms and the centralized XMPP multicast is of limited
      scalability, we adapt the well-known Bimodal Multicast protocol to work in a
      highly volatile Peer-to-Peer Grid computing environment. Finally, we show how
      to improve the protocol efficiency of XMPP by leveraging a standardized binary
      encoding of the XML Information Set for XMPP packet transmission. To
      substantiate the applicability of our approach and the effectiveness of our
      extensions, we describe how some important higher-level services used in
      Peer-to-Peer Grid Computing can be implemented on top of Orbweb and provide a
      detailed experimental analysis.},
