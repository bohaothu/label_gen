  abstract = {In this paper we extend the domain of applicability of the E-method,
	as a hardware-oriented method for evaluating elementary functions
	using polynomial and rational function approximations. The polynomials
	and rational functions are computed by solving a system of linear
	equations using digit-serial iterations on simple and highly regular
	hardware. For convergence, these systems must be diagonally dominant.
	The E-method offers an efficient way for the fixed-point evaluation
	of polynomials and rational functions if their coefficients conform
	to the diagonal dominance condition. Until now, there was no systematic
	approach to obtain good approximations to $f$ over an interval $[a,b]$
	by rational functions satisfying the constraints required by the
	E-method. In this paper, we present such an approach which is based
	on linear programming and lattice basis reduction. We also discuss
	a design and performance characteristics of a corresponding implementation.}
