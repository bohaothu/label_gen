  abstract = {{T}he {G}lobal {L}and {I}ce {M}easurement from {S}pace ({GLIMS}) project is a cooperative effort of over sixty institutions world-wide with the goal of inventorying a majority of the world's estimated 160000 glaciers. {E}ach institution (called a {R}egional {C}enter, or {RC}) oversees the analysis of satellite imagery for a particular region containing glacier ice. {D}ata received by the {GLIMS} team at the {N}ational {S}now and {I}ce {D}ata {C}enter ({NSIDC}) in {B}oulder, {C}olorado are ingested into a spatially-enabled database ({P}ost{GIS}) and made available via a website featuring an interactive map, and a {W}eb-{M}apping {S}ervice ({WMS}). {T}he {WMS}, an {O}pen {G}eospatial {C}onsortium ({OGC})-compliant web interface, makes {GLIMS} glacier data available to other data servers. {T}he {GLIMS} {G}lacier {D}atabase is accessible on the {W}orld {W}ide {W}eb at "http://nsidc.org/glims/". {T}here, users can browse custom maps, display various data layers, query information within the {GLIMS} database, and download query results in different {GIS}-compatible formats. {M}ap layers include glacier outlines, footprints of {ASTER} satellite optical images acquired over glaciers, and {R}egional {C}enter information. {T}he glacier and {ASTER} footprint layers may be queried for scalar attribute data, such as analyst name and date of contribution for glacier data, and acquisition time and browse imagery for the {ASTER} footprint layer. {W}e present an example analysis of change in {C}ordillera {B}lanca glaciers, as determined by comparing data in the {GLIMS} {G}lacier {D}atabase to historical data. {R}esults show marked changes in that system over the last 30 years, but also point out the need for establishing clear protocols for glacier monitoring from remote-sensing data.
