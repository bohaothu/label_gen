                          abstract = {Audio feedback remains little used in most graphical user interfaces despite its potential to greatly enhance interaction.  Not only does sonic enhancement of interfaces permit more natural human-computer communication but it also allows users to employ an appropriate sense to solve a problem rather than having to rely solely on vision.  Research shows that designers do not typically know how to use sound effectively; subsequently, their ad hoc use of sound often leads to audio feedback being considered an annoying distraction.  Unlike the design of purely graphical user interfaces for which guidelines are common, the audio-enhancement of graphical user interfaces has (until now) been plagued by a lack of suitable guidance.  This paper presents a series of empirically substantiated guidelines for the design and use of audio-enhanced graphical user interface widgets.
