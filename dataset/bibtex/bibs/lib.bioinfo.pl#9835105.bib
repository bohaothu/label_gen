abstract={We examined 705 surgical specimens of total and subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, from the Surgical Pathology Department of L'Aquila, Atri and Avezzano, during the period from January 1972 to December 1991. For each case at least 15 samplings were taken, from the tumor itself and from the mucosa which appeared macroscopically normal. The cases were then classified according to the criteria proposed by Lauren and by Ming and the staging of the disease using the UICC's pTNM. Applying Ming's classification, it was evident a clear prevalence of the infiltrative (78.6%), rather than the expansive type (21.4%). Lauren's classification showed a slight prevalence of the diffuse type (56.5%), compared with the intestinal type. Intestinal metaplasia, chronic atrophic gastritis and dysplasia were found more frequently in the intestinal and expansive histotypes. These are the forms having a better prognosis and which in our results represent a minority of cases, therefore identifying the geographic area as a low risk area. With regards to the pTNM staging, T3's resulted the most numerous; T1's, or early gastric cancers (EGC), represented instead 15.7% of the total. Such a percentage is rather high in comparison with the mean percentage in western countries with low risk of disease. In reference to the macroscopic variants, a clear prevalence of the ulcerated forms (66.5%) was noted, in contrast with Ming and other Authors, that declare a slight prevalence of the fungating type. Also considering the histotypes there is a certain discrepancy between the data of Ming and ours; in fact, in our study the infiltrative type prevails, representing 78.6% against 33.6% found by Ming. Such a result can be usefully correlated to the high percentage of the ulcerated forms observed in our study and to the relative scarcity of fungating forms; these variants themselves, according to Ming, are usually related to the expansive type of gastric carcinoma. We also noted, in EGC, a remarkable age difference in regards to the diffuse type; the mean age of the 57 patients with this type classified as T1 was 52.2 years against the 63.0 years of the 341 patients with T > 1. The patients with T1 diffuse type carcinoma were not only 10.8 years younger than the patients with advanced gastric cancer of corresponding histotype, but were also 10 years younger than patients with EGC of intestinal type. Such data could support the hypothesis that EGC, diffuse type, has a peculiar biologic behavior.}
