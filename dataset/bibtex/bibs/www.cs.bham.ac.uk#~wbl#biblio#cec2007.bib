  abstract =	{Computational complexity is a major challenge in evolutionary algorithms due to their need for repeated fitness function evaluations. Here, we aim to reduce number of fitness function evaluations by the use of fitness granulation via an adaptive fuzzy similarity analysis. In the proposed algorithm, an individual's fitness is only computed if it has insufficient similarity to a queue of fuzzy granules whose fitness has already been computed. If an individual is sufficiently similar to a known fuzzy granule, then that granule's fitness is used instead as a crude estimate. Otherwise, that individual is added to the queue as a new fuzzy granule. The queue size as well as each granule's radius of influence is adaptive and will grow/shrink depending on the population fitness and the number of dissimilar granules. The proposed technique is applied to a set of 6 traditional optimization benchmarks that are for their various characteristics. In comparison with standard application of evolutionary algorithms, statistical analysis reveals that the proposed method will significantly decrease the number of fitness function evaluations while finding equally good or better solutions.},

In this paper, patterns are clustered according to the output space of the problem, i.e., natural clusters are formed based on patterns belonging to each class. A combinatorial optimization problem is therefore formed, which is solved using evolutionary algorithms. The evolutionary algorithms identify the "easy" and the "difficult" clusters in the system. The removal of the easy patterns then gives way to the focused learning of the more complicated patterns. Incrementally, neural networks are added to the ensemble to focus on solving successively difficult examples. The problem therefore becomes recursively simpler. Over fitting is overcome by using a set of validation patterns along with a pattern distributor. An algorithm is also proposed to use the pattern distributor to determine the optimal number of recursions and hence the optimal number of weak learners for the problem. In this paper, we show that the generalization accuracy of the proposed algorithm is always better than that of the underlying weak learner. Empirical studies show generally good performance when compared to other state-of-the- art methods.},

Using fuzzy mechanism, a set of fuzzy rules are used to model their complicated relationships, in order to effectively direct the online self-adaptive adjustments, such as changing the crossover and mutation probabilities, and thus to improve the optimizing capability and convergence speed. Numerical simulation tests for a typical optimization problem illustrate the advantages of the new GA against another self-adaptive GA which is based on explicit mathematical modeling of the key factors.},

Traditionally, the balance of exploitation and exploration ability of a PSO algorithm is usually shown empirically by the final result of the algorithm over some benchmark functions and not by the dynamic behavior of the swarm during the iteration process. In order to observe the dynamic behavior of the swarm in a PSO algorithm in details, two measurement indices, Dispersion Index and Velocity Index, are proposed. In an empirical study, these indices are embedded in two PSO Algorithms and applied to six benchmark problems. The results of this study indicate that a good balance between exploration and exploitation does lead to a better PSO. This balance could be achieved by allowing enough time or iteration step for both exploration and exploitation processes to take place. Finally, the utilization of these indices to balance strategy for exploitation and exploration on the PSO is discussed. It is also suggested that the velocity index can be used as a basis for controlling the length of iteration step of PSO algorithm.},

Currently, one of the state-of-the-art RCGAs for function optimization is called the G3-PCX algorithm. However, its performance for solving multimodal problems is known to be poor compared with its performance for unimodal problems. In G3-PCX, the main problem primarily stems from premature convergence to local rather than global optima due to lack of explorative capabilities of the algorithm. As the G3-PCX algorithm relies completely on crossover for promoting diversity, this paper proposes a multilevel mutation operator to augment the algorithm's capability of escaping local optima. The proposed algorithm is called G3M2 (G3-PCX with Multilevel Mutation) and empirical tests on four benchmark multimodal test functions have shown highly competitive performance. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the proposed multilevel mutation is able to improve the precision accuracy of G3-PCX in solving multimodal function optimization problems. In three of the four problems, G3M2 outperformed the standard G3-PCX algorithm in terms of solution quality. Thus, the multilevel combination of non-adaptive, adaptive and self-adaptive parameter control strategies into a single paradigm is empirically shown to have beneficial effects for enhancing the effectiveness of the G3-PCX algorithm for solving multimodal optimization problems in terms of solution quality.},

  abstract =	{Gaussian models are widely adopted in continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). In this paper, we analyze continuous EDAs and show that they don't always work because of computation error: covariance matrix of Gaussian model can be ill-posed and Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix will fail under specific conditions. It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs. Even some EDA's performance that was previously thought inefficient can be improved surprisingly with the help of CMR. CMR can also guarantee those EDAs to be used with small scale of population (but still should be large enough to find the global optimum) to accelerate the convergence rate while maintaining the quality of solutions.},

Mathematically, measurement-based load modeling problem are closely related to the parameter identification area. Consequently, an efficient optimization method is needed to derive the load model parameters based on the feedback of estimation errors between the measurements and model outputs. This paper reports our work on applying genetic algorithms on measurement-based load modeling research. Due to its robustness to the initial guesses on the load model parameters, genetic algorithms are very suitable for load model parameter identification. Two cases including both the real measurement in a power station and the digital simulation are studied in the paper. For comparison purpose, the classical nonlinear least square estimation method is also applied to find the load model parameters. The simulated outputs from the load model confirm the efficiency of genetic algorithms in measurement-based load modeling analysis. Future work will focus on fastening the converging speed of the genetic algorithms, and/or utilizing more efficient evolutionary computation methods.},

The average time complexity is a crucial criterion that measures the performance of the stochastic algorithms. In the past few years, various kinds of EDAs have been proposed, but the related theoretical study on the time complexity of these algorithms is relatively few. This paper analyzed the time complexity of two early versions of EDA, the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) and the Incremental UMDA (IUMDA). We generalize the concept of convergence to convergence time, and manage to estimate the upper bound of the mean First Hitting Times (FHTs) of UMDA (IUMDA) on a well-known pseudo-modular function, which is frequently studied in the field of genetic algorithms. Our analysis shows that UMDA (IUMDA) has O(n) behaviors on the pseudo-modular function. In addition, we analyze the mean FHT of IUMDA on a hard problem. Our result shows that IUMDA may spend exponential generations to find the global optimum. This is the first time that the mean first hitting times of UMDA (IUMDA) are theoretically studied.},

The variety of types of algorithms for which this sort of "greedy transformation" has proven effective, and the range of successful applications, prompts us to look more closely at how such transformations may also make good solutions easier to find.

We have already proposed a bucket brigade algorithm and a procedure for choosing what to learn depending on the frequency of events with the aim of facilitating real-time learning while a game is in progress. We have also proposed a hybrid system configuration that combines existing algorithm strategies with a classifier system, and we have reported on the effectiveness of this hybrid system. This paper proposes applying genetic algorithms to the search for rewards in reinforcement learning where designers have hitherto used empirical trial-and-error methods. By pitting this new technique against an existing soccer game with algorithms designed by humans, we demonstrate the possibility of using genetic algorithms to automate the setting of rewards from the viewpoint of achieving a greater success rate and faster convergence than in cases where the success rewards for each play are set by the designers based on trial and error.},

The number of function evaluations needed for finding the point of optimum is significantly reduced with this procedure, what makes the proposed methodology suitable for dealing with costly blackbox optimization problems.

Several types of fluorescent probes and detection mechanisms are currently employed in real-time PCR, including SYBR Green, molecular beacons, and hybridization probes. Based on the new approach, real-time amplification performed using the TaqMan probes is adopted, as the TaqMan detection mechanism can be exploited for the design and development of the proposed readout approach. In this study, double-stranded DNA molecules of length 140 basepairs are selected as the input molecules, which represent the solving path for an HPP instance. These input molecules are prepared via the self-assembly of 20-mer and 30-mer singlestranded DNAs, by parallel overlap assembly. The proposed readout approach consists of two steps: real-time amplification in vitro using TaqMan-based real-time PCR, followed by information processing in silico to assess the results of real-time amplification, which in turn, enables extraction of the Hamiltonian path. The experimental result is compared with that of previously implementation on Roche LightCycler System. Experimental results establish an easier method to interpret the output of real-time PCR for the subsequent in silico information processing.},

These controllers are able to grow, learn, and adapt to different tasks. We use a PC cluster and a physically realistic simulator of a robotic hand to synthesize grasping from random movements. We present the "ligand-receptor" concept that can be used by artificial evolution to explore (a) the growth of a neural network, (b) value systems, and (c) learning mechanisms for a given task (grasping). Different objects require different grasps, when we pick up a glass, manipulate a screwdriver, or turn the pages of a book, our fingers move very differently. The position of the hand also varies. That is a fundamental problem for a robot, because it either needs to be pre-programmed to handle every object it might encounter in the future and its possible orientations, or it must be able to learn to adjust its grasp according to what it sees and feels. Thus why a neural controller should be capable to explore its own movement capabilities, reconfigure itself to cope with environmental and morphological changes, and coherently adapt its behavior to new situations. The results show that this self exploratory activity can make the robot more robust and adaptive, and that grasping can be produced from totally random and independent movements of the fingers generated intrinsically by the neural controller.},

Genetic algorithm is then used to search solutions of nonlinear programming. Four databases (one transcriptomics, one proteomics, and two breast cancers) were used to test the algorithm and six other well-known methods. Parallel computing based on island model was also experimented. The results show that the algorithm could identify most similar patterns in the database with high precision.

Two cooperative populations are constructed and evolved by independent differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The purpose of the first population is to minimize the objective function regardless of constraints, and that of the second population is to minimize the violation of constraints regardless of the objective function. Interaction and migration happens between the two populations when separate evolutions go on for several iterations, by migrating feasible solutions into the first group, and infeasible ones into the second group. Then, a Gaussian mutation is applied to the individuals when the best solution keep unchanged for several generations. The algorithm is tested by five famous benchmark problems, and is compared with methods based on penalty functions, co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (COGA), and co-evolutionary differential evolution algorithm (CODE). The results proved the proposed cooperative MCODE is very effective and efficient.},

A generator agent's profit depends on market price and scheduled dispatch quantity, both of which are uncertain due to competition among generators and demand fluctuation. An agent model with risk consideration is proposed where risk with respect to a bid action is measured as standard deviation or VaR of the profit obtained after performing the action. Instead of solely expected return, the weighted sum of expected return and risk is thereby defined as a bid action's value based on which actions are evaluated and selected. The model is applied to market simulation with discriminatory pricing and uniform pricing rules. Our experiment demonstrated that uniform pricing leads to higher variance in market price than discriminatory pricing when demand is high and uncertain.},

To the best knowledge of the authors', very few work has been done on improving the performance of EDA under small population size. This paper illustrates why EDA does not work well under small population size and proposes a novel approach termed as Over-Selection to boost EDA under small population size.

Based on the fact many bins are zero-height, we propose a novel method that can learn the multivariatedependency histogram based probabilistic graphical model with acceptable polynomial computational complexity. Several strategies previously used in the HEDA are combined into the new algorithm to improve the convergence and diversity.

The aircraft dynamics model allows the computation of fuel use, throttle, and velocity at different time instants throughout the path. A rigorous model validation is carried out prior to using the model for optimal path identification. An evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize the path distance and threat exposure encountered by the UAV for a mission. The optimization algorithm is a stochastic, zero order, elitist method similar in many respects to Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) but includes explicit diversity maintaining mechanism in both the objective and variable space.

This metric is motivated on two reasoning principles: (i) the Pareto-surface is an object that is to be described via sample sets, in a sense that is similar to the sampled function description in signal processing; and (ii) the resolution that is to be employed in the Pareto-surface sample set depends on the decision-making procedure resolution, instead of the surface structure itself.

This paper deals with a novel real-world optimization problem, called the 'Item-location assignment problem', faced by a logistics company in Shenzhen, China. The objective of the company in this particular operation is to assign items to suitable locations such that the sum of the total traveling time of the workers required for all orders is minimized. We propose to use a stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) to solve this operational problem. In GA, a specially designed crossover operation, called a shift and uniform based multi-point (SUMP) crossover, and swap mutation are adopted. Furthermore, the role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover and mutation rates after each ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLGA and make a comparison with the FLGA through simulations, several search methods, branch and bound, standard GA (i.e. without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, and tabu search, are adopted. Results show that the FLGA outperforms the other search methods in the considered scenario.},

Several GA-based approaches have been reported for the JSSP. Among them, there is a parameter-free genetic algorithm (PfGA) for JSSP proposed by Matsui et al., based on an extended version of PfGA, which uses random keys for representing permutation of operations in jobs, and uses a hybrid scheduling for decoding a permutation into a schedule. They reported that their algorithm performs well for typical benchmark problems, but the experiments were limited to a small number of problem instances. This paper shows the results of an empirical performance evaluation of the GA for a wider range of problem instances. The results show that the GA performs well for many problem instances, and the performance can be improved greatly by increasing the number of subpopulations in the parallel distributed version.},

However, arriving at the optimum configuration for the interest management scheme is a challenging and complex problem. The customary approach is to configure parameters in an adhoc manner (supported by experience). However, such an approach is unlikely to yield optimum system performance. Here we propose a means of finding optimal parameter values by way of a simulation tool equipped with evolutionary optimization capabilities.

Discretization is a process of transforming a continuous attribute value into a finite number of intervals and assigning each interval to a discrete numerical value. However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. In this paper we present an association rule mining algorithm that is suited for continuous valued attributes commonly found in scientific and statistical databases. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named "Genetic Network Programming (GNP)" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP represents its individuals using graph structures and evolve them in order to find a solution; this feature contributes to creating quite compact programs and implicitly memorizing past action sequences. In the proposed method using GNP, the significance of the extracted association rule is measured by the use of the chi-squared test and only important association rules are stored in a pool all together through generations. Results of experiments conducted on a real life database suggest that the proposed method provides an effective technique for handling continuous attributes.},

We carry out a range of experiments on different binary indicators: Those used in IBEA experiments, and also the indicators derived from classical Pareto ranking methods taken from well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms of the literature. Experiments show that the best results are obtained using selection indicators which are not only based on Pareto dominance relation. Moreover, the generic local search algorithm presented in this paper and the proposed indicators obtain promising results which lead to a number of future research directions.},

When all the objectives of supply chain are combined they work towards a common goal of increasing the profitability of an organization. The supply chain model is thus multi-objective in nature which involves several conflicting objectives. A three-stage supply chain problem (involving a network of supplier, plant and customer zones) is solved using Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm in this work. Three cases of objective functions are considered in this study. Pareto optimal solutions are obtained for each case. The results are compared with those reported using NSGA-II in the literature.},

Unlike previous EDAs that use probability density function(PDF), the estimation mechanism used in the proposed framework is the k-nearest neighbor estimation which can perform better with relative small amount of training samples.

The system to be reverse engineered is typically a sensor. Design documents for the sensor are not available and conditions prevent the sensor from being taken apart. The sensor is used to create a database of input signals and output measurements. Rules about the likely design properties of the sensor are collected from experts. The rules are used to create a fitness function for the genetic program. Genetic program based data mining is then conducted. This procedure incorporates not only the experts' rules into the fitness function, but also the information in the database. The information extracted through this process is the internal design specifications of the sensor. Significant experimental and theoretical results related to GP based data mining for reverse engineering and the related uncertainties will be provided.},

  abstract =	{Hardware-software co-synthesis is a key step of future design of embedded systems. It involves three interdependent subproblems: allocation of resources, assignment of tasks to resources, and scheduling the execution of tasks. Both assignment and scheduling are known to be NP-complete. So it is a really hard and challenging task to optimization algorithms. Both heuristic and evolutionary algorithms are commonly used in real world. Heuristic algorithms converge rapidly but often be trapped in local minima and evolutionary algorithms own high exploration capacity but become time-consuming when handling large-scale systems. In this paper, a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm, called Hybrid Quantum probabilistic coding Genetic Algorithm, is proposed to implement the co-synthesis of large scale multiprocessor embedded systems, in which a heuristic algorithm is combined with the Quantum probabilistic coding Genetic Algorithm to enhance the performance on the hard task. The experimental results show that HQGA has better performance than both HA and QGA on large scale HW/SW co-synthesis problems.},

Evolutionary algorithms have been quite successful in solving a wide class of intractable problems and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is a popular choice. However, like any other evolutionary algorithms, the rate of convergence of NSGA-II slows down with generations and often there is no improvement in the best candidate solution over a number of generations. The simplex search component comes into effect once the basic evolutionary algorithm encounters a slow rate of convergence. To allow exploitation around multiple promising regions, the simplex search is invoked from multiple promising regions of the variable space identified using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. In this paper, results are presented for a series of unconstrained optimization test problems that cover problems with a single minimum, a few minima and a large number of minima. Provided is a comparison of results with NSGA-II, Fast Evolutionary Strategy (FES), Fast Evolutionary Programming (FEP) and Improved Fast Evolutionary Programming (IFEP) where it's clear that SSEA outperforms all other algorithms for unimodal problems. On the suite of problems with large number of minima, SSEA performs better on some of them. For problems with fewer minima, SSEA performs better than FES, FEP and IFEP while demonstrating comparable performance to NSGA-II.},

However, RPU in the car-rental industry suffers serious nonlinearity. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been successfully applied to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This study elucidates the feasibility of using SVR to forecast RPU. Moreover, the parameters of a SVR model are derived using the immune algorithm (IA). Subsequently, RPU data from DTAG (Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, USA) are used to illustrate the proposed SVRIA (support vector regression with immune algorithm) model. The empirical results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the other two models, namely the Holt-Winters (HW) model and the seasonal HW (SHW) model. Consequently, the SVRIA model provides a promising alternative method of forecasting RPU.},

The ability of agents in noisy environments to cooperate was significantly enhanced over evolutionary time with substantial gains in cooperation made after the 3000<sup>th</sup> generation. Also, evolution in the presence of noise was found to significantly improve an agent's competitive ability.

By this approach, we can describe the global landscape after derivation of optimization. To achieve the proposed optimization strategy, three distinguished optimization algorithms are introduced: DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles), GAs (Genetic Algorithms), and SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming). To integrate these three algorithms, each algorithm, especially DIRECT, was modified and developed. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm was examined through numerical experiments. From these experiments, not only the optimum point but also the information of the landscape was determined. The information of the landscape verified the reliability of optimization results.},

The fitness of the solution has to be evaluated each time. Since fitness evaluation is the most computationally intensive process in the execution of the GA, revisits should be minimized or eliminated. In this paper, a novel dynamic binary partitioning tree archive is proposed to eliminate all revisits. It works as follows: When the GA generates a solution, the tree is accessed. A leaf node is appended to the tree if the solution has not been visited before and so has no record in the tree. Otherwise, a search is initiated from the leaf node that is the duplicate to the solution to find the nearest neighbor solution in the search space that is not visited. During this process, whole sub-trees may be pruned if all the leaf nodes it contains are visited. The search naturally implements a self adaptive mutation mechanism. Hence the GA requires no other mutation parameter or mutation scheme. Experimental results reveal that this new GA is superior in performance compared with the standard GA with revisits, and the tree archive is not memory intensive.},

Firstly, we attain the cost of raw materials by Bill of Material (BOM) from orders. Secondly, the producing procedure of the luggage is to use One-Dimensional Typesetting Algorithm to solve the problem of fabric cutting. Finally, we combine the IATS with mobile phone to offer an effective Quick Response/Efficient Consumer Response (QR/ECR). Hence, users can look up the minimal cost of raw materials and received the quote rapidly. The result shows that the overall average utility rate of fabric typesetting was 95.32% in IATS. It is not only to enhance the efficiency of utility rate for luggage material but also to save plenty of human resources for luggage factories.},

The DASA is also compared to some other ant methods for continuous optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the new approach. Besides this experimental work, the DASA was applied to a real-world problem, where the efficiency of the radial impeller of a vacuum cleaner was optimized.

In this paper, we focus on one aspect of this question: the impact of the choice of the test instances on the metaheuristic performances and the possible link with the fitness landscape structure. We base our experimental framework on the arc crossing minimization problem for layered digraphs. We compare a hybridized genetic algorithm and a multistart descent which are among the best approaches to this problem. We worked on two instance families with various sizes and structural complexities: small graphs which are easy to draw on a standard size support, and large graphs specifically built for our experiments. We show that, for the smallest instances, there is no significant difference between methods whereas for graphs similar to those classically used nowadays in applications the genetic algorithm is better, and for the largest graphs (with a scaling factor up to 10<sup>300</sup>), the multistart descent is the best method. These results suggest that for "structured" fitness landscapes associated with real-life instances the GA exploits its implicit learning. On the other hand for very large landscapes with probably numerous local optima, only one exploration on a larger scale can be provided by local searches from a random starting point, cheap in computing effort.},

The tactile system comprises a small matrix of sensors for detecting deformation of a tactile surface. The determination of contact state is completed using both simulated and experimental inputs. Because the system relies on few sensing positions hence a robust interpreting algorithm plays a vital role. The study involves the identification of the position of a pointed load for a range between 200-600 g which can be applied across the surface. The performance in determining the position is described in the form of absolute deviation from the actual applied position. The simulation result indicates that the multilayer perceptron is the best inference technique while the GP-based mapping model produces a better result in an experiment with a high load. The difference between the simulation and the experiment is the result of an inability of the simulation model at capturing true plate deflection characteristics.},

Indeed, the classical genetic algorithms (GAs) deals with operations on the whole population through all generations. These operations are performed during the evolution towards the best individual or solution of the considered combinatorial problem. In our approach, each individual participates to the evolutionary process uniquely during some iterations. There is no generation where all individuals are created at the same time and disappear at the same time at the end of the evolutionary process genation.

In our approach, each individual owns one lifespan represented by a number of cycles which are affected to it randomly at its birth and at the end of which it disappears from the population. Consequently, only certain individuals of the population are evaluated within each iteration of the algorithm and not all the population. This causes the substantial reduction of the total running time of the algorithm since the evaluations of all individuals of each generation necessitates more than 80% of the total running time of a classical GA.

This approach has been developed with the goal to present a new and efficient parallel scheme of the classical GA with better performances in terms of running time.  In this paper, we will present a new asynchronous parallel Master/Slave scheme of the GA and will show the power of our approach with the classification extraction rules problem.},

Little has been done to understand the performance of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on problems with a larger number of objectives. It is unclear whether the conclusions drawn from the experiments on problems with a small number of objectives could be generalised to those with a large number of objectives. In fact, some of our preliminary work [1] has indicated that such generalisation may not be possible. This paper first presents a comprehensive set of experimental studies, which show that the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, such as NSGA-II and SPEA2, deteriorates substantially as the number of objectives increases. NSGA-II, for example, did not even converge for problems with six or more objectives. This paper analyses why this happens and proposes several new methods to improve the convergence of NSGA-II for problems with a large number of objectives. The proposed methods categorise members of an archive into small groups (non-dominated solutions with or without domination), using dominance relationship between the new and existing members in the archive. New removal strategies are introduced. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods clearly outperform NSGA-II in terms of convergence.},

Finally, partial subproblems solutions are recomposed into a solution of the original problem. Our results focus on the COST-259 MI-FAP instances, for which some good assignments produced by local search meta-heuristics are widely available. However, standard implementations do not usually produce the best performance and, in particular, no good results have been previously obtained using evolutionary techniques. We show that problem decomposition can improve standard heuristics, both in terms of solution quality and runtime. Furthermore, genetic algorithms seem to benefit more from this approach, showing a higher percentage improvement, therefore reducing the gap with other local search methods.},

A highly accurate prediction is essential to ensure the quality of these decisions. Time series forecasting is based on historical data and the predictions are usually made using statistical methods. These characteristics make the forecasting problem an interesting application of Machine learning techniques, especially for Boosting techniques and Genetic Programming. Boosting techniques currently receive a lot of attention; they combine predictions from different forecasting methods as a procedure to improve the accuracy. This paper explores Genetic Programming (GP) and Boosting technique to obtain an ensemble of regressors and proposes a new formula for the updating of the weights and for the final hypothesis. This new formula is based on the correlation coefficient instead of the loss function used by traditional boosting algorithms, this new algorithm is called Boosting using Correlation Coefficient (BCC). To validate this method, experiments were accomplished using real, financial and artificial series generated by Monte Carlo Simulation. The results obtained by using this new methodology were compared with the results obtained from GP, GPBoost and the traditional statistical methodology (ARMA). The results show advantages in the use of the proposed approach.},

  abstract =	{For a mobile robot to move in a known environment and operate successfully, first it needs to robustly determine its initial position and orientation relative to the map, and then update its position while moving in the environment. Thus determining robot's position is one of the most important tasks in mobile robotics. This task consists of "global localization" and "robot's pose tracking". In this paper two recent sample-based evolutionary methods for globally localizing the position of a mobile robot are proposed. The first method is a modified version of genetic algorithm called Differential Evolution (DE) which is based on natural selection. The second one is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is based on bird flocking. DE evaluates initial population using the probabilistic motion and observation models and the evolution of the individuals is performed by evolutionary operators. PSO adjusts the velocity and location of particles towards target (robot's pose) through a problem space on the basis of information about each particle's previous best location and the best previous location of its neighbors. Our results illustrate the excellence of these two methods over standard Monte Carlo localization algorithm with regard to convergence rate, speed and computational cost.},

At the same time, significant advances have been made in the deployment of stochastic heuristics for function optimization. This paper reports on the use of Differential Evolution (DE) for solving bi-level programming problems with applications in the field of transportation planning. After illustrating our solution algorithm with some mathematical functions, we then apply this method to two control problems facing the transportation network manager. DE is integrated with conventional traffic assignment techniques to solve the resulting bi-level program. Numerical computations of this DE based algorithm (known as DEBLP) are presented and compared with existing results.

As an extension of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) operate similar to EAs, except during fitness evaluations. In this paper, we focus on genetic variation operations of a CCEA: mutations. We present how to bias mutations in cooperative coevolution and compare the performance of a CCEA adopting biasing mutations (CCEA-BM) and a conventional CCEA in which all individuals are encoded in binary representations. Our experimental study shows that biasing mutations can improve the performance of a CCEA on function optimization, in particular when high orders of binary representations are used.},

First, we define two kinds of pheromone and three kinds of heuristic information to guide the search direction of ants for this bi-criteria problem. Each ant uses either one from these heuristic types and pheromone types in each iteration based on the probabilities controlled by two parameters. These two parameters are adaptively adjusted in the process of the algorithm. Second, we use the information of partial solutions to modify the bias of ants so that inferior choices will be ignored. Moreover, the experimental results in 3 workflow applications under different deadline constraints show that the performance of our algorithm is very promising, for it outperforms the Deadline-MDP algorithm in most cases.},

A significant number of these uncertainty problems fall into the dynamic optimization category. For this class of problems, an evolutionary algorithm is expected to perform well under different levels and frequencies of change in the landscape. In addition, the dynamic evolutionary algorithm should warrant an acceptable performance improvement to justify the additional computational cost. Effective reuse of previous evolutionary information is a must as it facilitates a faster convergence after a change has occurred.

This paper introduces a new dynamic evolutionary algorithm that uses variable relocation vectors to adapt already converged or currently evolving individuals to the new environmental condition. The proposed algorithm relocates those individuals based on their change in functional value due to the change in the environment and the average sensitivities of their decision variables to the corresponding change in the objective space. The relocated population is shown to be better fit to the new environment than the original or any other randomly generated population. The algorithm has been tested for several dynamic benchmark problems and has shown better results.},

  abstract =	{In neural network optimization, multiple goals and constraints cannot be handled independently of the underlying optimizer. While "better" solutions should be rated higher than "worse" ones, the resulting cost landscapes must also comply with requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface. The genetic algorithm (GA), which has found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, is a random search technique which requires the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or fitness, to candidate solutions. This paper proposes that the fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision-making framework, based on goals and priority, is subsequently formulated in term of fuzzy reasoning and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Since the GA is a random search process and therefore takes more time to find a solution in the problem domain, a proper search direction is required in order to produce an optimum result. Fuzzy logic cannot provide an exact solution but can be used as a useful tool for reasoning. In this paper, the reasoning capability of fuzzy logic is used to provide a proper direction for genetic search in a problem domain and thus to achieve faster convergence in the GA. The effectiveness of this is shown in neural network optimization applied to dynamic modelling of an experimental flexible manipulator. The results show that the new fuzzy logic approach is superior to conventional exploration of the genetic search region.},

Our method, called implicit alternative splicing (iAS), is repeatedly applied to the individual encodings in the algorithm's population and inverts randomly chosen segments of decreasing size in a systematic fashion. Its goal is to determine the largest possible segment the inversion of which yields no loss in the encoding's quality. The application of iAS potentially produces a new encoding of equal or greater quality that is maximum possible Hamming distance from its source. This allows iAS to uphold the diversity of the population even if a minimal population size is chosen. This significantly improves the performance of an otherwise standard GA on a representative set of three different optimisation problems. Empirical results are compared and analysed and future work prospects are considered.},

They assumed that players were distributed across a two-dimensional lattice, and interactions between players occurred locally, rather than at long range, as in the well mixed situation. The resulting spatial evolutionary games display dynamics not seen in there well-mixed counterparts. An assumption underlying much of the work on spatial evolutionary games is that the state of all players is updated in unison or in synchrony. Using the framework outline in [1], we examine the effect of various asynchronous updating schemes on the dynamics of spatial evolutionary games. There are potential implications for the dynamics of a wide variety of spatially extended systems in physics, biology and chemistry.},

The problem, however, is of great significance since many of the real world systems can be treated as multi-agent systems with decentralized control. In this article, the authors propose an approximate algorithm for the problem based on a genetic algorithm. First, the problem is formalized using Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. Then a way of representing a solution (joint policy) in a chromosome is introduced and a genetic algorithm is proposed as a search mechanism. Finally, a multi-agent tiger problem is used as an experimental framework to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

A shortest time route with route information sharing strategy (ST-RIS) is believed to be one of the solutions for a novel CNS based on bilateral information shared among automobile agents. The question of which strategy is most appropriate for solving urban traffic congestion can be seen as a social dilemma, since the social holistic utility is opposite to each agent's individual utility. The presented model shows that this social dilemma is observed as a typical Chicken type dilemma, or as a typical Minority Game, where an agent who has adopted a minority strategy can earn more utility than other strategies. Consequently, the model has illustrated that ST-pRIS, which is a further advanced strategic form of ST-RIS, where only partial information is shared among agents, has a moderate potential to be diffused in a society from the viewpoint of the evolutionary game theory.},

One of the most important problems about this system is to obtain the optimal component arrangement that maximizes the system reliability. In order to obtain the exact solution for this problem, one needs to calculate n! system reliabilities. As n increases, however, the amount of calculation would be too large to obtain the solution within a reasonable computing time. In this paper, we propose four kinds of genetic algorithms to obtain quasi optimal solutions. They employ the ordinal representation scheme we have developed on the basis of ideas that eliminates arrangements with the same system reliabilities produced by rotation and/or reversal of certain arrangements, and allocates components with low failure probabilities at equal intervals. We have compared their performances and investigated how many components with low failure probabilities should be allocated at equal intervals to obtain good solution through the numerical experiments.},

Differential evolution has been successfully applied to solve electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. However, it is noted that the performance of differential evolution strongly depends on its intrinsic control parameters, namely, population size, mutation intensity, and crossover probability. A parametric study on differential evolution based on benchmark electromagnetic inverse scattering problem is therefore carried out. The findings presented here should be highly beneficial to future applicants of differential evolution in the community of electromagnetic inverse scattering problems. Such findings may be directly or indirectly applicable to researchers in other areas.},

ODE utilizes opposite numbers in the population initialization and generation jumping to accelerate Differential Evolution (DE). Instead of opposite numbers, in this work, quasi opposite points are used. So, we call the new extension Quasi- Oppositional DE (QODE). The proposed mathematical proof shows that in a black-box optimization problem quasi- opposite points have a higher chance to be closer to the solution than opposite points. A test suite with 15 benchmark functions has been employed to compare performance of DE, ODE, and QODE experimentally. Results confirm that QODE performs better than ODE and DE in overall.

Various genetic operators were used to search the combinatorial space of evolutionary trees, and a Pareto set was obtained. The implications of the common evolutionary subtrees to all trees found on the Pareto set are that the first codon sites play a far more important role in determining the optimal tree for these data.

The fitness estimation is always made, but, should the reliability of this fitness estimation drop below a user specified threshold, the estimate is discarded and a true fitness evaluation performed. Results are presented for three problems that show that the number of true fitness evaluations can be significantly reduced by this method without degrading the performance of PSO. Further the value used for the threshold, the only new parameter introduced, is shown not to be sensitive, at least on these test problems. Provided that the time to perform a true fitness evaluation is far longer than the time for the fitness and reliability calculations, a substantial amount of computing time can be saved while still achieving the same end result.},

The indirect representation of multiple alignments, namely, the guide tree representation of chromosomes, and the proper genetic operations make searching drastically efficient.

A recombination operator to handle a set representation that can generate offspring topologies that can be different from the parents is also proposed. Depending on the physical problem being solved, one can introduce specific operators which will aid the optimization process. One such mutation operator is used for the truss design to reduce the number of elements, hence finding the smallest feasible topology for the truss structure.

Since unnecessary resources used in computation iterations should be avoided, the determination of a proper termination condition for the algorithms is desirable.

  abstract =	{In this study, a total sliding-mode-based particle swarm optimization control (TSPSOC) scheme is designed for the periodic motion control of an indirect field-oriented linear induction motor (LIM) drive. First, an indirect field-oriented mechanism for a LIM drive is introduced to preserve the decoupling control characteristic. Then, the concept of total sliding-mode control (TSC) is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form an on-line TSPSOC framework for preserving the robust control characteristics and reducing the chattering control phenomena of TSC. Moreover, an adaptive inertial weight is devised to accelerate the searching speed effectively. In this control scheme, a PSO control system is utilized to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TSC without strict constraint and detailed system knowledge. Numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories. In addition, the superiority of the proposed TSPSOC scheme is indicated in comparison with the TSC, Petri fuzzy-neural-network control (PFNNC), and traditional fuzzy-neural -network control (TFNNC) systems.},

The present paper investigates on the use of Bacterial Foraging in identification of nonlinear dynamic systems employing an efficient Functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model. The BFO is a derivative free optimization tool and hence does not permit the solution of connecting weights to fall in local minima. This potential tool is employed in the paper to update the weights of the FLANN model. To assess the performance of the new model simulation studies of both the BFO-FLANN and multilayered ANN (MLANN) identification models are carried out. These experiments reveal that the two models exhibit identical identification performance. But, the proposed model offers low computational complexity and achieves faster convergence compared to its MLANN counterpart.},

We assumed a task in which a CA has to change its global state distinguished by the distribution ratio of cell states after every occurrence of a perturbation period. In the perturbation period, each cell state is modified by using an external rule with a small probability. By conducting evolutionary searches for rules of CAs that can solve this task, we obtained interesting behaviors of CAs in which their global state cyclically transited among different stable states in either ascending or descending order. Detailed analyses showed that such behaviors are due to their self-organizing properties that a drastic change in their global state occurs every when the number of the subsequent dominant cell state goes beyond a certain threshold through occurrences of perturbation periods.},

Genetic Network Programming (GNP), a new evolutionary computation method, is reported to be employed as the elevator group system controller in some studies of recent years. Moreover, reinforcement learning (RL) is also verified to be useful for more improvements of elevator group performances when it is combined with GNP. In this paper, we proposed a new approach of DDES using GNP with RL, and did some experiments on a simulated elevator group system of a typical office building to check its efficiency. Simulation results show that the DDES using GNP with RL performs better than the one without RL in regular and down-peak time, while both of them outperforms a conventional approach and a heuristic approach in all three traffic patterns.},

In this paper, a newly developed point symmetry based distance is used to propose symmetry based versions of six cluster validity indices namely, DB-index, Dunn-index, Generalized Dunn-index, PS-index, I-index and XB-index. These indices provide measures of "symmetricity" of the different partitionings of a data set. A Kd-tree-based data structure is used to reduce the complexity of computing the symmetry distance. A newly developed genetic point symmetry based clustering technique, GAPS-clustering is used as the underlying partitioning algorithm. The number of clusters are varied from 2 to &#8730;n where n is the total number of data points present in the data set and the values of all the validity indices are noted down. The optimum value of a validity index over these &#8730;n-1 partitions corresponds to the appropriate partitioning and the number of partitions as indicated by the validity index. Results on five artificially generated and four real-life data sets show that symmetry distance based I-index performs the best compared to all the other five indices.},

Generative representation schemes, often inspired by biological development, seek to address this by facilitating the discovery and reuse of design dependencies and allowing for adaptable exploration strategies. We present a novel developmental method for optimizing graphs that is based on the notion of directly evolving a hypergraph grammar from which a population of graphs can be derived. A multi-objective design system is established and evaluated on problems from three domains: symbolic regression, circuit design, and neural control. The observed performance compares favorably with existing methods, and extensive reuse of subgraphs contributes to the efficient representation of solutions. Constraints can also be placed on the type of explored graph spaces, ranging from tree to pseudograph. We show that more compact solutions are attainable in less constrained spaces, although convergence typically improves with more constrained designs.},

In contrast to numerical domain, no natural ordering can be found among the elements of a categorical domain. Hence no inherent distance measure, like the Euclidean distance, would work to compute the distance between two categorical objects. Most of the clustering algorithms designed for categorical data are based on optimizing a single objective function. However, a single objective function is often not applicable for different kinds of categorical data sets. Motivated by this fact, in this article, the categorical data clustering problem has been modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem. A popular multiobjective genetic algorithm has been used in this regard to optimize two objectives simultaneously, thus generating a set of non-dominated solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with that of different well known categorical data clustering algorithms and demonstrated for a variety of synthetic and real life categorical data sets. Also a statistical significance test has been performed to establish the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Productions that fail to contribute to selected solutions can be retained for several generations beyond their last use. The ensuing redundancy and its effects are assessed in this paper on two circuit design tasks associated with random number generation: finding a recurrent circuit with maximum period, and reproducing a De Bruijn counter from a set of seed/output pairs. In both instances, increasing redundancy leads to significantly higher success rates, outperforming comparable increases in population size. The results support previous studies that have shown that representational redundancy can be beneficial to evolutionary search. However, redundancy promotes an increase in further redundancy by encouraging the creation of large offspring, the evaluation of which is computationally costly. This observation should generalize to any unconstrained variablelength representation and therefore represents a notable drawback of redundancy in evolution.},

The routers tend to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily; thus, the network's wireless topology may change fast and unpredictably. Nowadays, these networks are having a great influence due to the fact that they can create networks without a specific infrastructure. In MANETs message broadcasting is critical to network existence and organization. The broadcasting strategy in MANETs can be optimized by defining a multiobjective problem whose inputs are the broadcasting algorithm's parameters and whose objectives are: reaching as many stations as possible, minimizing the network utilization, and reducing the makespan. The network can be simulated to obtain the expected response to a given set of parameters. In this paper, we face this multiobjective problem with two algorithms: Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization and ESN (Evolution Strategy with NSGAII). Both algorithms are able to find an accurate approximation to the Paretooptimal front that is the solution of the problem. ESN improves the results of MOPSO in terms of the set coverage and hypervolume metrics used for comparison.},

By applying the EC-based similarity measurement on polygon descriptors which were trained by stock market data during different periods, the similarity of corresponding stock market behavior can be analyzed. To demonstrate the representation capabilities of the proposed polygon descriptor, Taiwan stock market data from 1986 to 2006 are used.

This idea is applied to differential evolution, which is known to be an efficient and robust algorithm and DE<sup>d</sup>(Differential Evolution with Degeneration) is proposed. To show the advantage of DE<sup>d</sup>, it is applied to the structural learning of a simple test function and neural networks.

The process of rotating each joint independently is known as forward kinematics (FK). One way to simplify this process is to automatically calculate the angles required for a given joint (known as the end-effector) to reach a goal position - this process is known as inverse kinematics (IK). In this paper an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is proposed as a solution to inverse kinematics. Several extensions are also proposed to allow extra constraints to be included, such as obstacle avoidance and angular joint limits. This approach is called Evolutionary Motion IK (E-MOTION IK).},

Increases in the number of design variables usually result in a wide variety of optimum solutions. However, when the flexibilities of some design variables are small, the contributions of these design variables are also very small. This means that the same Pareto-optimal solutions can be derived without these parameters. Therefore, it is very important to find the flexibility of the design variables to the Pareto-optimal solutions. To find the flexibility, the values of one of the design variables are changed, while those of the remaining parameters are fixed. In this procedure, it is very important to determine the fixed values. We describe these procedures to determine the flexibility of the design variable to the Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we illustrate using the diesel engine fuel emission scheduling problem that the Paretooptimal solutions can be derived with only the design variables whose flexibilities are high.},

A new constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm by using good point set (COEAGP) is presented in this paper. In the process of population evolution, multi-objective optimization techniques and good point set in number theory are integrated into our algorithm. The approach transforms COP into a bi-objective optimization problem firstly. Then the crossover operator is designed by using the principle of good point set. The purpose of the new crossover is to enrich the exploration and exploitation abilities of the approach proposed. The new crossover operator can produce a small but representative set of points as the potential offspring. After that the BGA mutation operator is applied to potential offspring for enhancing the diversity of the potential offspring population. Furthermore, the update operator incorporates Pareto dominance and the tournament selection operator to choose the best individuals in the current offspring for the next generation. The new approach is tested on 8 well-known benchmark functions, and the empirical evidence suggests that it is robust and efficient when handling linear/nonlinear equality/inequality constraints and that COEAGP outperforms or performs similarly to the other techniques referred in this paper in terms of the quality of the resulting solutions.},

The proposed real-coded variable string length genetic fuzzy clustering technique (Fuzzy-VGAPS) is able to evolve the number of clusters present in the data set automatically. Here assignment of points to different clusters are made based on the point symmetry based distance rather than the Euclidean distance. The cluster centers are encoded in the chromosomes, whose value may vary. A newly developed fuzzy point symmetry based cluster validity index, FSym-index, is used as a measure of 'goodness' of the corresponding partition. This validity index is able to correctly indicate presence of clusters of different sizes as long as they are internally symmetrical. A Kd-tree based data structure is used to reduce the complexity of computing the symmetry distance. The proposed method is applied on several simulated T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density normal and MS lesion magnetic resonance brain images. Superiority of the proposed method over Fuzzy C-means, Expectation Maximization, Fuzzy Variable String Length Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy-VGA) clustering algorithms are demonstrated quantitatively. The automatic segmentation obtained by Fuzzy-VGAPS clustering technique is also compared with the available ground truth information.},

It first divides the chromosomes in a population into k clusters by the k-means clustering approach and evaluates each individual according to its own information and the information of the cluster it belongs to. The final best sets of membership functions in all the populations are then gathered together for mining fuzzy association rules.

  abstract =	{Real life optimization problems often require finding optimal solution to complex high dimensional, multimodal problems involving computationally very expensive fitness function evaluations. Use of a population based iterative technique like evolutionary algorithms in such problem domains is thus practically prohibitive. An attractive alternative is to build surrogates or use an approximation of the actual fitness functions to be evaluated. Many regression and interpolation tools are available to build such meta models. This paper briefly discusses the architectures and use of such meta-modeling tools in an evolutionary optimization context. We further present an evolutionary algorithm framework which involves use of surrogate models for fitness function evaluation. The original framework namely, the Dynamic Approximate Fitness based Hybrid EA (DAFHEA) model [14] reduces computation time by controlled use of meta-models (in this case approximate model generated by Support Vector Machine regression) to partially replace the actual function evaluation by approximate function evaluation. However, the underlying assumption in DAFHEA is that the training samples for the meta-model are generated from a single uniform model. This does not take into account uncertain scenarios involving noisy fitness functions. The enhanced model, DAFHEA-II, incorporates a multiple-model based learning approach for the support vector machine approximator to counter effects of noise [15]. Empirical results obtained by evaluating the frameworks using several benchmark functions (both nonnoisy and noisy versions) are presented.},

It is our view that by not explicitly classing it as such development of this algorithm has been rather held back. Seeing it as a pre-processor allows inspiration to be taken from the machine learning literature where such pre-processors are not uncommon. With this in mind, this paper takes a core feature of many such pre-processors, that of attribute weighting, and applies it to AIRS. The resultant algorithm called WAIRS (Weighted AIRS) uses a weighted distance function during all affinity evaluations. WAIRS is tested on 9 benchmark datasets and is found to outperform AIRS in the majority of cases.},

The objective of optimization is to enhance lubrication within the mould, especially at higher casting speeds, and reduce the intensity of oscillation marks. The need to improve lubrication conditions is primarily addressed by making the mould oscillate on its longitudinal axis. It is known that non-sinusoidal oscillation, where the time for upward motion of the mould is longer than that of downward motion in an oscillation cycle, reduces depth of oscillation marks while providing better lubrication. In the present work, a Genetic Algorithm is applied to optimize the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of the oscillation of the continuous casting mould based on objective functions that maximize the lubrication, and minimize the depth of oscillation marks and the cycle peak friction. Optimization is performed within constraints imposed by machine limits. The objective function and constraints are extracted from an analysis of the physics of oscillation, lubrication and heat transfer within the continuous casting process. The application of the Genetic Algorithm within a unified framework encompassing all oscillation performance metrics and constraints is seen to generate an optimal parameter set that provides better performance than existing oscillation parameters supplied by Original Equipment Manufacturers.},

This algorithm, called h_GACO, is a GA supplemented with ACO in where ACO is implemented to exploit information stored in pheromone trails during genetic operations, i.e. crossover and mutation. The effectiveness of h_GACO is investigated comparing its results with those obtained by five different metaheuristic approaches given in the literature for the ccTP.},

  abstract =	{System identification in noisy environment has been a matter of concern for researchers in many disciplines of science and engineering. In the recent past the Least Mean Square Algorithm (LMS), Genetic Algorithm (GA) etc. have been employed for developing a parallel model. During training by LMS algorithm the weights rattle around and does not converge to optimal solution. This gives rise to poor performance of the model. Although GA always ensures the convergence of the weights to the global optimum but it suffers from slower convergence rate. To alleviate the problem we propose a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for identifying nonlinear systems. The PSO is also a population based derivative free optimization technique like GA, and hence ascertains the convergence of the model parameters to the global optimum, there by yielding the same performance as provided by GA but with a faster speed. Comprehensive computer simulations validate that the PSO based identification is a better candidate even under noisy condition both in terms of convergence speed as well as number of input samples used.},

The objectives of FVRP are the minimization of total number of vehicles in service, total travel distance, and the total waiting time over all vehicles; while maximizing the average grade of customer satisfaction.

Benchmark problem instances classified by geographical distribution of customers are used in experimental studies and results of cooperative coevolutionary GAs are compared with those of panmictic GAs.

Furthermore, a class for which the (1+1)-EA takes exponential optimization time is examined. Nevertheless, given polynomial time, the evolutionary algorithm still produces a better solution than the approximation algorithm. Recently, the existence of an instance class has been proved for which the (1+1)-EA produces poor approximate solutions, given polynomial time.

In addition to developing different kinds of resource discovery algorithms, one approach is to study the different topologies or structures of the P2P network. In many cases topology management is based on either technical characteristics of the peers or their interests based on the previous resource queries. In this paper, we propose a topology management algorithm which does not predetermine favorable values of the characteristics of the peers. The decision whether to connect to a certain peer is done by a neural network, which is trained with an evolutionary algorithm. Characteristics, which are to be taken into account, can be determined by the inputs of the neural network.},

Its computational power was revealed after the introduction of some quantum algorithms such as Grover's search algorithm. Many classical algorithms especially that deal with Error Correcting Codes are introduced to solve an exhaustive search problem. The quantum techniques promise an optimal search speed that is of special importance when the size of the searched domain is quite large.

In this paper we devise the use of quantum search algorithm introduced by Grover to implement the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). Due to lack of resources and the nature of implementing quantum algorithms, only theoretical results are obtained. The use of quantum search algorithm showed that we can reduce the number of search computations exponentially. For example if the classical VA requires 262144 searching operations for a signalling length of 1024 intervals, the quantum algorithm will need only 512 searching operations when Single Search Quantum Viterbi Algorithm (SSQVA) is used. And for the Multi Search Quantum Viterbi Algorithm (MSQVA) it needs 16384 searching operations for the same signalling length.},

However these approaches have not identified an efficient approach to termination of base GA search or a means to balance practical consideration such as quality of solution and the expense of computation. Our Quality time tradeoff operator (QTT) is user defined, and acts as a base level termination operator and also provides a fitness value for the meta-level GA. In this manner the amount of computation time spent on less encouraging configurations can be specified by the user. Our approach has been applied to a computationally intensive test problem which evaluates a large set of configuration settings for the base GAs. This approach should be applicable across a wide range of practical problems (e.g. routing, logistic and biomedical applications).},

The main idea of ES/LMS is to employ the least mean square algorithm to adapt the last layer of network and evolution strategy to optimize the rest of the network.

Hybrid approaches to neural network learning, based on gradient and evolutionary techniques combinations, are aimed to raise the advantages of both approaches mentioned above &#8211; reliable computational requirements of gradient techniques and global search capabilities of evolutionary approaches. In general, neural network hybrid learning approaches are usually "sequential", rather than simultaneous. In the first step, the evolutionary technique is used to locate a promising region in the search space, and then the gradient technique is employed for fine tuning of network parameters in this region. The proposed BP/ES and ES/LMS methods investigate different approach. They perform "spatial" synthesis of gradient and evolutionary techniques, in which the neural network is partitioned into two parts &#8211; output layer versus the other layers &#8211; which are adapted simultaneously, however using these two different methods.

The three objectives of this study was: 1) to test if genetic algorithm optimization is an efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles, 2) can GA be used to generate new puzzles efficiently, and 3) can GA be used as a rating machine that evaluates the difficulty of a given Sudoku puzzle. The last of these objectives is approached by testing if puzzles that are considered difficult for a human solver are also difficult for the genetic algorithm.

In this paper we focus on container classes. They are used in almost every type of software, hence their reliability is of utmost importance. We present novel techniques to generate test data for container classes in an automatic way. A new representation with novel search operators is described and tested. A way to reduce the search space for OO software is presented. This is achieved by dynamically eliminating the functions that cannot give any further help from the search. Besides, the problem of applying the branch distances of disjunctions and conjunctions to OO software is solved. Finally, Hill Climbing, Genetic Algorithms and Memetic Algorithms are used and compared. Our empirical case study shows that our Memetic Algorithm outperforms the other algorithms.},

  abstract =	{Calibrating an evolutionary algorithm (EA) means finding the right values of algorithm parameters for a given problem. This issue is highly relevant, because it has a high impact (the performance of EAs does depend on appropriate parameter values), and it occurs frequently (parameter values must be set before all EA runs). This issue is also highly challenging, because finding good parameter values is a difficult task. In this paper we propose an algorithmic approach to EA calibration by describing a method, called REVAC, that can determine good parameter values in an automated manner on any given problem instance. We validate this method by comparing it with the conventional hand-based calibration and another algorithmic approach based on the classical meta-GA. Comparative experiments on a set of randomly generated problem instances with various levels of multi-modality show that GAs calibrated with REVAC can outperform those calibrated by hand and by the meta-GA.},

The other approach based on stochastic search decouples topology optimization from size optimization and uses a novel material mask overlay strategy that ensures optimal binary design and can be manufactured without any post processing.},

The distribution of these probabilities is learned interactively from the syntax of the Snakebots, exhibiting behavioral traits that according to the human observer are relevant for the emergence of ability to overcome obstacles. Because at the earlier stages of evolution these behavioral traits are not necessarily pertinent to the best performing (i.e. fastest) Snakebots, the user feedback provides the evolution with an additional insight about the promising areas in the fitness landscape. Empirical results verify that employing ILCS improves the efficiency of GP in that the evolved Snakebots are faster than those obtained via canonical GP.},

Such sequences should therefore have a large linear complexity and also a large k-error linear complexity. Efficient algorithms for computing the k- error linear complexity of a sequence over a finite field only exist for sequences of period equal to a power of the characteristic of the field. It is therefore useful to find a general and efficient algorithm to compute a good approximation of the k-error linear complexity. In this paper we investigate the design of a genetic algorithm to approximate the k-error linear complexity of a sequence. Our preliminary experiments show that the genetic algorithm approach is suitable to the problem and that a good scheme would use a medium sized population, an elitist type of selection, a special design of the two point random crossover and a standard random mutation. The algorithm outputs an approximative value of the k-error linear complexity which is on average only 19.5% higher than the exact value. This paper intends to be a proof of concept that the genetic algorithm technique is suitable for the problem in hand and future research will further refine the choice of parameters. },

So we optimize the fuzzy clustering using Predator Prey Particle Swarm Optimizations (PPPSO). The concept of PPPSO is that predators chase the center of prey's swarm, and preys escape from predators, in order to avoid local optimal solutions and find global optimal solution efficiently.

   The performance of fuzzy c-means (FCM), particle swarm fuzzy clustering (PSFC) and predator prey particle swarm fuzzy clustering (PPPSFC) are compared. Through experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm has the best performance among them.},

This required the GA to be adapted to a multi-processor structure, so that the scalability of the computation is maximised. The best solutions of each run enter the ensemble of calibrated models, which is finally analysed using a clustering algorithm. The aim is to identify the optimal regions contained in the ensemble and thus to reveal the distinct types of reservoir models consistent with the historic production data, as a way to assess the uncertainty in the Reservoir Characterisation due to the limited reliability of optimisation algorithms. The developed methodology is applied to the char- acterisation of a real petroleum reservoir. Results show a large improvement with respect to previous studies on that reservoir in terms of the quality and diversity of the obtained calibrated models. Our main conclusion is that, even with regularisation, many distinct calibrated models are possible, which highlights the importance of applying optimisation methods capable of identifying all such solutions.},

Researchers have proposed many approaches for storing tuples in a way that processes benefit from the organization of tuples. Although some progress has been made, most of the proposed solutions fail to address the reverse problem: if most tuples are kept near the processes, the system's robustness is affected; the over-clustering of tuples in particular nodes creates a dependence to that particular node. Hence, we have a dichotomy where it is important to organize tuples in clusters near the processes, but it is equally important to avoid over-clustering. The ideal is to have a balance where tuples are clustered but not totally concentrated in very few tuple spaces (eg. one or two). This paper presents a self-organized solution to the tuple distribution problem, in which the possibility of over-clustering is considered.},

The presented work extends the use of cross-entropy method to real-valued multiobjective optimization. For this purpose, parameters of CE search are adapted using the information collected from clustered nondominated solutions on the Pareto front.

 Comparison with well known multiobjective optimization algorithms on the solution of provably difficult benchmark problem instances demonstrated that CEMO performs at least as good as its competitors.},

The agents are unaware of system- wide issues such as when do queries arrive, what are they asking for, or when are they revoked. Every query brings with it a certain amount of wealth, and each agent continuously tries to save as much of the wealth as possible.

The proposed operator, named CQA-MEC (Constraint Quadratic Approximation for Multiple Equality Constraints), performs the steps: (i) the approximation of the non-linear constraints via quadratic functions; (ii) the determination of exact equality-constrained projections of some points onto the approximated constraint surface, via an iterative projection algorithm; and (iii) the re-insertion of the constraint- satisfying points in the genetic algorithm population. This operator can be interpreted both as a local search engine (that employs local approximations of constraint functions for correcting the feasibility) and a kind of elitism operator for equality constrained problems that plays the role of "fixing" the best estimates of the feasible set. The proposed operator has the advantage of not requiring any additional function evaluation per algorithm iteration, solely making usage of the information that is already obtained in the course of the usual genetic algorithm iterations. The test cases that were performed suggest that the new operator can enhance both the convergence speed (in terms of the number of function evaluations) and the accuracy of the final result.},

The niche fitness functions have been devised so as to demonstrate the gradual evolution of a population via multiple exaptation events where migrants seed, at each step, a new niche, adapt, and then spread to another in a predictable sequence. Such exaptation events take advantage of "hidden" relationships between fitness functions and allow evolving populations to explore regions of phenotype space that are otherwise inaccessible.},

In order to do so, in our previous work we proposed a new natural discrete crossover operator, which gave very good results compared to C4.5 in several UCI databases. Nonetheless, it was not experimentally compared to NCO. So, in this work, we perform this comparison in the same datasets and define a new natural continuous crossover operator, which is also compared to the continuous NCO operator. The experimental results showed the advantages of both new natural operators: our discrete operator achieves better accuracy and simpler concepts using less time, whereas our continuous operator is also able to explore the search space in a more efficient way, leading to better results in less time.},

The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) is a new meta-heuristic optimization method modeled after the behavior of a flock of birds in flight. "Particles" are initialized in the search space of a particular problem by assigning them a position, which represents a solution to the objective function, and a velocity. They "fly" through the search space with out direct control, but are given both a cognitive personal component and a global or social component of the best positions (thereby solutions) in space. The PSO algorithm is considered a very fast algorithm and is emerging as a widely studied widely used algorithm for optimization problems. The proposed method uses this meta-heuristic to solve the JSP by assigning each machine in a JSP an independent swarm of particles.},

To address this disparity, a method is proposed to generate a linearly non-separable shape matching fitness landscape: the test shape is compared to one or more distracter shapes as well as the target, and the individual fitness measures are combined non-linearly.

This paper presents a formal definition of the associated problem, and investigates several of its properties. An empirical study of the associated problem is performed using a production scheduling problem as experimental environment.

In HIS, multiple populations are simulated simultaneously so that they have different diversities. This mechanism allows HIS to obtain promising solutions with various diversities. Experimental comparisons between HIS and the annealing (i.e., general EAPM) have revealed that HIS outperforms the annealing when applying to a problem of a 2D Ising model, which have many local optima. Advantages of HIS can be summarized as follows: (1) Since populations do not need to converge and do not change rapidly, HIS can build probability models with stability; (2) Since samples with better cost function values can be used for building probability models in HIS, HIS can obtain better probability models; (3)HIS can reuse historical results, which are normally discarded in the anealing.},

The lack of formal treatment of Nature-inspired routing protocols is often criticized in the networking community. In this paper we propose a formal framework that helps in analyzing a Nature-inspired routing protocol, BeeHive.We have verified the correctness of our model by comparing its estimated values with the results obtained from extensive network simulations.

Addressing real-world problems should not only involve the search for a single optimal solution, but also a set of several quasi-optimal solutions. Although some methods aiming the search for multiple solutions have been proposed (e.g. Genetic Algorithm with Sharing and Immune Algorithm), these could not render highly optimized solutions to real-coded problems. This paper proposes hybrid algorithms combining real-coded evolutionary computation algorithms and gradient search methods for multiple-solution search in multimodal optimization problems. Furthermore, a new evaluation function of solution candidates with gradient is presented and discussed in order to find quasi-optimal solutions. Two hybrid algorithms are proposed - a hybridization between Immune Algorithm and Quasi-Newton method (IA+QN) and a hybridization between Genetic Algorithm with Sharing and Quasi-Newton method (GA<sub>S</sub>+QN). Experimental results have shown that the proposed methods can find optimal and quasi-optimal solutions with high accuracy and efficiency even in high-dimensional multimodal benchmark functions. The results have also shown that GA<sub>S</sub>+QN has better performance and higher robustness in terms of parameter configuration than IA+QN.},

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the extended model has significantly reduced the number of false positives.},

This approach is preliminarily investigated using both theoretically derived high dimensional Pareto fronts for a test problem (DTLZ2) and practically obtained objective spaces for the 4 dimensional knapsack problem via multi-objective evolutionary algorithms like HLGA, NSGA, and VEGA. The expected characteristics of the high dimensional fronts in terms of relative sizes, sequencing, embedding and asymmetry were systematically observed in the constructed virtual reality spaces.},

A three dimensional face-centred-cube (FCC), with the provision for providing the most compact core, can map closest to the folded protein in reality. Hence, our successful hybrid Genetic Algorithms (HGA) proposed earlier for a square and cube lattice model is being extended in this paper for a 3D FCC model. Furthermore, twins (conformations having similarity with each other), in GA population have also been considered for removal from the search space for improving the effectiveness of GA. The HGA combined with the twin removal (TR) strategy showed best performance when compared with the Simple GA (SGA), SGA with TR, and HGA only versions. Experiments were carried out on the publicly available benchmark HP sequences and results are expressed based on the fitness of the corresponding applied lattice model, which will help any future novel approach to be compared.},

For this purpose, the Species-based Differential Evolution (SDE) has been proposed previously. In this method, the population is divided into multiple subpopulations by using speciation, and each species focuses its search for one optimal solution. By this way, multiple optimal solutions can be discovered simultaneously. However, this algorithm takes a long time for complicated problems to acquire global optima. In this paper, we propose SDE with switching search strategies, which selects global search by the population or local search in each species according to the search situation. The comparison of the conventional SDE and our proposed method is performed on five test functions. The experimental results show that the SDE with switching search strategies outperforms the conventional SDE in a complicated function problem.},

Living organisms have evolved from stimulatory-reaction to intelligent-anticipation as part of an open ecosystem, and such a relationship is prerequisite for the evolutionary development of anticipatory computation. Effective anticipation depends on the accurate correlation of historical multiscalar data, and ultimately it must be realized as a computer, rather than on a computer.

This agent consists of an Artificial Neural Network whose weights are updated by the Temporal Differences (TD) Reinforcement Learning methods. The NET-FEATUREMAP mapping is used to represent a game board state in the Network input. The Network output corresponds to a real number (prediction) that indicates to what extent the input state is favorable to the agent. The agent is trained by self-play coupled with a cloning technique. The Minimax Algorithm is used to choose the best action to be executed considering the current game board state. Such a learning process is close to that proposed by Mark Lynch (NeuroDraughts). However, the LS-Draughts expands the NeuroDraughts as it automatically generates an effective and concise set of features to be used in the NET-FEATUREMAP mapping, whereas the latter uses a fixed and manually defined set of features. A tournament was promoted between the best player obtained by the LS-Draughts and the best available player of the NeuroDraughts. The tournament was won by the player of the LS-Draughts, which confirms that the GAs can be an important tool for improving the general performance of automatic players.},

The computational cost of measurement replication scales with the variance and is often too high to allow for results of statistical significance. In this paper we study an alternative: the REVAC method for Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration, and we investigate how different levels of measurement replication influence the cost and quality of its calibration results. Two sets of experiments are reported: calibrating a genetic algorithm on standard benchmark problems, and calibrating a complex simulation in evolutionary agent-based economics. We find that measurement replication is not essential to REVAC, which emerges as a strong and efficient alternative to existing statistical methods.},

Simulation results on a set of fifteen test functions show that, compared to an already improved DE algorithm, DE-AEC reduces the number of true function evaluations by 30% - 80% for fourteen functions in the achievement of either low-level (10<sup>-2</sup>) or high-level (10<sup>-8</sup>) accuracy.},

The research presented in this paper studies the performance scalability of evolved solutions in reactive multi-agent systems for the heap formation task. The scalability variable considered in the research was the cardinality of the agents group, whereas keeping the rest of the system and collective resources invariable. In the first phase of the experiments, best solutions for different system configurations were found using genetic algorithm. In the second phase, the evolved solutions were cross-tested in all system configurations. The research showed that evolved solutions performed well if the agents/objects ratio of the multi-agent system used in testing was similar to the agents/objects ratio of the multi-agent system used in evolution. Additionally, evolved solutions scaled well only on limited intervals that did not span over the critical point, which corresponded to the condition where the number of agents is equal to the number of objects. Typically, solutions that performed well on one side of the critical point performed badly on the other side, suggesting the solutions performances were significantly dependant on agents/objects ratio.},

By calculating the highest point of this surface we can guide the EA to the likely location of the optimum, vastly improving the convergence speed.

This paper proposes a new approach based on the generic generalized particle model (GE-GPM) for computing in parallel approximate efficient solutions for the distribution problem with multiple objectives. Unlike the swarm optimization approaches, GE-GPM is inspired by physical models of particle dynamics. We use mathematical formulations to describe or predict the properties and evolution of different states of the particles. In particular, according to "differential equation theory", we develop efficient optimization techniques for multi-objective problems. We also adopt methods of classical mechanics to tackle the problem of modeling the interaction among the particles. We show that GE-GPM, being inspired by classical mechanics, enables feasible multi-objective optimization in very large scales. The GE-GPM approach has a low computational complexity, which is crucial for the functioning of large-scale distribution problems.},

This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., glucose) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons. Based on self-organized computational approaches and similar stigmergic concepts we derive a novel swarm intelligent algorithm. What strikes from these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge coherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in mind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the collective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA algorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal complex functions described in the well-know DeJong test suite. Then, for the purpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA algorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed. Final results indicate that the <i>SSA</i> collective intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and contradictory purposes, while outperforming <i>BFOA</i> in adaptive speed. Results indicate that the present approach deals well in severe Dynamic Optimization problems.},

In this study, three primary features are utilized to extract genes' expression patterns and used as inputs to neuro-fuzzy inference system. The proposed algorithm learns expression patterns from the known genetic interactions, such as the interactions confirmed by qRT-PCR experiments or collected through text-mining technique by surveying previously published literatures, and then predicts other gene interactions according to the learned patterns. The proposed neuro-fuzzy inference system was applied to a public yeast MGE data set. Two simulations were conducted and checked against 112 pairs of qRT-PCR confirmed gene interactions and 77 TFs pairs collected from literature respectively to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

In particular, we have chosen the commonly-used NSGA-II algorithm for this purpose. The algorithm generates a curved path which is represented using B-Spline curves. The control points of the B-Spline curve are the decision variables in the genetic algorithm. In particular, we solve two problems, assuming the normal flight envelope restriction: i) Path planning for UAV when no other constraint is assumed to be present and ii) Path planning for UAV if the vehicle has to necessarily pass through a particular point in the space. The use of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm helps in generating a number of feasible paths with different trade-offs between the objective functions. The availability of a number of trade-off solutions allows the user to choose a path according to his/her needs easily, thereby making the approach more pragmatic. Although an automated decision-making aid is the next immediate need of research, we defer it for another study.},

Although this method has been successfully applied for various engineering structures for damage detection, it is unable to specify the effect of damage on structural properties. The direct indicator of the structural properties is the structural mechanical impedance which can be extracted from the PZT EM admittance signatures. To model the structural impedance, this paper presents a multiple-degrees-of-freedom system consisting of a number of one-degree-of-freedom elements with mass, spring and damper components. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are employed to search for the optimal solution of the unknown dynamic system parameters by minimizing an objective function. Experiment has been carried on a two-storey concrete frame subjected to base vibrations that simulate earthquake. A number of PZT transducers are regularly arrayed and bonded to the frame structure to acquire PZT EM admittance signatures. The changes of the structural parameters in the model system are quantified using GAs. The relation between the distance of the PZT transducer away from the damage and the changes of the structural parameters identified by the PZT transducer is studied. Finally, the sensitivity of the PZT transducers is discussed.},

In this networked society, the role of a human being is evolving from the data consumer to the data producer. In these changing circumstances, pipelined processing finds applications where the data obtained from the human producer needs to be processed and interpreted in real-time. For example, in an MHealth system, the vital signs acquired from the patient are processed in the pipelined fashion.

 This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach for the optimal assignment of pipelined processing tasks onto a chain of networked devices that minimizes total end-to-end processing delay considering knowledge about the communication and computation resources as the context information. Although some existing graph-based algorithms can solve this problem in polynomial time, we expect that GA can take less computational time and requires less memory while providing a reasonably good assignment. We compare the performance of GA approach with the graph-based approaches. It is observed that when the number of devices and the number of processing tasks are large, the GA approach performs better in terms of the satisfactory quality of the obtained sub-optimal solution considering the advantage of reduced computational time.},

Evolutionary support vector machines consider the classification task as in support vector machines but use an evolutionary algorithm to solve the optimization problem of determining the decision function. They can explicitly acquire the coefficients of the separating hyperplane, which is often not possible within the classical technique. More important, evolutionary support vector machines obtain the coefficients directly from the evolutionary algorithm and can refer them at any point during a run. In addition, they do not require properties of positive (semi-)definition for kernels within nonlinear learning. The concept can be furthermore extended to handle large amounts of data, a problem frequently occurring e.g. in spam mail detection, one of our test cases. An adapted chunking technique is therefore alternatively used. In addition to two different representations, a crowding variant of the evolutionary algorithm is tested in order to investigate whether the performance of the algorithm is maintained; its global search capabilities would be important for the prospected coevolution of non-standard kernels. Evolutionary support vector machines are validated on four real-world classification tasks; obtained results show the promise of this new approach.},

For example, most of these single objective optimizations fails to find the equally good solutions when there is more than one optimum (shortest distance path, least congested path). We believe that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based route planning algorithm proposed in this paper has the ability to tackle the above problems. In this paper, the proposed GA based route planning algorithm is successfully tested on the entire Singapore map with more than 10,000 nodes. Performance of the proposed GA is compared with an ant based path planning algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over ant based algorithm. Moreover, the proposed GA may be used as a basis for developing an intelligent route planning system.},

  abstract =	{Despite having a wide-spread applicability of evolutionary optimization procedures over the past few decades, EA researchers still face criticism about the theoretical optimality of obtained solutions. In this paper, we address this issue for problems for which gradients of objectives and constraints can be computed either exactly, or numerically or through subdifferentials. We suggest a systematic procedure of analyzing a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutions for their closeness to satisfying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points, which every Pareto-optimal solution must also satisfy. The procedure involves either a least-square solution or an optimum solution to a set of linear system of equations involving Lagrange multipliers. The procedure is applied to a number of differentiable and non-differentiable test problems and to a highly nonlinear engineering design problem. The results clearly show that EAs are capable of finding solutions close to theoretically optimal solutions in various problems. As a by-product, the error metric suggested in this paper can also be used as a termination condition for an EA application. Hopefully, this study will bring EAs and its research closer to classical optimization studies.},

We try to improve the performance of ICA based classification models by using proper IC subsets instead of all the ICs.

Different regions of the same RNA strand will fold together via base pair interactions to make intricate secondary and tertiary structures that guide crucial homeostatic processes in living organisms. Since the structure of RNA molecules is key to their function, algorithms for the prediction of RNA structure are of great value. This paper discusses significant improvements made to SARNAPredict, an RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA). One major improvement is the incorporation of a sophisticated thermodynamic model (efn2). This model is used by mfold to rank sub-optimal structures, but cannot be used directly by mfold during the structure prediction. Experiments on eight individual known structures from four RNA classes (5S rRNA, Group I intron 23S rRNA, Group I intron 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA) were performed. The data demonstrate the robustness and the effectiveness of our improved prediction algorithm. The new algorithm shows results which surpass the dynamic programming algorithm mfold in terms of prediction accuracy on all tested structures.},

However, because of the large number of possible failure states involved in the power system, it is normally not viable to exhaustively enumerate and evaluate all the states which may contribute to system failure. Meanwhile, time-dependent sources such as wind turbine generators are being more significantly integrated into the traditional power grid for cleaner power generation. The intermittency of wind power sources further complicates the reliability evaluation process. In this paper, a binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is adopted to derive a set of meaningful system states, which significantly affects the adequacy indices of generation system including loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load frequency (LOLF), and expected energy not supplied (EENS). A numerical example is used to verify the applicability and validity of the proposed population-based intelligent search (PIS) based evaluation procedure.

The fitness of each individual is related to its ability to collaborate with individuals from other species, thereby encouraging the development of cooperative strategies.

Coupled with the adaptive niche sharing algorithm, COMOPSO demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency in evolving highly competitive solution sets against various MO algorithms on benchmark problems characterized by different difficulties with consistent results.},

We call this process the gap-utilization technique (GUT). With GUT, we also apply a swapping technique that deals only with the bottleneck job. We study 35 test problems with known solutions, using the existing GA and our proposed two algorithms. We obtain optimal solutions for 23 problems, and the solutions are very close for the rest.},

Commonly, a search for solutions for a multi-objective problem, which is aimed at optimization, results in a set of Pareto optimal solutions. There are cases where more solutions should be also considered, nonetheless preserving the optimization inspiration. These solutions should not resemble the Pareto set, so as to provide diversity within the design space, and therefore they might not always be found by taking an epsilon-Pareto approach. With this motivation in mind, an already established method, which searches for diverse solutions, which are not all necessarily optimal, is herewith discussed and its shortages are highlighted. In contrast to the already established design method, the approach taken in this paper is to solve the multi-objective problem repeatedly, adding (automatically or interactively) at each run constraints, which are constructed, based on the obtained Pareto set. The motivation for the introduced approach comes from the need to generate a set of robot paths, which allow a mobile robot operator, flexibility in complying with different planning demands and a rapid response to a developing scenario. The methodology and the applicability of the approach are explained and demonstrated by utilizing multi-objective path planning problems.},

It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points: The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the timing of the buying and selling stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buying/selling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of 16 brands in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in 2004. From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&amp;Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.},

  abstract =	{We discuss the optimal system component allocation problem for series-parallel systems with interchangeable elements. A series-parallel system consists of subsystems that are connected in series and each subsystem consists of components in parallel. There are some heuristic methods to obtain quasi optimal solutions for the component allocation problem of series-parallel systems. Because this problem is one of the NP-complete problems, it is difficult to obtain the exact solutions for large scale problems. We had formulated this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem minimizing the system cost and maximizing the system reliability, and proposed an algorithm that obtains the exact solutions of the problems in an efficient way. The algorithm utilized the depth-first search method to eliminate useless searches and employs the branch-and-bound method to obtain the Pareto solutions. According to the results of our numerical experiments, the algorithm searches the Pareto solutions in practical time for not so large problems. In order to solve larger problems, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). In comparison with the exact solution method we had proposed and the MOGA method, we assure the MOGA method produces the best compromised solutions and the later can solve large scale problems. We have conducted experiments for reasonably large scale problems and have demonstrated reasonably good performance of our method.},

These objectives represent the interests of both port and ship operators. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that incorporates the concept of Pareto optimality is proposed for solving the multi-objective BAP. The MOEA is equipped with a novel solution decoding scheme which is specifically designed to optimize the use of berth space.

The application of noisy fitness functions is not straight forward but relevant to many real-world problems. Therefore, a variant of Harrington's one-sided desirability function using expectations is introduced which takes noise into account.

Such an amount of information needs to be exploited by sophisticated algorithms that automatically analyze the data in order to extract useful knowledge from the mega databases.  In this work we employ Evolution Strategies (ES) to automatically extract a set of physical parameters corresponding to stellar population synthesis (ages, metallicities, reddening and relative contributions) from a sample of galaxy spectra taken from SDSS. Such parameters are useful in cosmological studies and for understanding galaxy formation, composition, and evolution. We pose this parameter extraction as an optimization problem and then solve it using ES. The idea is to reconstruct each galaxy spectrum from the sample by means of a linear combination of three similar theoretical models, each contributing in a different way to the stellar population synthesis. This linear combination produces a model spectrum that is compared with the original spectrum using a simple difference function. The goal is to find a model that minimizes this difference, using ES as the algorithm to explore the parameter space. We present experimental results using a set of 100 spectra from SDSS Data Release 2 that show that ES are very well suited to extract stellar population parameters from galaxy spectra.},

In this paper, we propose an iterative approach to indicator-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The main feature of our approach is that only a single solution is obtained by its single run. Thus multiple runs are needed to find a solution set. In each run, our approach searches for a solution with the maximum contribution to the hypervolume of the solution set obtained by its previous runs.

The main novelty of NNIA is that the selection technique only selects minority isolated nondominated individuals in current population to clone proportionally to the crowding-distance values, recombine and mutate. As a result, NNIA pays more attention to the less-crowded regions in the current trade-off front. The experimental results on seven artificial data sets with different manifold structure and six real-world data sets show that the NNIA is an effective algorithm for solving multiobjective clustering problems, and the NNIA based multiobjective clustering technique is a cogent unsupervised learning method.},

Based on the example instance, the method requires 11 oligonucleotides, where 6 oligonucleotides are for the nodes and 5 oligonucleotides are for the edges.

Results on concatenated m-k deceptive trap functions show that the model accuracy depends on a large extent on the choice of selection method and to a lesser extent on the replacement strategy used. Specifically, it is shown that linkage learning in BOA is more accurate with truncation selection than with tournament selection. The choice of replacement strategy is important when tournament selection is used, but it is not relevant when using truncation selection. On the other hand, if performance is our main concern, tournament selection and restricted tournament replacement should be preferred. These results aim to provide practitioners with useful information about the best way to tune BOA with respect to structural model accuracy and overall performance.},

Mechanisms are employed to merge subswarms if they converge to the same solution, and also to absorb any particle within a subswarm if that particle enters the area covered by the subswarm. The NichePSO has shown very good performance in locating a good number of solutions to multimodal problems. However, it was found that the current subswarm merging and particle absorption strategies are premature, and limits exploration in the main swarm. This paper proposes a number of different merging and absorption strategies, and shows that fine tuning of these processes improves the performance of NichePSO on lower dimensional problems.},

Here we examine the performance of the evolved heuristics on larger instances of the problem, which contain many more pieces than the problem instances used in training. In previous work, we concluded that we could confidently apply our heuristics to new instances of the same class of problem. Now we can make the additional claim that we can confidently apply our heuristics to problems of much larger size, not only without deterioration of solution quality, but also within a constant factor of the performance obtained by 'best fit'.

   Interestingly, our evolved heuristics respond to the number of pieces in a problem instance although they have no explicit access to that information. We also comment on the important point that, when solutions are explicitly constructed for single problem instances, the size of the search space explodes. How- ever, when working in the space of algorithmic heuristics, the distribution of functions represented in the search space reaches some limiting distribution and therefore the combinatorial explosion can be controlled.},

  abstract =	{Computational simulations of conformational sampling in general, and of macromolecular folding in particular represent one of the most important and yet one of the most challenging applications of computer science in biology and medicinal chemistry. The advent of GRID computing may trigger some major progress in this field. This paper presents our first attempts to design GRID-based conformational sampling strategies, exploring the extremely rugged energy response surface in function of molecular geometry, in search of low energy zones through phase spaces of hundreds of degrees of freedom. We have generalized the classical island model deployment of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to a "planetary" model where each node of the grid is assimilated to a "planet" harboring quasi-independent multi-island simulations based on a hybrid GA-driven sampling approach. Although different "planets" do not communicate to each other - thus minimizing inter-CPU exchanges on the GRID - each new simulation will benefit from the preliminary knowledge extracted from the centralized pool of already visited geometries, located on the dispatcher machine, and which is disseminated to any new "planet". This "panspermic" strategy allows new simulations to be conducted such as to either be attracted towards an apparently promising phase space zone (biasing strategies, intensification procedures) or to avoid already in-depth sampled (tabu) areas. Successful folding of mini-proteins typically used in benchmarks for allatoms protein simulations has been observed, although the reproducibility of these highly stochastic simulations in huge problem spaces is still in need of improvement. Work on two structured peptides (the "tryptophane cage" 1L2Y and the "tryptophane zipper" 1LE1) used as benchmarks for all-atom protein folding simulations has shown that the planetary model is able to reproducibly sample conformers from the neighborhood of the native geometries. However, within these neighborhoods (within ensembles of conformers similar to models published on hand of experimental geometry determinations), the energy landscapes are still extremely rugged. Therefore, simulations in general produce "correct" geometries (similar enough to experimental model for any practical purposes) which sometimes unfortunately correspond to relatively high energy levels and therefore are less stable than the most stable among misfolded conformers. The method thus reproducibly visits the native phase space zone, but fails to reproducibly hit the bottom of its rugged energy well. Intensifications of local sampling may in principle solve this problematic behavior, but is limited by computational ressources. The quest for the optimal time point at which a phase space zone should stop being intensively searched and declared tabu, a very difficult problem, is still awaiting for a practically useful solution.},

In the multi-rover domain, the task was for many agents (rovers) to maximize the detection and evaluation of points of interest in a simulated environment, and to communicate gathered information to a base station. The goal of the rover group was to maximize a global evaluation function that measured performance (fitness) of the group. Results indicate that the CONE method was appropriate for facilitating specialization at both the individual and agent group levels, where as, the conventional NE method succeeded only in facilitating individual specialization. As a consequence of emergent specialization derived at both the individual and group levels, rover groups evolved by the CONE method were able to achieve a significantly higher task performance, comparative to groups evolved by the conventional NE method.},

We compare the experimental results from our simulated evolution versus the predictions made by agricultural experts.

This study also shows that maintenance of the diversity of the solution set is important for evolutionary algorithms to continuously track dynamic optimums.

Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP with Actor-Critic (GNP-AC) can select appropriate technical indexes to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks using Importance Index especially designed for stock trading decision making. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of 20 brands in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in 2004.

Mathematically based diagnostics of a 6 DoF system provides capability for a complex evaluation of system components behaviour, but are typically both memory and computationally expensive. Design and optimisation of the flight controllers is a demanding task which usually requires deep engineering knowledge of intrinsic aircraft behaviour. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are known for their robustness for a wide range of optimising functions, when no a priori knowledge of the search space is available. Thus it makes evolutionary approach a promising technique to design the task controllers for complex dynamic systems such as an aircraft. In this study, EAs are used to design a controller for recovery (landing) of a small fixed-wing UAV on a frigate ship deck. The control laws are encoded in a way common for Evolutionary Programming. However, parameters (numeric coefficients in the control equations) are optimised independently using effective Evaluation Strategies, while structural changes occur at a slower rate. The fitness evaluation is made via test runs on a comprehensive 6 degree-of-freedom non-linear UAV model. The need of a well defined approach to the control system validation is dictated by the nature of UAV application, where the major source of mission success is based on autonomous control system architecture reliability. The results show that an effective controller can be designed with little knowledge of the aircraft dynamics using appropriate evolutionary techniques. An evolved controller is evaluated and a set of reliable algorithm parameters is validated.},

Optimization methods based on genetic algorithms (GA) have recently been demonstrated to have the potential for overcoming the problems associated with gradient-based methods. The success of the GA depends, to a large extent, on the structural geometry representation scheme used. In this work, some enhancements are incorporated into the recently developed morphological geometric representation scheme coupled with a GA. Based on the morphology of living creatures, a geometric representation scheme had earlier been developed that works by specifying a skeleton which defines the underlying topology/connectivity of a structural continuum together with segments of material surrounding the skeleton. In this work, the flexibility to turn on or off parts of the skeleton is integrated into the scheme. This improves the variability of topological and shape characteristics in the evolutionary process and enhances the representation's versatility. The methodology is tested by solving a multicriterion 'target matching' problem : a simulated topology optimization problem where a 'target' geometry is first created and predefined as the optimum solution, and design solutions are evolved to converge towards this target shape.},

Therefore, a common view has been developed that adjusting the depth of crossover points to eliminate the bias can improve GP performance, and many attempts have been made to create effective crossover operators according to this view. As there are a large number of possible depth-control strategies, it is very difficult to identify the strategy that provides the most significant improvement in performance. This paper explores depth-control strategies by analysing the depth of crossover points in evolutionary process logs of five different GP systems on problems in three different domains. It concludes that controlling the depth of crossover points is an evolutionary stage dependent and problem dependent task, and obtaining a significant performance improvement is not trivial.},

Research on multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms have amply demonstrated that they are capable of finding multiple and diverse non-dominated solutions which allows the user to choose among many solutions. Although it is difficult to evaluate the importance of the various objectives quantitatively during the conceptual/preliminary stages of the design process, usually qualitative preference can be specified. This paper presents a novel, simple and intuitive way to integrate the user's preference into the evolutionary algorithm. This approach treats relatively more important objectives as adaptive constraints whose ideal values will be adaptively changed during the optimization procedure. Such changes will affect the region feasibility of the objective space which results in the variation of problem type (unconstrained problem, moderately constrained problem or highly constrained problem). As the selection criteria for mating partner depends on the type of problem in the algorithm used here, more selection pressure is put on adaptive constraints. The algorithm is validated using a target matching test problem. The results obtained indicate that the approach can produce good results at reasonable computational costs. The proposed algorithm efficiently guides the population towards the (preferred) region of interest, allowing a faster convergence and a better coverage of the preferred area of the Pareto optimal front based on the relative importance of the objectives.},

In a benchmark binary valued dataset our method seconds the generalization and optimality hypotheses for UCS and provide mechanisms for retrieving all maximally general rules in real time. In real valued problems, where precise realization of decision boundaries is often not possible, our algorithm is able to retrieve near optimal representations with the help of a modified subsumption operator.

In this work, the proposed hybrid algorithm integrates a simple local search strategy with an effective constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A novel constrained tournament selection is used as a single objective function in the local search strategy. The selection is utilized to determine whether a new solution generated in local search process will survive. Hooke and Jeeves method is applied to decide search path. Good initial solutions, the solutions to be mutated, are chosen for local search. This paper also examines the following strategies in the implementation of local search: applying local search only to final solutions, applying local search to solutions only in the early generations, and initializing local search when mutation gives rise to improvement in the solution. Simulation results from a target matching test problem indicate that the hybrid algorithm outperforms the multi-objective method without genetic local search when the implementation of local search is appropriate. It is also shown that the hybridization can improve the convergence speed.},

A necessary consequence of this increased capability is a higher degree of complexity, which in turn leads to gradient-based learning algorithms for RNNs being more likely to be trapped in local optima, thus resulting in suboptimal solutions. This motivates the use of evolutionary computational methods which center about the use of population based global-search techniques as an optimization scheme. In this article, we propose the use of a hybrid evolutionary strategy (ES) approach together with an adaptive linear observer, acting as a local search operator, as a learning mechanism for general RNN applications. Illustrative examples, though largely preliminary in nature, in solving a few system identification problems, are encouraging.},

In order to improve the collection of local optima in different regions of the search space the behavioral-search has been hybridized with a domain decompositon technique.

However, PSO aims to obtain the optimal solution, while the purpose of this study concentrates on the generated paths of particles. Hence, in order to generate appropriate paths of people in a crowd, we propose a method to employ the computational facilities provided in PSO. The proposed model is simple, uniform, and easy to implement. The results of simulations demonstrate that using PSO with the proposed technique can generate appropriate nondeterministic, non-colliding paths in several different scenarios, including static obstacles, moving targets, and multiple crowds.},

PC-IGA enables users to reduce the mental burden for evaluation by using paired comparison. Fitness inference method can decrease evaluation times on EC by using inferred fitness value instead of actual evaluation for candidate solutions based on the information of actually evaluated solutions in the past generations. However, PC-IGA does not give enough information to apply fitness inference method. This paper investigates effective application of the fitness inference method to PC-IGA through experiments with simulated evaluation. The experimental results show that fitness inference method can decrease the number of actual evaluation times by 40% comparing with the normal PC-IGA.},

  abstract =	{In this paper, a new search and optimisation algorithm based on a reduced space searching strategy, named RSSA, is presented. This algorithm originates from an idea which relates to a simple experience when humans search for an optimal solution to a 'real-life' problem, i.e. when humans search for a candidate solution given a certain objective, a large area tends to be scanned first; should one succeed in finding clues in relation to the predefined objective, then the search space is greatly reduced for a more detailed search. The proposed algorithm is validated via well-known benchmark functions and is found to be efficient. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to include the multiobjective case. Simulation results of optimising some challenging benchmark multiobjective problems, including the ZDT and DTLZ series problems, suggest that the new algorithm can locate the Pareto-optimal front and performs better than some other salient optimisation algorithms. Then, this proposed algorithm is successfully applied to the optimal design of alloy steels, which aims at determining the optimal heat treatment regimes and the required weight percentages for the chemical composites in order to obtain the pre-defined mechanical properties of the material.},

In PSO, when a particle finds a local optimal solution, all of the particles gather around the one, and cannot escape from it. On the other hand, TS can escape from the local optimal solution by moving away from the best solution at the present. The proposed TS-PSO is the method for combining the excellence of both PSO and TS. In this method, particles are divided into two categories called swarm1 and swarm2. And they play the key roles of intensification and diversification respectively. Swarm1 playing roles of intensification searches the area around the best solution at the present, and swarm2 playing roles of diversification intends to avoid local optimal solutions and to find global optimal one. Then, the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations with several functions which are well known as optimization benchmark problems comparing to the conventional PSO methods.},

In order to deeply study the optimum configuration strategy for the adjustable parameters in the ACO algorithm, an effective Matlab GUI(Graphical User Interface)-based ACO simulation platform is developed in this paper. In order to investigate the relative strengths and weaknesses of these adjustable parameters, series of experiments on EIL51TSP are conducted on the developed ACO simulation platform. On the basis of the experimental results presented above, a novel effective "three-step" optimum configuration strategy for the adjustable parameters in basic ACO algorithm is drawn. This "three-step" optimum configuration strategy for the adjustable parameters in basic ACO algorithm is also beneficial to the application and development of ACO algorithm in various kinds of optimization problems.},

Previous studies used fixed-order hyperedges which limit model spaces and, thus, the best performance achievable by hypernetworks. Here, we present a method for evolving variable-order hypernetwork models. To find the proper orders automatically, the fitness values are calculated for each hyperedge and the hyperedges with low fitness values are substituted by new hyperedges. The method was tested on three data sets from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the evolutionary hypernetworks show classification accuracies comparable to those of other conventional algorithms, find appropriate orders of hyperedges automatically, and extract important rules in the hyperedges for the given pattern classification problems.},

Unlike many evolutionary composition systems, there is no human interaction involved in the loop. The role of the human within our system is to select the set of melodies to train the critics on, and choose the bag of notes. The trainable critics are N-gram model. The system then evolves pleasant sounding melodies by permuting the order of the notes selected from the bag. The bag of notes constraint prevents a previously observed problem. We solve a prior problem where the Maximum Likelihood Sequence (MLS) generated by our N-gram model is repetitive using the bag of notes constraint.  In this paper, two experiments are constructed. Both experiments are identical except for the melody representations, which are Absolute Pitch (AP) and Pitch Difference (PD) representations. In each case, the bag of notes constraint results in more pleasing melodies, and the melody shape of the melodies are more controllable and predictable with appropriate operators. We suggest that using absolute pitch representation leads to better sounding melodies than the pitch difference representation, especially if the user enjoys arpeggio effects.},

While Genetic Programming (GP) constitutes a powerful tool for solving this class of problems, its effectiveness is still severely limited when the data sample requires different expressions in different regions of the input space - i.e., when the approximating function should be discontinuous.  In this paper we present a new GP-based approach for symbolic regression of discontinuous functions in multivariate data-sets. We identify the portions of the input space that require different approximating functions by means of a new algorithm that we call Hyper-Volume Error Separation (HVES). To this end we run a preliminary GP evolution and partition the input space based on the error exhibited by the best individual across the data-set. Then we partition the data-set based on the partition of the input space and use each such partition for driving an independent, preliminary GP evolution. The populations resulting from such preliminary evolutions are finally merged and evolved again.  We compared our approach to the standard GP search and to a GP search for discontinuous functions in univariate data-sets. Our results show that coupling HVES with GP is an effective approach and provides significant accuracy improvements while requiring less computational resources.},

We discuss the application of our MOEA to determine a set of fuzzy rule-based classifiers with different trade-offs between FPR and TPR in lung nodule detection from CT scans.

One problem remains with most of the hypervolume based algorithms: the best known algorithm for computing the hypervolume needs time exponentially in the number of objectives. To save computation time during hypervolume computation which can be better spent in the generation of more solutions, we propose a general approach how objective reduction techniques can be incorporated into hypervolume based algorithms. Different objective reduction strategies are developed and then compared in an experimental study on two test problems with up to nine objectives. The study indicates that the (temporary) omission of objectives can improve hypervolume based MOEAs drastically in terms of the achieved hypervolume indicator values.},

We describe two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trap function (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled subfunction contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. hBOA is able to solve large CPFs with small population sizes when it is unable to solve them with larger population sizes.  We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).  We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.},

The representation must at least be able to encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic operators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this paper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the framework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function optimization. Likewise, a new variant of GAs for difficult optimization problems denoted Split-and-Merge GA (SM-GA) is developed using a parallel implementation of an SGA and evolving a dynamic exchange of individual representation in the context of Dual Coding concept. Numerical experiments show that the evolved SM-GA significantly outperforms an SGA with static single coding.},

In the present analysis, the non-linear element model of the non-linear element is considered for closed loop stability analysis.

When embedded in a SoC, peripheral cores introduce new issues for their testing. In this paper an automatic approach able to coevolve assembly programs and stimuli sets for peripheral cores embedded in a SoC is described. The presented approach is based on an evolutionary algorithm that exploits high-level simulation and gathers coverage metrics information to produce the test sets. The proposed method considerably reduces the required efforts to produce a suitable test set with respect to the previous approaches, broadening its applicability and increasing its usefulness.},

This study generalizes that representation to give a character-string representation for points in R<sup>n</sup>. This is a novel representation for evolutionary optimization. With the correct generating points the method is proven to search its entire target domain at an easily controlled resolution. The representation can be used to achieve the same goals as niche specialization at a far lower computational cost because the optima located are specified by strings which can be stored and searched in standard string dictionaries. An implementation of the algorithm called the multiple optima Sierpinski searcher(MOSS) is found to be substantially faster at locating diverse collections of optima than a standard optimizer. The Sierpinski representation has a number of natural mathematical properties that are described in the paper. These include the ability to adapt both its search domain and its resolution on the fly during optimization.},

The results are compared with CPLEX MIP solver and other heuristics. The genetic algorithm proposed here gives solutions, which are 0.4 to 2.9 percent away from the theoretical lower bound.},

  abstract =	{When using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in dynamic environments some extensions have been introduced in order to avoid the premature convergence of the population towards a non-optimal point of the search space. One of these improvements consists in adding an explicit memory used for storing good individuals from the search population. When the environment is cyclic and previous environments reappear later memory should maintain EA's performance by keeping individuals' fitness at an acceptable level. But in most situations this purpose is not achieved and the typical behavior of an EA when a change occurs involves the decrease of the best individual's fitness and some time is necessary to readapt to the new conditions. The key problem when using explicit memory is the restriction usually imposed on its size. So, when it is necessary to store a new individual and memory is full we need to replace some individuals. This replacement can lead to the destruction of information that might be useful in the future. In this paper we are interested in the enhancement of memory's usage and we propose two new replacing methods to apply when memory is full. The investigated methods were tested in several memory-based EAs and the results show that memory can be used in a more effective way so algorithms' performance is strongly improved.},

The results suggest that online simplification disrupts existing potential building blocks during the evolution process. However, GP with simplification is capable of creating new building blocks which are used to form a more accurate solution, when compared to the standard GP. The effectiveness of GP systems utilising simplification can be correlated to the creation of these new building blocks.},

As the generation progresses, islands are created or erased based on the convergence status of searching in each island. Experiments were done with different function optimization problems.

In particular, we ask the following question: Given the results of a DNA computation, how does one determine the answer to the underlying SAT problem, and how does one examine the confidence of this answer? We examine this question in detail for selection-based DNA computing, and show that it is non-trivial to answer. We then introduce a method we call "decision thresholds" for answering it which can be applied to any variation of selection-based DNA computing. Furthermore, we provide an example by applying this method to the technique of using a network of microreactors employing negative selection of ssDNA.},

These spaces arise from the solution of multi-objective optimization problems with more than 3 objective functions which lead to high dimensional Pareto fronts. The 3-D representations of m-dimensional Pareto fronts, or their approximations, are constructed via similarity structure mappings between the original objective spaces and the 3-D space. Alpha shapes are introduced for the representation and compared with previous approaches based on convex hulls. In addition, the mappings minimizing a measure of the amount of dissimilarity loss are obtained via genetic programming. This approach is preliminarily investigated using both theoretically derived high dimensional Pareto fronts for a test problem (DTLZ2) and practically obtained objective spaces for the 4 dimensional knapsack problem via multi-objective evolutionary algorithms like HLGA, NSGA, and VEGA. The improved representation captures more accurately the real nature of the m-dimensional objective spaces and the quality of the mappings obtained with genetic programming is equivalent to those computed with classical optimization algorithms.},

The agent perceives the environment from an overhead video camera and conveys its actions to the car via standard radio remote control transmitter. In order to cope with the video feed latency we propose an anticipatory modeling in which the agent considers its current actions based on the anticipated intrinsic (rather than currently available, outdated) state of the car and its surrounding. We formalized the notion of driving style by defining the key parameters, which describe it, and demonstrated the feasibility of applying genetic algorithms to evolve the optimal values of these parameters. The optimized driving style, employed by the agent, is human competitive in that it yields both faster and more consistent lap times than those of a human around a predefined circuit. Presented work can be viewed as a step towards the automated design of the control software of remotely operated vehicles capable to find an optimal solution to various tasks in a priori known environmental situations. Also, the results can be seen as a verification of the feasibility of developing a framework of adaptive racing games in which the human competes against a computerized opponent with matching capabilities, both operating physical, scale models of cars.},

The algorithms experimented in this paper are Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), Fuzzy VEGA, Multiobjective Optimization Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2<sup>nd</sup> version (SPEA2) and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2<sup>nd</sup> version (NSGA2). The results show that using fuzzy logic to combine optimization objectives of VEGA (in VEGA_Fuz1) for this problem does improve performances measured by Generation Distance (GD) defined by average distances of the last generation of population to the nearest members of the true Pareto front but its solutions tend to cluster around a few points. MOGA and SPEA2 use some diversification algorithms and they perform better in terms of finding diverse solutions around Pareto front. SPEA2 performs the best even for comparatively small number of generations. NSGA2 performs closed to that of SPEA2 in GD but poor in distribution.},

Applied to the analysis of microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles on multiple human cancers, the hypernetwork classifiers identified cancer-related miRNA modules.

In order to perform the optimization notwithstanding presence of the noise, this paper proposes an Adaptive Prudent- Daring Evolutionary Algorithm (APDEA). The APDEA is an evolutionary algorithm with a dynamic parameter setting. Furthermore, the APDEA employs a dynamic penalty term and two cooperative-competitive survivor selection schemes. The numerical results show that the APDEA robustly executes optimization in the noisy environment. In addition, comparison with other meta-heuristics shows that behavior of the APDEA is very satisfactory in terms of convergence velocity. A statistical test confirms the effectiveness of the APDEA.},

The proposed method is pertinent for the real world project scheduling where the resources are constrained, and where generation of complete Pareto-optimal front is essential for a decision-maker. Accordingly, the entire time-cost tradeoff (TCT) profile is identified, wherein the decision-maker basically makes a sequence of decisions, which optimizes the overall performance of the project in terms of time and cost by satisfying not only the precedence constraints but also the resource constraints. A MOGA, is devised to search for the optimal profile, and a heuristic is developed and hybridized with MOGA to ensure the availability of the resource requirements for each instance of the project schedule of MOGA by adjusting the start time of non-critical activities exploiting their float values. To demonstrate the efficacy of MOGA employed in this work, two standard test problems from the literature are attempted. The hybrid MOGA is employed to solve two test problems of TCT, one with a single resource constraint, and the other with three resource constraints. The results are also compared with those of exhaustive enumeration technique - the close proximity between these results validates the suitability and accuracy of hybrid MOGA to solve MRCDTCT problems.},

Specimens that need to be distinguished from one another show similar profiles and cannot be separated easily based on decision boundaries or available discriminating rules. Alternatively, inter-relations among the feature vectors can be exploited for distinguishing samples into specific classes. Such variable interaction models are difficult to establish given the nature of biological systems. Genetic Programming, a data driven evolutionary modeling approach is proposed here to be a potential tool for designing variable dependency models and exploiting them further for class discrimination. A new and alternative GP model based classification approach is proposed. Analysis is carried out using illustrative datasets and the performance is benchmarked against well established linear and nonlinear classifiers like LDA, kNN, CART, ANN and SVM. It is demonstrated that GP based models can be effective tools for separating unknown biological systems into different classes. The new classification method has the potential to be effectively and successfully extended to many systems biology applications of recent interest.},

  abstract =	{Wireless sensor network lifetime for large-scale surveillance systems is defined as the time span that all targets can be covered. One approach to extend the lifetime is to divide the deployed sensors into disjoint subsets of sensors, or sensor covers, such that each sensor cover can cover all targets and work by turns. The more sensor covers can be found, the longer sensor network lifetime can be prolonged. Finding the maximum number of sensor covers can be solved via transformation to the Disjoint Set Covers (DSC) problem, which has been proved to be NP-complete. For this optimization problem, existing heuristic algorithms either get unsatisfactory solutions in some cases or take exponential time complexity. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to solve the DSC problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can get near-optimal solutions with polynomial computation time and can improve the performance of the most constrained-minimum constraining heuristic algorithm by 16% in solution quality.},

For some real-world applications, it is often that the Transportation Problem (TP) is extended to satisfy several other additional constraints or performed in several stages. There is Transportation Problem with exclusionary side constraints (escTP) proposed by Sun as the example. In this model, the TP is extended to satisfy the additional constraints in which the simultaneous shipment from some pairs of plants are prohibited. The restrictions which this model has are deeply concerned with TP in the real world. In this paper, we consider the exclusionary side constrained Logistics Network (esc-LN). It is the network model which combined two-stage Transportation Problem (tsTP) and escTP. To solve the problem, we used a priority-based Genetic Algorithm (priGA), and introduce the designing method of a delivery course.},

In practical applications, a unique solution for a given instance can not be defined, i.e. the actual solution may be outscored by some other due to noise effects arising during feature extraction. Soft computing approaches in general provide fast but not necessarily globally optimal solutions. In this case, the lack of guarantee of the global optimum is not a real drawback, since the uncertainty already arises in the problem definition. This paper discusses the application of memetic algorithms on the error-correcting graph isomorphism problem. We show that permutation encoding is robust enough to allow addressing both, the matching problem for graphs of the same size, and the subgraph matching problem. Since gene order information is meaningless in this particular case, a strict position based crossover is applied providing better performance than the popular PMX. We evaluate our algorithm on a synthetic data set with larger graph sizes than used in traditional, exact approaches and other permutation-based genetic approaches.},

A recent version of Genetic algorithm, called MOGA [1], [2], [3] is used as the evolutionary computation. Chromosomes evolve in a given subspace only. The computational resource allocation will be based on the quality of the search results: the subspace expected to contain the true solution will be given more computational resource. In this way, a quasi-parallelism is provided to evolutionary computation in different subspace in terms of computational time [4]. Various ways of resource allocation have been tried on the knapsack problem and the Weierstrass's Function problem.

The number of PDs in each layer increases very fast, which consume lot of time for evaluation of the coefficients of the PDs, consume huge memory and increase complexity of the model. We propose Simplified Polynomial Neural Network (SPNN) for the task of classification. PDs for a single layer of the PNN model are developed.

One of the difficult areas in applying this type of technology is how to recognize and quantify the corrosion characteristics. A Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) has been found to be a suitable technique for such purposes. The RBFNN has excellent local closing ability and the Immune algorithm has self-organization ability. Utilizing the advantages of both, an Immune RBFNN (IRBFNN) algorithm was proposed to process the MFL data. In this paper, steps of the algorithm are shown in detail, and the model built was applied to lab data to assess this technique's ability to determine the location and size of the corrosion spots on the pipeline. A segment of metal pipeline was taken as an object for inspection. Several corrosion spots were artificially made on it. The sizes of the square corrosion spots were first computed by using standard 3D finite-element analysis and this was then compared to the MFL data collected. These sizes were regarded as training inputs to the neural network. Experimental results show that the method successfully identified the location and size of corrosion on the pipe. It is fast in convergence, responds to the geometrical characteristics of corrosion correctly and, thus provides a promising new method for accurately detecting and sizing oil-gas pipeline corrosion.},

This paper conducts a short review on relaxed forms of Pareto dominance in the literature. A new form of relaxed Pareto dominance, called volume dominance, is presented afterward. The results based on comparison between volume dominance and Pareto dominance using SEAMO2, SPEA2 and NSGA2 show that the proposed volume dominance is capable of obtaining a better and smoother trade-off front, and it is more robust than Pareto dominance.},

This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the different correction methods used for optimizing noisy objective functions or fitness functions that creates uncertain environment and also provide with an brief overview of the other issues involved while using evolutionary computational methods for optimizing applications in uncertain environment.},

Cellular genetic algorithms are genetic algorithms where the population is embedded on a toroidal grid. This structure makes the propagation of the best so far individual slow down, and allows to keep in the population potentially good solutions. We present two selective pressure reducing strategies in order to slow down even more the best solution propagation. We experiment these strategies on a hard optimization problem, the Quadratic Assignment Problem, and we show that there is a threshold value of the control parameter for both which gives the best performance. This optimal value does not find explanation on the selective pressure only, measured either by takeover time or diversity evolution. This study makes us conclude that we need other tools than the sole selective pressure measures to explain the performance of cellular genetic algorithms.},

The optimization takes into account three requirements. Hence, it is multi-objective (multi-criteria) optimization. The first requirement is the elimination of the effect of nonidealities in the circuit on its magnitude frequency response. The nonidealities are the nonzero output conductance of the fieldeffect transistors realizing the current sources and the nonzero on-state resistance of the switches. The second and third fact respected by the optimization is concerned with the values of transconductances of the transistors in the circuit. The ratio between the highest and lowest one (the spread of transconductance values) and the sum of all of them should be as small as possible. The reason is a better circuit design. The aim of the optimization is to obtain suitable values of the transconductances satisfying the three requirements.},

Evolutionary algorithms are very widely adopted to approach this problem or just part of it. Neverthless, some concerns regarding execution times exist. In evolutionary high-level synthesis, design solutions have to be evaluated to extract information about some figures of merit (such as performance, area, etc.) and to allow the genetic algorithm to evolve and converge to Pareto-optimal solutions. Since the execution time of such evaluations increases with the complexity of the specification, the overall methodology could lead to unacceptable execution time. This paper presents a model to exploit fitness inheritance in a multi-objective optimization algorithm (i.e. NSGA-II) by substituting the expensive real evaluations with estimations based on closeness in an hypothetical design space. The estimations are based on the measure of the distance between individuals and a weighted average of the fitnesses of the closest ones. The results shows that the Pareto-optimal set obtained by applying the proposed model well approximates the set obtained without fitness inheritance. Moreover, the overall execution time is reduced up to the 25% in average.},

The increase of parents in crossover intensifies exploitation or exploration or both; however, the intensification is often unbalanced and consequently causes deterioration in performance. In this paper we propose the use of supermajority to address the issue of lopsided intensification on exploitation and exploration in multi-parent crossover. The proposed crossover, called biased occurrencebased scanning crossover (bOB), controls the tendency toward exploitation or exploration by the threshold in supermajority. Two adaptive strategies are developed to adjust the threshold of bOB. Experimental results indicate that bOB can achieve significant improvement on uniform crossover and occurrence-based scanning crossover in both solution quality and convergence speed. Precisely, the improvement in mean best fitness ranges from 4&#8211;89% on our test problems. The preferable results validate that bOB crossover can not only enhance the performance but also provide an effective way to control the exploitation and exploration in crossover.},

Finally, the hybrid learning algorithm (HLA) is further applied to adjust the hidden centers and the shape parameters of kernel function for the hidden layer.

The other important contribution of the work is implementation of two state-of-the-art routing protocols, EEABR and BeeSensor, in a well known WSN simulator RMASE and their thorough comparative analysis, using our proposed framework, with one another and with Flooded Piggybacked Ant Routing (FP-Ant) and a well known classical routing protocol, Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV). To the best of our knowledge, Nature inspired WSN routing protocols have never been evaluated in such an extensive manner either with one another or with AODV. The results obtained from the simulations, using the framework, have given us the opportunity to report new behavioral patterns of the protocols that were never previously reported.

We address the framework of monopolistic competition introduced by a seminal contribution of Blanchard-Kiyotaki. We model a number of price-setting firms producing differentiated goods characterized by a constant elasticity of substitution. A representative buyer participates in the goods' markets, supplies labor to firms and sets the level of wage. We assume a bounded rationality framework where economic agents learn to optimize their own utility in a strategic economic context. The model is suited to be represented by a normal-form game in order to perform a convergence analysis of learning dynamics with respect to game-theoretical solutions. Results point out that the general equilibrium solution la Blanchard-Kiyotaki results to be both a Nash equilibrium and Pareto optima allocation, but it is not the most frequently played solution. Indeed, the most played solution is characterized by the highest competition on the side of producers, resembling the Bertrand-like solution on price competition, and by the highest representative buyer's welfare. A possible explanation of this finding is that in our setting the highest competition occurs in the price-setting behavior of firms who face residual demands, whereas the single representative buyer has not any opponent on wage setting thus being able to reach her optimal utility.},

As a consequence, the degree of compression achieved provides an estimate of the level of regularity in the data. Previous work has investigated the use of these estimates to understand the replication of building blocks within Genetic Programming (GP) individuals, and hence to understand how different GP algorithms promote the evolution of repeated common structure within individuals. Here, we extend this work to the population level, and use it to understand the extent of similarity between sub-structures within individuals in GP populations.},

Individuals in our population represent interface specifications and we compute an individual's fitness from a weighted combination of user input and user interface design guidelines. Results from our preliminary study involving three users indicate that users are able to effectively bias evolution towards user interface designs that reflect both user preferences and computed guideline metrics. Furthermore, we can reduce fatigue, defined by the number of choices needing to be made by the human designer, by doing two things. First, asking the user to pick just two (the best and worst) user interfaces from among a subset of nine shown. Second, asking the user to make the choice once every t generations, instead of every single generation. Our goal is to provide interface designers with an interactive tool that can be used to explore innovation and creativity in the design space of user interfaces.},

In this study, we focus on the genetic algorithm based feature selection method and evolutionary computation based parameters optimization algorithm on a larger size data set to explore the potential limit that ANN can achieve in this specific classification problem. In addition, a different procedure in combining evolutionary algorithms and neural networks is proposed. We use the back propagation method to train the neural networks and derive a good combination of parameters. Evolutionary algorithm is then used to search around the neighborhood of the previously acquired parameters to further improve the classification accuracy. The outcomes show that the procedure is effective, and with appropriate combinations of features and parameters setting, the accuracy of the ANN classifier can reach the 88.2% mark, the best we have achieved so far. The result again indicates that AI techniques do have their roles on the identification of students with learning disabilities.},

With the proposed scheme, the linkage information can be obtained by first constructing an ID3 decision tree to learn the mapping from the population of solutions to their corresponding fitness differences caused by perturbations and then inspecting the constructed decision tree for variables exhibiting strong interdependencies with one another. The numerical results show that the proposed technique can accomplish the identical linkage identification task with a lower number of function evaluations compared  to similar methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, the proposed technique is also shown being able to handle both uniformly scaled and exponentially scaled problems.},

We analyze the evolved generalizations and explain why logical disjunctions can make the learning more difficult in XCS models and why our version performs better than the earlier one. Then, we show that in problems that allow many generalizations, so that or clauses are less "convenient", XCSGP tends to develop solutions that do not exploit logical disjunctions as much as one might expect.

Such areas are defined so that a high degree of inter-regional separation and intraregional integration -in both cases in terms of commuting flows- exist. A genetic algorithm has been designed based on the maximization of a fitness function that measures aggregate intra-region interaction under constraints of inter-region separation and minimum size. Additional requirements, typical of any functional regionalization, include the absence of overlapping between delineated regions and an exhaustive coverage of the whole territory (so all basic spatial units must be allocated to one -and only one- region). The complex set of restrictions results in conventional operators often generating invalid solutions, impeding or delaying the evolutionary process. This is the reason why an extensive set of operators has been designed that incorporates knowledge about the problem, allowing the evolution of the set of solutions towards the final result.},

It has been successfully applied to a wide variety of nearly intractable engineering problems. However, the DE and its variants usually employ a deterministic selection mechanism that always allows the better solution to survive to the next generation. This often prevents DE from escaping local optima at the early stages of search over a multi-modal fitness landscape and leads to a premature convergence. The present work proposes to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of DE by introducing a stochastic selection mechanism. The idea of a conditional acceptance function (that allows accepting inferior solutions with a gradually decaying probability) is borrowed from the realm of the Simulated Annealing (SA). In addition, the work proposes a center of mass based mutation operator and a decreasing crossover rate in DE. Performance of the resulting hybrid algorithm has been compared with three state-of-the-art adaptive DE schemes. The method is shown to be statistically significantly better on a six-function testbed and one difficult engineering optimization problem with respect to the following performance measures: solution quality, time to find the solution, frequency of finding the solution, and scalability.},

Its practical relevance also makes it an important real-world application for research in optimization. Because inventory must be managed over time, IM optimization problems are dynamic and online (i.e. they must be solved as time goes by). Dynamic optimization is typically harder than non-dynamic optimization. Much research in IM is devoted to finding specific algorithms that solve specific abstractions. For each new aspect to be taken into account, a new algorithm must be designed. In this paper, we aim at a more general approach. We employ general insights into online dynamic problem solving. A recently proposed framework is also employed. We point out how IM problems can be solved in a much more general fashion using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Here, time-dependence (i.e. decisions taken now have consequences in the future) is an important practical type of problem difficulty that is characteristic of practical dynamic optimization problems. Time-dependence is usually not taken into account in the literature and myopic (i.e. blind to future events) algorithms are often designed. We show that time-dependence is automatically tackled by our novel approach. We extend the common definition of IM problems with time-dependence by introducing customer satisfaction. We show that customer satisfaction for IM problems with superior solutions can be achieved when this form of time-dependence is properly taken into account. This also demonstrates our conclusion that taking into account the existence of time-dependence in practical online dynamic optimization problems such as IM is very important.},

  abstract =	{This paper presents a flexible evolutionary method for minimum-cost multipath constrained routing with load balancing problem in MPLS networks. The proposed solution approach combines genetic algorithms with linear multi-commodity flow to enhance the efficiency of the solution attained. The goal is to determine the distribution of traffic demands over a given capacitated network topology to minimize the routing cost while balancing loads on various links. The constraints that should be satisfied are the maximum hop count, the total number of virtual paths and the link capacities. This problem is a highly constrained multiobjective optimization for which exact optimization methods become helpless to deal with such complexity. Using a case study from the literature, the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with the standard genetic algorithm. We also show how the proposed approach can be used to determine approximate Pareto points and compare them with the exact Pareto front.},

Attempts of researchers' in this field to learn from nature have yielded promising results; they proved the feasibility of applying nature-like mechanisms to the world of digital electronics with self-diagnostic and self-healing characteristics, Design by humans however often results in very complex hardware architectures, requiring a large amount of manpower and computational resources. A wider objective is to find novel solutions to design such complex architectures for Embryonic Systems, by problem decomposition and unique design methodologies so that system functionality and performance will not be compromised. Design automation using reconfigurable hardware and EA (Evolutionary Algorithm), such as GA (Genetic Algorithms), is one way to tackle this issue. This concept applies the notion of EHW (Evolvable Hardware) to the problem domain. Unlocking the power of EHW for both novel design solutions and for circuit optimisation has attracted many researchers since the early '90s. The promise of using Genetic Algorithms through Evolvable Hardware design will, in this paper, be demonstrated by the authors by evolving a relatively simple combinatorial logic circuit (full-adder).},

This is accomplished by placing a prior distribution over the expected class of functions, then employing inference and intuitively defined utilities and costs to transform the evolutionary optimization problem into one of active sampling. This allows us to pose an approach to optimization that is optimal for each expressly stated function class. The resulting solutionmethodology can optimally navigate exploration-exploitation tradeoffs using well-motivated decision theory, while providing the process with a natural stopping criterion. Finally, the model naturally accommodates the expression of dynamic and noisy functions, setting it apart from most existing algorithms that address these issues as an afterthought. We demonstrate the characteristics and advantages of this algorithm formally and with examples.},

Properties of mutation and selection are developed, based on which a Gaussian approximate model of DE is introduced to facilitate mathematical derivations. The evolutionary dynamics and the convergence behavior of DE are investigated based on the derived analytical formulae and their appropriateness is verified by experimental results. It is shown that the lower limit of mutation factor should be as high as 0.68 to avoid premature convergence if the initial population is isotropically normally distributed and infinitely far from the optimum (i.e., the function landscape becomes a hyper- plane). The lower limit, however, may be decreased if the population becomes closer to the optimum and an accordingly smaller mutation factor is beneficial to speed up the convergence. This motivates future research to improve DE by dynamically adapting control parameters as evolution search proceeds.},

Altering the selection pressure had no significant effect on the robustness of the solutions located by tournament selection algorithm for the rONEMAX problem. For the SAW problem, however, tournament selection with a tournament size of four found solutions which were significantly more robust than those located by larger tournament sizes.

Ad hoc networks are generally based on technologies allowing nodes in a geographical neighborhood to communicate for free, in a P2P manner. These technologies include IEEE802.11 (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, etc. In most cases a communication infrastructure is available. It can be a set of access point as well as GMS/UMTS network. The use of such an infrastructure is billed, but it permits distant nodes to get in communication, through what we call "bypass links". The objective of our work is to improve the network connectivity by defining a set of long distance connections. To do this we consider the number of bypass links, as well as the two properties that build on the "small-world" graph theory: the clustering coefficient, and the characteristic path length. A fitness function, used for genetic optimization, is processed out of these three metrics. In this paper we investigate the use of two Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithms (LCGA and CCGA) and compare their performance to a generational and a steadystate genetic algorithm (genGA and ssGA) for optimizing one instance of this topology control problem and present evidence of their capacity to solve it.},

One of the features of the objective functions is "the optimum exists near a boundary much more than the other." On such objective functions, with recommended selection model, the proposed crossover operator set with an appropriate parameter has shown the fastest convergence speed. However, with another selection model, its convergence speed has been the slowest. In order to understand this inversion phenomenon, a theoretical analysis quantified the selection pressures of the selection models and estimated the expected positions of the center of gravity of the population. The theoretical results corresponded to empirical verifications and successfully explained. Finally, a guideline for designing RCGAs was obtained.},

One is Chromosome Reduction (CRed) step which shorten the length of the chromosomes, participating in genetic search, to improve the efficiency. The other is Chromosome Refinement (CRef) step which is a greedy heuristics, rearranging the bits using domain knowledge, to locally improve the fitness of chromosomes. With this hybridization and simple scaffold list, we could obtain longer contigs and scaffolds using GA. We experimented using three actual genome data to test our algorithm.

But, with the development of warship degaussing technology, more and more degaussing coils are being adopted. Thus, conventional methods for calibrating the degaussing system are increasingly difficult to implement. Combining incomplete evolution of every particle swarm and the idea of compressing the space, the evolution of LDW-PSO and space compression is done alternately, until the global optimization solution is got. Through the incomplete evolution of LDW-PSO algorithm, adequate preferable information is got to provide the foundation to reduce the searching space; the collective decision-making of the elite particle group is used to decide the scope of the new space. Taking some warship as an example, the proposed method was applied to adjust the degaussing system and the optimized calibrating mathematical model and optimization results are given. Simulation results are presented, which shows that this algorithm is advantageous to others, in terms of minimizing the vessel degaussing magnetic signature RMS value and peak value, and that this method can be used to optimize one parameter or combinational parameters that relate to the vessel or submarine's magnetic signature, so the vessel or submarine degaussing system is calibrated to an optimal state, and the vessel or submarine's magnetic safety is ensured. Furthermore, this optimization algorithm has many advantages, such as intuitional algorithm, simple programming, high calculating speed, which makes easy collaborating multi-computer and applying it to real project.},

This is the first time that an EDA has been applied to testing object oriented software. In addition to automated test data generation, the EDA approach also offers the potential of modelling the fitness landscape defined by the testing problem and thus could provide some insight into the problem. Firstly, we show results from empirical evaluations and comment on some appealing properties of EDAs in this context. Next, a framework is discussed in order to deal with the generation of efficient tests for the container classes. Preliminary results are provided as well.},

This lack of interpretability is an obvious disadvantage, since decision makers normally require some sort of explanation before taking action. To achieve comprehensibility, accuracy is often sacrificed by the use of simpler, transparent models, such as decision trees. Another alternative is rule extraction; i.e. to transform the opaque model into a comprehensible model, keeping acceptable accuracy. We have previously suggested a rule extraction algorithm named G-REX, which is based on genetic programming. One key property of G-REX, due to the use of genetic programming, is the possibility to use different representation languages. In this study we apply G-REX to estimation tasks. More specifically, three representation languages are evaluated using eight publicly available data sets. The quality of the extracted rules is compared to two standard techniques producing comprehensible models; multiple linear regression and the decision tree algorithm C&amp;RT. The results show that G-REX outperforms the standard techniques, but that the choice of representation language is important.},

Furthermore, the current experimental platform for evolutionary multiobjective portfolio optimization will be improved by introducing diversity measures and statistical analysis that are commonly used in performance assessment of multiobjective optimizers. Comparative study with other conventional representations, based on benchmark problems obtained from the OR-library, demonstrated that the proposed representation is able to attain a better approximation of the efficient frontier in terms of proximity and diversity. Experimental results also validated its viability and practicality in handling the various realistic constraints. Lastly, preference based techniques are considered also, allowing the evolutionary search to be focused on specific region of the efficient frontier. Future work includes improving the algorithmic model with more sophisticated variation operators and local search operators for better exploration and exploitation of the search space.},

The algorithm evolves the architecture of the ANN and trains its weights simultaneously. Different from the other techniques previously used, the proposed algorithm evolves the architecture along with the weights in two different layers. Tested on a non-linear system, typically a boost converter, the DLPSO evolves an optimal ANN controller to produce more efficient and robust results than the conventional control techniques used. The performance of the DLPSO based ANN controller is compared to that of a conventional PI controller at different operating points of the non-linear system. The tests show that the evolved controller performs equal to or better than the conventional techniques in terms of overshoot voltages and settling times for small and large signal input transients. Also, a comparison between the applicability of a PSO and a Real-Valued Genetic Algorithm for the training of weights is presented which shows that the PSO is faster and more efficient as a learning algorithm. Moreover, the proposed approach fully automates the neural network generation process, thus removing the need for time consuming manual design.},

It is proposed as a test bed to design and analyze optimization approaches for design optimization with tremendously reducing the running period of optimization process, while, the merit can be only achieved by correctly approximating the real design situation and satisfying the causality of design and evaluation.

 The representation of the designed object is mostly described by parameterization techniques. To realize the design optimization, is to vary the parameterized object by means of operating the relevant parameters. The solution of design optimization often involved the choice of suitable description for the designed object, which can be obtained by expanding the design freedom. When changing the description length, the original parameters of the designed object will then varied. This bring about the requirements for optimization algorithms to self-adapt their strategy parameters and related variables to perform consistently searching. 

We first put forwards a revised fitness evaluation mechanism for the TSDOP in order to more reasonably check the designed shape and direct optimization procedures. Based on the revised TSDOP framework, we further discuss the parameter setting problem for algorithms, especially evolution strategies, to adapt and initial their search strategy parameters. A solution method is proposed with solving a linear equations by a recursive way with linear time complexity. All discussions are limited with the B-spline parameterization framework, but may generally suit other parameterization techniques. Experiments are used to verify the causality of the revised fitness evaluation mechanism and to study the significance of the proposed method for suitable parameter settings of optimization algorithms during the adaptation of the description length for design optimization.},

The genetic algorithm is combined with an exact method, assuring the optimality of the final solution. The usual way to solve the subproblem is using integer programming. We compare this approach, the genetic algorithm, and a heuristic based on the linear relaxation of the subproblem formulation. We apply these algorithms to a crew scheduling problem that arises in the public transportation of a specific city. The results show that the genetic algorithm outperforms them.},

In this paper we deal with variants of genetic learning applied for the structure optimization and weights evolution of multi-layer perceptron networks. Several genetic operators are tested, including memetic-type local search, that produce good results in terms of network performace. It is shown, that combining evolutionary algorithms with neural networks can lead to better results than relying on neural networks alone in terms of the quality of the solution (both training and generalization error).

In computational experiments in this paper, we examine the effect of dynamically changing the probability using the five control strategies: constant, step-wise increase, step-wise decrease, linear increase, and linear decrease. Better results are obtained for almost all test problems by changing the local search application probability than specifying it as a constant value. An interesting observation is that the choice of an appropriate control strategy is problem-dependent. Gradually decreasing its value leads to good results for many problems. Such a control strategy, however, does not work on some test problems.},

Although route planning has been widely studied, most of the available applications are primarily targeted at finding the shortest path (SP) routes, which is insufficient for dynamic route planning in real life scenario. For example, the travel time for the SP may not correspond to the overall shortest time (ST) route due to varying road conditions. In this paper, the proposed Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm for solving the Dynamic Route Planning Problem (HEADRPP) is believed to be capable of solving this problem. The proposed HEADRPP comprises a Fuzzy Logic Implementation (FLI) and a Graph Partitioning Algorithm (GPA) incorporated into a Genetic Algorithm (GA) core, and offers both optimized SP and ST routes to the user. In this paper, the proposed HEADRPP is successfully tested on a 138 node network extracted from the Singapore Map, and its performance on SP optimization is compared with a pure GA and an ant based algorithm. Overall the performance of the proposed HEADRPP is shown to be robust to the dynamic nature of the DRPP.},

Most grid-based archiving algorithms require apriori knowledge of the span of the Pareto front for pre-setting of the grid length or the associated parameter, grid number. Unfortunately the knowledge is often unavailable beforehand in practice. The quality of the attained nondominated front can be very sensitive to the dimension of the grids. This paper presents a dynamic grid resizing strategy, capable of shrinking or expanding hyper grids as necessity dictates. Empirical study on two- and three-objective test functions demonstrates robust performance with respect to the initial grid sizes. Applied in the context of PAES, the adaptive archiving strategy performed well for initial grid sizes determined from a uniform random distribution. In comparison to AGA, the dynamic strategy presents improved non-dominated solutions in terms of proximity to the Pareto front and diversity for selected test problems.},

On a broader level, this paper acknowledges the need to move from 'optimizing the given', towards 'designing the optimal'. Here, the constraints are treated as objectives over and above the stated objective(s) and no other restrictions are used to 'constrain' the search space. We then evaluate this enhanced set of objectives, in terms of their criticality or redundancy. To this effect, we utilize our earlier proposed dimensionality reduction procedures [3], [7], to obtain a minimal set of objectives, which would characterize the original system with reasonable accuracy (from dimensionality reduction perspective) but with enhanced effectiveness (from a 'system design' perspective).},

The new possibilistic framework, proposed in this paper, is notable because it gives a counterpart of traditional probability framework, generally used to represent uncertainty in sequential data. The possibilistic BK algorithm is based on the junction tree technique where inference is done via an interface clusters that decrease the size of the dynamic network structured and amenable to a very simple form of inference.

Recently, emphasis has been made in addressing the decision-making activities in arriving at a single preferred solution. The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) literature offers a number of possibilities for such a task involving user preferences which can be supplied in different forms. This paper presents an interactive methodology for finding a preferred set of solutions, instead of the complete Pareto-optimal frontier, by incorporating preference information of the decision maker. Particularly, we borrow the concept of light beam search and combine it with the NSGA-II procedure. The working of this procedure has been demonstrated on a set of test problems and on engineering design problems having two to ten objectives, where the obtained solutions are found to match with the true Pareto-optimal solutions. The results highlight the utility of this approach towards eventually facilitating a better and more reliable optimization-cum-decision-making task.},

In particular, the crossover operator of the genetic algorithm is performed with multiple neural networks that have heterogeneous structures: either different number of nodes in a hidden layer or different number of hidden layers. Hence, this optimization process enables co-evolution of multiple NN structures which present different nonlinear models, and facilitates the selection of the most suitable forecasting model from multiple candidates. To expedite the searching process for ENN and meanwhile retain an efficient learning rate, the backpropagation training is applied only to the best or the second best chromosome in each generation. The second contribution of this work is the application of the ENN to a real forecasting problem arising from a car-sharing system. Despite the presence of randomness, nonlinearity and complexity in the forecasting process, the ENN demonstrates superior performance when comparing with both classics time series forecasting approaches and other soft-computing approaches.},

  abstract =	{This paper presents a single-objective and a multiobjective stochastic optimization algorithms for global training of neural networks based on simulated annealing. The algorithms overcome the limitation of local optimization by the conventional gradient-based training methods and perform global optimization of the weights of the neural networks. Especially, the multiobjective training algorithm is designed to enhance generalization capability of the trained networks by minimizing the training error and the dynamic range of the network weights simultaneously. For fast convergence and good solution quality of the algorithms, we suggest the hybrid simulated annealing algorithm with the gradient-based local optimization method. Experimental results show that the performance of the trained networks by the proposed methods is better than that by the gradient-based local training algorithm and, moreover, the generalization capability of the networks is significantly improved by preventing overfitting phenomena.},

A "greedy" algorithm which always aims to get higher power and pay less locational marginal price, as well as a "demand-driven" algorithm which aims to follow closely the individual demand, have been analyzed and implemented in simulations under different market scenarios. The two distinctive algorithms were compared against each other in a simulated power market of a reasonably large scale with 7 buyers and 20 sellers in an IEEE 14 bus network. The PowerWorld<sup>&#174;</sup> simulator has been used as a tool to ensure that the system validity and various constraints have been met. The simulation results suggest that a "demand-driven" co-evolutionary algorithm is more effective as it does not only help buyers to save cost when supply in the market is sufficient, but also enables them to outbid their opponents easily during tougher situations, such as when supply is in great shortage.},

A model of a discrete dynamical system is employed to emulate the evolution of the age distribution used under the adjustment process. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is applied for determining the adjustment magnitudes that influence the dynamics of the system. An interesting aspect of the problem lies in the high number of constraints; though the constraints are fundamental, they are considerably higher in number than in many other optimization problems. An adaptive penalty scheme is proposed for handling the constraints. Numerical examples show that GA with the utilized adaptive penalty scheme provides potential means for HR planning in HRM.},

The rational for this combination is that type-2 fuzzy sets are better able to deal with rule uncertainties, while the optimal GA-based tuning of the T2GA-TSKfnn parameters achieves better classification results. However, a general T2GA-TSKfnn is computationally very intensive due to the complexity of the type-2 to type-1 reduction. Therefore, we adopt an interval T2GA-TSKfnn implementation to simplify the computational process. Simulation results are provided to compare the T2GA-TSKfnn against other fuzzy neural networks. These results show that the proposed system is able to achieve a higher classification rate when compared against a number of other traditional neuro-fuzzy classifiers.},

The algorithm utilizes both bootstrap of training data and random feature subspace techniques to generate an initial and diverse ensemble and evolves the ensemble with negative correlation learning. The idea of generating ensemble by simultaneous randomization of data and feature is to promote the diversity within the ensemble and encourage different individual NNs in the ensemble to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the ensemble can learn better the entire training data. Evolving the ensemble with negative correlation learning emphasizes not only the accuracy of individual NNs but also the cooperation among different individual NNs and thus improves the generalization. As a byproduct of bootstrap, out-of-bag (OOB) estimation, which can estimate the generalization performance without any extra data points, serves another benefit of this algorithm. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by several benchmark problems and in these cases the performance of our algorithm is better than the performance of other ensemble algorithms.},

In this paper, evolutionary computation enabled modelling of such system is presented. Both competitive and cooperative game theory strategies are taken into account in evolving the intelligent model. The model then leads to intelligent trading strategy development and decision support. Experimental tests, verification and validation are carried out with various strategies, using different model scales and data published by NETA.

In some applications (e.g., Grid resource management), negotiation agents should be designed such that they are more likely to acquire resources more rapidly and with more certainty (in addition to optimizing utility). For negotiations with complete information, mathematical proofs show that the negotiation strategy set in this work optimizes the utilities of agents while guaranteeing that agreements are reached. A novel algorithm BLGAN is devised to guide agents in negotiations with incomplete information. BLGAN adopts (1) a Bayesian learning (BL) approach for estimating the reserve price of an agent's opponent, and (2) a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) for generating a proposal at each negotiation (N) round. In bilateral negotiations with incomplete information, empirical results show that when both agents adopt BLGAN to learn each other's reserve price, they are both guaranteed to reach agreements, and complete negotiations with much fewer negotiation rounds. When only one agent adopts BLGAN, the agent was highly successful in reaching agreements, achieved average utilities that were much closer to optimal, and used fewer negotiation rounds than the agent that did not adopt BLGAN.},

The proposed model consists of different modules each responsible for a particular set of tasks. The most challenging task involved in satisfying the demands is routing the traffic subject to multiple QoS constraints for multiple Internet Service Providers (ISP). Routing the traffic subject to multiple constraints itself is known to be an NP-hard problem. This paper addresses the problem of finding the optimum routes to satisfy the demands of different ISPs, where different ISPs have different demands and their priority of QoS keep changing. A genetic algorithm (GA) which makes use of heuristic technique is proposed in this paper. All the optimum routes are found in one run of the program, therefore the chromosome selected encodes all the demanded routes. This paper also makes use of employing a tournament selection mechanism where the diversity of the population is preserved while the best chromosomes are carried to the next generation. The evolutionary property of GA is utilised in this paper to evolve to suit the changing demands. The performance and the evolutionary property of the proposed solution are shown with the simulation tests.},

  abstract =	{Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with a high incidence rate worldwide. In Type-1 diabetes, the failure to produce sufficient pancreatic insulin leads to an uncontrolled increase in blood glucose. Prolong elevated blood glucose level poses significant risks of acute and chronic medical complications. Human assisted insulin injection, either through a fixed regime under the close supervision of a physician or through compartmental model schedules, is fundamentally an open-loop control system. Currently, a large amount of research has been conducted to treat Type-1 diabetes using a closed-loop insulin delivery system. The objective of this work is to investigate the use of a brain-inspired neural fuzzy system as a controller to deliver insulin in a closed-loop system for the treatment of Type-1 diabetes. In this paper, the Pseudo-Outer Product based Fuzzy Neural Network using the Yager rule of inference (i.e. POP-Yager) is employed as an intelligent controller to dispense the appropriate amount of insulin in the presence of varying meal disturbances to achieve normoglycemia for a simulated Type-1 diabetic patient.},

A player in each cell in a grid-world plays against its neighbors defined by this neighborhood structure. The other is for the mating of strategies by genetic operations. A new strategy for a player is generated by genetic operations from a pair of parent strings, which are selected from its neighbors defined by the second neighborhood structure. In this paper, we extend our IPD game simulation to a more realistic problem while keeping the simplicity of the original IPD game. We employ a stochastic strategy represented by a string of real numbers between 0 and 1. Each real number in the string denotes the probability of cooperation. We examine the effects of spatial structures on the evolution of IPD game strategies with probabilistic decision making in various payoff matrices. From simulation results, it is shown that cooperative behavior is evolved only when the interaction neighborhood is small and the mating neighborhood is also small for some payoff matrices.},

The attraction mechanism is coupled with a regular IPD strategy to produce the final agent's behavior. We study the mechanism in 2D space to understand how it influences the emerging spatial structures. We find that any agent strategy, even a plainly irrational one, may become stable in a spatial game given appropriate attraction relations with the neighbors. Also, often the removal of attraction after stabilization causes no qualitative effect. Then we study the effect of introduction of "extreme" agents, such as a "Don Juan" agent that is attracted by all others. Such agents can change dramatically the structure of emerging spatial strategy blocks. Especially the addition or removal of agents after stabilization almost always leads to re-organization and re-stabilization to a new configuration. Various parameters of this model are studied and finally the notion of mobility in relation to evolution is rediscussed. All our results suggest that psychological mechanisms external to the actual "problem" (here IPD) can interfere with it and can actually lead to enhanced cooperation and social stability despite environmental noise and agent irrationality. Moreover, all social/spatial variants that induce more interactions between agents with non-reciprocal attraction relations (such as the extreme agents), are bound to lead to a better social average and to more complex structures.},

Theoretical analysis of the number of function evaluations needed by the GPSEA to produce good solutions is provided. We also perform an empirical comparison of the performance of the GPS-EA to the performance of an EA with a manually tuned fixed population size. Both theoretical and empirical results show that using GPS-EA eliminates the need for manually tuning the population size parameter, while finding good solutions. This comes at the price of using twice as many function evaluations as needed by the EA with an optimal fixed population size; this, in practice, is a low price considering the amount of time and effort it takes to find this optimal population size manually.},

This research is aimed to construct a novel GA-FCMAC-BYY model as an alternative to analyze bank solvency. The proposed model attempts to advance our previous work which uses Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Controller - Bayesian Ying-Yang (FCMAC-BYY) network. Inspired by the ancient Chinese Ying Yang philosophy, FCMAC-BYY obtains optimal solution by achieving harmony between inputs and fuzzy clusters sets. However, it optimizes the fuzzy sets in the individual dimensions, resulting in the lost of relative binding data and global optimization may not be achieved. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is introduced here to look into the issue. GA operates on a population of potential solutions based on the principle of survival of the fittest to produce better approximations to a solution. Populations of candidate solutions are evaluated using fitness functions to determine the best solution. Thereafter, chromosomes would be evolved to produces new genes in the search of the optimal solution. The performance of the proposed GA-FCMAC-BYY model as a bank failure classification and early warning system is very encouraging.},

As we know that it cost too much computational cost, even if we are not sure the results is really global or not, we do not want to re-run evolutional algorithms to make sure its final results. Therefore, evolutional algorithms need to include as much effort as possible to let the user feel relieved that they got close to global solution. In this paper, development of range juggling in Genetic Range Genetic Algorithms (GRGA) for better convergence is described. Genetic Range Genetic Algorithms is updated version of Adaptive Range Genetic Algorithms (ARGA). In ARGA, searching range differ every generation, in the initial stages, searching range try to find the range that include global optimum solution. In the very last stages, it tries to converge to global solution, and the searching range is beginning to shrink in order to raise the accuracy of the solution. Therefore it is very important to choose system parameter especially for the initial stage not to trap into local solution and also not to move too fast to overshoot global solution. Not like ARGA, GRGA is free from critical settings of parameters, but it has some short comings in first convergence, because once searching range is given it does not change before the range is diminished. For better convergence, techniques of range juggling is proposed and examined in this paper. Through numerical experiments, it turned out that it has better convergence and accuracy in simple problem. Even in the case that has a large number of design variables, it can reach close to global optimum solutions.},

QDSEGA combines Q-learning and genetic algorithm effectively, however, it has just employed simple genetic operations in their QDSEGA. We have proposed a crossover for QDSEGA to accelerate the convergence speed to develop a control table for multi-legged robot. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of the proposed neighboring crossover to develop a compact control table for multiple agents.},

  abstract =	{Many genetic diseases are not caused by the effects of a single gene, but rather, are due to multiple genes acting in concert. For complex diseases, looking at the effect of variation in a single gene may predict one disease outcome, while looking at the interactions of genetic variations across multiple genes gives us a richer understanding of the risk of disease, and may predict different outcomes. EpiSwarm is designed to model genetic epistasis (nonlinear effects among genes) using the Swarm system. EpiSwarm rule agents act both as rules to explain epistatic phenomena as well as the machinery to organize the data into clusters of similar etiologies. The preliminary results reported here indicate that the system is a promising approach for visualizing and understanding clusters of disease outcomes for complex genetic diseases.},

The work presented here illustrates the prototype system and examples of the art that may be created with it. Future work will extend the design space to allow a wider range of possibilities and enhance the user-interface to allow more flexibility in design.},

Problems have different properties in the sense of separability, modality, and geometry of the Pareto-front   According to the results, a near optimal set of solutions was found in the majority of the problems. Rotated problems given caused more difficulty than the other problems. Performance metrics indicate that obtained approximation sets were even better than provided reference sets for many problems.},

  abstract =	{In this paper, three multilevel optimization strategies are presented and applied to the design of isolated and cascade airfoils. They are all based on the same general-purpose search platform, which employs Hierarchical, Distributed Metamodel-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (HDMAEAs). The core search engine is an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) assisted by local metamodels (radial basis function networks) which, for each population member, are trained anew on a "suitable" subset of the already evaluated solutions. The hierarchical scheme has a two-level structure, although it may accommodate any number of levels. At each level, the user may link (a) a different evaluation tool, such as low or high fidelity discipline-specific software, (b) a different optimization method, selected amongst stochastic and deterministic algorithms and/or (c) a different set of design variables, according to coarse and fine problem parameterizations. In the aerodynamic shape optimization problems presented in this paper, the three aforementioned techniques resort on (a) Navier-Stokes and integral boundary layer solvers, (b) evolutionary and gradient-descent algorithms where the adjoint method computes the objective function gradient and (c) airfoil parameterizations with different numbers of B&#233;zier control points. The EAs used at any level are coarse-grained distributed EAs with a different MAEA at each deme. The three variants of the HDMAEA can be used either separately or in combination, in order to reduce the CPU cost. The optimization software runs in parallel, on multiprocessor systems.},

Particularly, these efforts have revealed the success of MA on a wide range of real world problems. MAs not only converge to high quality solutions, but also search more efficiently than their conventional counterparts. Despite the success and surge in interests on MAs, there is still plenty of scope for furthering our understanding on how and why synergy between populationbased and individual learning searchers would lead to successful Memetic Algorithms. In this paper we outline several important design issues of Memetic Algorithms and present a systematic study on each. In particular, we conduct extensive experimental studies on the impact of each individual design issue and their relative impacts on memetic search performances by means of three commonly used synthetic problems. From the empirical studies obtained, we attempt to reveal the behaviors of several MA variants to enhance our understandings on MAs.},

  abstract =	{Most real-world search and optimization problems involve multiple conflicting objectives and results in a Pareto-optimal set. Various multi-objective optimization algorithms have been proposed for solving such problems with the goals of finding as many trade-off solutions as possible and maintaining diversity among them. Since last decade, Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) algorithms have been applied successfully to various test and real-world optimization problems. These population based algorithms provide a diverse set of non-dominated solutions. The obtained non-dominated set is close to the true Pareto-optimal front but it's convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front is not guaranteed. Hence to ensure the same, a local search method using classical algorithm can be applied.

 In the present work, SBX based NSGA-II is used as a population based approach and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is used as a local search procedure. This hybridization of evolutionary and classical algorithms approach provides a confidence of converging near to the true Pareto-optimal set with a good diversity. The proposed procedure is successfully applied to 13 test problems consisting two, three and five objectives. The obtained results validate our motivation of hybridizing evolutionary and classical methods.},
