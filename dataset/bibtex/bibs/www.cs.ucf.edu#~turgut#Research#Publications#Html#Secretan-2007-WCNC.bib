      If technological trends are any indication, we are coming upon a future
      where we will have highly-cognitive transmitters and receivers capable of
      using many different frequencies, transmission powers, modulation schemes
      and MAC protocols. Future generations of mobile devices will be able to
      bid for the spectrum that they require from a broker, or will have ways of
      automatically reducing interference by negotiation with other devices.
      Despite the many different algorithms and policies that could be used to
      support this, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently a lack of a
      unified protocol to allow negotiation of spectrum for brokered and
      non-brokered environments. The proposed protocol, PREDATOR (PRotocol for
      Equitable, Dynamic AllocaTion of Radio spectrum), accommodates both
      brokered and ad hoc configurations. In this paper, we provide a detailed
      description of how the protocol works, as well as results from a sample
      application environment to show its efficacy.
