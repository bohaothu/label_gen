 mental {{"}}censors{{"}} that make it hard for us to
 think {{"}}forbidden{{"}} thoughts. But his theory did
 not work so well for humorous nonsense as for other
 comical subjects. In this essay I argue that the
 different forms of humor can be seen as much more
 similar, once we recognize the importance of knowledge
 about knowledge and, particularly, aspects of thinking
 concerned with recognizing and suppressing bugs --
 ineffective or destructive thought processes. When seen
 in this light, much humor that at first seems
 pointless, or mysterious, becomes more
 understandable."

	abstract = {This article reviews research on the use of situation models in language comprehension and memory retrieval over the past 15 years. Situation models are integrated mental representations of a described state of affairs. Significant progress has been made in the scientific understanding of how situation models are involved in language comprehension and memory retrieval. Much of this research focuses on establishing the existence of situation models, often by using tasks that assess one dimension of a situation model. However, the authors argue that the time has now come for researchers to begin to take the multidimensionality of situation models seriously. The authors offer a theoretical framework and some methodological observations that may help researchers to tackle this issue.},
