  abstract =	 {Simulations are an excellent tool for studying
                  artificial intelligence. However, the simulation
                  technology in use by and designed for the artificial
                  intelligence community often fails to take advantage
                  of much of the work by the larger simulation
                  community to produce stable, repeatable, and
                  efficient simulations. We present the new system
                  Middleware for Parallel Agent Discrete Event
                  Simulation (MPADES) as a simulation substrate for
                  the artificial intelligence community. MPADES
                  focuses on the agent as a fundamental simulation
                  component. The ``thinking time'' of an agent is
                  tracked and reflected in the results of the agents'
                  actions. MPADES supports and manages the
                  distribution of agents across machines while being
                  robust to variations in network performance and
                  machine load. We present the system in detail and
                  give experimental results for a simple world model
                  and set of agents. MPADES is not tied to any
                  particular simulation, and is a powerful new tool
                  for creating simulations for the study of artificial
                  intelligence. },
