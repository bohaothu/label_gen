                 relational structures (RSs) as they occur in 2D pattern
                 and 3D object recognition. These techniques, namely,
                 evidence-based networks (EBS-NNets) and Rulegraphs
                 combine techniques from computer vision with those from
                 machine learning and graph matching. The EBS-NNet has
                 the ability to generalize pattern rules from training
                 instances in terms of bounds on both unary (single
                 part) and binary (part relation) numerical features. It
                 also learns the compatibilities between unary and
                 binary feature states in defining different pattern
                 classes. Rulegraphs check this compatibility between
                 unary and binary rules by combining evidence theory
                 with graph theory. The two systems are tested and
                 compared using a number of different pattern and object
                 recognition problems. (21 References).",

                 involves the matching of a sample data graph with the
                 subgraph of a larger model graph where vertices and
                 edges correspond to pattern parts and their relations.
                 In this paper, we present rulegraphs, a new method that
                 combines the graph matching approach with rule-based
                 approaches from machine learning. This new method
                 reduces the cardinality of the (NP-complete) graph
                 matching problem by replacing model part, and their
                 relational attribute states, by rules which depict
                 attribute bounds and evidence for different classes. We
                 show how rulegraphs, when combined with techniques for
                 checking feature label-compatibilities, not only reduce
                 the search space but also improve the uniqueness of the
                 matching process. (37 References).",

                 particular interest for computer vision is the
                 integration of two approaches to the recognition by
                 parts problem-graph matching and syntactic rule-based
                 approaches. A new procedure is developed, named CLARET,
                 which matches parts and relationships by tightly
                 coupling the processes of matching and rule generation
                 at run time. We have developed an interactive system
                 for interpreting hand-drawn symbols and schematic
                 drawings. The system operates invariant to rotation,
                 scale, and position and projects images onto a drawing

                 accommodate new symbols and answer orientation queries,
                 and it is compared empirically with machine learning
                 techniques. (C) 1999 Academic Press.",

                 comprehensive, in that it deals with both the
                 macro-level (societal) and the micro-level (agent)
                 aspects of systems. Gaia is founded on the view of a

                 consisting of various interacting roles. We illustrate
