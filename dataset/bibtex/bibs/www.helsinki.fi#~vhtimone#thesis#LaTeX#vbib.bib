  abstract  = {We consider a data network whose resources are shared by a dynamically varying number of elastic flows. It has been recently found that there exist allocations with the property that the stationary distribution of the number of flows in progress on dierent routes depends only on the traffic loads on these routes. Balanced fairness refers to the most efficient of such allocations. In this paper we present an efficient method for calculating performance metrics such as flow throughputs for networks obeying balanced fairness. The method, which notably applies to the practically interesting case of concentration tree networks, is based on a recursive algorithm for computing the normalization constant of the stationary distribution. This algorithm is extended to include the case where the rate of each flow is additionally limited by an external constraint representing the user's access line for instance. The method is also shown to be applicable to the case of a finite user population. Several examples are worked out.}

It has been recently shown that there exist allocations with the property that the stationary distribution of the number of flows in progress on different routes depends only on the traffic loads on these routes and is insensitive to any detailed traffic characteristics. Balanced fairness refers to the most effcient of such allocations. In this paper we develop a general recursive algorithm for efficiently calculating the corresponding performance metrics like flow throughput. Several examples are worked out using this algorithm including the practically interesting case of tree networks.},

  abstract    = {Quality of Service (QoS) is a general notion of introducing different quality levels to the best-effort Internet. Differentiation of traffic is needed both to guarantee quality requirements for real-time applications as well as to offer different levels of priority inside traffic classes. Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is a set of mechanisms aiming at providing scalable differentiation, where quality treatment inside the network is done to aggregates of flows not to individual flows. Quality guarantees can be divided into two service models. In assured services the flow should receive a rate at least equal to the contracted rate, while in relative services the rate of the flow should be proportional to the contracted rate. The thesis models QoS mechanisms used and proposed for use in DiffServ networks. The modelling concentrates on the interaction between various differentiation mechanisms and traffic flows using a given transport protocol. This type of closed loop modelling of the dependency of the flow sending rate on the metering, marking, dropping and scheduling mechanisms has not been done before. The mechanisms are modelled and analyzed on two levels: flow level and packet level. Furthermore detailed simulation of the packet level are performed. The correspondence between the models is good, and each modelling approach is able to illustrate a different aspect of mechanism design, either through the choice of parameter values or through the choice between two complementary mechanisms. Based on the models, we study how well relative services can be achieved, i.e. in what proportion network bandwidth is divided, using DiffServ without admission control.}
