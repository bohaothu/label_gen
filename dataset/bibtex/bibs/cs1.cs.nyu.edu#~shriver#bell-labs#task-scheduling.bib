	problem in hierarchical parallel systems, where each site consists 
	of a collection of local time-shared (e.g., CPU(s) or disk(s)) and 
	space-shared (e.g., memory) resources and communicates with remote 
	sites by message-passing. Earlier work on the problem employs either 
	one-dimensional models of parallel task scheduling, effectively 
	ignoring the potential benefits of resource sharing, or models of 
	globally accessible resource units, ignoring the affinity of system 
	resources to sites. In this paper, we develop a general approach 
	capturing the full complexity of scheduling distributed 
	multi-dimensional resource units for all forms of parallelism within 
	and across queries and operators. We present a level-based list 
	scheduling heuristic algorithm for independent query tasks (i.e., 
	operator pipelines) that is provably near-optimal for given degrees of 
	partitioned parallelism (with a worst-case performance ratio that 
	depends on the number of time-shared and space-shared resources per 
	site and the granularity of the clones). We also provide extensions 
	to handle precedence constraints in bushy query plans as well as 
	on-line task arrivals (e.g., in a dynamic or multi-query execution 
	environment). Preliminary experimental results confirm the 
	effectiveness of our scheduling algorithm compared both to previous 
	approaches and the optimal solution. Based on our analytical and 
	experimental results, we revisit the open problem of designing 
	efficient cost models for parallel query optimization and propose a 
	solution that captures all the important parameters of parallel

	priority rules. In this paper, we consider various job shop 
	scheduling problems with batch setup times. For each job a specific 
	technological route and a release date are given.  Moreover, the jobs 
	are partitioned into groups. A sequence independent setup time s rj 
	is required on machine j when a job of the r-th group is processed 
	after a job of another group. We consider different types of job 
	availability, namely item and batch availability.  As objective 
	function we use both regular and nonregular criteria. For such 
	problems we apply insertion techniques combined with beam search. 
	Especially we consider different insertion orders of the operations 
	or jobs. A refined variant of the insertion algorithm is presented, 
	where several operations are inserted in parallel. The proposed 
	variants have been tested on a large collection of test problems and 
	compared with other constructive algorithms based on priority rules.",

	sharing the same server for setting up jobs with the objective of 
	minimizing the machine idle time resulting from the unavailability 
	of the server is considered. The problem is shown to be strongly 
	NP-hard and a reduction procedure is developed to transform it into 
	a smaller one with all consecutive job completions alternating 
	between the 2 machines. In the latter problem, regeneration points 
	are identified for simplifying the idle time computations, leading 
	to the development of an efficient beam search heuristic. 
	Computational results indicate that the beam search performs very 
	favorably when compared with the local search on a wide variety of

	to take a known probability distribution function when dealing with 
	uncertain scheduling environments. The scheduling environments that 
	we consider in this paper are so uncertain that all information 
	available about the processing time of an operation is an upper and
