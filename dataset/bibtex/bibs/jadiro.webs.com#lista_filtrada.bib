  abstract = {PURPOSE: A new, simple, sensitive and rapid method was developed to
	analyse the polymorphic purity of crystalline ranitidine-HCI as a
	bulk drug and from a tablet formulation. METHODS: Diffuse reflectance
	infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was combined with
	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a data modelling tool. A standard
	feed-forward network, with backpropagation rule and with single hidden
	layer architecture was chosen. Reduction and transformation of the
	spectral data enhanced the ANN performance and reduced the complexity
	of the ANNs model. Spectral intensities from 1738 wavenumbers were
	reduced into 173 averaged spectral values. These 173 values were
	used as inputs for the ANN. Following a sensitivity analysis the
	number of inputs was reduced to 30, or 35, these being the input
	windows which had most effect on the output of the ANN. RESULTS:
	For the bulk drug assay, the ANN model had 30 inputs selected from
	a sensitivity analysis, one hidden layer, and two output neurons,
	one for the percentage of each ranitidine hydrochloride crystal form.
	The model could simultaneously distinguish between crystal forms
	and quantify them enabling the physical purity of the bulk drug to
	be checked. For the tablet assay, the ANN model had 173 averaged
	spectral values as the inputs, one hidden layer and five output neurons,
	two for the percentage of the two ranitidine hydrochloride crystal
	forms and three more outputs for tablet excipients and additives.
	The ANN was able to solve the problem of overlapping peaks and it
	successfully identified and quantified all components in tablet formulation
	with reasonable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the advantages over
	conventional analytical methods include simplicity, speed and good
	selectivity. The results from DRIFT spectral quantification study
	show the benefits of the neural network approach in analysing spectral
	data.},

	to handle different capabilities of the MAS over the OO systems.
	In this work a heavyweight extension to UML metamodel is proposed
	for modeling MAS according to our unified MAS conceptual model. It
	is not limited to a specific application domain or specific agent
	architecture. A proposed MAS-UML tool is built based on the extended

	Agents constitute also a natural paradigm to engineer simulations

	rapidly evolved in the past decade. The demand for mobile communications
	is increasing and packet data services through Internet protocol
	(IP) networks have become a trend. To supply more IP addresses to
	network devices and improve network performance, a new IP version
	6 (IPv6) was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force in
	1994. IPv6 supports certain features that make mobility management
	more efficient in mobile IP. A cellular architecture is needed to
	improve the communications quality and to reduce power consumption,
	both at the base and mobile stations. In a cellular environment,
	handoffs occur frequently. Reducing the defects caused by handoffs
	is extremely important in the mobile network environment. This is
	especially important for high-speed moving devices. In this paper,
	a handoff strategy called neighbor-assisted agent architecture, which
	takes advantage of the ad-hoc network to improve handoff performance,
	is proposed. Timing analytical and simulation results show that the
	proposed mechanism can provide a better solution than mobile IP for

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the status and outline the trends of community
	pharmacy services in the Portuguese healthcare system. FINDINGS:
	The legal framework for Portuguese pharmacies includes geographic
	and demographic criteria for opening pharmacies and restricting ownership
	to pharmacists. Since 1975, pharmacy owners have been organized under
	one association, the Portuguese National Pharmacy Association, which
	has dealt with pharmacy development over the past 20 years. Securing
	the economic sustainability of pharmacies was the first milestone.
	Investing in information software and communication technologies
	and modernizing the architecture of pharmacies was the next step.
	Then, professional services such as point-of-care measurements, drug
	waste management, and needle exchange services were developed. The
	methadone substitution program was introduced at a later date. Finally,
	major comprehensive services, including disease management/pharmaceutical
	care programs, were implemented. DISCUSSION: All Portuguese pharmacies
	are independent, which means that the decision to provide different
	services and the extent to which they are attained vary from pharmacy
	to pharmacy. Recent political changes seem to reinforce the need
	to pursue the strategies already defined-to expand the traditional
	scope of pharmacy business to a wider range of health services. CONCLUSIONS:
	Achievements that have been accomplished and strategies that are
	in place reflect a high level of organization and unity among Portuguese
	pharmacies. From a global perspective, pharmacies are reorganizing
	to be able to compete against other possible agents and are preparing
	to expand their scope of intervention.},

	The aim of this research was to address the design of an alternative

	RESULTS: An advanced multi-layer architecture for efficient data

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms rarely deal with ontogenetic, non-inherited
	alteration of genetic information because they are based on a direct
	genotype-phenotype mapping. In contrast, several processes have been
	discovered in nature which alter genetic information encoded in DNA
	before it is translated into amino-acid chains. Ontogenetically altered
	genetic information is not inherited but extensively used in regulation
	and development of phenotypes, giving organisms the ability to, in
	a sense, re-program their genotypes according to environmental cues.
	An example of post-transcriptional alteration of gene-encoding sequences
	is the process of RNA Editing. Here we introduce a novel Agent-based
	model of genotype editing and a computational study of its evolutionary
	performance in static and dynamic environments. This model builds
	on our previous Genetic Algorithm with Editing, but presents a fundamentally
	novel architecture in which coding and non-coding genetic components
	are allowed to co-evolve. Our goals are: (1) to study the role of
	RNA Editing regulation in the evolutionary process, (2) to understand
	how genotype editing leads to a different, and novel evolutionary
	search algorithm, and (3) the conditions under which genotype editing
	improves the optimization performance of traditional evolutionary
	algorithms. We show that genotype editing allows evolving agents
	to perform better in several classes of fitness functions, both in
	static and dynamic environments. We also present evidence that the
	indirect genotype/phenotype mapping resulting from genotype editing
	leads to a better exploration/exploitation compromise of the search
	process. Therefore, we show that our biologically-inspired model
	of genotype editing can be used to both facilitate understanding
	of the evolutionary role of RNA regulation based on genotype editing
	in biology, and advance the current state of research in Evolutionary

	in the proposed system are the primitive agent and the behavioral

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce a multiagent architecture called the MultiAGent
	Metaheuristic Architecture (MAGMA) conceived as a conceptual and
	practical framework for metaheuristic algorithms. Metaheuristics
	can be seen as the result of the interaction among different kinds
	of agents: The basic architecture contains three levels, each hosting
	one or more agents. Level-0 agents build solutions, level-1 agents
	improve solutions, and level-2 agents provide the high level strategy.
	In this framework, classical metaheuristic algorithms can be smoothly
	accommodated and extended. The basic three level architecture can
	be enhanced with the introduction of a fourth level of agents (level-3
	agents) coordinating lower level agents. With this additional level,
	MAGMA can also describe, in a uniform way, cooperative search and,
	in general, any combination of metaheuristics. We describe the entire
	architecture, the structure of agents in each level in terms of tuples,
	and the structure of their coordination as a labeled transition system.
	We propose this perspective with the aim to achieve a better and
	clearer understanding of metaheuristics, obtain hybrid algorithms,
	suggest guidelines for a software engineering-oriented implementation
	and for didactic purposes. Some specializations of the general architecture
	will be provided in order to show that existing metaheuristics [e.g.,
	greedy randomized adaptive procedure (GRASP), ant colony optimization
	(ACO), iterated local search (ILS), memetic algorithms (MAs)] can
	be easily described in our framework. We describe cooperative search
	and large neighborhood search (LNS) in the proposed framework exploiting
	level-3 agents. We show also that a simple hybrid algorithm, called
	guided restart ILS, can be easily conceived as a combination of existing

	which consists of two polypeptide chains of 3.8 and 8.4 kDa linked
	by two disulfide bridges. In this work, a complete assignment of
	the 1H spectra of napin BnIb has been carried out by two-dimensional
	NMR sequence-specific methods and its secondary structure determined
	on the basis of spectral data. A calculation of the tertiary structure
	has been performed using approximately 500 distance constraints derived
	from unambiguously assigned NOE cross-correlations and distance geometry
	methods. The resulting global fold consists of five helices and a
	C-terminal loop arranged in a right-handed spiral. The folded protein
	is stabilized by two interchain disulfide bridges and two additional
	ones between cysteine residues in the large chain. The structure
	of napin BnIb represents a third example of a new and distinctive
	folding pattern first described for the hydrophobic protein from
	soybean and nonspecific lipid transfer proteins from wheat and maize.
	The presence of an internal cavity is not at all evident, which rules
	out in principle the napin BnIb as a carrier of lipids. The determined
	structure is compatible with activities attributed to these proteins
	such as phospholipid vesicle interaction, allergenicity, and calmodulin
	antagonism. Given the sequence homology of BnIb with other napins
	and napin-type 2S albumin seed proteins from different species, it
	is likely that all these proteins share a common architecture. The
	determined structure will be crucial to establish structure-function
	relationships and to explore the mechanisms of folding, processing,
	and deposition of these proteins. It will also provide a firm basis
	for a rational use of genetic engineering in order to develop improved

	Current use of X-ray micro-CT can be extended in three ways to increase
	the quantitative imaging of molecular transport and accumulation

	usual iodine, attached to molecules of interest or to surrogates

	compartments, and the transport to and from such compartments, can
	be quantitated from the imaged spatial distribution of these contrast

	CT images can be used to improve the quantitative nature of radionuclide-based
	tomographic images (SPECT & PET) by providing correction for attenuation
	of the emitted gamma rays and the accurate delineation of physiological
	spaces known to selectively accumulate those indicators. Similarly,
	other imaging modalities which also localize functions in 2D images
	(such as histological sections subsequently obtained from the same
	specimen), can provide a synergistic combination with CT-based 3D
	microstructure. (3) By increasing the sensitivity and specificity
	of X-ray CT image contrast by use of methods such as: K-edge subtraction
	imaging, X-ray fluorescence imaging, imaging of the various types
	of scattered X-ray and the consequences of the change in the speed
	of X-rays through different tissues, such as refraction and phase
	shift. These other methods of X-ray imaging can increase contrast

	magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the resulting high-quality
	solution structure was compared with corresponding structures obtained
	from studies with the intact, 65-residue polypeptide chain of hirudin.
	On the basis of 580 distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser
	effects and 109 dihedral angle constraints, a group of 20 conformers
	representing the solution structure of hirudin(1-51) was computed
	with the program DIANA and energy-minimized with a modified version
	of the program AMBER. Residues 3 to 30 and 37 to 48 form a well-defined
	molecular core with two antiparallel beta-sheets composed of residues
	14 to 16 and 20 to 22, and 27 to 31 and 36 to 40, and three reverse
	turns at residues 8 to 11 (type II), 17 to 20 (type II') and 23 to
	26 (type II). The average root-mean-square deviation of the individual
	NMR conformers relative to their mean co-ordinates is 0.38 A for
	the backbone atoms and 0.77 A for all heavy atoms of these residues.
	Increased structural disorder was found for the N-terminal dipeptide
	segment, the loop at residues 31 to 36, and the C-terminal tripeptide
	segment. The solution structure of hirudin(1-51) has the same molecular
	architecture as the corresponding polypeptide segment in natural
	hirudin and recombinant desulfatohirudin. It is also closely similar
	to the crystal structure of the N-terminal 51-residue segment of
	hirudin in a hirudin-thrombin complex, with root-mean-square deviations
	of the crystal structure relative to the mean solution structure
	of 0.61 A for the backbone atoms and 0.91 A for all heavy atoms of
	residues 3 to 30 and 37 to 48. Further coincidence is found for the
	loop formed by residues 31 to 36, which shows increased structural
	disorder in all available solution structures of hirudin, and of
	which residues 32 to 35 are not observable in the electron density
	map of the thrombin complex. Significant local structural differences
	between hirudin(1-51) in solution and hirudin in the crystalline
	thrombin complex were identified mainly for the N-terminal tripeptide

	of popular agent architectures, we draw UML (Unified Modeling Language)
	diagrams to guide an implementer's design. However, before we describe
	these diagrams, we need to review some basic features of agents.
	The paper considers an architecture showing a simple agent interacting
	with an environment. The agent senses its environment, uses what
	it senses to choose an action, and then performs the action through
	its effectors. Sensory input can include received messages, and action
	can be the sending of messages. To construct an agent, we need a
	more detailed understanding of how it functions. In particular, if
	we are to build one using conventional object-oriented analysis and
	design techniques, we should know in what ways an agent is more than
	just a simple object},

	Such agent-mediated medical systems can manage complex tasks and
	have the potential to adapt gracefully to unexpected events. However,
	in these kinds of systems the issues of privacy, security and trust
	are particularly sensitive in relation to matters such as agents'
	access to patient records, what is acceptable behaviour for an agent
	in a particular role and the development of trust both between (heterogeneous)
	agents and between users and agents. To address these issues we propose
	a formal normative framework, deriving from and developing the notion
	of an electronic institution. Such institutions provide a framework
	to define and police norms that guide, control and regulate the behaviour
	of the heterogeneous agents that participate in the institution.
	These norms define the acceptable actions that each agent may perform
	depending on the role or roles it is playing, and clearly specifies
	the data it may access and/or modify in playing those roles. In this
	paper, we present the formalization of Carrel, a virtual organization
	for the procurement of organs and tissues for transplantation purposes,
	as an electronic institution using the ISLANDER institution specification
	language as formalizing languages. We demonstrate aspects of the
	formalization of such an institution, example fragments in the language

	be used as a blueprint in the implementation of the final agent architecture,

	Prescriptions from the Veteran's Health Information System Technology
	Architecture (VISTA) database for angiotension-converting enzyme
	(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers,
	calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and a miscellaneous group
	of antihypertensives filled or refilled during a 12-month period
	were included in the analysis. Claims data for each prescription
	were exported from the VISTA database to Microsoft Excel, and compliance
	rates were calculated by use of a methodology reported elsewhere.
	Mean compliance rates for each antihypertensive category were compared.
	RESULTS: A total of 26 201 prescription records accounting for 51
	927 separate prescription fills or refills were included. The majority
	of prescriptions (77\%) were associated with calculated compliance
	rates >80\%. The CCB category was associated with a significantly
	higher compliance rate (p < 0.001) than the beta-blockers (95\% CI
	1.3\% to 3.7\%), diuretics (95\% CI 1.4\% to 3.8\%), and miscellaneous
	agents (95\% CI 1.7\% to 7.5\%). The ACE inhibitor category was associated
	with a significantly higher rate (p < 0.001) than the beta-blockers
	(95\% CI 0.7\% to 3.0\%), diuretics (95\% CI 0.7\% to 3.0\%), and

	(95\% CI 1.2\% to 11.9\%). There were no significant differences
	in compliance rates among ACE inhibitors, CCBs, or ARBs. CONCLUSIONS:
	VA outpatients are relatively compliant when taking their antihypertensive
	medications as measured by prescription refill rates. Compliance
	rates for CCBs and ACE inhibitors are higher than those for beta-blockers,
	diuretics, and agents such as clonidine, methyldopa, hydralazine,
	and reserpine. Compliance for ARBs compared favorably with those
	of CCBs and ACE inhibitors. The methods used in this evaluation can

	a common task for evaluation of various theories, algorithms, and
	agent architectures. In the RoboCup simulation league, software agents
	play soccer games on an official soccer server over the network.
	When constructing these software agents, issues in area of agent
	architecture arise to satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists.
	This paper presents an overview of the agent architectures used in
	the simulator teams in RoboCup-99. Many types of agent architectures
	are reported and compared. We also provide some open questions for
	discussion and give some possible answers to be verified in the near

  abstract = {The framework of an assessment system on transformers' condition is
	proposed in this paper through mainly using data mining techniques.
	Moreover, a warehouse is used to collect transformers' testing data,
	and a multi-agent system is used to design the framework of the software.
	The present framework is open and flexible, so the objective system
	is easy to be developed and maintained. The system can support transformers'
	condition-based maintenance to reduce electric utility's cost. The
	condition of a transformer depends on its design, present and historical
	data relating to its installation environment, load amounts, being
	switched number and so on. Usually the off-line testing results,
	operational data, fault records and weather conditions have been
	stored in different systems, so finding an effective method to utilize
	all this information for condition assessment is difficult. Therefore,
	a data warehouse has been used to integrate all of the above data,
	and some data mining techniques have been used to find the pattern
	and trend of the condition of a transformer. Then whether it is healthy
	can be determined. In order to make the system open and flexible,
	open agent architecture (OAA) is employed to compose the multi-agent
	system. Seven application agents are designed to evaluate transformers'
	conditions synthetically. The Grey correlation method, grey theory
	prediction model GM(1,1), Bayesian network classifier and Bayesian
	network are employed in the agents.},
