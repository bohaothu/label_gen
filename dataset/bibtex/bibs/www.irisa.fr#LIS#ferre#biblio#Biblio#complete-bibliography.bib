      relation d'une base de données sur un cube de données OLAP, afin 
      d'afficher ces règles de manière plus structurée et plus intuitive. 
      De plus, nous montrons que les liens de navigation d'OLAP peuvent 
      aider l'utilisateur à naviguer dans ces règles produites.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Concept lattices have been successfully used for 
      information retrieval and browsing. They offer the advantage of 
      combining querying and navigation in a consistent way. Conceptual 
      navigation is more flexible than hierarchical navigation, and easier 
      to use than plain querying. It has already been applied to formal, 
      logical, and relational contexts, but its application to the semantic 
      web is a challenge because of inference mechanisms and expressive 
      query languages such as SPARQL. The contribution of this paper is to 
      extend conceptual navigation to the browsing of RDF graphs, where 
      concepts are accessed through SPARQL-like queries. This extended 
      conceptual navigation is proved consistent w.r.t. the context (i.e., 
      never leads to an empty result set), and complete w.r.t. the 
      conjunctive fragment of the query language (i.e., every query can be 
      reached by navigation only). Our query language has an expressivity 
      similar to SPARQL, and has a more natural syntax close to description 
      logics.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Since the arrival of digital cameras, many people are 
      faced to the challenge of organizing and browsing the overwhelming 
      flood of photos their life produces. The same is true for all sorts 
      of documents, e.g.~emails, audio files. Existing systems either let 
      users fill query boxes without any assistance, or drive them through 
      rigid navigation structures (e.g., hierarchies); or they do not let 
      users put annotations on their documents, even when this would 
      support the organization and retrieval of any documents on customized 
      criteria. We present a tool, {\sc Camelis}, that offers users with an 
      organization that is dynamically computed from documents and their 
      annotations. {\sc Camelis} is designed along the lines of Logical 
      Information Systems (LIS), which are founded on logical concept 
      analysis. Hence, (1) an expressive language can be used to describe 
      photos and query the collection, (2) manual and automatic annotations 
      can be smoothly integrated, and (3) expressive querying and flexible 
      navigation can be mixed in a same search and in any order. This 
      presentation is illustrated on a real collection of more than 5,000 
      photos.}

      for browsing data sets. Besides browsing, update and complex data are 
      other important aspects of information systems. To have an efficient

      because of the diversity of complex data and the computation of 
      conceptual structures, but essential for the scalability to 
      real-world applications. We propose to decompose contexts into 
      simpler and specialized components: logical context functors. We 
      demonstrate this allows for scalable implementations, updatable 
      ontologies, and richer navigation structures, while retaining 
      genericity.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Today, the thematic layer is still the prevailling 
      structure in geomatics for handling geographical information. 
      However, the layer model is rigid: it implies partitionning 
      geographical data in predefined categories and using the same 
      description schema for all elements of a layer. Recently, Logical 
      Information Systems (LIS) introduced a new paradigm for information 
      management and retrieval. Using LIS, we propose a more flexible 
      organisation of vectorial geographical data at a thiner level since 
      it is centered on the geographical feature. LIS do not rely on a 
      hierarchical organisation of information, and enable to tightly 
      combine querying and navigation. In this article, we present the use 
      of LIS to handle geographical data. In particular, we detail a data 
      model for geographical features and the corresponding querying and 
      navigation model. These models have been implemented in the GEOLIS 
      prototype, which has been used to lead experiments on real data.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a natural framework to 
      learn from examples. Indeed, learning from examples results in sets 
      of frequent concepts whose extent contains mostly these examples. In 
      terms of association rules, the above learning strategy can be seen 
      as searching the premises of rules where the consequence is set. In 
      its most classical setting, FCA considers attributes as a non-ordered 
      set. When attributes of the context are partially ordered to form a 
      taxonomy, Conceptual Scaling allows the taxonomy to be taken into 
      account by producing a context completed with all attributes deduced 
      from the taxonomy. The drawback, however, is that concept intents 
      contain redundant information. In this article, we propose a 
      parameterized algorithm, to learn rules in the presence of a 
      taxonomy. It works on a non-completed context. The taxonomy is taken 
      into account during the computation so as to remove all redundancies 
      from intents. Simply changing one of its operations, this 
      parameterized algorithm can compute various kinds of concept-based 
      rules. We present instantiations of the parameterized algorithm to 
      learn rules as well as to compute the set of frequent concepts.}

   ABSTRACT     = {The semantic web aims at enabling the web to understand 
      and answer the requests from people and machines. It relies on 
      several standards for representing and reasoning about web contents. 
      Among them, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is used to define 
      ontologies, i.e. knowledge bases, and is formalized with description 
      logics. In this paper, we demonstrate how dynamic taxonomies and 
      their benefits can be transposed to browse OWL~DL ontologies. We only 
      assume the ontology has an assertional part, i.e. defines objects and 
      not only concepts. The existence of relations between objects in OWL 
      leads us to define new navigation modes for crossing these relations. 
      A prototype, Odalisque, has been developed on top of well-known tools 
      for the semantic web.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Because of the expansion of geo-positioning tools and 
      the democratization of geographical information, the amount of 
      geo-localized data that is available around the world keeps 
      increasing. So, the ability to efficiently retrieve informations in 
      function of their geographical facet is an important issue. In 
      addition to individual properties such as position and shape, spatial 
      relations between objects are an important criteria for selecting and 
      reaching objects of interest: e.g., given a set of touristic points, 
      selecting those having a nearby hotel or reaching the nearby hotels. 
      In this paper, we propose Logical Concept Analysis (LCA) and its 
      handling of relations for representing and reasoning on various kinds 
      of spatial relations: e.g., Euclidean distance, topological 
      relations. Furthermore, we present an original way of navigating in 
      geolocalized data, and compare the benefits of our approach with 
      traditional Geographical Information Systems (GIS).}

   ABSTRACT     = {Recent work in fault localization crosschecks traces of 
      correct and failing execution traces. The implicit underlying 
      technique is to search for association rules which indicate that 
      executing a particular source line will cause the whole execution to 
      fail. This technique, however, has limitations. In this article, we 
      first propose to consider more expressive association rules where 
      several lines imply failure. We then propose to use Formal Concept 
      Analysis (FCA) to analyze the resulting numerous rules in order to 
      improve the readability of the information contained in the rules. 
      The main contribution of this article is to show that applying two 
      data mining techniques, association rules and FCA, produces better 
      results than existing fault localization techniques.}

   ABSTRACT     = { In academia, many decisions are taken in committee, for 
      example to hire people or to allocate resources. Genuine people often 
      leave such meetings quite frustrated. Indeed, it is intrinsically 
      hard to make multi-criteria decisions, selection criteria are hard to 
      express and the global picture is too large for participants to 
      embrace it fully. In this article, we describe a recruiting process 
      where logical concept analysis and formal concept analysis are used 
      to address the above problems. We do not pretend to totally eliminate 
      the arbitrary side of the decision. We claim, however, that, thanks 
      to concept analysis, genuine people have the possibility to 1) be 
      fair with the candidates, 2) make a decision adapted to the 
      circumstances, 3) smoothly express the rationales of decisions, 4) be 
      consistent in their judgements during the whole meeting, 5) vote (or 
      be arbitrary) only when all possibilities for consensus have been 
      exhausted, and 6) make sure that the result, in general a total 
      order, is consistent with the partial orders resulting from the 
      multiple criteria.}

      this paper, we present other navigation modes than zoom-in for less 
      directed and more exploratory browsing of a document collection. The 
      presented navigation modes are zoom-out, shift, pivot, and querying 
      by examples. These modes correspond to query transformations, and 
      make use of boolean operators. Therefore, the current focus is always 
      clearly specified by a query.}

      prototype, GEOLIS1, which tightly combines querying and navigation in

   ABSTRACT     = {Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a natural framework for 
      learning from positive and negative examples. Indeed, learning from 
      examples results in sets of frequent concepts whose extent contains 
      only these examples. In terms of association rules, the above 
      learning strategy can be seen as searching the premises of exact 
      rules where the consequence is fixed. In its most classical setting, 
      FCA considers attributes as a non-ordered set. When attributes of the 
      context are ordered, Conceptual Scaling allows the related taxonomy 
      to be taken into account by producing a context completed with all 
      attributes deduced from the taxonomy. The drawback, however, is that 
      concept intents contain redundant information. In this article, we 
      propose a parameterized generalization of a previously proposed 
      algorithm, in order to learn rules in the presence of a taxonomy. The 
      taxonomy is taken into account during the computation so as to remove 
      all redundancies from intents. Simply changing one component, this 
      parameterized algorithm can compute various kinds of concept-based 
      rules. We present instantiations of the parameterized algorithm for 
      learning positive and negative rules.}

      faced to the challenge of organizing and retrieving the overwhelming 
      flow of photos their life produces. Most people put no metadata on 
      their photos, and we believe this is because existing tools make a 
      very limited use of them. We present a tool, Camelis, that offers 
      users with an organization of photos that is dynamically computed 
      from the metadata, making worthwhile the effort to produce it. 
      Camelis is designed along the lines of Logical Information Systems 
      (LIS), which are founded on logical concept analysis. Hence, (1) an 
      expressive language can be used to describe photos and query the 
      collection, (2) manual and automatic metadata can be smoothly 
      integrated, and (3) expressive querying and flexible navigation can 
      be mixed in a same search and in any order. This presentation is 
      illustrated by experiences on a real collection of more than 5000 
      photos.}

      as to form informative concepts. However these scales are either 
      defined by hand, or derived in a context-unaware manner (e.g., all 
      words occuring in string values). We present an efficient algorithm 
      based on suffix trees that produces complete and concise substring 
      scales. Completeness ensures that every possible concept is formed, 
      like when considering the scale of all substrings. Conciseness 
      ensures the number of scale attributes (substrings) is less than the 
      cumulated size of all string values. This algorithm is integrated in 
      Camelis, and illustrated on the set of all ICCS paper titles.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Dynamic taxonomies have been proposed as a solution for 
      combining querying and navigation, offering both expressivity and 
      interactivity. Navigation is based on the filtering of a 
      multidimensional taxonomy w.r.t. query answers, which helps users to 
      focus their search. We show that properties that are commonly used 
      only in queries can be integrated in taxonomies, and hence in 
      navigation, by the use of so-called logics. Hand-designed taxonomies 
      and concrete domains (e.g., dates, strings) can be combined so as to 
      form complex taxonomies. For instance, valued attributes can be 
      handled, and different roles between documents and locations can be 
      distinguished. Logical Information Systems (LIS) are characterized by 
      the combination of querying and navigation, and the systematic use of 
      logics.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Today, the thematic layer is still the prevailling 
      structure in geomatics for handling geographical information. 
      However, the layer model is rigid: it implies partitionning 
      geographical data in predefined categories and using the same 
      description schema for all elements of a layer. Recently, Logical 
      Information Systems (LIS) introduced a new paradigm for information 
      management and retrieval. Using LIS, we propose a more flexible 
      organisation of vectorial geographical data at a thiner level since 
      it is centered on the geographical feature. LIS does not rely on a 
      hierarchical organisation of information, and enable to tightly 
      combine querying and navigation in a same search. In this article, we 
      present a work in progress about the use of LIS model to handle 
      geographical data. In particular, we detail a data model for 
      geographical features and the corresponding querying and navigation 
      model. These models have been implemented in the GEOLIS prototype, 
      which has been used to lead experiments with real data.}

      logic transformers that may add connectives or recursive structures, 
      or may alter the semantics of a logic. The semantic structure of the 
      framework is model theoretic as opposed to the verifunctional style 
      often used in classical logic. This comes close to the semantics of 
      description logics, and we show indeed that the logic~${\cal ALC}$ 
      can be rebuilt using logic functors. This offers the immediate 
      advantage that variants of~${\cal ALC}$ can be explored and 
      implemented almost for free. This report comes with extensive 
      appendices describing in detail a toolbox of logic functors 
      (definitions, algorithms, theorems, and proofs).}

   ABSTRACT     = { Many application domains make use of specific data 
      structures such as sequences and graphs to represent knowledge. These 
      data structures are ill-fitted to the standard representations used 
      in machine learning and data-mining algorithms: propositional 
      representations are not expressive enough, and first order ones are 
      not efficient enough. In order to efficiently represent and reason on 
      these data structures, and the complex patterns that are related to 
      them, we use domain-specific logics. We show these logics can be 
      built by the composition of logical components that model elementary 
      data structures. The standard strategies of top-down and bottom-up 
      search are ill-suited to some of these logics, and lack flexibility. 
      We therefore introduce a dichotomic search strategy, that is 
      analogous to a dichotomic search in an ordered array. We prove this 
      provides more flexibility in the search, while retaining completeness 
      and non-redundancy. We present a novel algorithm for learning using 
      domain specific logics and dichotomic search, and analyse its 
      complexity. We also describe two applications which illustrates the 
      search for motifs in sequences; where these motifs have arbitrary 
      length and length-constrained gaps. In the first application 
      sequences represent the trains of the East-West challenge; in the 
      second application they represent the secondary structure of Yeast 
      proteins for the discrimination of their biological functions.}

   ABSTRACT     = {A logical view of formal concept analysis considers 
      attributes of a formal context as unary predicates. In a first part, 
      we propose an augmented definition that handles {\em binary 
      relations} between objects. A Galois connection is defined on 
      augmented contexts. It represents concept inheritance as usual, but 
      also relations between concepts. As usual, labeling operators are 
      also defined. In particular, concepts and relations are visible and 
      labeled in a single structure. In a second part, we show how 
      relations can be used for navigating in an augmented concept lattice. 
      This part augments the theory of Logical Information Systems. An 
      implementation is sketched, and first experimental results are 
      presented.}

   ABSTRACT     = {We present Logical Information Systems (LIS). A LIS can 
      be viewed as a schema-less database whose objects are described by 
      logical formulas. Objects are automatically organized according to 
      their logical description, and logical formulas can be used for 
      representing both queries and navigation links. The key feature of a 
      LIS is that it answers a query with a set of navigation links 
      expressed in the same logic as the query. As navigation links are 
      dynamically computed from any query, and can be used as query 
      increments, it follows that querying and navigation steps can be 
      combined in any order. We then present LISFS, a file-system 
      implementation of a LIS, where objects are files or parts of files. 
      This has the benefit to make LIS features available right now to 
      existing applications. This implementation can easily be extended and 
      specialized through a plug-in mechanism. Finally, we present some 
      applications in the field of personal databases (e.g., music, images, 
      emails), and demonstrate that building specialized interfaces for 
      visualizing databases can be done easily through LISFS navigation. }

   ABSTRACT     = {BLID (Bio-Logical Intelligent Database) is a 
      bioinformatic system designed to help biologists extract new 
      knowledge from raw genome data by providing high-level facilities for 
      both data browsing and analysis. We describe BLIDrsquos novel data 
      browsing system which is based on the idea of Logical Information 
      Systems. This enables combined querying and navigation of data in 
      BLID (extracted from public bioinformatic repositories). The browsing 
      language is a logic especially designed for bioinformatics. It 
      currently includes sequence motifs, taxonomies, and macromolecule 
      structures, and it is designed to be easily extensible, as it is 
      composed of reusable components. Navigation is tightly combined with 
      this logic, and assists users in browsing a genome through a form of 
      human-computer dialog.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Les deux principaux paradigmes de recherche 
      d'information, la navigation et l'interrogation, sont souvent 
      dissociés. Les syst~mes hiérarchiques offrent une structure de 
      navigation figée qui ne convient pas ~ toutes les utilisations ; ce 
      qu'ils compensent par des outils de recherche. Ceux-ci, fondés sur 
      l'interrogation, sont plus souples mais sont plus difficiles ~ 
      utiliser pour les non-initiés et rendent délicat le contr~le du 
      volume des réponses. Il appara~t donc comme nécessaire de combiner 
      étroitement navigation et interrogation. Pour réaliser cette 
      combinaison, nous nous fondons sur l'Analyse de concepts (AC) qui 
      permet de construire automatiquement, ~ partir d'une description des 
      objets, une structure de navigation appelée ~treillis de concepts~, 
      o~ les concepts jouent ~ la fois le r~le de répertoire et de requ~te. 
      Comme dans l'AC les descriptions se limitent ~ des ensembles 
      d'attributs, nous avons généralisé l'AC pour les remplacer par des 
      formules d'une logique arbitraire. Ceci nous semble important pour 
      traiter des applications diverses. Les Syst~mes d'information 
      logiques (SIL) se définissent donc par la combinaison 
      navigation/interrogation, l'emploi de la logique (descriptions, 
      requ~tes et liens de navigation) et la généricité. Sur cette base, 
      nous avons développé plusieurs mécanismes pour faciliter l'expression 
      et la découverte de connaissances. Les connaissances d'un domaine 
      peut ~tre exprimées par une terminologie. Un dialogue homme-machine, 
      fondé sur le treillis de concepts, permet de retrouver des objets 
      (navigation) et de découvrir des régularités entre les objets 
      (extraction de connaissances). Un mécanisme d'apprentissage offre une 
      assistance ~ la classification des objets. Enfin, un prototype a été 
      développé pour d'expérimenter ces mécanismes. Il est générique dans 
      le sens o~ il ne dépend pas de la logique employée. Ces logiques 
      peuvent ~tre assemblés ~ l'aide d'un jeu de composants logique, que 
      nous avons constitué.}

   ABSTRACT     = {A formal context associates to objects a description 
      that combines automatically extracted properties (intrinsic) and 
      manually assigned ones (extrinsic). The extrinsic properties are 
      expressed by users according to intentions that are often subjective 
      and changing, and determine the classification and retrieval of 
      objects. So, we find it important to assist users in this task 
      through the automatic suggestion of extrinsic properties to be 
      assigned and even the discovery of rules to automate these 
      assignements. The principle is to learn from the description of 
      existing objects the extrinsic description of a new object. Because 
      of the changing nature of users' intentions, the assistance given in 
      the incremental building of a logical context must be interactive. We 
      present formal principles, and an application to the classification 
      of email messages. }

   ABSTRACT     = {Logical Concept Analysis is Formal Concept Analysis 
      where logical formulas replace sets of attributes. We define a 
      Logical Information System that combines navigation and querying for 
      searching for objects. Places and queries are unified as formal 
      concepts represented by logical formulas. Answers can be both 
      extensional (objects belonging to a concept) and intensional 
      (formulas refining a concept). Thus, all facets of navigation are 
      formalized in terms of Logical Concept Analysis. We show that the 
      definition of being a refinement of some concept is a specific case 
      of Knowledge Discovery in a formal context. It can be generalized to 
      recover more classical KD~operations like machine-learning through 
      the computation of necessary or sufficient properties (modulo some 
      confidence), or data-mining through association rules.}

   ABSTRACT     = {We present the design of a file system whose 
      organization is based on Concept Analysis \u201c~ la 
      Wille-Ganter\u201d. The aim is to combine querying and navigation 
      facilities in one formalism. The file system is supposed to offer a 
      standard interface but the interpretation of common notions like 
      directories is new. The contents of a file system is interpreted as a 
      Formal Context, directories as Formal Concepts, and the sub-directory 
      relation as Formal Concepts inclusion. We present an organization 
      that allows for an efficient implementation of such a Conceptual File 
      System.}

   ABSTRACT     = {We propose a generalization of Formal Concept Analysis 
      (FCA) in which sets of attributes are replaced by expressions of an 
      almost arbitrary logic. We prove that all FCA can be reconstructed on 
      this basis. We show that from any logic that is used in place of sets 
      of attributes can be derived a contextualized logic that takes into 
      account the formal context and that is isomorphic to the concept 
      lattice. We then justify the generalization of FCA compared with 
      existing extensions and in the perspective of its application to 
      information systems.}

   ABSTRACT     = {Nous proposons une généralisation de l'analyse de 
      concepts formels (ACF) dans laquelle les ensembles d'attributs sont 
      remplacés par des expressions d'une logique presque arbitraire. Nous 
      prouvons que toute l'ACF peut ~tre reconstruite sur cette base. Nous 
      montrons qu'~ partir de toute logique utilisée ~ la place des 
      ensembles d'attributs, on peut dériver une logique contextualisée qui 
      prend en compte le contexte formel et qui est isomorphe au treillis 
      de concepts. Nous comparons ensuite la généralisation de l'ACF aux 
      extensions qui y ont déj~ été apportées. Enfin, nous présentons nos 
      perspectives d'application aux syst~mes d'information.}
