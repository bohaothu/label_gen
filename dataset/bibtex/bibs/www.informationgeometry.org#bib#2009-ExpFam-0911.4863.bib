  This document describes concisely the ubiquitous class of exponential family distributions
 met in statistics. The first part recalls definitions and summarizes main properties
 and duality with Bregman divergences (all proofs are skipped). The second part lists
 decompositions and related formula of common exponential family distributions. We
 recall the Fisher-Rao-Riemannian geometries and the dual affine connection information
 geometries of statistical manifolds. It is intended to maintain and update this
 document and catalog by adding new distribution items.
