  abstract = {{Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes (BDMP) are a powerful modeling
	tool used in the reliability and safety domains. We propose to take
	advantage of their capabilities to go beyond the traditional techniques
	used to model attack scenarios. In particular we show how this new
	approach can be seen as preferable to attack trees and Petri net-based
	methods. Attack trees are inherently static and limited to independent
	events, whereas BDMP are dynamic and can take into account simple
	dependences. This allows the modeling of attack sequences, but also
	of defensive aspects such as detections. Petri net-based approaches
	are highly flexible but often lack readability and scalability; BDMP
	representations are close to attack trees, inheriting their readability
	and easy appropriation. Moreover, BDMP have mathematical properties
	leading to drastic reductions of combinatorial problems, allowing
	efficient scenarios processing and time dependent quantifications.
	Finally, limits and improvement perspectives are discussed.}}
