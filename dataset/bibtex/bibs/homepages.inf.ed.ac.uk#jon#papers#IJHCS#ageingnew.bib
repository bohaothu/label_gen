In general, the adolescent recall and summary responses were reproductive and text based, whereas the adult responses were more reconstructive and interpretive. Age-group differences were especially apparent in the story condition: The adolescents recalled and summarized the story's propositional content, whereas many of the adults recalled and summarized the story's psychological and metaphoric meanings as well. Individual difference variables accounted for much of the age-related variability in the essay but not in the story responses},

The system is scalable and allows multi-vendor appliances to be added with no major changes to its core. Password protection is used to block unauthorized users from accessing the appliances at home. If the Internet connection is down or the server is not up, the embedded system board still can control and operate the appliances locally},

Semantic priming for young and older adults was indexed by determining if semantic congruence between words in the orienting task and words in the pronunciation task improved performance on the pronunciation task relative to pronounced words from semantic categories not primed in the orienting task. The present data, from two different experiments, revealed that subjects pronounced high-dominance exemplars of the "living" words primed in the orienting task faster than words not primed in the orienting task. These data indicated that semantic priming for relatively long prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies can occur, and that such priming is at least as robust for older adults as for young adults. The results are discussed in terms of four current models of semantic priming},

This pilot study aimed to investigate the nature of behavioral dysexecutive problems in a sample of normal elderly adults as measured by the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. Factor analysis showed that five interpretable factors could be derived from the DEX: intentionality (factor 1), interference management (factor 2), inhibition (factor 3), planning (factor 4), and social regulation (factor 5), suggesting that different components may underlie the behavioral dysexecutive symptoms of normal aging. The relationship between these factors and neuropsychological measures of Executive Functions were also briefly explored},

   abstract = {Functional imaging and clinical studies in children and adults have provided evidence of developmental changes in the hemispheric specialization for language. Whereas cytoarchitectonic asymmetry has been demonstrated in Broca's region of adults, the anatomical correlates of developmental changes in language dominance are largely unknown. In the present postmortem study of 34 human brains (ages ranging from 3.5 months to 85 years), the cytoarchitecture of areas 44 and 45 as the putative anatomical correlates of Broca's region, their developmental changes, and interhemispheric asymmetry were analyzed. Asymmetry as estimated by Euclidean distances between feature vectors of cytoarchitectonic profiles of left and right areas 44 and 45 was already found in 1-year-old infants. Asymmetry tended to increase with age, which was significant in area 45, but not in area 44. An adult-like, left-larger-than-right asymmetry in the volume fraction of cell bodies [gray level index (GLI)] was reached at approximately 5 years in area 45 and 11 years in area 44. These time points indicate a delayed development of the cytoarchitectonic asymmetry in Broca's region in comparison with that of the primary motor cortex. It may be hypothesized that the delayed maturation is the microstructural basis of the development of language abilities and the influence of language practice on cytoarchitecture during childhood. Interhemispheric asymmetry in the cytoarchitecture of areas 44 and 45 continues to change throughout life. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic asymmetry of areas 44 and 45 is a result of microstructural plasticity that endures throughout almost the whole lifespan},

The number of primary basilar dendritic branches, the total number of basilar dendritic endings, the total basilar dendritic length, the total number of visible basilar dendritic spines and the cell soma sizes were all positively inter-correlated and all features were correlated to age (r = -0.77, -0.88, -0.82, -0.72, -0.86, respectively; all P < 0.05). These neuronal measures all correlated with brain weight (r = 0.79*, 0.65*, 0.51, 0.45, 0.55, respectively; *denotes P < 0.05). A first principle component derived from the inter-correlations of the neuronal features plus brain weight correlated almost perfectly with age (r = -0.93). The neuronal features differed between the right and left hemispheres (Wilks' Lambda = 0.91, P < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that the dendritic trees of the right hemisphere were longer (P = 0.002), more branched (P = 0.008) and possessed more dendritic spines (P = 0.0009; Sheffe's tests). In conclusion, there are hemispheric differences in the dendritic structure of the small pyramidal neurons of presumptive human speech cortex and its right hemisphere analogue. Generalized neuronal atrophy is highly correlated with both brain weight and age, and is a candidate process to explain the decline in cognition with age},

The effects of regional accents were also exaimined, briefly, and it was shown that mis-matches in regional training and test data resulted in degradations in performance of 3-5\%. Also the difference in read and spontaneous speech was briefly addressed and it was found that mis-matches in speaking style of training and test data negatively effected recognition. It was concluded that training models on elderly speech improved recognition for elderly test data, however male elderly speech performed worse than female elderly speech and this did not improve when using gender dependent models.},

However, research to date has been unable to indicate that short-term memory declines with age. These findings have led some rehabilitation professionals to mistakenly conclude that short-term memory is not affected by the aging process. This article reviews both the traditional concept of short-term memory, as outlined by Atkinson and Shiffrin, and the more recent conceptualization of short-term memory in terms of Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) model of working memory. The implications of the concept of working memory has implications for occupational therapy interventions for older adults. For example, clients with dementia may experience difficulties in performing tasks that require drawing inferences. Similarly, language that contains vague references may present problems for these clients. In addition, changes in working memory in older adults suggest that they may experience difficulties with medication management and what Rule, Milke, and Dobbs (1992) called wayfinding. Therefore, evaluations of working memory would provide a better indication of older adults' memory performance than the modal model},

It is argued that sensory function has an advantage over processing speed, working memory and executive function as a mediational construct because it is non-cognitive.

Results showed that performance on four tasks that measured the ability to suppress or remove irrelevant information stored in working memory accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in verbosity, whereas performance on other cognitive measures was unrelated to it. Shared effects between the measures of the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information and age suggested that age declines in this particular ability may underlie previously observed age-related increases in verbosity. In contrast, the contribution of psychosocial factors to explained variance in verbosity scores was relatively independent of that of inhibition-related measures and age.

OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The hypothesis that a high level of OTV is associated with declining competence in other aspects of everyday life was examined in 142 older adults, previously screened for the level of OTV. Competence was assessed based on self-reported changes since age 50 years in quality and quantity of engagement in eleven domains of instrumental and voluntary activities of everyday life. RESULTS: Path models indicated that a high level of OTV was associated with a decreased competence in everyday activities and was indirectly linked, through competence, with lower well-being and greater loneliness. With competence level controlled, a high level of OTV directly predicted less loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that a high level of OTV is symptomatic of a more general decline in competence and of less successful aging. However, a high level of OTV also entails a strong motivation for talking to others and thus may offer protection against loneliness},

Number of nouns, verbs, adjectives and grammatical connectors were scored for each subject's picture description. It was concluded that: (1) the ratio among different phrase elements was very uniform across age, educational level and sex groups; (2) the total number of words used to describe the "The Cookie Theft" picture significantly increased with the subject's educational level; (3) the amount of spontaneous language in general decreased with age; however, a significant interaction-effect between age and sex was observed. A steady and pronounced spontaneous language decrease across age-groups was observed in males. However, only mild differences across age-groups were observed in female subjects. It was hypothetized that language changes during aging are strongly sex-dependent: while in men spontaneous language rapidly decreases with aging, in women spontaneous language production remains quite well-preserved},

There is much less and more recent literature concerned with intergenerational communication involving older people and older people in institutional care. This has not yet impacted on speech and language therapy practice, especially in the area of training others. The aims of this paper are (1) to describe some of the main theoretical concepts associated with intergenerational communication, (2) to present the results from a study of the opinions about and experiences of intergenerational communication in which children, community- based older women and professional carers of older people were included and (3) to discuss the implications for speech and language therapy practice. A hypothesis for the study was that views on and attitudes towards communication and ageing would vary among the age groups. Some of the main concepts and models associated with intergenerational communication with older people are reviewed, including the communication predicament and enhancement models and the concept of patronizing communication. A qualitative study of three different age groups of (mainly) women was undertaken using a variety of methods of data elicitation (including written questionnaire and focus group discussion). Themes arising from the data were illuminated using content analysis. Participants' responses demonstrate some current generally positive views across the life-span on what it means to be old and the value of communication with older people. The implications for speech and language therapy practice are outlined, with the main emphasis on the potential use of intergenerational communication theory in developing a new focus for training other staff groups who care for older people and for measures of effectiveness of such in-service training},

   abstract = {In a speech recognition system used for the elderly, word recognition rate is improved by 3 - 5 \% when using an acoustic model based on an older person's voice instead of a conventional adult voice. Even after speaker adaptation, an acoustic model based on the older person's voice was confirmed to be more suitable as a source acoustic model. One of the negative factors affecting the performance of a speech recognition system is a mismatch between the characteristics of the user's voice and the acoustic model employed by the system. This paper describes the learning process of an acoustic model using a large-scale elderly voice database (200 sentences uttered by 301 persons). This 'elderly acoustic model' was evaluated using an elderly-adapted large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system (LVCSR). In addition, the two techniques, MLLR (maximum likelihood linear regression) and the speaker adaptation technique using a statistical approach, were compared. The results indicate that the speaker adaptation technique using a statistical approach was easier to use by the elderly and showed better adaptation. In this case, further adaptation of the acoustic model learned from an elderly person's voice was confirmed experimentally to yield a high recognition rate},

One of the factors that adversely affect the performance of speech recognition systems is a mismatch between the acoustic properties of the speech of the system user and the acoustic model. The speech of young or middle-aged adults is generally used in constructing the acoustic model. Thus, a mismatch occurs between the model and the acoustic properties of the speech of the elderly, which may degrade the recognition rate. In this study, a large-scale elderly speech database (200 sentences * 301 subjects) is used to train the acoustic model, and the resulting elderly acoustic model is evaluated by using a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system. In the experiments, the word recognition rate was improved by 3 to 5\% compared to the recognition results of an acoustic model trained by young or middle-aged adult speech, namely, by the JNAS speech database (150 sentences * 260 subjects, average 28.6 years). It is also verified experimentally that the recognition rate is further improved in speaker adaptation to elderly speech by making use of an acoustic model trained by elderly speech},

There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory},

A fourth subsystem, the episodic buffer, has recently been proposed. These are described in turn, with particular reference to implications for both the normal processing of language, and its potential disorders.The reader will be introduced to the concept of a multi-component working memory. Particular emphasis will be placed on the phonological loop component, and (a) its fractionation into a storage and processing component, (b) the neuropsychological evidence for this distinction, and (c) its implication for both native and second language learning. This will be followed by (d) a brief overview of the visuospatial sketchpad and its possible role in language, culminating in (e) discussion of the higher-level control functions of working memory which include (f) the central executive and its multi-dimensional storage system, the episodic buffer.

   abstract = {This article is a transcription of an electronic symposium in which some active researchers were invited by the Brazilian Society for Neuroscience and Behavior (SBNeC) to discuss the last decade's advances in neurobiology of learning and memory. The way different parts of the brain are recruited during the storage of different kinds of memory (e.g., short-term vs long-term memory, declarative vs procedural memory) and even the property of these divisions were discussed. It was pointed out that the brain does not really store memories, but stores traces of information that are later used to create memories, not always expressing a completely veridical picture of the past experienced reality. To perform this process different parts of the brain act as important nodes of the neural network that encode, store and retrieve the information that will be used to create memories. Some of the brain regions are recognizably active during the activation of short-term working memory (e.g., prefrontal cortex), or the storage of information retrieved as long-term explicit memories (e.g., hippocampus and related cortical areas) or the modulation of the storage of memories related to emotional events (e.g., amygdala). This does not mean that there is a separate neural structure completely supporting the storage of each kind of memory but means that these memories critically depend on the functioning of these neural structures. The current view is that there is no sense in talking about hippocampus-based or amygdala-based memory since this implies that there is a one-to-one correspondence. The present question to be solved is how systems interact in memory. The pertinence of attributing a critical role to cellular processes like synaptic tagging and protein kinase A activation to explain the memory storage processes at the cellular level was also discussed},

Word sequences were repeated exactly, or with one pair of words reversed. Two experiments using auditory presentation showed clear word length effects for both recall and serial recognition, although the magnitude of the effect tended to be less for recognition. A third experiment using visual presentation studied the effect of articulatory suppression during the recognition test; again we found a clear word length effect. It is concluded that the word length effect can influence retention through both rehearsal and output factors, as proposed by the phonological loop hypothesis},

Vigilance performance was therefore studied in a sample of elderly subjects who were tested over a 40-min period involving perceptual or memory-based tasks which were matched for initial level of performance. There was a significant interaction between task and delay, with only the memory-based task showing decrement. A second study used the same two tasks to investigate vigilance performance in patients suffering from probable Alzheimer's Disease. Over a 15-min delay period, an equivalent interaction effect occurred, again indicating substantially greater decrement for the memory-based task. The results are interpreted as consistent with a role for the executive processes of working memory in both visual rehearsal and vigilance performance, (C) 1999 Academic Press},

Finally, a study is described in which the dual task performance of patients with known frontal lesions is shown to be associated with observed behavioural problems.

We succeed in identifying one case each of relatively pure amnesia and relatively pure dysexecutive syndrome. We also, however, find cases of predominant STM deficit, as well as cases with defective visual but not verbal memory, and cases of the converse pattern. These cases do not seem to reflect simple random variation in the data, since less theoretically coherent patterns of symptoms are not found in this pure form.

Analysis of the controlling central executive has proved more challenging, leading to a proposed clarification in which the executive is assumed to be a limited capacity attentional system, aided by a newly postulated fourth system, the episodic buffer. Current interest focuses most strongly on the link between working memory and long-term memory and on the processes allowing the integration of information from the component subsystems.

It showed that, when patients are required to perform 2 concurrent tasks simultaneously, the AD patients are particularly impaired, even when level of performance on the individual tasks is equated with that of age-matched controls. Although the results were clear, interpretation was still complicated by 2 issues: first, the question of comparability of performance on the separate tests between AD and control patients; secondly, the question of whether our results could be interpreted simply in terms of a limited general processing capacity being more taxed by more difficult dual tasks than by the individual tasks performed alone. The present study followed up the AD and control patients after 6 and 12 mths. We were able to allow for the problem of comparability of performance by using patients as their own control. Under these conditions, there is a very clear tendency for dual task performance to deteriorate while single task performance is maintained. A second experiment varied difficulty within a single task in which patients and controls were required to categorize words as belonging to 1, 2 or 4 semantic categories. There was a clear effect of number of categories on performance and a systematic decline in performance over time. There was, however, no interaction between task difficulty as measured by number of alternatives and rate of deterioration, suggesting that the progressive deterioration in performance shown by AD patients is a function of whether single or dual task performance is required, and is not dependent on simple level of task difficulty. Implications for the analysis of the central executive component of working memory are discussed},

BACKGROUND: Voice disorders frequently accompany aging and IPD, but it is unclear how laryngeal muscle physiology is affected by these processes and how changes in laryngeal muscle activity result in characteristic changes of the voice. METHODS: Absolute and relative (to maximum) EMG amplitudes of the TA muscle were compared during speech and nonspeech tasks. Corresponding sound pressure level (SPL) measures were obtained for the speech tasks. RESULTS: Absolute TA amplitudes were consistently the highest in the young individuals, lowest in the individuals with IPD, and intermediate in the older individuals. Relative TA amplitudes were generally the highest for the young individuals, lowest for the older individuals, and intermediate for the individuals with IPD. SPL findings showed the older individuals and individuals with IPD produced most of the speech tasks with comparable SPLs, and these levels were consistently lower than those of the young individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced levels of TA muscle activity may contribute to the characteristic hypophonic voice disorders that frequently accompany IPD and aging},

Simultaneous measures of subglottal pressure and electromyographic (EMG) activity from the thyroarytenoid (TA), lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA), and cricothyroid (CT) muscles were investigated in young and old individuals while they attempted to phonate at three loudness levels, "soft," "comfortable," and "loud." Voice sound pressure level (SPL) and fundamental frequency (F ) measures were also obtained. Across loudness conditions, subglottal pressure levels were similar for both age groups. Laryngeal EMG measures tended to be lower and more variable for old compared with young individuals. These differences were most apparent for the TA muscle. Finally, across the three loudness conditions, the old individuals generated SPLs that were lower overall than those produced by the young individuals but modulated loudness levels in a manner similar to that of the young subjects. These findings suggest that the laryngeal mechanism may be more affected than the respiratory system in these old individuals and that these changes may affect vocal loudness levels},

Control of the lower lip, jaw, and larynx (i.e., fundamental frequency) was examined using a nonspeech visuomotor tracking (VMT) task, where subjects move the articulator of interest to track a moving target on an oscilloscope screen. This task examines articulator motor control during movements that are similar to speech but that do not impose linguistic units or the demands of coordinating multiple structures. Accuracy and within- and between-subject variability in tracking performance were measured by cross correlation, gain ratio, phase shift, and target-tracker amplitude difference. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that performance of children (aged 8;2 to 17;0 [years;months]) and older adults (aged 45;1 to 84;3) is poorer than that of younger adults (aged 17;1 to 45;0). Accuracy of movement amplitude tended to increase during development and decline with aging, whereas age did not appear to influence accuracy of temporal parameters in lip and jaw tracking. In contrast, age tended to influence individual variability in temporal but not amplitude parameters. Differences were noted between articulators. The data complement previous studies that considered accuracy and variability of articulator movement during speech. The VMT method and the data provided may be applied to assessment of impairments in the motor speech system and to differential diagnosis of motor speech versus linguistically based disorders},

The social world of older people can be characterized as one in which their dependent behaviors are immediately attended to, while independent behaviors are widely ignored. This is particularly so in personal maintenance situations, although it is also present in prosocial engagement situations. The scripts are highly robust across settings (institutional and private dwellings), social partners of older people (staff, family members), sex, length of institutionalization, and health status, but are age specific. Attempts to change the scripts proved successful and led to a significant increase in autonomous functioning on the part of older participants. Implications of these findings for communication research with older people in general are discussed},

The present study is designed to examine the postulated effect of estrogen on memory by studying the effect of gender on the age-related decline in cognitive function. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 800 women and 551 men aged 65 to 95 years, members of the community-based Rancho Bernardo Study (begun in 1972 and 1974) who completed the Beck Depression Inventory in 1984-1987 and 12 standardized tests of cognitive function in 1988-1991. All participants were white, middle to upper-middle class, relatively well educated, and ambulatory. At all visits, use of estrogen therapy was ascertained and validated. RESULTS: Test performance worsened with age in both sexes, with similar patterns in men compared with women who were current, past, or never users of estrogen. Between-gender comparisons of the slope for age on each cognitive function test after adjustment for education, depressed mood, and estrogen use (in women) indicated that men had a significantly steeper decrement with age than women on the Buschke total recall and long-term memory tests (P <.001), on the immediate and delayed recall tasks of the visual reproduction tests (P <.01 and .05, respectively), and on category fluency (P <.05). Similar results were obtained when gender comparisons included only women who had never used estrogen. CONCLUSION: These weak or absent gender differences in decline in cognitive function with age do not support the thesis that estrogen deficiency is associated with a decline in cognitive function in postmenopausal women},

The authors compared the performance of young and older adults on tasks involving spontaneous motor tempo, processing speed, and working memory.

Finally, with nonsense word counterparts to word stress pairs (botgog vs. bot gog) preserving phonetic information but lacking semantic content, no ear asymmetry was found. These results suggest that as the linguistic significance of the stimuli is reduced, thereby lessening the linguistic function of stress, there is a less dominant involvement of the left hemisphere in stress processing. Results are discussed in relation to a theory of a functional integration of prosodic and segmental speech components that is paralleled by a working partnership of left and right hemisphere},

   year = {2001},
   abstract = {The ability of the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with one another via the corpus callosum is important for a wide variety of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, many of them communication related. Anatomical evidence suggests that aging results in structural changes in the corpus callosum and that the course over time of age-related changes in corpus callosum structure may depend on the gender of the individual. Further, it has been hypothesized that age- and gender-related changes in corpus callosum structure may result in concomitant decreased performance on tasks that are reliant on interhemispheric integrity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age and gender on auditory behavioral and visuomotor temporal indices of interhemispheric function across the life span of the normal adult. Results from 120 consistently right-handed adults from age 20 to 75 years revealed that interhemispheric integrity, as measured by dichotic listening, auditory temporal patterning, and visuomotor interhemispheric transfer time tasks, decreases relatively early in the adult life span (i.e., between the ages of 40 and 55 years) and shows no further decrease thereafter. In addition, the course over time of interhemispheric decline is different for men compared to women for some tasks. These findings suggest that decreased interhemispheric function may be a possible factor contributing to auditory and communication difficulties experienced by aging adults. In addition, results of this study hold implications for the clinical assessment of interhemispheric function in aging adults and for future research into the functional ramifications of decreased multimodality interhemispheric transfer},

The main point of our second experiment is to prove the influence of aging on the process of knowledge integration mentioned above. We compared the results of a subject group of young (25 years) with old adults (75 years) in a recognition task. The experimental data support a slowdown for primarily sensorical and motorical and nonlexical components for the higher age group but they do not confirm a deficit in the critical process of knowledge integration.

Methods: We searched for trials in MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, review articles and textbooks. We excluded non-English articles and those pertaining to psychology, addiction, psychiatry, research and education. Results: In health care delivery, 3 of 4 trials of CTS-based interventions improved clinic show rates. In preventive health care, 4 of 5 showed higher childhood immunization rates. For nutrition, 2 small trials showed no clear benefit in cholesterol lowering or in weight reduction, but 1 trial showed a benefit in fibre intake. For increasing physical activity, 1 smaller trial showed no benefit but a larger one did. For medical management of chronic conditions, 1 trial showed improved hemoglobin A(1c) levels and 1 trial showed better processes of care in diabetes. In hypertension management, 1 trial found better adherence to medication regimens and control of blood pressure. In outpatient oncology care, 1 trial showed better supportive care. For support of caregivers for dementia patients, 1 trial showed no benefit. One small trial showed better adherence to medication in seniors. Conclusions: The CTS has diverse applications in medical care; however, the evidence for these is limited. Despite being impersonal, the reliability and availability of the CTS make it attractive for reminders and follow-up. More research is needed to deter-mine the role of the CTS in medical care.

More detailed analyses showed that in response to an error situation, older workers compared to younger ones stated they were significantly less likely to try and solve the problem entirely on their own; this was also partly supported by the observational data. In terms of the available options for helping rectify errors, older workers reported that they were more often likely to use written documentation and rely less on asking other workers.

Relations between stroke risk and decline in verbal fluency, memory, and visuospatial performance were analyzed through regression, controlling for age and education. Age was associated with decline in all cognitive functions; stroke risk was associated with decline only on verbal fluency. The relation between stroke risk and fluency decline was 80\% as large as that between age and fluency decline.

The experimental procedure involved the detection of incongruous sentences, either with or without a mnemonic preload. Instructions emphasized alternatively speed or accuracy. Results showed that whatever the instructions, older adults remained consistently much slower than young adults, and a little more accurate. When instructed to emphasize speed, they never managed to reduce the response time difference relative to young adults. It is concluded that the more cautious approach in older adults is required to attenuate the adverse effects of a slower processing system},

Experiment 2 revealed a specific processing impairment in older subjects, and showed that older subjects tended to sacrifice the maintenance of the concurrent mnemonic load to devote more resources to ongoing processing. In Experiment 3, the age-related differences in the processing/ storage trade-off were again observed. Furthermore, differences in the speed/accuracy trade-off were revealed. Experiment 4 showed that whatever the instructions regarding the speed/accuracy trade-off, the older subjects remained slower and slightly more accurate than the young subjects.

Young and older subjects were asked to simultaneously detect incongruities in sentences and keep increasing longer series of words (3, 4, or 5) in memory. The difficulty of incongruity detection was manipulated by variation of the number of intervening words (0, 6, or 12) between two critical words. Incongruity detection was assumed to be linked to the processing of information function of working memory. The concurrent mnemonic load consisted of material previously processed, and was assumed to be linked to the storage function of WM. Results showed that an increment in incongruity-detection difficulty led to a greater decrement in accuracy in older than in young subjects, indicating an impairment in the information-processing function. On the other hand, an increment in concurrent mnemonic load led to a slightly smaller decrement in accuracy in older subjects. Furthermore, fewer words from this mnemonic load were recalled in older subjects. It is suggested that older subjects are impaired in coping with both requirements of the task, and tend to sacrifice the storage of information recently processed to devote their resources to the immediate processing component of the task. These results are discussed in relation to their implications for language comprehension},

With regard to attention, the ability to divide attention between tasks appears to pose specific problems. It seems obvious that this problem is highly relevant to the introduction of road traffic informatics (RTI). When it is not taken into account, RTI may create additional problems for older drivers. On the other hand, when developed properly, RTI might help in compensating for ageing related impairment. To study divided attention while driving, a task environment was created that simulated both fundamental driving tasks (lane-tracking and reacting to peripheral visual information) and RTI. Modalities of RTI that were varied were: low to high memory requirement; self-paced or machine-paced presentation; numerical or spatial presentation; and vocal or manual responding. The difficulty of lane-tracking and the RTI tasks is adapted to individual capacity in single task conditions. When the RTI tasks were combined with driving, performance of older drivers in both types of tasks dropped significantly more than performance of the young. From a safety point of view, the increased number of misses of peripheral stimuli and increased course deviation are particularly important. Older drivers find driving more problematic and tend to avoid difficult manoeuvres. Older drivers less often engage in additional activities while driving, which suggests that they need more attentional resources for driving},

The impetus for this paper was the publication of the National Service Framework for Older People, which draws attention to the prevalence of age discrimination and the need to provide individualized care. Approach. The literature between 1990 and 2001 was reviewed in a systematic way. Certain key, older texts were also identified. Twenty-four publications were found, which examine the ways in which nurses and other health workers modify their speech when conversing with older people, discuss what older people think about this practice, or otherwise contribute to this issue. Results. The paper uses speech accommodation theory to explain how the language addressed to older people is sometimes modified. The practice of over- accommodation is also described. This happens when older people are addressed in a simplified vocabulary with a high-pitched tone of voice and slow speech. The extent of over-accommodation is discussed, and its impact on older people is considered in terms of fostered dependence and lowered self-esteem. Conclusion. The findings of the review in the context of current policy related to older people and implications for nursing education are discussed},

The age difference was independent of explicit memory (cued recall and recognition), suggesting that memory for source and information are separable. Older adults were comparable to younger adults in responder identification but worse at inquirer identification. Responder identification was better than inquirer identification, with the latter dropping to chance at 1 week. Source identification was most accurate when participants were in the responder role; there was little difference between the inquirer and listener roles},

Popovich et al. (1987). The ATCUS was developed using college undergraduates and has an internal consistency estimate of 0.84. One hundred ninety-three individuals with an average age of 73.6 responded to the ATCUS scale. The scale was primarily administered in several group settings. Some individual sessions were permitted when individuals could not attend the group sessions or when time constraints on the group prohibited their completion. The findings lend some support to previous findings that older adults have a fear of computer-related devices. The results also show however, that the older adults believe computers are valuable to certain aspects of their lives. The finding that their overall anxiety level toward computers is low, would suggest that programs of education may be readily implemented to increase the level of usage of computers among this age group},

However, the evidence for the cost effectiveness and sustainability of telecare and telemedicine remains slight. Health care costs based on age indicate that older people are the main consumers, with spending on those 75 and over six times that of the average population. It is also estimated that around 40\% of total hospital and community health service expenditure is on people aged 65 and over. Where the greatest expenditure is observed, it is suggested that the greatest savings can be achieved. The paper therefore considers older people as the target user group and seeks to demonstrate a wish by this group for the development of telecare and telemedicine and to show that a suitable system can be delivered in a cost-effective manner},

   abstract = {The development of drugs for the treatment of disorders of cognition has benefited from a more precise knowledge of the loss of specific neural pathways associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in AD has engendered the development of new compounds that target various aspects of the cholinergic system. However, limitations in the effectiveness of the most common of these, the anticholinesterases, have fueled the race to provide more efficacious compounds. In an attempt to avoid side effects and improve efficacy, other neuronal targets have been considered, including receptors for norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, excitatory amino acids, neural peptides, and others. Our laboratory has had the opportunity to study the memory-enhancing potential of many of the compounds developed expressly for these neuronal targets in macaques. Upon reviewing 21 such studies it was evident that: 1) To varying degrees, pharmacological manipulation of each target yielded improved task performance. 2) Combining pharmacological targets could lead to additive or synergistic effects on task performance. 3) Mature adult and aged monkeys provided equivalent estimates of drug effectiveness. 4) There appeared to be no limiting level of task improvement for compounds tested in aged and younger monkeys. 5) Certain of these agents also exhibited potential disease-modifying actions. Thus, certain memory-enhancing agents may prove more useful when implemented early in the course of a disease such as AD, and they also may enjoy a wide application for the treatment of the memory decline associated with normal aging},

In the present study SRP results were analysed in 256 probands from the general elderly population. SRP scores were highly intercorrelated, and principal component analysis yielded only one single factor. The SRP scores were moderately and not differentially correlated with immediate and delayed free recall and recognition and with verbal fluency. All SRP scores discriminated nondemented probands with episodic long-term memory impairment from those without. The MMSE performed significantly better than any SRP score in detecting dementia. The theory-based assumption that the SRP allows assessment of different, independent aspects of memory could not be validated. It is suggested that the SRP is a mixed measure of semantic memory, episodic long-term and short-term memory, and working memory, and that the different SRP scores do not allow to assess different memory functions. Thus, the SRP may neither be recommended for assessment of different subfunctions of memory nor for dementia screening. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Considerable research, however, reports remarkable age constancy in many aspects of language performance, contrary to the predictions of Inhibitory Deficit theory. For conditions that do produce age differences in language comprehension and production, evidence for inhibitory deficits is controversial at best. In predicting new findings, Inhibitory Deficit theory is constrained by lack of a well specified model, producing confusion between inhibition that occurs ata behavioral level versus a theoretical level. Modification of the theory is required to bring it in line with empirical findings on language and aging, and greater specification of underlying processes is required to reduce contradictions in predictions},

   abstract = {Whereas some older adults show significant cognitive deficits, others perform as well as young adults. We investigated the neural basis of these different aging patterns using positron emission tomography (PET). In PET and functional MRI (fMRI) studies, prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity tends to be less asymmetric in older than in younger adults (Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Old Adults or HAROLD). This change may help counteract age-related neuro-cognitive decline (compensation hypothesis) or it may reflect an age-related difficulty in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms (dedifferentiation hypothesis). To compare these two hypotheses, we measured PFC activity in younger adults, low-performing older adults, and high-performing older adults during recall and source memory of recently studied words. Compared to recall, source memory was associated with right PFC activations in younger adults. Low-performing older adults recruited similar right PFC regions as young adults, but high-performing older adults engaged PFC regions bilaterally. Thus, consistent with the compensation hypothesis and inconsistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a hemispheric asymmetry reduction was found in high-performing but not in low-performing older adults. The results suggest that low-performing older adults recruited a similar network as young adults but used it inefficiently, whereas high-performing older adults counteracted age-related neural decline through a plastic reorganization of neurocognitive networks.(C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)},

To investigate this issue, we scanned younger and older adults with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing three different tasks: working memory, visual attention and episodic retrieval. There were three main results. First, in all three tasks, older adults showed weaker occipital activity and stronger prefrontal and parietal activity than younger adults. The occipital reduction is consistent with the view that sensory processing decline is a common cause in cognitive aging, and the prefrontal increase may reflect functional compensation. Secondly, older adults showed more bilateral patterns of prefrontal activity than younger adults during working memory and visual attention tasks. These findings are consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model. Finally, compared to younger adults, older adults showed weaker hippocampal formation activity in all three tasks but stronger parahippocampal activity in the episodic retrieval task. The former finding suggests that age-related hippocampal deficits may have a global effect in cognition, and the latter is consistent with an age-related increase in familiarity-based recognition. Taken together, the results indicate that both common and specific factors play an important role in cognitive aging},

It was specifically hypothesized that patients with greater right hemisphere dysfunction (low spatial AD patients) would be impaired on emotion processing tasks relative to those with predominantly left hemisphere dysfunction (low verbal AD patients). Both groups showed impairment on emotion processing tasks but for different reasons. The low verbal patients performed poorly on the affect processing measures because they had difficulty comprehending and/or remembering the task instructions. In contrast, low spatial AD patients have emotion processing deficits that are independent of language and/or memory and may be due to a more general visuoperceptual deficit that affects the perception of static but not dynamic affective stimuli},

The three experiments reported in this paper further investigate the articulatory determinants of word length effects on span tasks. Experiment 1 replicated Baddeley et al.'s finding of an effect of word length on auditory and visual span when the stimuli consist of words that differ in terms of the number of syllables. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effects of word length are eliminated when the words in the span task are matched for the number of syllables and phonemes but differ with respect to the duration and/or complexity of their articulatory gestures. These results indicate that it is the phonological structure of a word and not features of its actual articulation that determines the magnitude of the word length effect in span tasks},

Three groups of variables arise from the literature that seem to affect the quality or quantity of nurse-patient communication: variables related to nurses, to patients, and to the setting in which nursing care takes place. The study was conducted in two different care settings: a home for elderly people and a home care organization. In a sample of 181 video-taped nursing encounters, involving 47 nurses and 109 patients a study was made of nurse-patient communication. In addition, relevant data related to patients, nurses and situation were gathered by questionnaires and were combined with the results of observations of videotaped nurse-patient interactions. It was found that the educational level of nurses was related most strongly to the way nurses communicate with their elderly patients. Patient characteristics such as age, gender and subjective state of health appeared to play a minor role in the way nurses communicate},

In the first three experiments, younger subjects recalled more words than did older subjects, but an independent index of recall selectivity showed that older subjects were apparently more successful in selecting higher valued words. However, a fourth experiment showed that this superior selectivity on the part of older adults was attributable to their greater proportional reliance on primary memory recall. Overall, the data suggest that although older adults recall fewer words than do younger adults, they exert as much control over some aspects of encoding},

Empirical evidence of cognitive aging shows a deterioration in working memory ability but also suggests that elderly people maintain the ability to acquire new information and strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of two different mnemonic strategies (Loci mnemonic vs. Strategic training) in young and older adults and to evaluate the ability of the older groups to improve performance. Participants received extensive practice in the use of a specific strategy. Three groups of participants (20 adult, 20 younger elderly, and 20 older elderly) were tested in the laboratory, as well as in ecological conditions using a battery of cognitive tests. Questionnaires were also administrated to explore cognitive, metacognitive and emotive motivational aspects of working memory performance. The results show the efficacy of both trainings in improving performances in different tasks, particularly the ecological. The elderly benefit from strategies as much as younger people; nevertheless, the memory performances of the latter are higher. Differences between the two trainings are found only in the task evaluating ability to re-use learnt strategies in other unfamiliar situations. Improvement in performance was more pronounced for the strategic training. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved},

Alzheimer and multi-infarct patients (N = 30) and normal subjects over the age of 50 (N = 40) were submitted to a medical, neurological and cognitive investigation. The cognitive tests applied were Mini-Mental, word span, digit span, logical memory, spatial recognition span, Boston naming test, praxis, and calculation tests. The brain ratios calculated were the ventricle-brain, bifrontal, bicaudate, third ventricle, and suprasellar cistern measures. These data were obtained from a brain computer tomography scan, and the cutoff values from receiver operating characteristic curves. We analyzed the diagnostic parameters provided by these ratios and compared them to those obtained by cognitive evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of cognitive tests were higher than brain measures, although dementia patients presented higher ratios, showing poorer cognitive performances than normal individuals. Normal controls over the age of 70 presented higher measures than younger groups, but similar cognitive performance. We found diffuse losses of tissue from the central nervous system related to distribution of cerebrospinal fluid in dementia patients. The likelihood of case identification by functional impairment was higher than when changes of the structure of the central nervous system were used. Cognitive evaluation still seems to be the best method to screen individuals from the community, especially for developing countries, where the cost of brain imaging precludes its use for screening and initial assessment of dementia},

Experiment 1 revealed that only processing speed and monitoring explained age differences in SOPT performance. Participants in Experiment 2 were 53 older adults who returned 4 years after the initial testing and 53 young adults. A task that assessed the ability to generate and monitor an internal series of responses as compared to an externally imposed series of responses was also administered. Experiment 2 replicated the key findings from Experiment 1 and provided some further evidence for age-related internal monitoring difficulties. Furthermore, the exploratory longitudinal analysis revealed that older age and lower intellectual abilities tended to be associated with poorer performance on the SOPT at Time 2},

Statistically significant differences in mean temporal resolution thresholds derived from the four tests resulted from differences in stimulus and task variables. From a clinical perspective, however, all tests yielded comparable results, indicating normal temporal resolution for all 10 children. Differences among the four tests with regard to ease of use, time required for administration and scoring, and face validity are discussed. Additional research is needed to determine the relative sensitivity and specificity, and, therefore, the clinical utility of these four temporal resolution tests in both pediatric and adult populations.},

Two experiments are reported in which participants were required to perform pairwise combinations of (1) a verbal memory task, a visual memory task, and perceptuomotor tracking (Experiment 1), and (2) pairwise combinations of the two memory tasks and articulatory suppression (Experiment 2). Tracking resulted in no disruption of the verbal memory preload over and above the impact of a delay in recall and showed only minimal disruption of the retention of the visual memory load. Performing an ongoing verbal memory task had virtually no impact on retention of a visual memory preload or vice versa, indicating that performing two demanding memory tasks results in little mutual interference. Experiment 2 also showed minimal disruption when the two memory tasks were combined, although verbal memory (but not visual memory) was clearly disrupted by articulatory suppression interpolated between presentation and recall. These data suggest that a multiple-component working memory model provides a better account for performance in concurrent immediate memory tasks than do theories that assume a single processing and storage system or a limited-capacity attentional system coupled with activated memory traces},

This study aimed to develop and validate a neuropsychological tool to measure time perception and to study temporal perception with aging. Eighty-six healthy participants, aged 15-90 years old, were asked to verbally estimate and produce empty intervals signaled by auditory beeps, of 7-, 32-, and 58-s duration. Two tests were used as "gold-standards": estimation of the duration of time necessary to draw a clock ("clock time") and estimation of the duration of neuropsychological evaluation ("global time"). Results showed a correlation between estimation and production (p < .01) and a correlation between estimation or production and "global time" (p < .01). The correlation between either estimation or production and age (p < .01), suggested a faster "internal-clock" in the older participants. However, this finding lost significance when controlled for literacy. The results suggest that these tests are potentially a useful tool to measure subjective perception of time. They also corroborate the hypothesis of a change in subjective time perception with aging. It was not possible to conclude if this effect was a specific result of aging or biased by the interference of literacy},

In the second experiment 20 new subjects read the same passages but with varying punctuation (appropriate, no punctuation, or altered) and were also tested on text comprehension and word recognition. Subjects' reading time was also recorded. ANOVA results revealed that altered prosody and punctuation affect performance in a similar fashion and seriously impair text comprehension and word recognition.

In general, it is maintained that a decline in cognitive and physical function is an inevitable consequence of aging. However, many individuals demonstrate comparable physical and cognitive characteristics with individuals up to 40 years their junior. A suggested reason for this is their continued involvement in physical and mental activity. Further work has demonstrated that older individuals may even possess 'greater' ability to respond to physical stimulus than their younger counterparts. Several physiological variables are discussed and how they relate to and explain any changes in performance. In addition, several mechanisms are reviewed that have been suggested to explain any changes that occur following an intervention to improve physical and mental function. Particular attention is given to the feasibility of using computers as a means to provide an exercise mode for those elderly individuals who cannot participate in traditional modes of exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming or jogging. The overall theme is the belief that a decline in function, particularly cognitive function when stimulated by computer interaction, is not inevitable. The decline in cognitive function experienced by many elderly individuals appears to occur due to a lack of appropriate stimulus. The literature supports this view and further advocates the use of activity to stimulate and maintain physical and cognitive function},

In experiment 1, old and young adults were trained in both CM and variably mapped (VM) category search. The training results replicate previous findings by Fisk and Rogers (1991). Even though older adults are initially at a disadvantage relative to young adults, the comparison times of young and old adults are near zero after CM training. For VM, older adults remain at a disadvantage relative to younger adults, even after extensive training. A full reversal manipulation was implemented in experiment 2 to investigate the learning in memory search. Initially, the young subjects were less affected by the full reversal condition compared to the performance of the older adults. However, older subjects quickly recovered and both young and old were performing at trained CM levels within 60 trials of additional practice. These results suggest: (a) attention is not being trained in CM memory search; (b) automatic category activation does not contribute much, if at all, to the performance improvement in memory search; and (c) age-invariant learning mechanisms account for performance improvement in CM memory search},

A GEIS script specified the following: question texts, including variable texts; answer option texts; numeric codes for answers; range check information; logical question-branching information; interview status information; do-loop information; and IVR information, such as key codes and voice messages. GEIS thoroughly checked scripts for logical or syntactical errors. GEIS required SAS Version 8.0, and survey data were accumulated within SAS data sets. An application of GEIS to conduct a survey involving CATI, IVR, and a combined hybrid method is described. The CATI results deviated in the direction expected for sensitive questions, whereas IVR obtained a small sample size, rendering the results unreliable. However, the hybrid method was found to provide more accurate telephone survey data on alcohol consumption than did CATI alone.

The IVR system automatically made calls to households and explained the nature of the call; selected one eligible woman aged 18-69 years; determined her screening status; delivered a message appropriate to her screening status; offered additional messages to counter common barriers; offered additional information on cervical screening and cancer; offered additional contact numbers; and offered to arrange for someone to call back. Cervical screening rate data were obtained from the Australian Health Insurance Commission (HIC) for 6 months before and following the intervention. Results. The cervical screening rate was found to have increased by 0.43\% in intervention compared to the control postcodes, and the increase was greater for older women at 1.34\%. Conclusions. The overall conclusion was that IVR technology was a feasible means to contact women to deliver brief interventions aimed at increasing cervical screening rates and could economically target at-fisk groups. The potential for linking IVR to centralized Pap test Registers to issue Pap test reminders should be explored. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In September 2000, 5,000 households within Cessnock, New South Wales, were contacted by an IVR system. The system randomly selected eligible women aged 18-69, assessed their cervical screening status and provided a tailored message about cervical screening. A computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) evaluated intervention acceptability. Participation rates, participant demographics, IVR use by women, and IVR costs were also examined. Results: 549 (12\%) women listened to the IVR call and 587 (59\%) completed the CATI interview. IVR listeners under-represented younger and older women, and overrepresented women who were married, and of Aboriginal descent. The majority of women (98\%) found IVR easy to answer and 90\% agreed IVR reminders were a good idea. Unscreened and older women used the system more than screened or younger women. Conclusions: The IVR call was successfully used by a large number of women to obtain information on cervical cancer screening, with higher use by recognised risk groups. Implications: These results suggest that an IVR reminder might be useful to increase cervical screening rates since those most at risk also used IVR the most. The potential for linking IVR to a database to issue reminders in the same manner as Pap Test Register postal reminders needs to be explored.},

In a recent study in humans, conditioned preference learning deficits were observed in a group of patients with damage to the amygdala formation. In this study, patients with Parkinson's disease, which is known to involve pathology of the dorsal striatum, were tested on the same conditioned preference task, together with a group of patients with circumscribed lesions of the frontal lobe. Unlike patients with frontal lobe damage, patients with Parkinson's disease did not exhibit conditioned preferences. However, in this respect their behaviour was indistinguishable from that of age-matched (older) control subjects. In keeping with previous literature, working memory deficits were observed in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal-lobe lesions. Compared to young control subjects, a strong increase in preference for familiar, versus novel, items was observed in both patients with Parkinson's disease and in older control subjects. Such a familiarity effect appears to overshadow the conditioning manipulation employed in this task and, therefore, preclude the expression of conditioned preferences in older subjects. These results suggest that there is a developmental progression in the degree to which different mechanisms of 'learning to like' are important over the life span. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Cognitive abilities rise steeply from infancy to young adulthood and then are either maintained or decline to old age, depending on the specific ability. This pattern suggests corresponding continuities of mechanism and process, but it is striking that the fields of cognitive development and cognitive aging make little contact with each other's methods and theories. In this review we examine reasons for this cultural separation, and show how recent findings from both areas fit a framework couched in terms of cognitive representation and control. These two broad factors have very different lifespan trajectories; consideration of their relative growth and decline makes it clear that cognitive aging is not simply 'development in reverse'. This framework is offered in light of recent interest in finding greater continuity throughout the lifespan and creating a more comprehensive explanation of cognitive function and cognitive change.},

Analyses employed claims data to examine relationships between IVR reminders and preventive service use 5 to 9 months postintervention among members without prior utilization.

It consists of sixteen items, eight asking about prospective memory failures, and eight concerning retrospective failures. The PRMQ was administered to a sample of the general adult population (N = 551) ranging in age between 17 and 94. Ten competing models of the latent structure of the PRMQ were derived from theoretical and empirical sources and were tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The model with the best fit had a tripartite structure and consisted of a general memory factor (all items loaded on this factor) plus orthogonal specific factors of prospective and retrospective memory. The reliabilities (internal consistency) of the Total scale and the Prospective and Retrospective scales were acceptable: Cronbach's alpha was 0.89, 0.84, and 0.80, respectively. Age and gender did not influence PRMQ scores, thereby simplifying the presentation and interpretation of normative data. To ease interpretation of scores on the PRMQ, tables are presented for conversion of raw scores on the Total scale and Prospective and Retrospective scales to T scores (confidence limits on scores are also provided). In addition, tables are provided to allow users to assess the reliability and abnormality of differences between an individual's scores on the Prospective and Retrospective scales},

Studies of hand grip strength and aging demonstrate a decrease in strength with age; however, there are little data regarding tongue function. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of increased age to tongue strength and endurance. Methods. A pressure transducer, the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument, was used to measure maximal strength and endurance of both the hand and tongue. Ninety-nine healthy volunteers from the oral physiology component of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were divided into four age groups, ranging from 21 to 96 years of age. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine differences in strength and endurance between age groups and genders. Regression analysis was done to determine the relationship of strength and endurance with age. Results. Gender analysis indicated that both tongue and hand strength were greater in males; however, tongue and hand endurance demonstrated no gender differences. The strength in both the tongue and hand decreased with age. Individuals over the age of 79 years showed statistically decreased tongue strength, and individuals over the age of 59 years showed statistically decreased hand strength. There was no significant change in the tongue and hand endurance with age. Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that tongue function is gender- and age-dependent and follows the same trends as hand function. Tongue strength is decreased in older individuals and females, while tongue endurance is gender- and age-independent},

At the same time we are witnessing a technological explosion and computers are increasingly being used in most settings. This means that most older people will have to interact with some form of computer technology to perform routine tasks. This may be problematic for the current cohort of older adults as they are unlikely to have had exposure to technology and thus are required to learn a new set of skills. Further most systems are designed without considering older adults as active users of technology and thus current interfaces may prove difficult for older people. This paper examines issues relevant to aging and the design of computer technology. The intent is to synthesize existing knowledge regarding computers and older adults and to present some guidelines for interface design},

Results indicated that the participants liked using the system, were able to use it with minimal difficulty, and that it provided a valuable means for social interaction and mental stimulation.

Overall, the results indicted age differences in performance of both tasks. The younger participants had higher levels of performance. Further, the results indicated that age-related differences in component cognitive abilities were related to performance. These data were used to develop design interventions such as modifying the layout of screen information. This paper presents data from the intervention studies. Overall the findings indicate that the interventions improved performance for all participants. For example, there were fewer keystroke errors for the data entry task and problem solving time was reduced for the problem solving task.

The approach described in the paper is based on the analysis of humanoid and personal robots as an evolution from industrial to advanced and service robotics driven by the need for helpful machines, as well as a synthesis of the dream of replicating humans. The first part of the paper describes the development of anthropomorphic components for humanoid robots, with particular regard to anthropomorphic sensors for vision and touch, an eight-d.o.f. arm, a three-fingered hand with sensorized fingertips, and control schemes for grasping. Then, the authors propose a user-oriented design methodology for personal robots, and describe their experience in the design, development, and validation of a real personal robot composed of a mobile unit integrating some of the anthropomorphic components introduced previously and aimed at operating in a distributed working environment. Based on the analysis of experimental results, the authors conclude that humanoid robotics is a tremendous and attractive technical and scientific challenge for robotics research. The real utility of humanoids has still to be demonstrated, but personal assistance can be envisaged as a promising application domain. Personal robotics also poses difficult technical problems, especially related to the need for achieving adequate safety, proper human-robot interaction, useful performance, and affordable cost. When these problems are solved, personal robots will have an excellent chance for significant application opportunities, especially if integrated into future home automation systems, and if supported by the availability of humanoid robots.

One of the most intriguing issues in the design of such robot is the definition and implementation of adequate schemes for human-robot interaction. In fact, achieving this goal requires multidisciplinary efforts, and the integration of engineering analysis with psychological, anthropological, ethological and product design considerations. In this paper, the basic concepts to be followed in the design of human-robot interaction are discussed, with reference to a concrete example: the MOVAID personal robot for assistance to disabled and elderly people at home. The MOVAID system was designed taking into careful account as a primary design goal the need for interaction with the human user. A prototype of the MOVAID system has been developed and then successfully validated with disabled end-users. The results of these tests indicate that a personal robot is technically feasible, and is acceptable to users in terms of helpfulness, easiness of use and pleasure of interaction},

Methods: In Experiment 1, 250 participants read two passages, a narrative and an expository text, and answered a series of multiple-choice inferential questions. In Experiment 2, three groups: younger-old good and poor comprehenders and older-old poor comprehenders were compared for working memory and metacognitive tasks. Results: Although older-old adults had some difficulty compared with younger-old, a comparison with normative control scores (comprehension level achieved at the end of 8th grade compulsory education) showed that their reading comprehension of a narrative text was adequate, demonstrating basic comprehension skills for everyday life. Younger-old good comprehenders had higher working memory and metacognitive scores than younger-old poor comprehenders, consistent with results obtained in the literature with younger participants. Older-old adults had poorer working memory than younger-old poor comprehenders, although they did not differ in metacognitive performance.

Two experiments compared groups of participants in different age ranges (young-old, 55-65 years, old, 66-75 years and old-old, more than 75 years and, in Experiment 2 only, young, 20-30 years). Memory updating tasks were administered, which required participants to remember the smallest items in each list. To perform the task correctly, participants had to update information efficiently, reducing interference from items no longer relevant. Intrusion errors were computed and in the first experiment these were described as "intrusions of irrelevant items" (immediate exclusion) and "intrusions of once relevant items" (delayed exclusion). The oldest adults performed worse in memory updating and made a greater number of intrusion errors of once relevant information. In the second experiment results showed that increases in memory load (number of items that had to be remembered) and updating demand (number of potentially relevant items) impaired performance. The oldest adults had greater difficulty when the task demand was increased. Furthermore, they produced a higher number of intrusion errors, particularly when the updating demand was increased. It therefore appears that elderly people have specific difficulty in updating information in working memory by excluding irrelevant information},

These men read the same text they did 30 years previously for a digital registration. After having copied the high-quality archival recordings digitally, the results of the acoustical analysis of both recordings (recent and archival) were compared. This was done to search for the contribution of aging. In this article we report on the results of the speaking fundamental frequency (SFF) and the standard deviation of the SFF (SFFsd) as a measure of intraindividual variability, and the voice onset time (VOT). Results indicate that, in connected speech, SFF decreased, SFFsd became more restricted, and the VOT increased strongly. The interpretation of the results compels us to conclude that it is extremely difficult to define the specific effect of aging alone, since it is only one element among many others, including methodological concerns},

The right hemi-aging model is supported by behavioral studies in the domains of cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor processing, but the evidence has been mixed. In contrast, available evidence is generally consistent with the HAROLD model, which is supported primarily by functional neuroimaging evidence in the domains of episodic memory encoding and retrieval, semantic memory retrieval, working memory, perception, and inhibitory control. Age-related asymmetry reductions may reflect functional compensation or dedifferentiation, and the evidence, although scarce, tends to support the compensation hypothesis. The right hemi-aging and the HAROLD models are not incompatible. For example, the latter may apply to prefrontal regions and the former to other brain regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

With simultaneous dichotic presentation, undrugged young subjects reported both messages correctly in 35\% of trials. Aged subjects scored double-correct responses in only 19\% of trials, a highly significant difference (p less than 0.001). Following treatment with 1.0 mg scopolamine, young subjects also scored double correct responses in only 19\% of trials, a highly significant reduction from their undrugged performance (p less than 0.01), but virtually the same as that of normal aged subjects. Similar findings were obtained with a staggered dichotic presentation. These results extend the observation that cholinergic blockade in young subjects reproduces the pattern of M/C decline of the aged; thus providing further for the hypothesis that this decline may result from impaired function in cholinergic neurons.

Participants correctly repeated significantly more words in the sentences when they were preceded by related sentences than when the sentences were presented in isolation.

The aim is to detect unusual situations that might give serious cause for concern. The smart home is connected to a large medical network, which provides a direct link to medical assistance in case of emergency. One of the main issues is to make a decision about the patient state so as to detect both short- and long-term critical evolutions, with a level of seriousness being associated to each detection. The complexity of the decision making process entails building a multiple-level decision architecture. The methods and algorithms related to such a decision-making stem from pattern recognition and neural networks.

The results do not challenge the utility of the sentence span task as a measure of on-line cognition, but they raise concerns as to how resource might be allocated to processing and storage elements of the task within a single flexible resource pool, or between different resources of a multiple component working memory system. Although both models lack predictive power regarding resource allocation in these tasks, the multiple resource model appears to offer the better account},

To identify the problems IVR users experience, 22 community-dwelling senior women and 22 female university students were monitored while they performed the same six real IVR tasks. As expected, old age had a negative impact on performance, but seniors were polarized into very poor and very good performers. Seniors gave lower usability ratings than young people; only young users gave high ratings to the one voice-activated system. Users' problems were mostly caused by design flaws in the IVR systems, especially ambiguous choices or instructions, and too-rapid automated voices. Young and old participants had similar complaints, but most young users overcame all difficulties, while the majority of seniors failed because of age-related losses in capacities. The solution is not special products for the old, but universal design that will make IVRs and other technological products more usable for everyone.},

In this study older adults (55 years and over) were compared to younger adults (30 years and under) on levels of computer anxiety and computer experience. Subjects in the study completed a demographic and computer experience questionnaire, and two computer anxiety scales. Previous research findings indicating a negative relationship between computer anxiety and computer experience was replicated for both young and older adults. Additional findings indicated that older adults were less computer anxious and had less computer experience than younger adults. Furthermore, older subjects indicated more liking for computers than younger subjects. However, while young males liked computers more than young females, no differences between older males and older females were found on the computer liking subscale. Some discrepancies between the two computer anxiety scales suggest further research is needed to validate computer anxiety scales for use with older adults},

Gender differences were observed for attitudes towards computers, with females having a less positive attitude than males. Greater computer experience was associated with a more positive attitude, and with learning more word processing knowledge during the course, replicating previous findings with young adults. No overall change in attitudes was found across the course, with the exception of computer liking; subjects tended to like computers less after the course, suggesting that the type of computer exposure may be an important factor in determining attitudes. Spatial scanning was found to be important in rapidly locating control keys for editing. Inductive and deductive reasoning were important predictors of word processing knowledge, accounting for 60\% of the variance. Identification of individual difference factors is a first step towards suggesting design changes in word processing programs for older adults},

Accordingly, older participants are predicted to be particularly bad in a time-based prospective memory task. However, the prediction is not always confirmed. Self-initiated activities entail central executive functioning. We therefore predicted the age deficit to emerge more clearly when the performance on the ongoing task also involved more central executive functioning. Time-based prospective memory among older adults collapsed when the complexity of the ongoing task increased. However, an age deficit was also obtained when the pacing of the event-based prospective memory task was high because of the general slowing of functioning by older adults},

A sample of 53 community residing spousal dyads (balanced with respect to sex of care receiver) completed questionnaires about their well- being, relational satisfaction, and communication patterns. In addition, conversations between the dyads were videotaped and analyzed. The type of communication used by the caregiving spouses was influenced by their sex, their earlier relationship with their spouse, and their level of well-being. Caregivers who used an overly directive communication tone with their spouse were likely to be wives and carergivers who had a high degree of autonomy in their earlier relationship with their spouse. Low levels of life satisfaction and high affect balance in caregivers were associated with caregivers using a more patronizing tone. The well-being of care receivers was also related to their perceptions of their caregivers' communication. Care receivers who perceived their caregivers' communication as patronizing reported low levels of affect balance and high levels of conflict in the relationship. The findings suggest that certain characteristics of spousal carergivers are related to the type of communication they use when conversing with their partner, although the relations are not always as expected. Furthermore, the data also confirm the Communication Predicament of Aging Model, in that communication from caregivers that conveys a lack of respect can have a negative effect on the well-being of care receivers},

This paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the schizophrenia facial affect recognition research over the past decade and the schizophrenia literature on affective prosody, and provides the first review of the schizophrenia literature on multichannel emotion recognition research. The weight of evidence would suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience problems in the perception of emotional material; however, the specificity, extent, and nature of the deficits are unclear. Emotion recognition research in schizophrenia should be informed by the general literature on emotion recognition with serious attention paid to methodological issues},

Moreover, regression analyses produced no reliable relation between the prospective and retrospective memory tasks.

In particular, the effect of computer knowledge operated on computer interest through computer anxiety. The effect of age was not fully mitigated by the other model variables, indicating the need for future research that identifies and models other correlates of age and computer interest. The most immediate application of this research is the finding that a simple 3-item instrument can be used to assess computer interest in older populations. This will help professionals plan and implement computer services in public-access settings for older adults.

For analyses of results, participants were grouped based on their level of computer experience. All users performed well under auditory-haptic bimodal feedback and experienced users responded well to all multimodal feedback. Based on performance benefits for older adults seen in this experiment, future research should extend investigations to effectively integrate multimodal feedback into GUI interfaces in order to improve usability for this growing and diverse user group},

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of age on proper and common name retrieval in long-term memory. The word retrieval paradigm used to achieve this goal consisted of the naming of photographs representing celebrities (production of a certain kind of proper names: names of people) and objects (production of common names). Compared with younger adults, elderly people experienced more tip-of-the-tongue states for proper names, but not for common names. Thus, the present study provides support for disproportionate age-related problems in lexical access to proper names. This finding is interpreted with reference to the cognitive model of speech production proposed by Burke et al. (1991)},

Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCHINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and INSPEC were searched using the terms diabetes and telemedicine for clinical studies using electronic transfer of blood glucose results in people with diabetes. The technology used, trial design and clinical outcome measures used were extracted for trials and prospective cohort studies. Randomized controlled trials with HbA(1c) as an outcome were pooled using standard meta-analytical methods. Results We identified 539 papers among which 32 papers described 10 prospective cohort studies, 12 parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCT), three crossover trials, and one non-parallel group trial. Only two studies described full details of randomization, blinding of outcomes and dropouts and withdrawals. Electronic transfer of glucose results appears feasible in a clinical setting. Only two of the RCTs included more than 100 patients, and only three extended to 1 year. Only one study was designed to show that telemedicine interventions might replace clinic interventions without deterioration in HbA(1c). Results pooled from the nine RCTs with reported data did not provide evidence that the interventions were effective in reducing HbA(1c) (-0.1\%, 95\% Cl -0.4\% to 0.04\%). Conclusions Telemedicine solutions for diabetes care are feasible and acceptable, but evidence for their effectiveness in improving MAR or reducing costs while maintaining HbA(1c) levels, or improving other aspects of diabetes management is not strong. Further research should seek to understand how telemedicine might enhance educational and self-management interventions and RCTs are required to examine cost-effectiveness.},

HNR is a measure that quantifies the amount of additive noise in the voice signal; jitter reflects the periodicity of vocal fold vibration. In this study, measures of HNR, jitter and F0 were used to compare vocal function in three groups of normally speaking women: young adults, middle-aged adults, and elderly adults. Significant differences in HNR emerged between the elderly women and the other two groups. F0 differences were also apparent between the elderly group and the two younger groups; there were no significant differences in jitter between the three groups. HNRwas found to be a more sensitive index of vocal function than jitter. The significant lowering of HNR evident in t he elderly speakers may be attributable in part to medications taken by the majority of these elderly subjects},

This has increased the incidence of senile pathologies and the associated problems for this people. In the field of otolaryngology, one of these pathologies is presbyacusis. This study attempts to find relationships between presbyacusis and different parameters related to it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out with 59 volunteers aged between 50-89 from different homes for the elderly in the city of Reus. The subjects presented with or without symptoms of deafness. An AOE test was then performed to determine the different parameters. Significant response criteria were: otoemissions with a signal-noise ratio of 3 dB or greater or 65\% reproducibility in < 2 bands. The results obtained were analyzed through a computer statistics program (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel for the graphics. RESULTS: The results of the characteristics of the test are within the acceptable limits of quality. The prevalence of subjects with AOE was 22\%, with an average age of the subjects of around 69 years. We did not find statistical differences in the presbyacusis group with respect to the parameters of intensity and reproductability, but there was a correlation in the duration of the test. In the analysis of frequencies in the reproductibility parameters we observed a fall in the 5 KHz. The ratio signal-noise showed a similar tendency. It is necessary to emphasize the worst results in the different parameters from the right ear the left one. CONCLUSIONS: The AOE offers information in frequencies of 1 and 2 KHz, where we can see a reduction in the reproducibility in the presbyacusis group. We see a longer test time, in the presbyacusis group and this may be used to control the development of the disease},

PATIENTS AND METHOD: We started a cross-sectional study with 61 patients coming from different retirement homes, being able to finally test 59 subjects, after two abandonments. RESULTS: The prevalence of presbyacusis was of 16.9\%, predominating in female sex, although it was not a statistically significant association, with an average age at the moment of the study of 75.7 years. None of the presbyacusis patients referred smoking habits in the last 30 years, and only sporadic alcohol. A significantly negative statistical relation with the hypertension was verified. There was no significant statistical association with the location and type of home, neither with other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of the disease is confirmed, without a real significant predominance in women. The time of evolution of the disease is variable at the moment of the diagnosis. We emphasized the absence of relation between the arterial hypertension, the consumption of tobacco and alcohol and presbyacusis, as well as the rest of studied risk factors},

When retest effects were not included in the models, the age-related effects were underestimated, with the magnitude of bias depending on the size of the ignored retest effects.

With speech competition, elderly listeners exhibited significantly larger reductions in P2 amplitude than did young listeners. The competition produced no changes in N1 amplitude in either group. These findings contrast with those of an earlier study in which age-related reductions in N1 but not P2 amplitude were found when listeners attended to tones rather than speech stimuli in the presence of speech competition. These studies suggest that amplitude reductions in different LAEP components may provide electrophysiologic indices of age-related breakdowns in processing sounds in the presence of competition. Which LAEP components are affected may depend on experimental variables such as task difficulty or the nature of the stimuli (e.g., speech vs nonspeech)},

Syllogistic reasoning was significantly correlated with education, processing speed, word span, and word fluency. Correlations with visuo-spatial processing and random letter generation were just short of significance. Syllogistic reasoning performance declined with age, although the deficit was no longer statistically significant following control for age-related differences in information-processing speed. On the other hand the inclusion of word fluency as an additional covariate boosted the apparent age effect, returning it to statistical significance. Thus it is possible that cognitive processes outside of working memory might underpin at least part of the apparent age deficit. This possibility is evaluated in the light of neuropsychological evidence implicating the prefrontal cortex in both the processing of syllogisms and more generally in cognitive ageing},

Intrasubject and intersubject analyses of the speech data revealed a dependence of pitch on duration that differed between male and female speakers. Significant differences between the genders were also found in speech rate, pitch range, and pitch slope. The findings suggest that an integrated treatment of acoustic cues may provide a more invariant feature of normal prosody against which clinical groups may be compared.

Gestures have proven a powerful concept for explaining how planning and analysing of motor acts could have evolved into verbal communication. According to this concept, development of an action-perception network allowed for coding and decoding of communicative gestures. These were manual or manual/articulatory in the beginning and then became increasingly elaborate in the articulatory mode. The theory predicts that listening to the 'gestures' that compose spoken language should activate an extended articulatory and manual action-perception network. To examine this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of language on cortical excitability of the hand muscle representation by transcranial magnetic stimulation. We found the hand motor system to be activated by linguistic tasks, most notably pure linguistic perception, but not by auditory or visuospatial processing. The amount of motor system activation was comparable in both hemispheres. Our data support the theory that language may have evolved within a general and bilateral action-perception network},

In Experiment 1, young, middle-age, and older adults solved three addition problems before giving the answers to any. Older adults added as well as young and middle-age adults but showed a more pronounced serial position curve across the three problem positions. In Experiment 2, young and older adults constructed linear orderings (e.g., ABCD) from pairwise information presented in sentences (e.g., BC). Manipulations involving processing (e.g., type of sentence) did not interact with age differences, but those involving storage capacity (e.g., ordering length) did. All main effects and interactions support the hypothesis of a smaller storage capacity but do not rule out some processing deficit in older adults},

The home becomes a place where people care for each other, and it gradually subsumes all activities. This article reports on an ethnographic study of aging adults who live independently in their homes. Seventeen elders aged 60 through 90 were interviewed and observed in their homes in 2 Midwestern cities. The goal is to understand how robotic products might assist these people, helping them to stay independent and active longer. The experience of aging is described as an ecology of aging made up of people, products, and activities taking place in a local environment of the home and the surrounding community. In this environment, product successes and failures often have a dramatic impact on the ecology, throwing off a delicate balance.}

As a group, the Parkinsonian speakers had very limited jaw movement compared to the normal geriatrics. For opening gestures, jaw displacements and velocities produced by the Parkinsonian subjects were about half those produced by the normal geriatrics. Lower lip movement amplitude and velocity also were reduced for the Parkinsonian speakers relative to the normal geriatrics, but the magnitude of the reduction was not as great as that seen in the jaw. Lower lip closing velocities expressed as a function of movement amplitude were greater for the Parkinsonian speakers than for the normal geriatrics. This increased velocity of lower lip movement may reflect a difference in the control of lip elevation for the Parkinsonian speakers, an effect that increased with the severity of dysarthria. Acoustically, the Parkinsonian subjects had reduced durations of vocalic segments, reduced formant transitions, and increased voice onset time compared to the normal geriatrics. These effects were greater for the more severe, compared to the milder, dysarthrics and were most apparent in the more complex, vocalic gestures},

The present study used a simple RT paradigm to investigate effects of the complexity of the required task on vocal RT in normal young and aged speakers. Task complexity was represented by two levels: a single word and a short sentence. Only the aged subjects showed a significant task complexity effect on vocal RT. Furthermore, the between-group RT difference increased as a function of task complexity. Specific causes for the increase in vocal RT for the aged subjects are presently unknown, but likely reside in altered respiratory biomechanics and reduced efficiency of CNS motor processing},

Results showed older participants to be slower than younger participants on overall latencies on the information retrieval task.

Regression analysis showed that movement speed, reasoning speed and spatial ability predicted the overall latencies accurately. Modelling the consecutive steps showed that latencies on the first selection are predicted by movement speed and reasoning speed. Memory and spatial measures are predictors for latencies on steps further into the menu structure only. This finding is consistent with increased slowing of older participants for later selections and suggests that deep menu structures are less suited for older users},

By and large, the ERP repetition effect, recorded during indirect memory paradigms, appears to be relatively intact with aging, suggesting spared repetition priming mechanisms and the brain substrates upon which they depend. Some age-related findings during direct (i.e. explicit) memory testing suggest that a left-sided posterior old/new effect (similar to 500-800 ms), thought to reflect a relatively automatic retrieval of item information, is equivalent in young and old. A later: long-duration, right-sided, prefrontal old/new effect, allied with the search for and/or the retrieval of contextual information (i.e. source memory), has been found to be smaller or absent in the waveforms of the old in two of three studies, suggesting impaired source memory mechanisms in the elderly. It is argued that the data are relatively consistent with spared item retrieval mechanisms in the elderly presumably supported by medial temporal lobe structures, However, although the data are suggestive, there are too few studies at this time to reach a firm conclusion as to whether the mechanisms that support contextual retrieval, presumably mediated by prefrontal cortical structures, are impaired in the elderly.

The target P3b data were recorded in either auditory oddball paradigms or in visual study tasks in which orienting activity was manipulated (as a within-subjects variable) in investigations of indirect memory. Some of the studies required choice reaction time responses, whereas others required responses only to the target stimuli. Motor response requirements had a profound effect on the P3b scalp distribution of older but not of younger subjects. The presence of a frontally oriented scalp focus in the topographies of the older adults in most of the tasks described here is consistent with older adults continuing to use prefrontal processes for stimuli that should have already been well encoded and/or categorized. However, although older subjects generally had different P3b scalp distributions than younger subjects, their scalp distributions were modulated similarly by task requirements. These data suggest that similar mechanisms modulate the scalp distribution of P3b in older compared to younger adults. However, in the older adult, these scalp distribution changes in response to task demands are superimposed on a frontally oriented scalp focus due to a putative frontal lobe contribution to target P3b topography},

Performance declined from the single- to the conjoint-cue task for both age groups but more so for the elderly. The ERP data showed that both age groups used a hierarchical processing strategy to perform the conjoint-cue task, but processing of the pitch dimension took longer for the elderly than for the young. The ERP data also showed that the scalp distribution of a late aspect of the waveform. was more restricted in both anterior and posterior directions for the elderly.

This method measures hysteresis (microJ), which describes the viscous properties of the system, and compliance (mm(3)/kPa) reflecting its elasticity. Moreover, P(ec0) (kPa) was recorded, which corresponds to middle ear pressure measured by tympanometry. Recordings were made in a group of 30 older normal subjects (mean age 77 years) and results were compared to previous findings in a group of 39 younger normal subjects (mean age 29). Hysteresis was markedly decreased in the older normal group compared to the younger one (p = 0.057). This may reflect morphological changes previously reported in the tympanic membrane and can be related to theoretical considerations on tympanic membrane rupture pressures. Compliance and P(ec0) were not influenced by variation in age (p = 0.645 and 0.966)},

METHODS: We studied 13 healthy subjects using water labeled with radioactive oxygen 15 and positron emission tomography while they listened to 3 similar sets of spoken English sentences. In different tasks, their responses were based on the emotional propositional content, on the emotional intonation of the sentence (prosody), or on their ability to repeat the second word in the sentence (control). RESULTS: Understanding propositional content activated the prefrontal cortex bilaterally, on the left more than on the right. In contrast, responding to the emotional prosody activated the right prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSION: Neurologically healthy subjects activate right hemisphere regions during emotional prosody recognition},

However, it is not known whether this defect is present during the earliest stages of the illness or whether it reflects specific limitations in dividing attention between cognitive and motor requirements. Methods: Fifteen patients with early stage PD and 10 age-matched and 9 younger normal controls moved the right dominant hand on a digitizing tablet to eight targets presented on a screen in synchrony with a tone at 1-second intervals. The tasks were as follows: 1) CCW-a timed-response task where targets appeared in a predictable counterclockwise order; 2) RAN-a reaction time task where targets were random and unpredictable; 3) SEQ-a task with multiple demands emphasizing explicit learning and target anticipation in which subjects learned a sequence while reaching for targets; and 4) VSEQ-subjects learned a visual sequence without moving. Results: CCW and RAN yielded similar results in all groups. In patients with PD, sequence learning was the same in SEQ and VSEQ and was slower compared to both control groups. In older controls, learning was faster in VSEQ than in SEQ, whereas younger controls learned equally fast in both tasks. Conclusions: Despite normal motor execution, the initial phases of sequence learning are impaired in early PD independent of task requirements, possibly reflecting reduced working memory. Learning was slower in older than younger controls only in tasks with multiple demands, presumably due to reduced attentional resources},

As a way around these problems, we asked whether a general set of design guidelines could be generated which would improve older adults' performance on existing audio remote controls. In a series of three experiments, we were able to show that older adults did have much more difficulty operating existing remote controls than younger adults, that a common problem lay behind most of those errors, and that general guidelines for the design of audio remote control interfaces emerged which when implemented led to large improvements in performance. The guidelines can be generalized to the much larger set of remote controls, thereby potentially increasing the independence and well being of many older adults},

We describe here a utility elicitation program developed specifically for use with computer-inexperienced older adults: functional limitation and independence rating (FLAlRl). FLAIRI design features address common physical problems of the aged and computer attitudes of inexperienced users that could impede computer acceptance. We interviewed 400 adults ages 65 years and older with FLAIRl. In exit interviews with 154 respondents, 118 (76\%) found FLAIRI easy to use.

N100 amplitude to probes decreased as a function of memory load in young subjects, but increased as a function of memory load in the elderly. Young subjects also exhibited changes in N100 latency during memorization of list items, a result not found in elderly subjects. We conclude that normal aging is associated with a qualitatively different pattern of N100 responses during memory retrieval, and a static N100 response during encoding. The findings suggest that aging is accompanied by functional reorganization of the neural network that supports retrieval in auditory working memory},

It was tested against the standard paper map for the test area with both younger and older people and their performance and subjective workload were measured. The results show that such an aid can significantly outperform a paper-based map and that older people derive substantially more benefit from it than do younger people.}

As a contribution to such technological solutions, two demonstrator platforms for a robotic home assistant-called Care-O-bot - were designed and implemented at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart. Whereas Care-O-bot I is only a mobile platform with a touch screen, Care-O-bot II is additionally equipped with adjustable walking supporters and a manipulator arm. It has the capability to navigate autonomously in indoor environments, be used as an intelligent walking support, and execute manipulation tasks. The control software of Care-O-bot II runs on two industrial PCs and a hand-held control panel. The walking aid module is based on sensors in the walking aid handles and on a dynamic model of conventional walking aids. In ""direct mode"", the user can move along freely with the robot whereas obstacles are detected and avoided. In ""planned mode"", he can specify a target and be lead there by the robotic assistant. Autonomous planning and execution of complex manipulation tasks is based on a symbolic planner and environmental information provided in a database. The user input (graphical and speech input) is transferred to the task planner and adequate actions to solve the task (sequence of motion and manipulation commands) are created. A new method for sensor based manipulation using a tilting laser scanner and camera integrated in the head of the robot has been implemented. Additional sensors in the robot hand increase the grasping capabilities. The walking aid has been tested with elderly users from an assisted living facility and a nursery home. Furthermore, the execution of fetch and carry tasks has been implemented and tested in a sample home environment},

Recall was spoken and written and in strict serial order. Despite similar letter spans, serial recall was more difficult for the elderly than for the young. Final-item recall advantage in the control condition was reduced more for the elderly than for the young in the auditory modality, and the elderly were more susceptible to a small degree of visual suffix interference. Older subjects made more suffix and extralist intrusion errors than did young subjects. Oral recall, along with the method of recording written responses, may have allowed these errors to surface. The extralist intrusion errors were phonological or based on alphabetic order, suggesting that the elderly may experience task-competitive, internally generated noise, which enters the response set. The suffix intrusions, along with greater susceptibility to the suffix, suggest an attentional type of deficit related to ineffective response inhibition in the elderly},

Participants responded when they heard an anomalous word embedded within a popular fairy tale. Anomalous words evoked a robust positivity in the 700- to 900-msec latency range in all participants. Comparison of area measures from waveforms at the lateral frontal, frontotemporal, temporal, temporoparietal, and parietal electrode sites revealed asymmetry in hemispheric positivity. In children and young adults, asymmetry peaked in the 600- to 800-msec range and favored the left hemisphere in both target-right and target-left conditions. In seniors, however, asymmetry peaked at 1100 msec, favored the left hemisphere in the target-right condition, and favored the right hemisphere in the target-left condition. These results support the concept that aging affects hemispheric asymmetry during linguistic processing},

   abstract = {Sentence comprehension declines with age, but the neural basis for this change is unclear. We monitored regional brain activity in 13 younger subjects and 11 healthy seniors matched for sentence comprehension accuracy while they answered a simple probe about written sentences. The sentences varied in their grammatical features (subject-relative vs object-relative subordinate clause) and their verbal working memory (WM) demands (short vs long antecedent noun-gap linkage). We found that young and senior subjects both recruit a core written sentence processing network, including left posterolateral temporal and bilateral occipital cortex for all sentences, and ventral portions of left inferior frontal cortex for object-relative sentences with a long noun-gap linkage. Differences in activation patterns for seniors compared to younger subjects were due largely to changes in brain regions associated with a verbal WM network. While seniors had less left parietal recruitment than younger subjects, left premotor cortex, and dorsal portions of left inferior frontal cortex showed greater activation in seniors compared to younger subjects. Younger subjects recruited right posterolateral temporal cortex for sentences with a long noun-gap linkage. Seniors additionally recruited right parietal cortex for this sentence-specific form of WM. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural basis for sentence comprehension includes dissociable but interactive large-scale neural networks supporting core written sentence processes and related cognitive resources involved in WM. Seniors with good comprehension appear to up-regulate portions of the neural substrate for WM during sentence processing to achieve comprehension accuracy that equals young subjects},

Reminders that referred only to the intended activity did improve prospective memory, but not to the level of reminders that referred both to the target events and to the intended activity. Instructions to imagine oneself performing the prospective memory task did not further improve prospective memory. Neither the delay between the prospective memory instructions and the prospective memory cover task nor the delay between a reminder and a prospective memory target event significantly influenced performance.

None of the patients with presbylaryngis received this diagnosis from the referral source. Understanding the anatomic and physiologic changes of the aging vocal tract, along with the clinical correlation of each change, is crucial in evaluating this group of patients.

Collagen plays a significant role in the biomechanical effects of the lamina propria. Specifically, it lends tensile strength to the rapidly oscillating fold. We obtained from a state medical examiner 38 larynges from men and women in infant, adult, and geriatric age groups. We stained the vocal folds for collagen using a picric acid stain and studied them using an image analysis system. Distributions of collagen were measured from the superficial to deep layers (from epithelium to vocalis muscle) within the lamina propria. The data showed an increase in collagen content from infant to adult stages. Infant folds had about 51\% of the collagen found in all adults and in geriatric patients (p < .001). There was no significant difference between adult and geriatric folds (p < .16). There was, however, a gender difference in the amount of collagen in both adult and geriatric specimens. Female adult and geriatric folds had about 59\% of the collagen found in male adult and geriatric folds (p < .001). The distribution pattern of collagen showed that most of the collagen was present in the deep layer. From these data we conclude that there are age-related and gender-related differences between male and female infant, adult, and geriatric vocal folds. Stress-strain performance studies need to be correlated with histologic findings to better study the phonetic implications of these findings},

The technical state of the art of emergency-call systems specially developed for use by the elderly, is briefly discussed, in particular the well-known radio emergency-call button, with the aid of which an alarm can be activated manually. This system, however, does not offer adequate safety in all emergency situations. Alternative or complementary systems designed to automatically trigger an alarm on the basis of the recording and evaluation of so-called vital parameters, are therefore proposed. In addition, in a smart-home environment with networked devices, further parameters - so-called environment parameters can be used. It is found that the identification of an emergency situation becomes more reliable as the number of parameters employed increases},

SETTING: Comprehensive postacute TBI rehabilitation program. PARTICIPANTS: Ten people with moderate to severe TBI enrolled from 3 months to 18 years after injury. OUTCOME MEASURE: Memory for therapy goals. Clinicians generated statements describing six current therapy goals, half of which were randomly assigned to be recorded on a voice organizer during the next case management session. Participants selected three times per day to listen to the recorded goals, prompted by an alarm. One-week recall was tested using both free- and cued-recall formats. RESULTS: Recorded goals were recalled better than unrecorded goals and appeared to be associated with better awareness or follow-through with therapy objectives. CONCLUSION: Portable electronic devices have the potential to assist with treatment areas beyond tasks involving prospective memory},

The results of the study indicated that untrained listeners used similar perceptual sets to judge age until after the fiftieh year of life. Regardless of sex, listeners tended to underestimate the age of the speakers. Male and female speech pathologists viewed low pitch and hoarseness as being the most salient features of speech for the speakers. Qualitative analysis revealed that the most prominent features indicated by speech pathologists could be classified according to pitch, quality, articulation, and rate of speech},

The thoughts were manipulated as caring or dominant (younger individual), and assertive or passive (older individual). The young individual was evaluated more negatively in the patronizing, rather than neutral, speech conditions. Less assertive responses to patronizing speech resulted in evaluations of increased warmth and incompetence for the elderly patronizee.

One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house},

   year = {1996},
   abstract = {Critical concern with infantilisation practices - i.e. the tendency to treat older people as if they are dependent children - has for the most part concentrated on the negative associations between infantilisation and dependency in later life. Infantilisation is usually defined as an unwelcome imposition on older men and women who are often portrayed as relatively powerless to resist. Whilst the negative consequences of enforced infantilisation must not be ignored there are also occasions when infantilisation may be regarded as a voluntary or chosen mode of resistance on the part of older people to the decrements and external impositions of later life. The concept of infantilisation may therefore be enlarged to include modes of resistance involving processes of mutual identification of the old with the young; in certain instances even as a form of conspiracy between these two age groups against the wider society. This paper therefore pursues fictional images of such rapport as they occur in a selection of the 'William'' stories written by Richmal Crompton during the period from 1919 up to her death in 1969, and with an appeal which continues up to the present day. The argument is that these stories of alliances between boyhood and 'elders' may be regarded as vivid examples (a repository of positive images) of what may be described as 'positive infantilisation': that is to say, of consciousness of the independence of subjective selfhood from the ageing body in the face of the misperceptions and misleading stereotypes of the (mature) adult world},

A secondary analysis of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition standardization sample (N = 1030) was performed to investigate this relationship. It was hypothesized on the basis of past research indicating an age-related decline in central executive performance, that backward digit and spatial span performance would decrease at a greater rate than forward span performance. However, the results indicated that the rate of age-related performance decline was equivalent for both measures. It is proposed that both forward and backward span tasks recruit central executive resources for successful task performance},

Based on previous work on the discourse processing of synthetic speech, a monotonic trend in a listener's ability to accurately summarize texts produced by different output methods was hypothesized (word > sentence > mixed). Thirty able-bodied adults were individually tested over a 2-day period, listening to four texts produced by a DECtalk speech synthesizer at a speech presentation rate of 7.5 wpm. Using a discourse summarization taxonomy developed by Higginbotham, Lundy, and Scally (1993), the experimental hypothesis was confirmed. Word-method listeners produced significantly more accurate renditions of the original texts than sentence-method listeners, who in turn, did better than mixed-method listeners. Statistically significant differences also were found for the topic familiarity of the texts. The role of the above variables on AAC device comprehension and technology design is discussed},

Phonatory air flow signals were gathered during [pa] syllable repetitions. Mean phonatory air flow, coefficients of variation, and the presence of large air flow perturbations (75 ml/s or more) were examined for the three groups of speakers. There was no significant difference in mean phonatory air flow across groups, and very large intersubject variation in mean phonatory air flow occurred for both the AdSD and MTD groups. Coefficients of variation were similar for the groups of women with MTD and normal phonation but were significantly larger for the group with AdSD. Air flow perturbations were common with AdSD and rare with MTD. Relatively large coefficients of variation and air flow perturbations of at least 75 ml/s did occur for some women with normal voices who were 70 years of age or older. It appears that intrasubject variability in phonatory air flow may aid in the differentiation of AdSD and MTD when used in conjunction with other elements of a thorough voice evaluation. However, the potential contribution of aging to increased intrasubject variability in phonatory air flow must be considered when interpreting findings},

Tidal breathing differed across subject groups with regard to depth, rate, and chest wall configuration. Subjects rated high in relative fatness breathed deeper, slower, and with a greater chest wall deformation from relaxation than did other subjects. Speech breathing differed across subject groups with regard to relative volume contributions of the rib cage and abdomen, abdomen excursions, rib cage paradoxing, and chest wall configuration. Subjects rated high in relative fatness demonstrated substantial abdomen contributions to lung volume change, large abdomen excursions, frequent rib cage paradoxing, and marked chest wall deformations from relaxation. By contrast, subjects rated high in relative linearity demonstrated large rib cage contributions to lung volume change, small abdomen excursions, and slight chest wall deformations from relaxation. Subjects rated high in relative musculoskeletal development generally represented a mixture of characteristics of the other two subject groups in their speech breathing performance. Functional differences are discussed in relation to possible underlying mechanism and inferences are drawn concerning evaluation and management of individuals with speech breathing disorders},

   abstract = {This experiment was designed primarily to generate information about the preferences of older listeners for various classes of voices. Speech samples for that purpose were elicited from 80 speakers, who provided the desired stimuli (sentences) under frequency and intensity control. Specifically, there were eight cells in the design, each represented by 10 speakers (5 male and 5 female); all combinations of low, medium, and high speaker fundamental frequency (SFF) were combined with soft, middle and loud vocal intensity (VI) productions--except for the low-SFF/high-VI combination, which proved impossible to obtain. Listeners were four groups of 20 individuals equally divided as to sex. The two older of these groups, designated as the experimental subjects, were: older adults (60-70 years of age) and the elderly (80-90 years). The two younger groups served as controls; they included young adults (20-30 years of age) and middle-aged adults (aged 40-50 years). Listeners rated each speech sample on a 5-point preference scale varying from "like very much" to "dislike very much." The results suggest that most listeners prefer medium intensity voices. Other preference tendencies were toward low-pitched voices and (slightly) toward male speakers; but these trends were not as marked as the first. Most importantly, there were no systematic differences in voice type preferences between or among the older and younger groups--or between male and female listeners},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are over 16 000 nursing homes in the United States (US), among which approximately 70\% of residents are cognitively impaired. Reflecting this, approximately 20\% of US nursing homes maintain Special Dementia Care Units (SCUs). SCUs supposedly provide more staff time and more specialized staff assignments to residents than do traditional care units. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This paper addresses the issues of staff time and assignment: do the costs of personal care inputs differ according to whether they are provided by SCUs or in traditional care settings? Related to this, are differences associated with the different settings, or are they accounted for by resident characteristics within the settings? METHODS: Given the bias generally associated with collection of staff time data, the author developed (supported by the Health Care Financing Administration and the National Institute on Aging) and used in this study a barcode-based system ('InfoAide'). Using InfoAide, each provider automatically recorded task- and resident-specific time expenditure data which were subsequently monetized, using prevailing local wage rates. Individual resident personal characteristics and status data were provided by another simultaneous study of SCU impacts among the same residents. Regression analysis (MANCOVA for significantly correlated dependent variables) was used to examine the relationships between cost and SCU/traditional status, and individual resident characteristics, separately for each category of provider. RESULTS: Controlling for resident characteristics, the cost of aide care is significantly (positively) related (p <=0.01) to SCU status. Cognitive impairment, ADL impairment and being restrained are also related to higher aide care cost (p <=0.05, p <=0.01, and p <=0.05, respectively). The same is generally true of Speech Therapy, Social Service and care by licensed practical nurses, although the differences between SCU and traditional care units are essentially trivial - and there are no SCU/traditional care differences for registered nurses. DISCUSSION: SCU/traditional unit status, even when combined with the central resident covariates, explains very little variance in service costs, other than among nursing aides; in separate MR analyses in which monetized service time was the dependent variable, the cumulative adjusted R2 among aides was 0.37; for each of the other categories of service provider, the adjusted R2 was less than 0.10. There were differences (particularly in cognitive and ADL impairment) between SCU and non-SCU residents; these differences were related to differences in basic services which were, in turn, provided primarily by aides. The increased level of care provided in SCUs is attributable primarily to nursing aides. However, there is relatively little (albeit statistically significant) variation in more 'elective'services according to individual characteristics or to SCU versus traditional unit placement.

Two different dual-task conditions were comprised of simple tests that are presumably processed via separate perceptual modalities: 1 visual-manual and 1 auditory-verbal. The first condition consisted of a visual cancellation test and an auditory digit span. The second condition was comprised of an alternate form of the visual cancellation test and letter fluency. NIANOVA examined the effect of cognitive status (3-level independent variable) on 3 indices of dual-task performance (letter fluency, digit span, visual cancellation). Analyses controlled for age, education and performance on each test when performed alone. The results revealed that the cognitive impairment group incurred significantly greater dual-task costs compared to both control groups. Furthermore, as was evident from discriminant function analyses, the dual-task measures were very accurate and better than the traditional neuropsychological measures at discriminating elders with cognitive impairments from normal controls},

Twenty-four females, 12 young and 12 old, heard word triads. Each triad was followed by visual presentation of a single word in colored ink. For both young and old Ss, color-naming latency for the visual words was significantly higher if the word itself was present in the auditory triad. This indicated that the visual words were processed to the level of meaning automatically in both young and old Ss},

   abstract = {A speaker has several ways in which he or she may highlight the fact that an error or imprecision of speech has been made and subsequently altered. The three principal ones are by signalling through the structure of the speech that surrounds the error (the repair-syntax), by the use of prosody, and through the semantic content. The role of prosody in the correction process is investigated in the current studies. Analysis of the prosody of a number of errors and their alterations drawn from unrestricted speech are reported. The analysis shows that pauses occur at the moment of interruption and that an increase in stress occurs at the start of the alteration. Pauses could indicate the moment of interruption, and stress could highlight what has been altered. Two sets of perceptual experiments were carried out to assess whether these cues are salient for listeners who hear constructions containing an error and its alteration. Two paradigms were employed in each set of experiments: (1) direct judgement about the comprehensibility of sentences containing errors and alterations, and (2) repeating a message that had an error and alteration without the error. The effects of stress and pauses on (Experiments 1A and 1B) or pauses around (Experiment 2A and 2B) the alterations were assessed. In the first set of experiments it was shown that pauses and stress help listeners process repairs. When a word is spoken in error, the speaker may repeat a section of speech immediately preceding the alteration and/or a section immediately following that word. Inclusion of these repeated sections allows assessment of whether pauses signal where the interruption occurred. The second experiment shows that the placing of the pause before the retrace, rather than at other locations, indicates to listeners where the repair starts},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the occurrence and outcome of cognitive decline in healthy, community-dwelling elders. METHODS: Ninety-five elders (mean age 84 years) who at entry had no cognitive impairment were followed for up to 13 years. Cognitive decline was defined as obtaining either a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5 or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24 on two examinations. RESULTS: Three outcomes of aging were determined: intact cognition, persistent cognitive decline without progression to dementia, and dementia. Whereas 49\% remained cognitively intact, 51\% developed cognitive decline. Mean follow-up to first CDR 0.5 was 3.8 years and age at conversion was 90.0 years. Those who remained cognitively intact had better memory at entry and were less likely to have APOE4 than those who developed cognitive decline. Of the 48 participants with cognitive decline, 27 (56\%) developed dementia (CDR > or =1) a mean of 2.8 years later. Participants with cognitive decline who progressed to dementia had poorer confrontation naming at the time of their first CDR 0.5 than those with persistent cognitive decline who did not progress during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The old old are at high risk for developing cognitive decline but many will not progress to dementia in the next 2 to 3 years or even beyond. These findings are important for understanding the prognosis of cognitive decline and for the design of treatment trials for AD. APOE genotype is a risk factor for cognitive decline},

Results indicated that all three types of variability were greater in older compared with younger participants even when group differences in speed were statistically controlled. Quantile-quantile plots showed age and task differences in the shape of the inconsistency distributions. Measures of within-person variability (dispersion and inconsistency) were positively correlated. Individual differences in RT inconsistency correlated negatively with level of performance on measures of perceptual speed, working memory, episodic memory, and crystallized abilities. Partial set correlation analyses indicated that inconsistency predicted cognitive performance independent of level of performance. The results indicate that variability of performance is an important indicator of cognitive functioning and aging},

Comparison of the low context items vs the number of meaningfully rich items correctly identified provided an index of the listener's ability to use contextual information in the HP sentences. The LP and CP score reflected the individual's ability to recognize items based only on the acoustic-phonetic information of the key words. Most individuals were able to take some advantage of contextual cues in everyday sentences; however, the older listeners were more adversely affected by background noise than younger listeners. For clinical utilization of the SPIN test, further research is needed to develop normative data as a function of age to make it an "age-fair" test},

With speech competition, elderly listeners exhibited significantly larger reductions in N1 amplitude than did young listeners. This suggests that N1 may provide an electrophysiologic index of age-related breakdowns in processing sounds in the presence of background competition. An unexpected difference was also found between young and elderly listeners in P300 scalp topography. While the young listeners' P300 response was centered at midline for both left and right ear stimulation, the elderly participants had P300 maxima centered in the parietal area of the hemisphere located contralateral to the test ear. This suggests that some of the functional properties (e.g., timing, strength, orientation) of the P300 neural generators may change with age or, alternatively, that different generators may be operative in elderly listeners},

We assessed 150 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD using the Western Aphasia Battery and a 100-item picture-naming test. A multivariate linear regression analysis examined the effect of age at onset after controlling for gender, education, severity of dementia and duration of the disease. Patients with early onset performed significantly worse than did patients with late onset on the word comprehension and sequential commands subtests. On the other hand, late-onset patients performed more poorly than early-onset patients on the picture-naming test in a subgroup with mild language deficits. However, the trend disappeared in other subgroups with more degraded language function. We consider that the concomitant effects of normal aging worsened the picture-naming deficits in the late-onset patients, and the rapid decline of naming ability in the early-onset patients masked the aging effect with the progression of language deficits. The deterioration of word comprehension and the rapid decline of naming ability are the characteristics of early-onset patients. The different patterns of language deficits between early- and late-onset patients may correspond to the genetic heterogeneity of AD},

We also studied the distribution of oxytalan fibers in vocal folds by aldehyde-fucusin staining. Oxytalan fibers were distributed throughout the connective tissue of the vocal folds, and a large number of fibers was present just under the epithelial basement membrane and around the muscle fibers.

This article focuses on one general approach to such decision making: predict the consequences of possible system actions on the basis of prior empirical learning, and evaluate the possible actions, taking into account situation-dependent priorities and the tradeoffs between the consequences. This decision-theoretic approach is illustrated in detail with reference to an example decision problem, for which models for decision making were learned from experimental data. It is shown how influence diagrams and methods of decision-theoretic planning can be applied to arrive at empirically well-founded decisions. This paradigm is then compared with two other paradigms that are often employed in intelligent user interfaces. Finally, various possible ways of learning (or otherwise deriving) suitable decision-theoretic models are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This article gives an overview of a research program that emphasizes empirically based understanding of this problem and the use of an explicit model of the relevant causal relationships. After introducing the challenge and comparing several possible approaches to it, we summarize related work on adaptive systems and the empirical research that forms the basis of the Ready prototype. The structure and workings of this prototype are discussed and illustrated with examples. We conclude by summarizing how the results obtained so far can form the basis for practically applied systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Data were collected via a survey instrument that combined demographics with the Loyd and Gressard (1984) computer attitude scale and the Fennema-Sherman (1976) mathematics attitude scale. The 351 male and female participants, in three age groups, were approximately equally divided between developmental and non-developmental students. A multiple analysis of variance revealed no main effect for gender with respect to dimensions of computer attitude. A main effect was found for age, indicating that the youngest group of students reported less computer anxiety and higher levels of confidence than did the other age groups. However, the oldest students reported the highest levels of computer liking and perceived usefulness of computers, Also, students with the highest level of math attitudes had the highest score for all four dimensions of computer attitude. Finally, relative to non-developmental students, developmental students reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the dimensions of computer attitude except perceived usefulness. Implications are discussed},

This study introduces a neural network modeling approach combined with cluster and decision tree analyses as a means to develop the inferential logic of Senior Healthwatch. Its role is to convert the data obtained from the Smart House into more meaningful information about the residents' daily activity such as the times for meal preparation, eating, and cleaning.

Demented individuals made errors of omission, not commission, at immediate recall. These errors probably reflect difficulty with attentional control rather than memory per se.

Participants included 210 introductory psychology students with and without head injuries. No significant demographic differences were found between these groups. Participants listened to 4 sets of audiotaped instructions from afictitious home economics teacher containing prosodic and content variations. Afterward, they rated the teacher on the following dimensions: liking, positive impact, negative impact, grade level being taught, and whether they would recommend hiring this teacher. Analysis of variance revealed there were no significant group differences between participants rating with normal speech. As expected, both groups favored the normal speech register over motherese. However, the group with head injuries consistently rated the speech with motherese content as more negative, less likable, less likely to hire, and aimed at a lower grade level. Participants with head injuries also rated the speech register with motherese prosody as less likable and less likely to hire. These results suggest that when addressing individuals with head injuries, both what you say and how you say it are important},

We analyzed data from the WAIS-III/WMS-III standardization sample to resolve these issues. As expected, speed (Digit Symbol-Copy) correlated very strongly with Digit Symbol--Coding. Memory (Digit Symbol--Incidental Learning or WMS-III index scores) correlated more moderately with Digit Symbol-Coding. Even after controlling for variance in Coding explained by Copying, a statistically significant proportion of the residual variance was explicable in terms of memory functions. The contribution of memory to Digit Symbol--Coding, while relatively small, is real. In addition, a small portion of the age-associated decline in Coding scores cannot be accounted for by Copying scores},

One aspect is syntactic modularity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits interaction among syntactic and pragmatic information, so that their syntactic processes are not informationally encapsulated. Another aspect is syntactic ambiguity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits them to maintain multiple interpretations. The theory is instantiated as a production system model in which the amount of activation available to the model affects how it adapts to the transient computational and storage demands that occur in comprehension.},

We review the range of available external memory aids and evidence on their efficacy in clinical settings. Several studies have shown that external memory aids act as effective reminders and improve prospective memory functioning. Computer-based resources and procedures for improving memory functioning include those that serve similar functions to external memory aids, those which present memory tasks as memory retraining exercises, those which instruct the individual in the use of memory strategies, those which directly assist in domain-specific knowledge acquisition, and those which form the basis of "virtual reality" memory rehabilitation procedures. While there may be potential for computer-based procedures, there is at present only limited evidence on their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We outline practical issues relating to the implementation of memory aids in clinical settings. We consider future developments that may impact on the application of external memory aids and computers in the treatment of human memory disorder.},

Three-dimensional records of mandibular movements were obtained by means of the Selspot movement analysis system, which monitors infrared light pulses from light-emitting diodes attached to the test subject. There was no difference in the duration of the total chewing cycle between the two groups. Mandibular velocity was significantly lower in the elderly group, in both the opening and the closing phases. Despite great inter-individual variations, significantly smaller mean vertical displacements of the mandible were found in the elderly than in the younger group. The lateral component in the vertical opening movement was similar for both the elderly and younger subjects. The similar chewing rates in the two groups might imply that the function of the central pattern generator was unaffected by old age. Aging was, however, associated with reduction of vertical mandibular displacement and velocity},

In both age groups, encoding of the four-word memory set elicited ERS in the theta and alpha frequency range. Theta ERS, and ERD in the alpha and beta bands were observed during retrieval. During encoding, the elderly showed greater alpha ERS and smaller theta ERS. During retrieval, smaller alpha ERD and theta ERS was found in the elderly subjects. Also, in the elderly, beta ERD was elicited in the late time window during retrieval. The statistically significant differences between the age groups were more marked during retrieval than during encoding. The results indicate that although the two groups performed equally well behaviorally in the task and the elderly subjects were cognitively intact, normal aging affects oscillatory theta, alpha and beta responses particularly during retrieval from working memory. The ERD/ERS patterns of the elderly resemble those of children found in a recent study, which might suggest that those memory-related brain processes that evolve later in childhood are the first to be affected in older age.

The method was applied to the IDEATel intervention, a multiinstitution randomized controlled trial of the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of a home-based telemedicine system for diabetic Medicare population. The usability study was designed to assess barriers to optimal use of the system. The focus was both on dimensions of the interface and on dimensions of patient skills and competency. The usability field research involved testing 25 patients in their homes using the system. The analysis included a range of video-analytic methods of varying levels of granularity. The usability evaluation revealed aspects of the interface that were suboptimal and impeded the performance of certain tasks. It also found a range of patient-related factors such as numeracy and psychomotor skills that constituted barriers to productive use. A multifaceted usability approach provided important insight regarding use of technology by an elderly chronic-care patient population and more generally, for understanding how home health initiatives can more effectively use such technology},

It is important to identify the differences in interaction for users of differing physical capability, because the border between the labels 'able-bodied' and 'motion-impaired' users is becoming increasingly blurred as the generation of computer users inexorably becomes older and physically less capable. If user models are to retain their relevance, then they have to be able to reflect users' physical capabilities (Stary, 1997). Through empirical studies, this paper will show that there are very important differences between those with motion-impairments, whether elderly or disabled, and able-bodied users when they interact with computers. It attempts to quantify where those differences occur in the interaction cycle with the use of a very straightforward user model, the model human processor (MHP) (Card et al., 1983), which describes interaction purely in terms of perception, cognition and motor component times},

Grammatical complexity initially averaged 4.78 ( on a 0 to 7 point scale) for participants who did not meet criteria for dementia and declined .04 units per year; grammatical complexity for participants who met criteria for dementia initially averaged 3.86 and declined .03 units per year.

This debate concerns which aspects of language processing are vulnerable to working memory limitations, how working memory is best measured, and whether compensatory processes can offset working memory limitations. Age-comparative studies are particularly relevant to this debate for several reasons: difficulties with language and communication are frequently mentioned by older adults and signal the onset of Alzheimer's dementia and other pathologies associated with age; older adults commonly experience working memory limitations that affect their ability to perform everyday activities; the rapid aging of the United States population has forced psychologists and gerontologists to examine the effects of aging on cognition, drawing many investigators to the study of cognitive aging. Older adults constitute ideal population for studying how working memory limitations affect cognitive performance, particularly language and communication. Age-comparative studies of cognitive processes have advanced our understanding of the temporal dynamics of cognition as well as the working memory demands of many types of tasks (Kliegl, Mayr, \& Krampe, 1994; Mayr \& Kliegl, 1993). The research findings reviewed in this volume have clear implications - for addressing the practical problems of older adults as consumers of leisure time-reading, radio and television broadcasts, as targets of medical, legal, and financial documents, and as participants in a web of service agencies and volunteer activities. Older adults are often the recipients of "elderspeak," an insulting and patronizing form of address which is intended to enhance older adults' comprehension (Kemper, 1992; Kemper, Finter- Urczyk, Ferrell, Harden, \& Billington, in press); yet elderspeak, by conveying a sense of disrespect, may offend older adults, reducing intergenerational contact and thereby indirectly contributing to older adults' cognitive and social decline (Ryan, Giles, Bartolucci, \& Henwood, 1986). Effective strategies for enhancing older adults' comprehension must be developed which will minimize processing demands without relying on "baby talk." Broadcasts and texts targeted at older adults must be adapted to slower information processing rates and reduced working memory capacity if older adults are to continue to be informed and engaged. The chapters in this volume examine what is known about memory, aging, and grammar in order to better understand how such constraints affect language and communication. Plan of the Book The contributors to this volume fall into three clusters: (1) Leading cognitive aging researchers with special expertise in language production and comprehension (Kemper, Burke, Kliegl, Stine-Morrow, Waters, Wingfield); (2) Syntactician...},

The declines were most rapid in the mid 70s. For the group with dementia, grammatical complexity and propositional content also declined over time, regardless of age. Rates of decline were uniform across individuals. These analyses reveal how both grammatical complexity and propositional content are related to late-life changes in cognition in healthy older adults aswell as those with dementia. Alzheimer's disease accelerates this decline, regardless of age},

We discuss factor score comparison methods for assessing age-based construct similarity that may be more appropriate for small-scale studies. We then examine these methods for a series of single-factor models of verbal working memory (VWM) based on data from three separate studies in which small samples of younger and older adults' completed VWM-based tasks. Our single-factor models accounted well for the associations among the sets of VWM tasks. This construct was also measured well across age groups and different samples. Our analyses suggest that factor score comparison methods may be useful for small-scale studies that require assessment of age-based measurement similarity in cognitive constructs},

We examined the relationships among age, executive abilities, and psychomotor speed in 40 older adults and 46 young adults. Both verbal and nonverbal tasks were administered that measured 2 aspects of executive ability: set formation and set shifting. Executive and psychomotor speed tasks were paired based on similarities in basic task demands. Our results revealed that poorer executive performance was associated with increasing age. Further, although psychomotor speed attenuated the relationship, age accounted for a unique and significant proportion of variance in executive performance after controlling for psychomotor speed. These results suggest that age has an effect on prefrontally mediated executive abilities that cannot be explained solely in terms of psychomotor slowing},

A user-oriented approach was used to develop a design concept for a memory device for older users. One hundred seniors were interviewed to identify their physical, physiological and cognitive capabilities and limitations, as well as their preferences for memory aid functions. Specific design requirements were gathered from user testing of six currently available memory aids with 30 of the original 100 elderly subjects. The interview and user testing results were consolidated to provide the basis for tradeoff criteria for memory aid interface concepts, and for the development specifications for an optimal interface design for a memory aid designed specifically for the elderly user. A design concept was developed for a medication device that would be easy to use, would reduce the likelihood of scheduling errors, and would be nonthreatening to older users who might otherwise be intimidated by an electronic device. The Phase I effort focused on enhancing medication compliance, which is a priority issue with the senior population},

Results suggest that both young and elderly adults use a computationally less demanding late-closure pal sing strategy whenever possible, but that sentence prosody can override this tendency when an alternative closure position is clearly signaled. Although subtle differences appeal ed in regard to sentence completion strategies and latencies to completion, results suggest that efficient resolution of syntactic boundary uncertainty and effective use of sentence prosody are two features of language comprehension that remain well-preserved in normal aging},

Movements of the lower lip/jaw during speech were recorded from 8 adults with IPD, 8 healthy aged adults, and 8 young adults. The spatiotemporal index (STI), a measure of spatial and temporal variability, revealed that for all speaker groups slow rate was associated with the most variability. Compared to the other conditions, STI values from the loud condition were closest to those from habitual speech. Also, the normalized movement pattern for the loud condition resembled that of habitual speech. It is hypothesized that speaking loudly is associated with a spatial and temporal organization that closely resembles that used in habitual speech, which may contribute to the success of the LSVT},

Young and elderly adult smokers had average smoking histories of 9.3 and 52.0 years, respectively. Significant aging (young > elderly adults) and task (single-task > dual-task) effects were observed for performance accuracy and speed measures as well as for N400/P600 ERP waveform components elicited by 'old/new' wordrecognition and P300 ERP indices elicited by auditory target detection. The effects of smoking history were limited to the P600 component, which showed faster latencies in elderly smokers than elderly nonsmokers and young nonsmokers. Young smokers exhibited longer latencies than young nonsmokers. The results were discussed in relation to normal and pathological cognition in the elderly},

Hemispheric dominance for processing facial expressions of emotions was also examined. There were no consistent group differences in the ability to process emotion presented via the auditory domain (i.e., nonverbal sounds, such as crying or shrieking, and speech prosody). Controls were, however, significantly better than the AD patients in identifying emotions depicted in drawings of emotional situations and in videotaped scenes displaying faces, gestures, and body movements. These differences were maintained after statistically adjusting for the visuospatial abilities of the participants. After a statistical adjustment for abstraction ability, some of the tasks continued to differentiate the groups (e.g., the emotional drawings task, the videotaped displays of faces), but others did not. These results confirm and extend previous results indicating that AD patients do not have a primary deficit in the processing of emotion. They suggest that the difficulties of the AD patients in perceiving emotion are secondary to the cognitive impairments associated with AD},

A spoken dialogue system with an autonomous robot should deal with the utterances which contain redundant words and abbreviation of words. This paper describes a spoken dialogue system based on semantic frames. Each semantic frame corresponds to a single task, and has several slots and an utterance generation rule. The system can process an utterance from five kinds of tasks. Based on the candidate likelihood, the system identifies the kind of task and then recognizes a phrase for each slot},

Covariance analysis based data analysis strategies have been introduced more recently which allow functional interactions between brain regions of a neuronal network to be assessed. This contribution focuses on studies aiming to (1) establish the functional topography of episodic and working memory processes in young and old normal volunteers. (2) to assess functional interactions between modules of networks of brain regions by means of covariance based analyses and systems level modelling, (3) to characterise the temporal dynamics by the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and (4) to relate neuroimaging data to the underpinning neural networks. Male normal young and old volunteers without neurological or psychiatric illness participated in neuroimaging studies (PET, fMRI, MEG). Studies were approved by the ethical committee and federal authorities. Our results in young volunteers show distributed brain areas that are involved in memory processes (episodic and working memory) and show much of an overlap with respect to the network components. Systems level modelling analyses support the hypothesis of bihemispheric, asymmetric networks subserving memory processes and revealed both similarities in general and differences in the interactions between brain regions during episodic encoding and retrieval as well as working memory. Changes in memory function with ageing are evident from functional topographic studies in old volunteers activating more brain regions as compared to young volunteers. There are more and stronger influences of prefrontal regions in elderly volunteers comparing the functional models between old and young subjects. We discuss the way that the systems level models of the PET and fMRI results have implications for the underlying neural network functioning of the brain. This is done by developing simplifying assumptions, which lead from the equations describing the activities of the coupled neural modules to the systems level model equations. The resulting implications for the neural interactions are then discussed, in terms of a set of synaptically coupled neural modules. Finally, we consider how a similar analysis could be extended from the spatial to the temporal domain thus including the EEG and MEG results. The implication of preliminary MEG results presented here for the temporality arising in the interaction between the coupled neural modules in a working memory paradigm is discussed in terms of the previously developed neural network models arising from the PET and fMRI data.

Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases were conducted to find controlled clinical studies of automated phone messaging used in patient care. Studies were selected based on the three criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials or controlled trials; 2) patients receiving health core related education, information, advice or reminder for a specific action to be taken in their home setting; and 3) use of automated computer-based phone technology to deliver the messages. Information abstracted from studies included information about the institution, persons targeted, intervention and its effect on health outcomes, costs and acceptance by patients and caregivers. Results: A total of nineteen studies were identified for review. Sixteen studies were randomized controlled trials and three were controlled studies with no randomization. Studies were placed in two categories, preventive care education and chronic care studies. Preventive care education studies covered childhood immunizations, medication compliance, influenza vaccinations, tuberculosis and health prevention activities and chronic care studies were related to cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. More than 80\% of studies showed significant impact upon measurable health outcomes. Conclusions: Controlled evidence substantiates the efficacy of automated telephone communication in improving the quality of care. Educational voice messages are acceptable to patients and represent an important opportunity to enhance telemedicine and telehealth applications.},

All Europeans are to be reached by the benefits that increasing application of information society technology (IST) potentially offers, and not just the digitally literate possessing easy access to services and devices respectively. This concerns not at least older citizens as they merely lack the opportunity to gain experiences with ICT within a working or educational context. Moreover, the prevalence of functional restrictions impeding access to mainstream applications such as the Internet tends to increase with growing age. Against this background, the SeniorWatch project addresses the need to better understand and monitor market dynamics of IST applications targeted towards older (and older disabled) citizens. Information is gathered through an innovative, integrative approach including Europe-wide representative surveys (10,000 older citizens aged 50+ and 500 decision makers of the care sector in all Member States, both based on random sampling), country reports (all Member States, USA, Japan, Norway), leading edge case studies and industry-lead technology analyses. This contribution presents a first analysis of survey data as far as they concern accessibility-related issues. The prevalence of selected functional restrictions impeding access to IST-related mainstream products and services is surveyed. Data on the propensity on using mainstream applications are gathered and related to functional abilities and perceived problems in handling IST devices and services. Finally, the foreseeable market potential for IST-related products and services is assessed},

Although older users significantly rated their computer and Internet experience lower than younger participants, experience did not alter the significance of age and hierarchy differences},

The rehearsal and retrieval of time-based tasks was mediated by more automatic than deliberate self-initiated processes. Moreover, the number of reported rehearsals without any apparent triggers was reliably higher in time- than in event-based tasks.

A reanalysis of the word repetitions revealed that older adults' word durations and inter-word pauses are longer than young adults'},

The stimuli were digitally manipulated to create synthesized, band-pass filtered (F0-range and F2/F3-range) and re-entrant (pitch only version of stimulus is convolved with a steady-state signal) conditions. Results of a forced-choice discrimination paradigm showed that, in general, performance is remarkably robust despite spectral manipulation, even when there is relatively little spectral information. However, performance was significantly degraded in the low band-pass and re-entrant conditions. These observations are discussed in light of the relevance of the fundamental frequency as well as syllabification for the analysis of prosodic information},

We administered prefrontal measures to healthy younger (n = 23; age = 28.4 +/- 5.9, education 15.7 +/- 2.6, MMSE = 29.5 +/- 0.6) and older participants (n = 20; age = 69.1 +/- 5.0, education = 15.5 +/- 3.4, MMSE 28.9 +/- 1.5). Groups did not differ on education or mental status, P > 0.05. Tasks thought to involve greater OFC processing included the Iowa Gambling Task and Delayed Match and Non-Match to Sample Tasks. Tasks requiring greater DLPFC processing included Petrides' Self-Ordered Pointing, WAIS-R Digit Span Backward, Letter Fluency, and Months Backward from the Boston Revision of WMS-Mental Control. Composite z-scores were calculated for OFC and DLPFC tasks. A 2 x 2 ANOVA revealed a Group x Task interaction: F(1, 41) = 5.55, P = 0.02, and a Group main effect: F(1, 41) = 12.16, P = 0.001. Follow-up analyses revealed younger adults outperformed older adults on OFC tasks only (younger = 0.37 +/- 0.46, older = -0.43 +/- 0.70; t(41) = 4.5, P < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses of individual tasks confirmed that despite age differences on Petrides' Self-Ordered Pointing, measures requiring relatively greater OFC involvement showed larger effect sizes for age differences. Thus, tasks emphasizing OFC functions appear more sensitive to age effects when directly compared to measures of DLPFC functioning. Reasons for this difference in magnitude may stem from differential aging of prefrontal cortex or differential recruitment of alternative brain regions for successful task completion.

   abstract = {Our understanding of the ways in which changes in specific neural systems mediate adult age differences in memory is rapidly increasing, due in no small part to the advent of functional neuroimaging techniques. This article reviews age-related changes in memory performance obtained with behavioral measures, describes models of the neural mechanisms of memory, and derives predictions from these models regarding age-related changes in brain activation patterns. The neuroimaging findings obtained to date support models emphasizing the role of prefrontal cortex in age-related changes in memory functioning, especially for episodic memory retrieval. In general, neural activation associated with episodic memory encoding is regionally similar for younger and older adults but relatively lower in magnitude for older adults. During retrieval, activation that is restricted to the right prefrontal cortex for younger adults is more likely to be bilateral for older adults. Prefrontal activation exhibits an age-related increase when working memory tasks require simple storage and an age-related decrease when working memory requires higher-level executive processes. Although the evidence is limited, behavioral performance and activation patterns appear to be similar among younger and older adults on tests of semantic (context-independent) and implicit memory. We conclude that several methodological issues, such as defining the relation between brain structure and function, and determining the relationship between performance and activation, are particularly important for understanding age-related changes. Future directions for aging research include further investigation of the relation between encoding and retrieval and the identification of both spared and impaired neural systems. Microsc. Res.

   abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, immediate serial verbal recall is impaired by irrelevant speech, articulatory suppression, and syncopated tapping. Interpretation of these variables in terms of the phonological loop component of working memory assumes separate phonological storage and articulatory rehearsal processes. In contrast, the Object-Oriented Episodic Record (O-OER) of Jones and the feature theory of Neath interpret these and other phenomena in terms of a unitary multimodal system. Three experiments investigate these disrupting tasks, with each experiment emphasizing one parameter. In each case, recall of phonologically similar and dissimilar letter sequences is compared as a marker of the presence or absence of phonological coding. In Experiment 1, subjects heard or articulated a single item, or tapped a single key at equal intervals. Only articulatory suppression impaired performance; it also abolished the effects of phonological similarity. Experiment 2 was identical, except that items were heard, or generated in a syncopated rhythm. Both suppression and tapping impaired performance to an equivalent extent and obliterated the effect of phonological similarity. Syncopated irrelevant speech caused a modest but significant impairment in performance. Experiment 3 was identical to Experiment 1, except that six tokens were used. Irrelevant speech and tapping had a clear impact on recall, but neither removed the phonological similarity effect. Again articulatory suppression had a major impact on performance and removed the effect of phonological similarity. We conclude that the pattern of results readily fits the phonological loop hypothesis, provided one accepts Saitos proposal that generating syncopated sequences uses common processes with speech production. It is not clear how the results can be explained by either the O-OER or the feature hypothesis},

Although a majority of speakers yielded age estimates consistent with the conditions of intended disguise, the differences in listeners' estimates among all three conditions were relatively small. Moreover, differences between speakers' actual ages and listeners' age estimates in the control condition were also small. Implications of the findings and suggestions for research are discussed},

The test involved switching repeatedly between four tasks (block construction, bead threading, paper folding, alphabetical searching) over a 10 min period. In Experiment 1, there were four groups of 20 healthy participants. One group attempted multitasking with no interruption, a second group was interrupted early in the test, a third group late in the test and a fourth group was interrupted both early and late. Interruption involved carrying out a fifth, unexpected task for a period of 1 min before returning to the four main tasks. There was no difference in multitasking performance between the groups. In Experiment 2 the participants were seven dysexecutive patients and 14 age-matched controls. A repeated measures approach was employed to assess the impact of two interruptions (early and late) for both groups. Contrary to predictions, the patients as well as controls were resistant to the effects of interruptions, despite their clearly impaired multitasking performance. These results suggest that the ability to deal with interruptions may be separable from the ability to organise and execute multiple tasks within a limited time frame},

The study included 24 drivers between the ages of 18 and 24 years. A baseline condition with no e-mail system was compared with a simple and a complex e-mail system in both simple and complex driving environments. The results show a 30\% (310 ms) increase in reaction time when the speech-based system is used. Subjective workload ratings and probe questions also indicate that speech- based interaction introduces a significant cognitive load, which was highest for the complex e-mail system. These data show that a speech-based interface is not a panacea that eliminates the potential distraction of in-vehicle computers. Actual or potential applications of this research include design of in-vehicle information systems and evaluation of their contributions to driver distraction},

It is therefore of utmost important to understand how normal ageing process impacts upon prose memory so as to gain insight into ways to differentiate pathological vs normal age-related changes of the recall of prose observed among older people. Objectives To understand the differential age-related change of prose memory in older Hong Kong Chinese of higher and lower education. Method Forty-eight normal, healthy Cantonese-speaking Chinese were recruited. Seventeen of them were younger, highly educated participants. Among the 31 older people recruited, 19 of them received education comparable with the younger participants and 12 were older people of low education. A prose passage was constructed to measure the different processes of prose memory, including learning efficiency, rate of forgetting, recall accuracy, accuracy of temporal sequence of information recalled, distortions, and recognition memory. Results As expected, ageing affected all the processes of prose memory measured, except the rate of forgetting. Apart from learning efficiency and rate of forgetting, education was observed to modify the effect of ageing on all the processes studied. Conclusions Changes of prose memory associated with ageing and the differential effect of education on prose recall among older people were discussed. The findings seem to suggest that prose memory is a multifaceted construct. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd},

This randomized, controlled trial was designed to evaluate the impact of a system that provides uniquely formatted laboratory results to patients with CVD on their changes in LDL-C levels. Methods: Eighty patients with CVD were randomized to receive standard care or the intervention inclusive of a computer-generated, 11' x 17' color poster depicting an individual's LDL-C status and goals along with personalized steps to aid in goal achievement. Cholesterol profiles were obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment. Physicians received standard laboratory reports and were blinded to the randomization. Results: There were no significant differences between patient groups in age, education level, race, baseline cholesterol levels, comorbidities, or percentage of patients in each group who met their NCEP goal at baseline. Patients receiving intervention tools had significant reductions in LDL-C from baseline compared with patients in the control group. Intervention patients who did not meet NCEP goals at baseline had the greatest reduction in LDL-C, with a mean change from baseline of -21.5 mg/dL (P < 0.001) whereas standard care patients had no significant change in the LDL-C levels (-4.6 mg/dL, P = 0.28). At study close, 73\% of intervention patients reported that their posters remained displayed on their refrigerator. Conclusion: This unique and personalized intervention resulted in the LDL-C lowering benefit among patients with CVD comparable to that of lipid lowering agents.},

   year = {2000},
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship of specific motor impairment in idiopathic PD to incident dementia. BACKGROUND: The total Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score at baseline has been associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in PD. METHODS: A cohort of 214 nondemented community-dwelling patients with PD was followed annually with neurologic and neuropsychological evaluations. The association of baseline motor impairment with incident dementia was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Facial expression, tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia were analyzed as part of subscore A (indicative of dopaminergic deficiency); speech and axial impairment were analyzed as part of subscore B (indicative of predominantly nondopaminergic deficiency). The correlation between the six motor domains and age was also analyzed. RESULTS: Of 173 patients followed for at least 1 year, 50 became demented according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition (DSM III-R) criteria (mean follow-up, 3.6 +/- 2. 2 years). When both subscores A and B were entered into the Cox model, subscore B was associated with incident dementia (relative risk = 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.09 to 1.30; p = 0.0001), in addition to gender, age, and education, whereas subscore A was not (relative risk = 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.99 to 1.07; p = 0.19). Of the six motor domains, speech and bradykinesia were associated with incident dementia (p < 0.05), and axial impairment approached significance (p = 0.06). Only axial impairment was correlated with age (correlation coefficient = 0.32; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that motor impairment mediated predominantly by nondopaminergic systems is associated with incident dementia in PD. Axial impairment may be the result of a combined effect of the disease and the aging process},

   abstract = {Background: While age-related increases of between-person variability in a variety of cognitive measures are commonly reported in cross-sectional studies, the nature of short-term intraindividual fluctuation in elderly people's performance is relatively unexplored. Objective: The goal of the present study is to examine short-term fluctuations in elderly people's sensorimotor functioning and their relations to individual differences in verbal and spatial memory. Methods: Fluctuations in old adults' (mean = 75.71 years, SD = 6.93 years) sensorimotor performance were investigated by biweekly measurements spanning approximately 7 months. Sensorimotor performance was measured by three walking tasks, including the du ration a nd the nu m ber of steps ta ken to wa Ik a 360-degree circle and to walk in feet both at normal and fast pace. Performances of verbal and spatial memory were assessed by weekly measurements of digit memory span, memory for short text and spatial recognition. Results: The magnitude of intraindividual fluctuation in most sensorimotor and memory tasks examined was at least half as great as the level of individual differences across persons. In addition, intraindividual fluctuation in sensorimotor performance is a relatively stable individual attribute, which correlates positively with age and negatively with the levels of sensorimotor, text and spatial memory performance. Although a substantial amount of individual differences in intraindividual fluctuation was shared with mean performance level, variance component and hierarchical regression analyses showed that intraindividual fluctuation in walking steps added significant independent contribution over and above that given by level of performance in predicting text and spatial memory. Conclusion: Taking these results together, we suggest that intraindividual fluctuations in elderly people's performance should not be ignored or simply treated as measurement error; rather, they are potentially important empirical variables for understanding sensory and cognitive aging and the nature of intraindividual response variations in general.

Two commonly used text topologies, hierarchical and referential, were constructed with HTML. Twelve subjects whose ages ranged from 57 to 67 participated in an experiment where each of the two topological treatments received six subjects at random. The results showed that for older adults, hypertext with a hierarchical topology was superior to its referential counterpart in terms of browsing and navigation efficiency. The implications for design of hypertext systems/interface fit for the aged are discussed},

   year = {2001},
   abstract = {The countries of the European Union generally want to enhance self-support for the elderly and disabled and consequently strive for accessibility of `mainstream' Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for these inhabitants. The `universal accessibility' approach is advocated as a possibility to include all user groups in the software development process. The European Union supports research in this area, for example by funding the project Assessing the Awareness of the Design for All Approach (AADAA consortium, 1998). However, the `universal accessibility' approach is not as widely spread in the design community, as it should be. Several reasons have been identified. First, the phenomenon that `universal accessibility' products are perceived as dull by the designers creates serious problems for the acceptance of the `universal accessibility' paradigm. This might, however, be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Second, the cost of involving elderly and disabled users in software development can be higher than for involving the rest of the population. On the other hand, a broader perspective comprises also the advantages of the `universal accessibility' approach: The involvement of elderly in the design process often results in better products for all kind of users so that the overall utility of this approach is high. Furthermore, the number of potential users of the `universal accessible' product also increases so it might very well be a good investment. Third, the extra constraints on design possibilities are another objection. However, it could be that the constraints force the designers to be creative, bringing about new ideas that, enrich the total design space. In sum, the three problems of dullness, design costs and design constraints can be solved by evoking positive attitudes, widened cost-benefit analyses and creative design solutions. However, to realise `universal accessibility', the corresponding human factors knowledge should be incorporated into the design practice. Currently, designers take insufficiently account of human-factors knowledge on elderly and disabled. This paper provides a cognitive engineering approach to solve this problem},

The adoption of speech as the dominant mode of IHS-user interaction is also supported by the Milleniurn Homes System, an IHS currently being developed at Brunel University in the UK. However, due to IHS novelty, little research has been conducted into dialogue design for IHS speech output.

Elderly men demonstrated significantly higher spectral amplitude levels than young men at 160 Hz, as well as significantly lower levels at 1600 Hz.

Multiple regression analysis revealed that older age judgments based on phonated vowels were significantly associated with higher fundamental frequency standard deviation values and lower mean fundamental frequency values. Older age judgments based on whispered vowels were significantly associated with lower F1 frequencies.

Findings that women demonstrate more substantial lowering of spectral peaks with aging than men suggest that women may undergo more pronounced age-related lengthening of the supraglottic vocal tract. Alternatively, it is possible that elderly men systematically alter tongue position during vowel articulation while elderly women are less inclined to do so. Taken in conjunction with previous research, these findings suggest a "mixed model" of vocal tract resonance changes with aging in which an interaction exists between gender, the resonance effects of laryngeal lowering, and vowel articulatory patterns},

Fourteen veterans 87 to 93 years old served as subjects, producing a total of 40 sentences at a conversational rate. Wide-band (300 Hz) spectrograms were created from high-quality tape recordings. Specified acoustic measures were made (consonant, vowel, and voice-onset time durations; and vowel formant frequencies and trajectory slopes) via digitizer and microcomputer Sonogram Analyzer program. Descriptive analysis of the selected measurements was performed to obtain a profile of speech production behavior for these subjects. Data were also compared to those of the young adult, Parkinson's disease patients, and younger elderly subjects studied by Weismer (1984a) and Weismer, Kimelman, and Gorman (1985). Performance of the older subjects was similar to that of the younger elderly in many cases, but in certain cases bore notable similarities to Parkinsonian speech.

The participants completed 1-9 test sessions over 1-10 years. Duration of PD was associated with deteriorating performance on most cognitive tests, independent of age-related decline. Severity of motor impairment, indexed by Hoehn and Yahr stages, was positively related to impairment on almost all cognitive tests, holding age and duration constant. For some tests, especially those that were motorically demanding and those that assessed language skills, cognitive deficits appeared earlier in the disease course for late-onset than for early-onset PD patients. These late onset deficits were synergistic effects beyond the additive contributions of disease duration and normal aging. These findings may assist physicians in advising PD patients and their families about the future course of the illness},

Two sets of long- and short-duration words were selected, in each case maximizing duration differences but matching for frequency, familiarity, phonological similarity, and number of phonemes, and controlling for semantic associations. Serial recall measures were obtained using auditory and visual presentation and spoken and picture-pointing recall. In Experiments 1a and 1b, using the first set of items, long words were better recalled than short words. In Experiments 2a and 2b, using the second set of items, no difference was found between long and short disyllabic words. Experiment 3 confirmed the large advantage for short-duration words in the word set originally selected by Baddeley, Thomson, and Buchanan (1975). These findings suggest that there is no reliable advantage for short-duration disyllables in span tasks, and that previous accounts of a word-length effect in disyllables are based on accidental differences between list items. The failure to find an effect of word duration casts doubt on theories that propose that the capacity of memory span is determined by the duration of list items or the decay rate of phonological information in short-term memory},

However, other error types remained constant or increased with aging.

STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of the lamina propria of the vocal fold obtained from human cadavers. METHODS: The Picrosirius-polarization method was used to visualize collagen fibers. RESULTS: Analysis of 20 human vocal folds by the Picrosirius-polarization method permitted the visualization of two fiber populations arranged in three layers in the lamina propria: two layers of thick, strongly birefringent collagen fibers (collagen type I), one immediately below the epithelium and another more dense layer in the deep region superficially to the vocal muscle, penetrating between muscle fibers. The third layer consisted of fine, weakly birefringent fibers (collagen type III) located between the two layers of thick fibers. In addition, the collagen fibers in the lamina propria showed an intertwined network arrangement in the form of a "wicker basket." CONCLUSIONS: This basket-like configuration better explains how the vocal fold is able to stretch even though it contains nonstretchable fibers and to modulate the frequency of the voice under the action of the intrinsic musculature of the larynx. Segmental areas of disarray of the basket-like structure of the collagen layers were systematically observed in older patients. Thus, it is possible that vocal alterations occurring in the elderly might be the result of a loss of histoarchitectural arrangement of the collagen system and its relationship with the lamina propria and underlying musculature},

Design and Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled study of 100 caregivers, 51 in the usual care control group and 49 in the technology intervention group, who received yearlong access to an IVR-mediated system. The system provided caregiver stress monitoring and counseling information, personal voice-mail linkage to AD experts, a voice-mail telephone support group, and a disteaction call for care recipients. We conducted analyses by using a repeated measures approach for longitudinal data and an intention-to-treat analytic approach. Outcomes included the caregiver's appraisal of the bothersome nature of caregiving, anxiety, depression, and mastery at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results: There was a significant intervention effect as hypothesized for participants with lower mastery at baseline on all three outcomes: bother (p =.04), anxiety (p =.01), and depression (p =.007). Additionally, wives exhibited a significant intervention effect in the reduction of the bothersome nature of caregiving (p =.02). Implications: Wives who exhibited low mastery and high anxiety benefited the most from the automated telecare intervention. Findings suggest that, to optimize outcome effects, similar interventions should be tailored to match the users' characteristics and preferences.},

The latter served as a control domain. Item difficulty was equated across age groups in each domain. In spite of this age equivalence in actual performance, differences were found in FOK and CL ratings for computers but not for general knowledge, with older people being less confident than young people in their own computer knowledge. The greater age difference in ratings observed in the computer domain, as compared with the general domain, was even greater for the FOK than for the CL judgments. Statistical control of age differences in global self-efficacy beliefs in the computer domain (poorer in the older participants, but not in the general domain), eliminated age differences in FOK and CL judgments in the same domain. These findings confirm earlier ones. They suggest that underconfidence in their relevant abilities is one possible source of the difficulties that the elderly may encounter in mastering new computer technologies},

The most important influence on performance was how subjects chose to remember to make the telephone calls. The best performance was from subjects who telephoned either in conjunction with another routine event or engaged in some form of advanced planning of the daily schedule. The worst performance was from those who relied on internal cues from their own memory. Performance was intermediate from those who used external cues such as notes or diary entries. Subjects in the between condition were less likely to choose internal cues than those in the exact condition, possibly because the task appeared more difficult, and this resulted in their showing superior performance. The effect of age was influenced by the cue used. For subjects using internal cues, those who forgot were older than those who remembered, whereas for subjects using the other cues, those who forgot were younger than those who remembered. Regardless of cue, self-ratings of cognitive failures were related to performance such that those who reported more minor everyday mistakes were indeed more likely to forget to telephone. While there was some indirect effect of general intelligence on performance in the task, there was no relationship between retrospective memory scores and whether or not subjects remembered to telephone},

Forgetting was predicted by age, even after a composite measure of general ability was included in the regression. Recovery was related to general ability alone.

Again, there were differences in PM performance between young and older participants, and between older participants and AD patients. The observed deficits were not due to the forgetting of the PM task instructions in either experiment.

   abstract = {Asperger's syndrome (an autistic disorder) is characterized by stereotyped and obsessional behaviours, and pervasive abnormalities in socio-emotional and communicative behaviour. These symptoms lead to social exclusion and a significant healthcare burden; however, their neurobiological basis is poorly understood. There are few studies on brain anatomy of Asperger's syndrome, and no focal anatomical abnormality has been reliably reported from brain imaging studies of autism, although there is increasing evidence for differences in limbic circuits. These brain regions are important in sensorimotor gating, and impaired 'gating' may partly explain the failure of people with autistic disorders to inhibit repetitive thoughts and actions. Thus, we compared brain anatomy and sensorimotor gating in healthy people with Asperger's syndrome and controls. We included 21 adults with Asperger's syndrome and 24 controls. All had normal IQ and were aged 18-49 years. We studied brain anatomy using quantitative MRI, and sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition of startle in a subset of 12 individuals with Asperger's syndrome and 14 controls. We found significant age-related differences in volume of cerebral hemispheres and caudate nuclei (controls, but not people with Asperger's syndrome, had age-related reductions in volume). Also, people with Asperger's syndrome had significantly less grey matter in fronto-striatal and cerebellar regions than controls, and widespread differences in white matter. Moreover, sensorimotor gating was significantly impaired in Asperger's syndrome. People with Asperger's syndrome most likely have generalized alterations in brain development, but this is associated with significant differences from controls in the anatomy and function of specific brain regions implicated in behaviours characterizing the disorder. We hypothesize that Asperger's syndrome is associated with abnormalities in fronto-striatal pathways resulting in defective sensorimotor gating, and consequently characteristic difficulties inhibiting repetitive thoughts, speech and actions},

Accounting for lower level speed and storage, however, removed essentially the entire age effect, suggesting that both functions play important and independent roles.

In all experiments, subjects were asked to perform an action when a target item later occurred. When the semantic context changed from encoding to test, prospective memory significantly declined (Experiment 1). When the target event (the item, which in its subsequent appearance in the experiment was the signal to perform the action) was presented as word (relative to picture presentation, Experiment 2) or was encoded nonsemantically (relative to semantic encoding, Experiment 3), there was a decline in prospective memory performance. Dividing attention during prospective memory retrieval substantially reduced prospective memory performance (Experiment 3). The results of this research indicated that prospective memory is largely conceptually driven, and it behaves more similarly to direct rather than indirect conceptual tests. We suggest that prospective remembering of the type studied here is mediated by a reflexive episodic associative memory system as proposed by Moscovitch (1994)},

The present study was conducted to investigate the possibility that age differences in dual-task performance are amplified by an increase in the difficulty of the constituent tasks, where difficulty was manipulated by varying the central, cognitive nature of the tasks (Experiment 1) or the degree of choice involved (Experiment 2). With the present tasks, strong evidence was found for an age-related decrement in divided attention performance. Contrary to our original expectations, however, it does not seem that division of attention presents some especial difficulty to older people. Rather, division of attention is one of several equivalent ways to increase overall task complexity. In turn, age differences are exaggerated as tasks are made more complex},

METHODS: Measures of force generation were obtained for the upper lip, lower lip, tongue, and jaw. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences among age groups, probably because of large individual variability within groups. Trends indicated a decline, particularly after age 80 years. CONCLUSION: Although trends in the data suggest some decline in the function of orofacial structures with age, it is unlikely that these changes would noticeably affect functional communication},

Patients with DAT corrected only 24\% of their total errors and patients with PD only 25\%. Healthy subjects, by contrast, corrected from 72 to 92\% of their total errors. Patients with DAT tended to rely on reformulation repairs while patients with PD used both repair types about equally often. While healthy elderly Ss (in the 70s group) utilized lemma repairs more often than the reformulation strategy, all other healthy Ss used both strategies about equally often. Across all groups naming performance correlated negatively with numbers of undetected errors. Results point to a previously unrecognized communication disorder associated with PD and DAT and manifested by an impairment in the ability to correct output errors. This impairment may be related to attentional and frontal dysfunction in the two patient groups},

In the present study, behavioral laterality indices of emotional prosodic and traditional linguistic speech functions were obtained for a sample of healthy young adults, using the dichotic listening method. After screening for adequate emotional prosody and linguistic recognition abilities, participants completed the Fused Rhymed Words Test (FRWT; Wexler \& Halwes, 1983) and the Dichotic Emotion Recognition Test (DERT; McNeely \& Netley, 1998). Examination of the difference in ear asymmetries for these measures within individuals revealed a complementary pattern in 78\% of the sample. However, the correlation between laterality quotients for the FRWT and DERT was near zero, supporting Bryden's model of "statistical" complementarity (e.g., Bryden, 1990)},

We assessed the frontal function (working memory, word fluency, Trail-Making Tests, CASI subitems of list-gene rating fluency, attention, and concentration/mental manipulation), language function (proverbs. CASI subitem language), non-language function (the digit symbol test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), CASI subitem visual construction), memory (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale recall/recognition, story recall, CASI subitems short and long-term memory, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test), and the global function (CASI subitems orientation and abstraction and judgment). We found that the only test affected by age was the digit symbol test of the WAIS-R. The effects of education were distributed among various tests. There was a significant correlation between age and the frontal lobe atrophy in the lower educated group. The present findings suggest that cognitive function is spared by the aging process itself and dementia should be considered as age-related, not aging-related disorders, and that education might have a protective effect on cognitive change, supporting the reserve hypothesis},

One factor that may contribute to this is deterioration in the ability to process the dynamic components of speech such as formant transitions. The frequency-modulated (FM) sweep is a useful stimulus for investigating the neural basis of temporal processing speed since it has features in common with formant transitions. Previously, we showed that when cells in the auditory cortex of aged animals were presented with FM sweeps, they exhibited a decrease in temporal processing speed when compared to cells recorded from young animals. However, this was not the case for cells in the inferior colliculus (IC) where neural responses did not appear to be affected by aging. One question that remains is how the auditory thalamus is affected by aging: Is it similar to that of the auditory cortex or of the IC. To this end, single units were recorded from the ventral division of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGNv) of young and aged anaesthetized rats in response to FM sweeps. Results showed that there were no age-related differences in speed or direction selectivity of FM sweep responses in the MGNv. When compared with units recorded from the IC and AI, the responses of MGNv neurons were similar to those of the IC. This suggests that temporal processing speed is affected by aging in the cortex, but not in the auditory thalamus or midbrain},

One factor that may contribute to this is a deterioration in the ability to process dynamic aspects of speech such as formant transitions.

The primary goal of this study was to explore the neural basis of the effects of aging on temporal processing speed. To this end, single units were recorded from the auditory cortex of young and aged rats in response to frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps that changed from trial to trial in both direction and speed. Results showed that the majority of cells recorded from young rats responded most vigorously to fast and medium speeds. By contrast, the majority of units recorded from aged animals responded best to slow speeds. For preferred direction of FM sweep, similar results were observed for both age groups, namely, approximately half of the units exhibited a direction-selective response. The results of the present study demonstrate an age-related decrease in the rate of change of frequency that can be processed by the auditory cortex},

Virtually all empirical research on working memory involves investigations of working memory for verbal and visual information.

This study examined age differences in working memory for emotional versus visual information. Findings demonstrate that, despite an age-related deficit for the latter, working memory for emotion was unimpaired. Further, older adults exhibited superior performance on positive relative to negative emotion trials, whereas their younger counterparts exhibited the opposite pattern.

Here we used fMRI measures of neural activity during performance of the color-word Stroop task to compare the neural substrates of attentional control in younger (ages: 21-27 years old) and older participants (ages: 60-75 years old) during conditions of both increased competition (incongruent and congruent neutral) and increased conflict (incongruent and congruent neutral). We found evidence of age-related decreases in the responsiveness of structures thought to support attentional control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices), suggesting possible impairments in the implementation of attentional control in older participants. Consistent with this notion, older participants exhibited more extensive activation of ventral visual processing regions (i.e., temporal cortex) and anterior inferior prefrontal cortices, reflecting a decreased ability to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant information. Also, the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in evaluatory processes at the level of response (e.g., detecting potential for error), showed age-related increases in its sensitivity to the presence of competing color information. These findings are discussed in terms of newly emerging models of attentional control in the human brain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)},

LK readers, particularly those who produced high levels of recall, spent differentially more time at intrasentence and sentence boundaries suggesting that they allocated more processing resources to consolidate the concepts in the seemingly disjointed text. HK readers, on the other hand showed facilitation in this organizational processing. These beneficial effects were more pronounced for elderly readers than for younger readers, suggesting that older readers take special advantage of knowledge in the on-line processing of discourse.

A listening test was carried out for JNAS and S-JNAS databases where subjects were asked to estimate each speaker's age subjectively and judge whether the subjects should take special care with their speaking styles when talking to the speakers. Secondly, a series of experiments were carried out to automatically identify the subjectively-defined elderly speakers. In the first experiment, GMM-based speaker recognition techniques were used and 91\% accuracy was obtained. Through experimental examinations of various prosodic features, speech rate and local power perturbation were added to GMM-based identification in the second experiment. The performance rose to 95\%. Finally, a method was also devised to estimate a speaker's aged using the proposed techniques. A rather high correlation between the age estimated by the method and that obtained by the subjective listening test indicates the validity of the method},

While few have experienced overt or brutal ageism, interaction in everyday life involves some negative treatment, occasional positive 'sageism', and others 'keeping watch' for one's vulnerabilities. Health professionals are a major source of ageist treatment. Some older people limit their lives by accommodating ageism, while others actively negotiate new images of ageing for themselves and those who will be old in the future},

Both age groups displayed a PNwm component during the two working memory tasks. For the 1-back task, densities were similar in both young and elderly individuals. In contrast, PNwm densities increased with higher memory load (2-back>1-back) in the younger but not in the older group. This difference was mainly observed over parietal electrodes suggesting an impaired activation of neural generators within this brain region.

The main aim of this study was to use bold contrast fMRI to clarify the normal functional neuroanatomy of emotional prosody, in passive and active contexts. Subjects performed six separate scanning studies, within which two different conditions were contrasted: (1) "pure" emotional prosody versus rest; (2) congruent emotional prosody versus 'neutral' sentences; (3) congruent emotional prosody versus rest; (4) incongruent emotional prosody versus rest; (5) congruent versus incongruent emotional prosody; and (6) an active experiment in which subjects were instructed to either attend to the emotion conveyed by semantic content or that conveyed by tone of voice. Data resulting from these contrasts were analysed using SPM99. Passive listening to emotional prosody consistently activated the lateral temporal lobe (superior and/or middle temporal gyri). This temporal lobe response was relatively right-lateralised with or without semantic information. Both the separate and direct comparisons of congruent and incongruent emotional prosody revealed that subjects used fewer brain regions to process incongruent emotional prosody than congruent. The neural response to attention to semantics, was left lateralised, and recruited an extensive network not activated by attention to emotional prosody.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for their deficits: (i) a speech-specific failure in phonological representation and (ii) a general deficit in auditory ''temporal processing,'' such that they cannot easily perceive the rapid spectral changes of formant transitions at the onset of stop-vowel syllables. To test these hypotheses, two groups of second-grade children (20 ''good readers,'' 20 ''poor readers''), matched forage and intelligence, were selected to differ significantly on a /ba/-/da/ temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, said to be diagnostic of a temporal processing deficit. Three experiments then showed that the groups did not differ in: (i) TOJ when /ba/ and /da/ were paired with more easily discriminated syllables (/ba/-/sa/, /da/-/integral a/); (ii) discriminating nonspeech sine wave analogs of the second and third formants of /ba/ and /da/; (iii) sensitivity to brief transitional cues varying along a synthetic speech continuum. Thus, poor readers' difficulties with /ba/-/da/ reflected perceptual confusion between phonetically similar, though phonologically contrastive, syllables rather than difficulty in perceiving rapid spectral changes. The results are consistent with a speech-specific, not a general auditory, deficit. (C) 1997 Academic Press},

In this chapter, we describe our research activity on the integration of a robotic arm in the environment of disabled people who have lost the abilities to use their proper arms to perform daily living tasks and who are able to use an adapted robot to compensate, even partly, the problems of manipulation in their environments. To develop a human friendly interface it is necessary to act on the system itself to make it more flexible and easy to use. Improvement of assistive robot's functionalities must comply with users environment which is composed of several assistive aids complementary to the robot. To meet this target we should have a consistent knowledge on users' needs and taking into account their specific types of disability, their restricted possibilities, and also their acceptation level of technologies. This requires multidisciplinary competencies on several research areas, such as computer sciences, networking, robotics, home automation, and also on ergonomic to provide standardized functionalities which allow efficient usability of assistive technological aids. This chapter describes the adaptation software architecture developed for an assistive robotic arm, called Manus manipulator, in the context of smart homes where the robot is considered as an object among the others},

Functional misuses of laryngeal muscles come into play when patients try to compensate for these changes. The etiology of dysphonia in the elderly gets even more confusing when psychological factors such as loneliness and depression add their effects to laryngeal muscle misuse. Laryngeal cancer is still probably the most common cause of hoarseness in older persons. Unfortunately the biopsy to rule out cancer in a person who is hoarse from degenerative or functional causes will often greatly worsen the dysphonia and render voice therapy less effective},

In a separate task, participants also recalled medication instructions (with or without the icon) after a study period. We found that questions about dose and rime information were answered more quickly and accurately when the icon was present in the instructions. Notably, icon benefits were greater for information that was implicit rather than stated in the text. This finding suggests that icons can improve older and younger adults' comprehension by reducing the need to draw some inferences. The icon also reduced effective study time (study time per item recalled). In Experiment 2, icon benefits did not occur for a less integrated version of the timeline icon that, like the text required participants to integrate dose and time information in order to identify the total daily dose. The integrated version of the icon again improved comprehension, as in Experiment 1, as well as drawing inferences from memory. These findings show that integrated timeline icons improved comprehension primarily by aiding the integration of dose and time information. These findings are discussed in terms of a situation model approach to comprehension.},

List instructions were better understood and recalled than paragraphs, and reduced age differences in answer time and span differences in accuracy. Headers reduced paragraph comprehension for participants with lower levels of working memory capacity, presumably because they were not salient cues in the paragraphs. Experiment 2 investigated if headers were more effective when more saliently placed in paragraphs and lists, and if list and header cues helped readers draw inferences from the instructions. List formats again reduced age differences in comprehension, especially reducing the time needed to draw inferences about the medication. While headers did not impair comprehension, these cues did impair recall.

Both older and younger participants in Experiment I chose to repeat messages. More repetition, higher cognitive ability (working memory and processing speed), and younger age were associated with better memory for appointment information. The effect of age was eliminated when cognitive ability, but riot repetition, was controlled Thus, older adults used optional repetition in automated systems, But this strategy did not eliminate age differences in memory. In Experiment 2, older as well as younger adults took accurate notes and also repeated messages. Both note-faking and message repetition improved memory for the messages but did not reduce age differences. These findings suggest that older as wen as younger adults use presentation strategies in automated messaging systems. Older adults may not take full advantage of these strategies, perhaps because of age-related declines in self-initiated or metacognitive processes},

When attentional demand is great, older drivers in particular are subjected to information overload which may adversely affect their driving performance. The study described focused on the establishment of baseline quantitative measures of attentional demand as a function of vehicle velocity, road curvature, and amount of oncoming traffic. Eight experienced drivers drove a virtual environments driving simulator while controlling the visibility of the forward scene via a foot switch. They were instructed to stay in their lane and obey all traffic regulations, while trying to keep the forward scene visible as little as possible. Attentional demand was calculated as the percent of time drivers viewed the forward scene during a run. While driving at 100 kph the average attentional demand (86\%) was significantly higher (p <.01) then when driving at 33 kph (77\%). The finding that an increase in vehicle velocity of 67 kph resulted in only a 9\% increase in attentional demand was somewhat surprising. As expected, the attentional demand of drivers on curves (85\%) was significantly higher (p <.05) then when driving on a straight road (81\%). The effect of traffic versus no traffic on curves was also statistically significant. The attentional demand on curves with moderate oncoming traffic was 88\% versus 80\% when there was no traffic. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a virtual environments simulator to measure drivers' attentional demand},

Following an overview of structural and functional changes found in studies of aging larynges, this article examines current findings on maximum phonation duration, voice quality, vocal jitter/shimmer, spectral noise, and fundamental frequency. Aging can affect vocal pitch, loudness, and quality, but such effects are highly variable across the aging population. Therefore, a thorough voice and medical examination is needed to isolate voice problems caused by vocal abuse or pathology from those due to normal aging. Pushing exercises may be a viable treatment option for those with age-related voice problems},

Each of the 32 subjects generated 80 utterances, which were coded semi-automatically with respect to a wide range of features, such as filled pauses. The experiment yielded new results concerning the effects of time pressure and cognitive load on speech. To see whether a system can automatically identify these conditions on the basis of speech input, we had this task performed for each subject by a Bayesian network that had been learned on the basis of the experimental data for the other subjects.

   abstract = {Background: This study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a computer-automated telephone system to evaluate cognitive impairment in elderly callers to identify signs of early dementia. Methods: The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale was used to assess 155 subjects aged 56 to 93 years (n=74, 27, 42, and 12, with a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively). These subjects performed a battery of tests administered by an interactive voice response system using standard Touch-Tone telephones. Seventy-four collateral informants also completed an interactive voice response version of the Symptoms of Dementia Screener. Results: Sixteen cognitively impaired subjects were unable to complete the telephone call, Performances on 6 of 8 tasks were significantly influenced by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale status. The mean (SD) call length was 12 minutes 27 seconds (2 minutes 32 seconds). A subsample (n=116) was analyzed using machine-learning methods, producing a scoring algorithm that combined performances across 4 tasks. Results indicated a potential sensitivity of 82.0\% and specificity of 85.5\%. The scoring model generalized to a validation subsample (n=39), producing 85.0\% sensitivity and 78.9\% specificity. The kappa agreement between predicted and actual group membership was 0.64 (P<.001). Of the 16 subjects unable to complete the call, 11 provided sufficient information to permit us to classify them as impaired, Standard scoring of the interactive voice response-administered Symptoms of Dementia Screener (completed by informants) produced a screening sensitivity of 63.5\% and 100\% specificity. A lower criterion found a 90.4\% sensitivity, without lowering specificity. Conclusions: Computer-automated telephone screening for early dementia using either informant or direct assessment is feasible. Such systems could provide wide-scale, cost-effective screening, education, and referral services to patients and caregivers.},

Dissemination of information is likely to be slowest among the general population, who may be the first to recognize dementia symptoms but may also be reticent to discuss concerns because of fear, embarrassment, and/or inadequate knowledge. The feasibility of providing public education and access to dementia resources was studied using a toll-free interactive voice response (IVR) telephone system. Public interest in this service and willingness to use this technology were evaluated in a 1-month study conducted in a predominantly rural upper Midwest county (population of 102,565). One hundred ninety-three calls were received during November 1999, with an average length of 9 minutes and 29 seconds. One in six calls lasted 15 minutes or longer. One third of the calls were received outside typical business hours (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). Concern for a parent or grandparent was the most frequent reason (50.6\%) given for the call. Self-concern was indicated by 24.7\% of the callers. Callers provided positive feedback. Such IVR technology may provide a cost-effective bridge to the "digital divide" existing among elderly, lower socioeconomic status, and rural populations underrepresented as computer and Internet users.},

Depression also affects speech. Research suggests several objective voice acoustic measures affected by depression can be obtained reliably over the telephone. Thirty-five physician-referred patients beginning treatment for depression were assessed weekly, using standard depression severity measures, during a 6-week observational study. Speech samples were also obtained over the telephone each week using an interactive voice response system to automate data collection. Several voice acoustic measures correlated significantly with depression severity. Patients responding to treatment had significantly greater pitch variability, paused less while speaking, and spoke faster than at baseline. Patients not responding to treatment did not show similar changes. Telephone standardization for obtaining voice data was identified as a critical factor influencing the reliability and quality of speech data. This study replicates and extends previous research with a larger sample of patients assessing clinical change associated with treatment. The feasibility of obtaining voice acoustic measures reflecting depression severity and response to treatment using computer-automated telephone data collection techniques is also established. Insight and guidance for future research needs are also identified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This is because CNV reflects a higher cognitive function compared with P300 and the effects of aging do not appear in such a function.

However, sex differences in aging of human brain areas associated with nonreproductive behavior have not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that there would be significant sex differences in aging of brain areas that subserve speech, visuospatial, and memory function. METHODS: We investigated sex differences in the effect of aging on human brain morphometry by means of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and on regional cerebral metabolism for glucose by positron emission tomography. In the magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined 69 healthy right-handed subjects (34 women and 35 men), divided into young (age range, 20 to 35 years) and old (60 to 85 years) groups. In the positron emission tomography study, we investigated 120 healthy right-handed subjects (65 women and 55 men) aged 21 to 91 years. RESULTS: In the magnetic resonance imaging study, age-related volume loss was significantly greater in men than women in whole brain and frontal and temporal lobes, whereas it was greater in women than men in hippocampus and parietal lobes. In the positron emission tomography study, significant sex differences existed in the effect of age on regional brain metabolism, and asymmetry of metabolism, in the temporal and parietal lobes, Broca's area, thalamus, and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant sex differences in aging of brain areas that are essential to higher cognitive functioning. Thus, our findings may explain some of the age-sex differences in human cognition and response to brain injury and disease},

In Experiment 4, we determined the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) such that, on average, younger and older adults were able to correctly hear the same percentage of words when words were presented one at a time in noise. In Experiment 5, younger adults were tested under this S/N. Compared with older adults from Experiment 3, younger adults in this experiment recalled more words at all serial positions. The results are interpreted as showing that encoding in secondary memory is impaired by aging and noise either as a function of degraded sensory representations, or as a function of reduced processing resources.},

Compensating for hearing difficulties did not eliminate age-related differences when the 2 talkers were spatially separated by 9Â° or 45Â° azimuth, but it did when the talkers' contributions came from one central location. These findings suggest that dialogue poses more of a problem for older than for younger adults, not because of the additional cognitive requirements of having to follow 2 talkers rather than 1, but because older adults are not as good as younger adults at making use of the auditory cues that are available for helping listeners perceptually segregate the contributions of 2 spatially separated talkers.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the value of a new gap detection procedure called Gaps-In-Noise (GIN) for assessment of temporal resolution in a clinical population. DESIGN: The test consists of 0 to 3 silent intervals ranging from 2 to 20 msec embedded in 6-sec segments of white noise. The location, number, and duration of the gaps per noise segment vary throughout the test for a total of 60 gaps presented in each of four lists. The GIN procedure was administered to 50 normal-hearing listeners (group I) and 18 subjects with confirmed neurological involvement of the central auditory nervous system (group II). RESULTS: Results showed mean approximated gap detection thresholds of 4.8 msec for the left ear and 4.9 msec for the right ear for group I. In comparison, results for group II demonstrated a statistically significant increase in gap detection thresholds, with approximated thresholds of 7.8 msec and 8.5 msec being noted for the left and right ears, respectively. Significant mean differences were also observed in the overall performance scores (i.e., the identification of the presence of the gaps within the noise segments) of the two groups of subjects. Finally, psychometric functions, although similar for short and long duration gaps, were highly different for gaps in the 4- to 10-msec range for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of psychoacoustic procedures are available to assess temporal resolution; however, the clinical use of these procedures is minimal at best. Results of the present study show that the GIN test holds promise as a clinically useful tool in the assessment of temporal resolution in the clinical arena.},

The convergence of television and the Internet is lagging behind expectations, and the combination of desktop computers, entertainment consoles, televisions, and cell phones has yet to form a cohesive whole. One possible reason for this lag in progress is that these technologies don't address a coherent need -they merely augment current entertainment and communication practices. We base our research on the premise that the next revolution of technology in the home will arise from devices that help older adults maintain their independence. A coherent suite of technologies will eventually let older adults be proactive about their own healthcare, will aid them in daily activities and help them learn new skills, will create new avenues for social communication, and will help ensure their safety and well being. The Aware Home Research initiative hopes to help older adults ""age in place"" by creating devices that can assist with daily tasks, offer memory support, and monitor daily activities. However, understanding user needs and attitudes is essential to deploying this technology},

Therefore, the authors propose a remote monitoring system, using the power line network. This system can be located anywhere in the home, even in older houses, allowing caregivers to monitor elderly people from anywhere in the world via the Internet. The authors evaluated the power line network system experimentally. The results showed that the transfer rate depends on the electronic noise in the power line and on the distance between computers even if it was fixed. The authors compared this system with a `traditional' Ethernet system. Although more time was needed, data transfer was completed without problem},

In the present experiment, however, the type of response the subject made determined whether or not an age difference existed in simple reaction time to a visual stimulus. When subjects responded manually, by releasing a key, the usual age decrement in response latency was found. When the same subjects responded vocally, by saying a word, there was no significant age difference in reaction time. This result suggests that slowing of psychomotor latency with age is not a general phenomenon, but may be limited to certain neural systems},

Older subjects demonstrated significantly shorter VOTs only in certain contexts involving place of consonant production and vowel context.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if professionals treating older rehabilitation patients regarded them as having different characteristics than younger rehabilitation patients, to derive factors from these perceptions, and to examine the impact of the discipline of the professional and other factors on these perceptions. DESIGN: Rehabilitation professionals at a random sample of facilities accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities were surveyed to determine their level of agreement with 60 items addressing characteristics of older rehabilitation patients. The items were derived from focus groups with rehabilitation staff members. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand sixty-three rehabilitation professionals from nine disciplines (nursing, occupational therapy, physiatry, physical therapy, psychology, social work, speech pathology, therapeutic recreation, and vocational counseling) responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study. RESULTS: There was a wide range of agreement levels across the 60 items (range of median agreement, 12.7\% to 93.5\%). Factor analysis resulted in six categories of perceptions regarding older rehabilitation patients: (1) physical limitations, (2) motivational deficits, (3) psychological distress/need for support, (4) maturity and positive coping skills, (5) need for privacy/decreased adaptability, and (6) discharge complications. Significant differences across disciplines were found for five of six factors. Nurses agreed more strongly with the negative psychological factors (2, 3, and 5) compared to physical therapists, psychologists, and social workers. Physicians scored significantly higher than two other disciplines on the physical limitations factor. These differences may be related to the distinct role each discipline plays in the rehabilitation process. Older professionals also scored higher on four factors, likely because of personal rather than professional experience with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Treating professionals recognize differences between younger and older rehabilitation patients. Many of these perceived differences can be viewed as variables that require more effort and skill on the part of the treating professional. The training of rehabilitation professionals needs to better prepare individuals from all disciplines to adapt to age-specific differences},

These systems are: episodic memory, semantic memory, short-term memory, perceptual representation system and procedural memory. All available evidence from cross-sectional research shows that there is a linear, decreasing memory performance as a function of age for episodic memory. Longitudinal studies suggest, however, that this age deficit may be an overestimation, by showing a relatively stable performance level up to middle age, followed by a sharp decline. Studies on semantic memory, short-term memory, perceptual representation system, and procedural memory show a relatively constant performance level across the adult life span, although some tasks used to assess short-term memory and procedural memory have revealed an age deficit. Disregarding the mixed results for these latter two memory systems, it can be concluded that episodic memory is unique in showing an age deficit. Episodic memory is also unique in the sense that it is the only memory system showing gender differences in performance throughout the adult life span with a significantly higher performance for women},

However, far less is known about these context effects for much younger and older listeners. In the present study, measures of these context effects were obtained from young children (ages 4 years 6 months to 6 years 6 months) and from older adults (over 62 years), and compared with those of the young adults in an earlier study [A. Boothroyd and S. Nittrouer, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 101-114 (1988)]. Both children and older adults demonstrated poorer overall recognition scores than did young adults.

The pauses followed either two single-clause sentences, a two-clause right-branching sentence, or a two-clause left-branching sentence. There was a significant Age Group x Syntactic Form x Clause Order interaction such that the age group differences in verbatim recall were exacerbated by the effects of syntactic complexity. The elderly recalled 25\% fewer words from the first embedded clause of the left-branching sentences than the college students, whereas they recalled only 4\% fewer words from the first of two successive single-clause sentences. Performance on the running memory span task was also correlated with two measures of the adults' working memory: forward digit span and backward digit span. The pattern of correlations indicated that working memory limitations determine adults' running memory span for prose and contribute to age-group deficits in comprehension},

Up to day, the localization is achieved by the door contacts and the volumetric sensors installed in each room of the HIS/sup 2/. The relationship is not trivial, consequently a set of rules, experienced during the installation of the HIS/sup 2/, has been elaborated. Thus, a set of rules has been written, with the limitation to only one person living in the home. Furthermore, we define the term "volume", more convenient than the term "room", as a room can include several volumes. Then we classify into three kinds of volumes: the "destination" volume, the "communication" volume and the "exchange" volume.

In each experiment, listeners were trained to learn a set of 10 talkers' voices and were then given an intelligibility test to assess the influence of learning the voices on the processing of the linguistic content of speech. In the first experiment, listeners learned voices from isolated words and were then tested with novel isolated words mixed in noise. The results showed that listeners who were given words produced by familiar talkers at test showed better identification performance than did listeners who were given words produced by unfamiliar talkers. Ln the second experiment, listeners learned novel voices from sentence-length utterances and were then presented with isolated words. The results showed that learning a talker's voice from sentences did not generalize well to identification of novel isolated words. In the third experiment, Listeners learned voices from sentence- length utterances and were then given sentence-length utterances produced by familiar and unfamiliar talkers at test. We found that perceptual learning of novel voices from sentence-length utterances improved speech intelligibility for words in sentences. Generalization and transfer from voice learning to Linguistic processing was found to be sensitive to the talker-specific information available during learning and test. These findings demonstrate that increased sensitivity to talker-specific information affects the perception of the linguistic properties of speech in isolated words and sentences},

The task involved 2 memory sets, 1 of which was later cued as irrelevant. The recognition probe was presented at a variable time after the cue. Two indicators of inhibition, the setsize effect of the irrelevant set and the reaction time cost of intrusion probes (i.e., negative probes present in the irrelevant list), were dissociated. Irrelevant setsize effects lasted less than 1 s after the cue and did not differ between old and young adults. Intrusion costs lasted up to 5 s and were disproportionally large for old adults. With the additional requirement to remember both lists until after the probe, young adults' intrusion costs in Experiment 2 were equivalent to those of old adults in Experiment 1, but the setsize effects of the irrelevant set was larger. The results are compatible with a dual-process model of recognition in combination with a working-memory model distinguishing the focus of attention from the activated portion of long-term memory},

Subsequent data were collected by means of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) at 30-day Intervals (14 time points) during the study and in the follow-up period.-The IVRS system facilitated data collection and minimized Inconvenience to the patient, Compliance with the requirement to record details of the healthcare services during the year long study was high. No overall trend for lower RU was associated with sibenadet therapy, which correlates with the lack of sustained clinical effect seen in studies conducted concurrently. These data do, however, provide valuable information on RU associated with COPD and insights into adjustments associated with changes in disease course. Physicians were seen to be the most common source of care for patients with COPD and more of the patients with severe COPD (stage 111) than mild (stage 1) were seen to utlize the most expensive resources (e.g, inpatient hospital care). For those patients who experienced an exacerbation during the trial (irrespective of treatment group), resource use was increased during the periods when an exacerbation was reported when compared with the periods before or after an exacerbaton. The proportion of cases attending the physician doubled and with a trip to the Emergency Room (ER) increased approximately ninefold during the reporting period in which the exacerbation occurred compared with the previous month, This study has shown that use of an IVRS, even in elderly patients, is an effective means of gathering RU data over long periods. The study findings suggest that the advent of effective therapeutic interventions, particularly any with the ability to minimize exacerbations and limit disease progression, could impact on the health care services used and potentially reduce associated costs.

Measures of mean fundamental frequency (F/sub 0/), mean jitter and shimmer (both absolute and relative), and the standard deviation of F/sub 0/, SPL, and peak-to-peak vocal amplitude were computed. Significant differences were found between the healthy young and healthy elderly subjects on measures of F/sub 0/ and amplitude SD, percent jitter, and shimmer. Differences were generally magnified when the younger subjects were compared with the elderly atherosclerotic subjects. Although only percent jitter significantly differentiated between the two geriatric groups, the atherosclerotics' phonations were generally associated with greater short- and long-term variability (as well as intersubject variability) than the healthy elderly men. Unlike the younger subjects, the elderly (especially the elderly atherosclerotic) subject's perturbation measures fell much closer to the upper limits established in the literature for normal voices, indicating that the elderly speaker may be more prone to vocal disruption in the face of pathology},

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) transforms speech into text, while automatic speech synthesis [or text-to-speech (TTS)] performs the reverse, task. ASR has largely developed based on speech coding theory, while simulating certain spectral analyses performed by the ear Typically, a Fourier transform is employed, but following the auditory Bark scale and simplifying the spectral representation with a decorrelation into cepstral coefficients'. Current ASR provides good accuracy and performance on limited practical tasks, but exploits only the most rudimentary knowledge about human production and perception phenomena. The popular mathematical model called the hidden Markov model (HMM) is examined; first- order HMMs are efficient but ignore long-range correlations in actual speech. Common language models use a time window of three successive words in their syntactic-semantic analysis. Speech synthesis is the automatic generation of a speech waveform, typically from an input text. As with ASR, TTS starts from a database of information previously established by analysis of much training data, both speech and text. Previously analyzed speech is stored in small units in the database, for concatenation in the proper sequence at runtime. TTS systems first perform text processing, including "letter- to-sound" conversion, to generate the phonetic transcription. Intonation must be properly specified to approximate the naturalness of human speech. Modem synthesizers using large databases of stored spectral patterns or waveforms output highly intelligible synthetic speech, but naturalness remains to be improved},

All stimuli generated N1 and P2 waves that peaked at about 104 and 200 ms post-stimulus onset. The N1 amplitude increased linearly with increases in the tonal duration in young, middle-aged, and older adults. The P2 amplitude also increased linearly with signal duration, but only in young and middle-aged adults. The results demonstrate that the N1 and P2 waves can resolve duration differences as short as 2-4 ms and that normal aging decreases the temporal resolving power for processing small differences in sound duration},

N1m amplitude suppression at short ISIs was stronger in children than in adults and may reflect a longer refractory period of the N1 generator neurons during early childhood than later in life. Peak latencies of P1m, N1m, and N2m decreased with age, most rapidly < 7 years of age. All deflections originated in nearby cortical areas within the posterior sylvian fissure, and may serve as functional landmarks for that anatomic area},

This new task requires lists of five words to be processed in order to individuate animal nouns, and that the last word of each list be contemporarily maintained. The words incorrectly recalled as target items, but presented during the task (intrusion errors), were computed in order to analyze the efficiency of suppression mechanisms. The findings indicated a continuous decline in working memory measures, and an early decline in short-term memory (passive storage) measures (between 60's and 70's). An age-related increase in intrusion errors was observed; the intrusion index was inversely related to working memory performance but, according to the hypotheses, was not related to short-term memory measures. These results suggest that the stronger working memory effect observed through age might be due to the combined influence of a decline in the capacity of short-term memory, and a loss of efficiency in suppression mechanisms},

The needs and wishes of the users have been assessed and interpreted in direct interaction between users, researchers, technicians and designers, and thus operatively influenced the development process. According to the preferences, abilities and needs of the user the prototype system offers automatic adjustability and manual control of toilet height and tilt, of light level, with support bars and alarm functions. User interface methods include push buttons, speaker independent voice control, touch screen, voice output, and voice level triggered alarm. The usage of RFID technology (contactless smart cards) allows storing and updating users' preferences on a personal data base which allows the toilet prototype to adapt itself while and even before the user is entering the toilet room. Dedicated sensors allow recognising certain phases of the toilet process, e.g. when the user starts to stand up and, if wanted by the user, can assist him/her by raising the toilet. The prototype has been evaluated intensively by elderly and disabled test participants.},

This finding has important performance implications for the many applications that use such systems. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether certain characteristics of synthetic speech slow on- line, real-time cognitive processing. Whereas past research has focused on the phonemic acoustic structure of synthetic speech, we manipulated prosodic, syntactic, and semantic cues in a task requiring participants to recall sentences spoken either by a human ol by one of two speech synthesizers. The findings were interpreted to suggest that inappropriate prosodic modeling in synthetic speech was the major source of a performance differential between natural and synthetic speech. Prosodic cues, along with others, guide the parsing of speech and provide redundancy. When these cues are absent or inaccurate, the additional burden placed on working memory may exceed its capacity, particularly in time-limited, demanding tasks. Actual or potential applications of this research include improvement of text-to-speech output systems in warning systems, feedback devices in aerospace vehicles, educational and training modules, aids for the handicapped, consumer products, and technologies designed to increase the functional independence of older adults},

The age effect was particularly marked on the time-based task. Performance of the event-based prospective task, however, had a higher cost to performance on the concurrent working memory task than the time-based task did, suggesting that event-based responding has a substantial attentional requirement. The older adults also made a significant number of time-monitoring errors when time monitoring was their sole task.

The main effect of group and the Group x Test (ear reported first vs ear reported second) interaction were reliable with both serial and free recall scoring. In the second experiment young subjects were matched to old subjects on the basis of digit span. Matching eliminated the group and Group x Test interaction with seriall recall and the group effect with free recall, suggesting that digit span and dichotic memory are mediated by common mechanisms. Error trends and the Group x Test interactions with free recall revealed that some age related differences persisted even after matching. These differences are discussed in terms of regression artifact and processing capacity},

Comparison of the performances of subjects in the older age groups with previous data concerning four year olds, 11 year olds, and young adults (Oarnell and Amerman, 1978) revealed a close resemblance between the performance of four year olds and older adults in the proportion of correct syllable identifications, consistency of responses and substitution preferences. On all of these measures, the responses of these two age groups differed significantly from those of the 11 year olds and young adults. The results suggest a reduction in decoding precision for these coarticulatory cues as a function of the aging process},

Prosodic discrimination was assessed with sentence pairs where members of a pair differed by intonation or rhythm, and musical discrimination was tested using musical-phrase pairs derived from the prosody of the sentence pairs. This novel technique was chosen to make task demands as comparable as possible across domains. One amusic subject showed good performance on both linguistic and musical discrimination tasks, while the other had difficulty with both tasks. In both subjects, level of performance was statistically similar across domains, suggesting shared neural resource for prosody and music. Further tests suggested that prosody and music may overlap in the processes used to maintain auditory patterns in working memory},

(2) If older and younger subjects have access to external memory aids, older subjects will display significantly better prospective memory. (3) If these subjects are denied external aids, the younger subjects will exhibit better prospective memory. Hypotheses 1 and 2 were confirmed, but 3 was not. The advantage older subjects display when permitted use of memory aids could derive from better recall of the future task or higher motivation to complete the task once it is recalled. In the second experiment, 51 undergraduates (M = 18.71 years) and 55 older subjects (M = 71.87 years) recruited from a continuing education program were used to test the hypothesis that the advantage older subjects displayed in aided prospective memory over younger ones derives from better recall of the task. The results obtained were not consistent with this interpretation. In the third experiment, 22 undergraduates (M = 18.50 years) and 20 Elderhostel participants (M = 70.25 years) tested the hypothesis that the advantage older subjects enjoy in prospective memory derives from greater motivation to complete the task.

   abstract = {The vocal ligaments insert at the anterior and posterior commissures of the larynx. These structures fulfil biomechanical functions, balancing the different elastic moduli of tendon, cartilage or bone and undergo age-related changes that may be responsible for voice changes with increasing age. The aim of this study was to analyse the insertion structures of the vocal ligaments by means of macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic methods and to draw conclusions from age-related structural changes on a functional basis. Investigations were carried out on the larynges of 22 males and 15 females (aged 1-95 y). In adolescence, the insertion zone of the vocal ligament tendon, a dense network of connective tissue rich in sulphated glycosaminoglycans at the thyroid cartilage, is characterised by a layer between tendon and cartilage comparable to fibrocartilage. The insertion zone lacks a perichondrium. Collagen fibrils of the vocal ligament tendon penetrate directly into the thyroid cartilage. In the insertion area, the chondrocytes are surrounded by collagen fibrils, which show positive reactivity to antibodies against type I and type III collagen. Sulphated glycosaminoglycans are integrated between the collagen fibrils. In the area of the posterior glottis, elastic cartilage rests like a cap on the hyaline base of the arytenoid cartilage. There is no distinctive border between the structures. With increasing age, ossification of the laryngeal skeleton occurs, involving hyaline cartilage at the posterior glottis and hyaline and fibrocartilage at the anterior commissure. At the same time, a loss or sulphated glycosaminoglycans is observed inside the vocal ligament tendon. Advanced ossification of the laryngeal skeleton, particularly in the area of the commissures, an increasing loss of glycosaminoglycans in the vocal ligament tendon and changes in the elastic tissue reduce the elastic modulus between tendon, cartilage and bone, thus 'stiffening' the insertion zones, which could be one factor among others favouring voice changes with advancing age},

These culturally related differences should not be overlooked in either functional assessment or in rehabilitation strategies nor should these differences remain unrecognized in future research. Wallace and Freeman (1991) go further to say that culturally sensitive approaches to clinical and academic preparation of clinicians, through an infusion approach, are needed to provide information about cultural diversity in adults including health/environmental issues that determine health status and consequences on communication competence in multicultural communities, such as poverty, access to health care, genetics, stress, living environments, and diet. One clear approach to sharpening clinician cultural sensitivity to diversity among people who are elderly is to include aging cultural differences in the speech-language pathology curricula of colleges and universities and to begin to explore these issues more fully in our research and professional forums},

Cognitive tests measured attention, perceptual speed, memory, language, and spatial copying. Regression models, adjusted for age and education, demonstrated that men with higher levels of blood lead recalled and defined fewer words, identified fewer line-drawn objects, and required more time to attain the same level of accuracy on a perceptual comparison test as men with the lowest level of blood lead. Men with higher levels of blood and bone (tibia) lead copied spatial figures less accurately; men with higher levels of bone (tibia) lead had slower responses for pattern memory.

Continuous respiratory datasets (obtained by inductive plethysmography) were collected from 40 healthy adults (10 young men, 10 young women, 10 elderly men, and 10 elderly women) during 120 min of spontaneous breathing. The interbreath interval (IBI) time series were extracted by a new algorithm and fractal scaling exponents that quantify power-law correlations were computed using detrended fluctuation analysis. Under supine, resting, and spontaneous breathing conditions, both healthy young and elderly subjects had scaling exponents for the IBI time series that indicate long-range (fractal) correlations across multiple time scales. Furthermore, the scaling exponents (mean +or- SD) for the IBI time series were significantly (p<0.03) lower (indicating decreased correlations) in the healthy elderly male (0.60+or-0.08) compared to the young male (0.68+or-0.07), young female (0.70+or-0.07), and elderly female (0.67+or-0.06) subjects. These results provide evidence for fractal organization in physiologic human breathing cycle dynamics, and for their degradation in elderly men. These findings may have implications for modeling integrated respiratory control mechanisms, quantifying their changes in aging or disease, and assessing the outcome of interventions aimed toward restoring normal physiologic respiratory dynamics},

The second strategy (called the `range strategy') is based an the position inside or outside normal ranges established from a reference population; results based on this strategy were presented in a previous paper. Reference values were calculated from a database of 200 healthy voices distributed into 10-year age groups ranging from 20 to 70. Comparisons were made using a second database of 220 voices, including 65 control, 51 functional dysphonia, 50 with nodules on the vocal folds and 54 recurrent nerve palsy. The phonetic material was compared of 17 French vowels: 11 vowels in a sentence, three isolated vowels and three segments (beginning, middle and end) of the sustained vowel /a/. Four acoustical features were considered for each vowel: the voice fundamental (f0) and the first three formant frequencies. Acoustical features were calculated on an ILS (interactive Laboratory System) analysis system (workstation). The separation of each pathological group from the control group, using sets of acoustical features, was statistically assessed. From the strategy point of view, results indicated that (i) the fundamental frequency f0 was the best measure to separate normal from pathological voices with the distance strategy; (ii) when the formants were taken, the range strategy performed better in separating the voices. For classification of pathologies, the best separation coefficients were obtained with nodules and the worst with recurrent nerve palsy. Overall, it was seen that the separation between control and pathological voices was most efficient when measured using the distance strategy for f0. The range strategy was useful with formant frequencies},

Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations},

The model has been used to design and develop a telephone system for the management of hypertensive patient within the EU funded Homey project. The knowledge existed in a widely accepted guideline for the care of hypertension has been represented and augmented through the proposed cognitive model. The final product is an intelligent system able to manage an adaptive dialogue. It monitors patients' adherence and increases their involvement by promoting self-care through frequent virtual visits, which is complementary to the traditional face-to-face encounters with their primary care physicians.},

STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. RESULTS: Interactive voice response assessment systems have been implemented in the treatment of patients with chronic health problems such as heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and mental health disorders. The information patients report during IVR assessments is at least as reliable as information obtained via structured clinical interviews or medical record reviews. Patients often are more inclined to report health problems to an IVR system than directly to a clinician. The few outcome evaluations of IVR-supported chronic illness management services indicate that they can have moderate impacts on some health and health behavior outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should evaluate the extent to which IVR assessment data can improve the prediction of clinical problems over and above what is possible using data usually available to primary care providers. Studies also should evaluate the outcomes of IVR-supported chronic disease management and the use of IVR assessments to measure variation in patient-centered treatment outcomes.},

   abstract = {In 3 experiments, auditory massed repetition was used to examine age-related differences in habituation by means of the verbal transformation paradigm. Participants heard 10 words (5 high frequency and 5 low frequency), each presented 180 times, and they reported perceived changes in the repeated words (verbal transformations). In these experiments, older adults reported fewer illusory percepts than young adults. Older adults' loss of auditory acuity and slowing of processing, stimulus degradation (in young adults), and instructions biasing the report of these illusory percepts did not account for the fewer illusory percepts reported by the older adults. These findings suggest that older adults' reduced susceptibility to habituation arises from centrally located declines in the transmission of information within the word-recognition pathway. The discussion focuses on the implications that these age-related declines may have on word identification during on-line speech perception},

The implicit test of perceptual identification yielded no evidence of age-related declines in the processing of either lexical information or coarse perceptual details (modality of presentation). The same test, however, produced marked age-related declines in the processing of fine-grained perceptual details (voice) when subjects were not familiarized with the talkers' voices prior to the encoding task. Marked age differences were also observed in recognition memory. These findings suggest that although aging preserves the encoding and incidental retrieval of lexical and coarse perceptual information, it affects the encoding of fine-grained perceptual information and deliberate retrieval processes},

In the present study, we attempted to uncover the source of these contradictory findings by assessing whether the terminal item's susceptibility to top-down influences might depend on subjects' first-hand experience of the extent to which recall is affected by the suffix. Furthermore, we examined whether age differences in the suffix effect could be attributed to age-related declines in inhibitory processes. Our findings supported both predictions},

In keeping with the results of research showing that processing resources diminish as normal aging occurs (Craik \& Bird, 1982; Rabinowitz, Craik \& Ackerman, 1982), we suggest that generation ability based on referential processing is affected to a greater extent in older adults than is the generation ability involving representational processing. Fifteen young adults and 15 elderly persons performed a generation task modeled on that used by Dror and Kosslyn (1994). Observations were based on two contrasting conditions. In the first instance, subjects were required to generate an image representation of numbers when instructed to do so by a graphic stimulus, e.g., "31" (representational generation). In the second case, generation was produced on the basis of a verbal stimulus, e.g., "thirteen" (referential generation). Results (response time and number of accurate answers) show that, compared to young adults, elderly adults have a diminished ability to generate images based on words rather than numbers and do so at a slower pace. Our results suggest, therefore, that the performance of the first type of generation is cognitively more demanding for elderly subjects than that which is founded on figurative stimuli. The deterioration of mental image generation processes observed in elderly subjects by Dror and Kosslyn (1994) is therefore dependent on the nature of processing (referential vs. In conclusion we suggest two complementary assumptions to explain the observed dissociation. The differential effect of age may be the result of a deficienness cy linked to the nature of processing (control vs. automatic). Our second assumption is that, more specifically, referential generation involves more processing resources than does representational generation because it requires an additional transcoding operation. In this instance, the differential effect of aging that we observed would be closely linked to the number of cognitive operations involved in mental image generation},

To vary working memory demands, a cue to the relevant dimension (letter or shape) in an odd-man-out task was presented or withheld. Pathology to prefrontal areas associated with normal aging, was not linked to shifting deficits when working memory load was reduced in a comparison of older and younger adults (Experiment 1).

Parkinson patients were relatively unimpaired on this task (Experiment 2,). but began to display shifting deficits when response competition was present in the display (Experiment 3)},

For purposes of comparison, the cholinergic neuronal system was studied in parallel in young adult (3-7 months), mature (15-17 months) and aged (24-26 months) rats. In young adults GAD activity was highest in the CIC (219 nmol/mg protein/h; N = 5), intermediate in NLL (82 nmol/mg protein/h), and lowest in CN (34 nmol/mg protein/h). Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was highest in NLL and CN, and approximately 35-40\% lower in CIC. A more uniform pattern was observed with GABA-T activity. Reductions in GAD activity were seen in the CIC of mature (-31\%) and aged (-30\%) rats that were not graded with age when compared to young adult, P < 0.05 (N = 5). This effect was regionally selective, since the CN did not show any loss of GAD or ChAT activity. The neurotransmitter selectivity of this deficit in CIC is supported by the non-parallel changes in ChAT activity (-22\%, aged vs. mature, P < 0.05) that occurred after the changes in GAD activity. In contrast to the loss of GABAergic biosynthetic capacity in aged CIC, high affinity uptake processes (Kd and Vmax) for 14C-GABA and 3H-D-aspartate were not significantly altered (P > 0.05). Similar to the CIC, the NLL showed remarkable age-related deficits, but these deficits were more substantial for the cholinergic system (ChAT activity: -56\% aged vs. young adult, P < 0.05; GAD activity: -35\% aged vs. mature). None of the areas examined showed a significant loss of GABA-T activity with aging. These data suggest: 1) Age-related loss of GABA-mediated inhibition in the CIC of Fischer-344 rats is not attributable to changes in uptake or degradation of GABA, but may be related loss of biosynthetic capacity (i.e. activity or quantity) of the GAD present; 2) processing centers of the central auditory pathway (i.e. CIC and NLL), but not necessarily primary (i.e. CN) integrative nuclei, demonstrate selective, age-related neurochemical deficits; and 3) age-related neurochemical changes in central auditory structures may contribute substantially to the abnormal perception of signals in noise and loss of speech discrimination observed in neural presbycusis},

METHODS: One hundred consecutive volunteers over age 40 with no history of voice disorders were enrolled. All completed a self-administered laryngeal symptom questionnaire and underwent a comprehensive head and neck examination including transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 61 years. Vocal fold bowing (presbylaryngis) was present in 72\% of the patients, and findings of laryngopharyngeal reflux were present in 64\% of the cohort. In addition, other laryngeal pathology were identified in 21\%. Only 12\% had a completely normal laryngeal examination. CONCLUSIONS: Occult laryngeal pathology is very common in persons over 40. Findings suggestive of laryngopharyngeal reflux are present in 64\%, and vocal fold bowing is present in 72\% of persons over 40},

The data indicated that in addition to taking longer, the older adults tended to have more difficulty performing the tasks. The findings also indicated that memorability was an important usability feature, and that the ratings of overall usability and overall satisfaction were significantly worse for the older adults},

Each device hosts software agents with different levels of knowledge and complexity. Internet and Java technologies provide the building blocks of the designed telemonitoring software.

During testing, two hours and again one week following presentation of the 16 words, no marked differences among age groups were observed in EDR, but HR responses were lower in the old than in the young group. The old adopted high signal detection decision criteria for emotional words, which accounted for their lower recognition of emotional words in one measure. The old were as proficient as the young in recognition of neutral words. More emotional words were correctly recognized when a person's responsivity in HR and EDR was high, but this correlation was dissociated in the old. Heart rate changes but not EDR reflected a reduced responsivity in the old. The results place in question the use of peripheral autonomic measures as an index to memory processing},

Adult women produced speech movements of equal amplitude and velocity to those of adult men. The children produced speech movement amplitudes equal to those of adults, but they had significantly lower peak velocities of orofacial movement. Thus we found no evidence supporting a size-scaling principle for orofacial speech movements. Young children have a relatively large-amplitude, low-velocity movement strategy for speech production compared with young adults. This strategy may reflect the need for more time to plan speech movement sequences and an increased reliance on sensory feedback as young children develop speech motor control processes},

It is hypothesized that the reversibility of repeated ambiguous patterns is a general phenomenon arising from satiation, whereas transformations of repeated unambiguous verbal stimuli, involving phonetic distortions, are based on specific speech-perception mechanisms that are absent in the aged},

We addressed this issue by the transient interference produced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which directly assesses causal relationships between performance and stimulated regions. We compared the effects of rTMS ( a rapid-rate train occurring simultaneously to the presentation of memoranda) applied to the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on visuospatial recognition memory in 66 healthy subjects divided in two classes of age (<45 and >50 years). In young subjects, rTMS of the right DLPFC interfered with retrieval more than left DLPFC stimulation. The asymmetry of the effect progressively vanished with aging, as indicated by bilateral interference effects on recognition performance. Conversely, the predominance of left DLPFC effect during encoding was not abolished in elders, thus probing its causal role for encoding along the life span. Findings confirm that the neural correlates of retrieval modify along aging, suggesting that the bilateral engagement of the DLPFC has a compensatory role on the elders' episodic memory performance},

Forty-five subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups with either low or high mental work-loads and gave instructions on the assembly of a small machine model. Speakers in the low work-load condition had the model available while instructing, whereas speakers in the high work-load condition had to recall the assembly without external aids. In a third group, speakers were given a secondary task while instructing. Only in the low load condition were instructions apparently adapted to the listener. High load and dual task conditions, on the other hand, yielded messages that were equivalent as to their contents, regardless of the different communicative tasks. Additional assessment of speech characteristics demonstrated the experimental manipulation of mental work-load to be effective. Results suggest that decreased listener-adaptation reflects a dissociation of the communicative demands of listener-adapted speech and the cognitive resources to meet these demands.},

Two experiments tested whether this decrease reflects cognitive overload or a systematic reduction of work load. In experiment I three groups of speakers gave their partner an instruction on the assembly of a machine model. In the experimental groups (high cognitive load) speakers had to either recall information relevant to the instruction from memory or had to accomplish a secondary task. For half of the participants in each group accountability was manipulated by telling them they would have to explain their speech planning after giving the instruction. This manipulation enhanced partner-adaptation only in the high-load groups. In experiment II both methods of inducing high load in experiment I were combined for the experimental group. Under these conditions the accountability manipulation produced no effect. Reduced partner-adaptation can thus be understood as serving the reduction of high cognitive load. These results make the cognitive load-approach a possible explanation of previous observations of reduced partner-adaptation.},

A baseline measure was obtained in silence. The effect of each noise was also assessed under articulatory suppression (AS). In Experiment 2, the number of digits to recall was adjusted to participants' individual span. Results show a clear irrelevant speech effect (ISE), that is, recall declines in the presence of familiar and nonfamiliar verbal noise, but is unaffected by white noise. AS negates ISE. Most important, ISE does not interact with age: older adults have no more difficulty inhibiting irrelevant auditory information than do young adults. These results are discussed relative to current theories of inhibition in aging},

Fast younger subjects showed less dorsolateral PFC activation during retrieval than slow younger subjects, whereas older adults showed the opposite pattern. Thus age-related changes in dorsolateral PFC and not ventrolateral PFC account for WM decline with normal aging},

DESIGN: Five years ago, the author developed a dysphagia staging scale based on personal experience and a review of the English literature. This scale was shared with colleagues from the specialties of otolaryngology, speech pathology, neurology, and gastroenterology, both within and outside the author's institution. Minor modifications have been made. The scale has been used in clinical management and retrospective studies. SETTING: Patients were seen in a multispecialty, tertiary care, academic center. Patients: The patient population included the full spectrum of oropharyngeal dysphagia in adults, but was weighted heavily toward aging patients and patients with head and neck cancer, neurologic disorders, gastroesophageal conditions, and psychiatric problems. RESULTS: The stages are as follows: stage 0 = normal function and asymptomatic; stage I = normal function but with episodic or daily symptoms of dysphagia; stage II = compensated abnormal function manifested by significant dietary modifications or prolonged mealtime (without weight loss or aspiration); stage III = decompensated abnormal function with weight loss of 10\% or less of body weight over 6 months due to dysphagia, or daily cough, gagging, or aspiration during meals; stage IV = severely decompensated abnormal function with weight loss of more than 10\% of body weight over 6 months due to dysphagia, or severe aspiration with bronchopulmonary complications, nonoral feeding recommended for most of nutrition, and stage V = nonoral feeding for all nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The FOSS was successful for staging various adult patients with dysphagia into clinically useful, overall performance categories. It has been applied successfully to retrospective outcome studies and to clinical management by clinicians from different specialties},

   abstract = {Objectives: To quantify the contribution of gray and white matter volumes to total prefrontal volume in healthy aging. To determine if prefrontal tissue volumes distinguish healthy aging from Alzheimer disease (AD). Design: Volumes of total prefrontal cortex, prefrontal gray matter, and prefrontal white matter were compared among young healthy elderly (YHE) (n = 14; mean age, 70 years), old healthy elderly (OHE) (n = 14; mean age, 90 years), and subjects with AD (n = 14; mean age, 70 years) by analysis of variance. Additionally, Pearson correlations were performed between volumes and age. Results: Old healthy elderly and subjects with AD had significantly less total prefrontal volume (approximately 15\% less in both groups) and prefrontal white matter volume (approximately 30\% less and 20\% less in the OHE and AD groups, respectively) than YHE, but there were no differences between the OHE and AD groups. There was a significant difference in gray-white matter volume ratio with OHE having a higher ratio than YHE. Subjects with AD did not differ from YHE or OHE in this ratio. There were significant negative correlations between age and total prefrontal volume and age and prefrontal white matter volume in the healthy subjects. Conclusions: In the very old, the decline of white matter volume is disproportionately greater than the decline of gray matter volume. In subjects with AD both gray and white matter loss contribute to the decline of prefrontal volume. This is demonstrated by the gray-white matter ratio that does not differ between YHE and subjects with AD. Thus, it is likely that AD is different from accelerated aging},

Objective: We used volumetric magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether any region within the PFC is more vulnerable to deterioration with late aging or AD. Methods: Volumetric analysis of PFC regions was performed on younger healthy elderly subjects (n = 26; 14 men and 12 women [mean age, 71.7 years] for aging analysis; 12 men and 14 women [mean age, 71.4 years] for AD analysis), oldest healthy elderly (OHE) subjects (n = 22 [11 men and 11 women]; mean age, 88.9 years), and patients with AD (n=22 [12 men and 10 women]; mean age, 69.8 years). Results: The OHE subjects had less PFC white matter than did young healthy elderly subjects. The orbital region was selectively preserved relative to other PFC regions in the OHE subjects. Subjects with AD had less total PFC gray matter than did age-matched healthy subjects and significantly less volume in the inferior PFC region only. Conclusions: Orbital PFC is selectively preserved in OHE subjects. In contrast, degeneration within the PFC with AD is most prominent in the inferior PFC region. Thus, degeneration within the PFC has a regionally distinct pattern in healthy aging and AD},

   abstract = {The elderly population in the world is increasing rapidly and consequently so is demand for new technologies that allow them to live independently. Facilitating the control of household appliances and the home environment through various devices that encompass multimodal and ambient interfaces seems a way to achieve this. In this paper, we lay out the theoretical principles relating to the accommodation of technology for use in the home among older people, followed by a report supporting these principles based on experiments we have carried out. Three modalities of output - audio, visual and multimodal - were tested using two different devices - palmtop and laptop - as realistic prototypes of household appliance controllers. Through experimental design, the applicability of using icons and musical earcons as a medium to transmit information to the user and its suitability to the home was investigated. The use of musical earcons allowed the potential for an ambient interface to be compared with a traditional visual interface for older people. Results showed participants performed markedly better using the multimodal and visual interfaces than with the audio interface. In addition, both groups performed better using the palmtop as compared to the laptop.},

   abstract = {Many variables have been assumed to reflect speed of processing, and most are strongly related to age in the period of adulthood. One of the primary theoretical questions with respect to aging and speed concerns the relative roles of specific and general age-related effects on particular speed variables. Distinguishing between specific (or unique) and general (Or shared) age-related influences on measures of speed has been complicated, in part because the issues are sometimes framed in terms of extreme all-or-none positions, and because few researchers have employed analytical procedures suitable for estimating the relative contributions of each type of influence. However, recent methods focusing on partitioning age-related variance have indicated that large proportions of the age-related effects on individual speed variables are shared with age-related effects on other variables. Although these theoretical ideas and analytical procedures are fairly new, they may be relevant to a variety of psychophysiological or neurobiological variables. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The participants also performed several additional cognitive tasks that allowed examination of the relation of time-sharing efficiency to other types of cognitive functioning The results were consistent with the existence of a distinct time-sharing ability because the time-sharing costs in the three dual-task combinations were significantly correlated with one another but only weakly correlated with other cognitive variables. Increased age was associated with reductions in time-sharing ability, and greater efficiency in performing two tasks at once was associated with better performance on tasks assessing spatial, reasoning, and memory abilities.

A decrease in the number and activation of fibroblasts in maculae flavae indicates decreased synthesis of fibrous components in the vocal fold mucosa.

Second, the EFAVFs ran in various directions, were branched, and formed a complicated network. The surface of the fibers was rough, and the fibers appeared to vary in size. Some EFAVFs united to form a sheet with a rough surface. Third, the EFAVFs could not be easily digested by elastase compared with those of younger adults.

The results for the aged mucosae can be summarized as follows. 1) Especially in men, collagenous fibers had increased and reticular fibers had decreased. 2) Collagenous fibers had formed bundles, and their density was high. 3) The spaces between collagenous fibers and the interstitial spaces for other extracellular matrices had decreased. 4) The collagenous fibril diameters differed, and their outline was irregular. 5) Twisted collagenous fibrils were present. 6) Occasionally, masses of dense collagenous fibers and fibrous tissue could be seen in the mucosa. 7) Occasionally, the collagenous fibers were increased all the way from the deep layer to the superficial layer of the mucosa, and consequently, there was no layered structure. Not only changes in the 3-dimensional structure of the collagenous fibers, but also their qualitative and quantitative changes, have an effect on the 3-dimensional structure of the extracellular matrices. Thus, the viscoelasticity must change to ensure normal phonation, and this change in viscoelasticity would explain one component of aging of the voice},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3D structure of the macula flava in the human vocal fold was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy using a chemical digestion method (modified sodium hydroxide maceration method) and the results compared with those obtained using light microscopy. RESULTS: The macula flava of the human vocal fold comprised a dense mass of cells and extracellular matrices. Many cells were stellate in shape and possessed cytoplasmic processes. Extracellular matrices were composed of collagenous, reticular and elastic fibers, and ground substances (hyaluronic acid). Many fibers ran in various directions. The stellate cells were surrounded by these extracellular matrices. Amorphous materials were attached to the surface of the stellate cells. Extracellular matrices in the macula flava extended to those in the lamina propria of the vocal fold mucosa. CONCLUSION: Anterior and posterior maculae flavae in the human vocal fold mucosa are postulated to be involved in the metabolism of extracellular matrices, which are essential to the viscoelasticity of the lamina propria (the vibrating tissue) of the human adult vocal fold mucosa},

The results are summarized as follows. Aged VFSCs were stellate in shape and possessed slender cytoplasmic processes. Aged VFSCs also possessed lipid droplets in the cytoplasm and stored vitamin A. Basically, the morphological characteristics of the aged VFSCs were the same as those of younger adults. The number of VFSCs had decreased. There were fewer intercellular organelles than in younger adults. Some components of the cytoplasm had degenerated. The nuclei of the VFSCs were dense and cleaved. There were few vesicles at the periphery of the cytoplasm of aged VFSCs, and few newly released amorphous materials. Some aged VFSCs had degenerated, and an accumulation of glycogen particles was seen in the cytoplasm. The number of fibers synthesized by these inactivated cells had decreased. These findings were recognized to various degrees. The aged VFSCs in the maculae flavae appear to have decreased activity, have abnormal metabolism, and undergo degeneration. Age-related changes in the VFSCs of the maculae flavae are postulated to influence the metabolism of extracellular matrices in the vocal fold mucosa, as well as the viscoelasticity of the aged vocal fold mucosa, and are one of the causes of aging of the voice},

Results from such studies can be criticized because the pragmatic goals of readers differ dramatically from those of speakers in typical conversation.

Our research employs a cooperative game task, in which two speakers use utterances from a predetermined set to negotiate moves around gameboards. Results from a set of early versus late closure ambiguities suggest that speakers signal this syntactic difference with prosody even when the utterance context fully disambiguates the structure. Phonetic and phonological analyses show reliable prosodic disambiguation in speakers' productions; results of a comprehension task indicate that listeners can successfully use prosodic cues to categorize syntactically ambiguous fragments as portions of early or late closure utterances},

   abstract = {Within the broad field of spoken dialogue systems, the application of machine-learning approaches to dialogue management strategy design is a rapidly growing research area. The main motivation is the hope of building systems that learn through trial-and-error interaction what constitutes a good dialogue strategy. Training of such systems could in theory be done using human users or using corpora of human-computer dialogue, but in practice the typically vast space of possible dialogue states and strategies cannot be explored without the use of automatic user simulation tools. This requirement for training statistical dialogue models has created an interesting new application area for predictive statistical user modelling and a variety of different techniques for simulating user behaviour have been presented in the literature ranging from simple Markov models to Bayesian networks. The development of reliable user simulation tools is critical to further progress on automatic dialogue management design but it holds many challenges, some of which have been encountered in other areas of current research on statistical user modelling, such as the problem of 'concept drift', the problem of combining content-based and collaboration-based modelling techniques, and user model evaluation. The latter topic is of particular interest, because simulation-based learning is currently one of the few applications of statistical user modelling that employs both direct 'accuracy-based' and indirect 'utility-based' evaluation techniques. In this paper, we briefly summarize the role of the dialogue manager in a spoken dialogue system, give a short introduction to reinforcement-learning of dialogue management strategies and review the literature on user modelling for simulation-based strategy learning. We further describe recent work on user model evaluation and discuss some of the current research issues in simulation-based learning from a user modelling perspective.},

French versions of the Stroop color-word task and of the Daneman and Carpenter's RST were administered to 151 participants,from 30 to 80 years. In addition to the traditional span score, a score of vulnerability to intrusions was also computed as the number of intruding responses (words from preceding trials of the RST or nonfinal words). An analysis of variance showed a significant age effect on the reading span and on the resistance to interference, but no significant age effect on the vulnerability to intruding responses. A multiple-regression analysis was also made with the reading span score as the dependent variable, and with age, vulnerability to intrusions, and resistance to Stroop interference as independent variables. This analysis revealed that there was a relation between participants' vulnerability to intruding responses and their working memory span scores; the contribution of age and resistance to interference were very weak. In conclusion the present findings first support the idea that the working memory capacity undoubtedly involves some inhibitory control; however, because the participants' vulnerability to intruding responses is not clearly affected by age, the present findings also suggest that some part of age effects upon the working memory span has to be explained by another factor than a growing inefficiency in inhibitory control},

The results indicate that emotional prosody modulates word processing and that the time-course of this modulation differs for males and females. Women show behavioural and electrophysiological priming effects already with a small interval between the prosodic prime and the visual target word. In men, however, similar effects of emotional prosody on word processing occur only for a longer interval between prime and target. This indicates that women make an earlier use of emotional prosody during word processing as compared to men},

Memory performance was assessed with several well-known tests and with recently developed tests for domain-specific aspects of memory. Most tests concerned episodic memory. Study 1 also included measures of semantic, incidental and working memory. Study 2 further examined the influence of the domain-specificity of objective and subjective measures for remembering names, intentions, and texts. Relations between memory self-reports and performance were weak in both groups and for all kinds of tests. Against expectations, the low correlations could not be explained by differences between ecological and laboratory tests or incidentally and intentionally remembered information, or by differences between specific failures compared to global, stereotyped judgments. Surprisingly, correlations did not increase when subjective and objective measures assessed the same ability, like remembering names. Also noncognitive variables (mood and lifestyle) did not influence the relations. The (weak) relations between subjective and objective memory measures were comparable for subjects over and under 65 years of age. Furthermore, relations were comparable for the general population sample and the memory compliant group},

Measures of perceptual comparison speed, working memory, and executive ability, as well ns regional brain volumes based on high resolution magnetic resonance imaging were obtained from a subsample of 112 participants. We then conducted a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses to test whether (1) the processing speed theory, (2) frontal-executive theory, or (3) some combination of these best accounted for age-related variation in fluid intelligence. The results showed that perceptual comparison speed, executive ability, and frontal lobe volume each made significant contributions to a regression equation that explained 57\% of the variance in fluid intelligence. These findings suggest that both the processing speed and frontal-executive theory of cognitive aging are partially correct and complement one another},

Our goal was to focus on issues of clinical significance in caregiver intervention research in order to move the field toward a greater emphasis on achieving reliable and clinically meaningful outcomes. Design and Methods: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health databases from,1996 through 2001 were searched to identify articles and book chapters mapping to two medical subject headings: caregivers and either dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Articles were evaluated on two dimensions, outcomes in four domains thought to be important to the individual or society and the magnitude of reported effects for these outcomes in order to determine if they were large enough to be clinically meaningful. Results: Although many studies have,reported small to moderate statistically significant effects-on a broad range of outcomes, only a small proportion of these studies achieved clinically meaningful outcomes. Nevertheless, caregiving intervention studies have increasingly shown promise of affecting important public health outcomes in areas such as service utilization, including delayed institutionalization; psychiatric symptomatology, including the successful treatment of major and minor depression; and providing services that are highly valued by caregivers. Implications: Assessment of clinical significance in addition to statistical. significance is needed in this research area. Specific recommendations on design, measurement, and conceptual issues are made to enhance the clinical significance of future research.}

Probands were classified as showing no decline, slow, medium, or rapid rate of decline, based on the slope of change in cognitive and physical/functional factors over three or more assessments. Siblings of probands who did not decline on measures of memory, visuospatial/cognitive function or ADL skills were approximately half as likely to die as siblings of probands who had the most rapid decline. The reduction in risk of death in siblings of probands who did not decline in was primarily observed among siblings of probands who were older than 75 years, suggesting that genetic influences on life span may be greater at older ages.

Our quantitative results showed that AD patients had a lower performance level in the three retention intervals than controls but a significant interaction between group and interval was not found, indicating that the rate of forgetfulness was similar in the two groups. In our qualitative analysis, errors were categorised as confusions, perseverations, omissions, and order alterations. Contrary to other studies (Dannenbaum, Parkinson, \& Inman, 1988; Kopelman, 1985) where an AD forgetfulness tendency of omissions was observed, our data showed an excess of perseveration (even more than five repetitions), indicating problems in the central executive. This could be interpreted in terms of problems in updating the contents of working memory},

To compensate for that, "Speech Rate Conversion" technology which slows down speech while retaining the features of a speaker's voice has been developed. Meanwhile, quickening the speech rate for fast viewing of VTR and for content retrieval using audio has been attempted. Some of these speech rate conversion technologies are put to practical use. Variable rate playback of video and audio stored on hard disk is becoming available as multimedia grows. Furthermore, high quality speech rate conversion is needed to control temporal duration of speech waveforms in recent high quality TTS technologies. The paper proposes a method of speech rate conversion including extension of the unvoiced portion to improve naturalness in various applications and also presents a portable speech rate converter intended to progress the audio broadcasting service for elderly viewers},

Results indicated a relative deficit in the elderly in the cognitive comprehension of humor-selecting punch lines to jokes and in a cartoon array test. Measures of cognitive function correlated with humor comprehension. In contrast to this deficit in comprehension, the elderly showed intact affective appreciation and emotional reactiveness. Because of the hypothesis of frontal lobe degeneration as a basis for changes with aging, we compared the elderly to patients with focal frontal lesions. In this comparison, the elderly were significantly better than the patients in their comprehension of humor. They also displayed intact appreciation of humor compared to patients with frontal lesions. This preliminary study suggests that preserved affective responsiveness may underlie the success in using humor as a coping mechanism in the elderly},

To this end, we provide information about practical tools such as systems for signal display and prosodic transcription, and several caveats which we have found useful to keep in mind},

This focus is inappropriately narrow both from the perspectives of neuropathogenesis and neurobehavioral phenomenology, and it is based on a limited view of prosody. Current models of brain organization for prosody propose lateralized representation based on functional (affective vs. linguistic) or featural (timing vs. pitch) properties of prosodic material. However, a role for subcortical structures in prosody is being increasingly described, and prosodic functions are now known to span a broad range in communication. In this article we describe normal prosody and present an overview of neurobehavioral disorders associated with acquired adult dysprosody. From these considerations we propose a neurobehavior-based approach to a more effective study of prosodic disturbance, and eventually, to better insight into normal prosody},

The purpose of this investigation was to observe velopharyngeal closure in normal subjects and subjects with cleft palate from prepubertal to postpubertal life (i.e. pre-adenoid involution to post-adenoid involution). Changes in velopharyngeal closure patterns were observed in 60\% of the normals studied and 30\% of the cleft subjects},

For the older adults, but not the younger adults, lexical decisions were slower when the probe was presented (the dual-task condition), compared with a control condition in which the lexical decision was performed alone. The older participants also showed slower tone-detection responses in the dual-task condition than when the tone was presented alone. For all participants, proportional tone-detection times (compared with tones in isolation) decreased with increasing SOA, but this decrease was less pronounced in the older group. Finally, the time between responses in the dual-task condition was longer for older than for younger adults. The results indicate that word meaning influences the allocation of attention similarly for younger and older adults, but that older adults suffer a cost and become disproportionately slower in processes related to response coordination and output},

   abstract = {Surgery in the elderly requires a knowledge of the changes in the larynx that take place with aging. In the elderly larynx, there are changes in the elastin and collagen fibers within the lamina propria. There is also thinning and atrophy of the mucous membranes and atrophy of the mucous glands. Common disorders are vocal fold atrophy, sulcus vocalis, glottic incompetence, and vocal fold edema. A reduction in the number of lymphatic channels is responsible for the vocal fold edema. Vocal fold atrophy is responsible for the increase in pitch that is frequently heard in elderly men. Other common conditions in the elderly include vocal fold nodules, polyps, and Reinke's edema. The most common phonosurgical procedures performed in the elderly are vocal fold surgery for benign pathology and laryngeal structure surgery for glottic incompetence. Microsurgical techniques on benign vocal fold lesions aim to avoid injury to the transitional layer, which is rich in fibroblasts. Although the superficial layer of the lamina propria involves less fibroblastic activity, any surgical manipulation of the lamina propria can influence the vibratory properties of the vocal folds, particularly when the basement membrane zone is manipulated. The alterations in phonosurgical techniques used in the elderly are the result of histologic changes in the vocal folds and altered wound healing. Functional voice disorders often develop to compensate for the structural changes in the larynx. Correction of hyperfunctional or abnormal functional technique is as important as phonosurgical correction of vocal fold pathology},

For comparative purposes, results from an earlier study of 35 young adult women (aged 18-25 years) were available. Compared to younger groups of subjects, reflex responses of the elderly were reduced in numbers and amplitude, were characterized by fewer initial excitatory component responses, and had longer latency to onset. Analyses of responses of the children indicated that age 7-8 years is a transitional period. Some children show adult-like responses, while others display responses that appear to represent earlier forms or transitional responses. These results suggest that oral-motor reflexes are not fixed response patterns upon which more complex motor skills, such as speech, are built. Rather, oral reflex development appears to occur in concert with the acquisition of complex motor skills. Systematic changes in reflex responses also occur in the period from young adulthood to seventh decade of life. This result indicates a continuous evolution of oral sensorimotor systems throughout the human life span},

Acoustic analyses indicated that the elderly adults' segment, syllable, and sentence durations were 20 to 25\% longer than those of the young adults at both the normal and the fast rates of speech. In addition to comparisons that were made between these two groups of subjects, comparisons were also made with durations of the speech of young children studied in previous research.

   abstract = {Frequency of prospective memory and retrospective memory failures was rated on a 16-item questionnaire by 862 volunteers, from five groups: patients with Alzheimer Disease (rated by carers), carers of Alzheimer Disease patients, elderly, young, and a group of married couples. Reported memory failures were highest for Alzheimer Disease patients, and lowest for carers, with elderly and young controls in between. More prospective memory than retrospective memory failures were reported in all groups, although the difference was small for Alzheimer Disease patients who were rated near ceiling for both. Prospective memory failures of Alzheimer Disease patients were reported as more frustrating for carers than retrospective memory failures; prospective memory and retrospective memory failures frustrated Alzheimer Disease patients equally. Data from the couples indicated that there were no biases resulting from rating on behalf of someone else. These results suggest that: (1) normal ageing has no greater effect on self-reported retrospective memory than prospective memory failures, (2) the relatively small number of memory failures reported by carers may result from comparing themselves with the Alzheimer Disease patients in their care, and (3) prospective memory failures have a greater impact on the lives of the carers and are therefore more likely to be reported as early indicants of the disease},

   abstract = {Objective: The objective of the study was to implement a previously developed automatic speech-in-noise screening test by telephone (Smits, Kapteyn, \& Houtgast, 2004), introduce it nationwide as a self-test, and analyze the results. Design: The test was implemented on an interactive voice response system, which can handle multiple lines. The test measures the speech reception threshold in speech-shaped noise by telephone (SRTTn) in an adaptive procedure using digit triplets as speech material. The test result is given as either good, insufficient, or poor. Questions about age, sex, and subjective rating of hearing were included in the test. The test was introduced as the National Hearing test and publicity was generated. In the first 4 mo, 65,924 people took the initiative and dialed the test. The possibility to use mobile phones was disabled because of significant worse results (0.7 dB) with that telephone type. Results: After applying exclusion criteria, results from 39,968 callers were analyzed. Seventy-five percent of the callers were older than 44 yr of age. Starting at about 45 yr of age, there is an increase in SRTTn with increasing age. SRTT(n)s for men are significantly worse than SRTT(n)s for women for age groups 50 to 54 and higher. Older people tend to rate their hearing better than might be expected from their SRTTn. However, after converting the mean SRTTn values per age group and per subjective score to percentile values, the values remain constant across age groups. Mean measurement error was within 1 dB. These errors increase with increasing SRTTn. Conclusions:This study shows the implementation and results from a functional hearing screening test by telephone. The test can be done in about 3 minutes, 30 sec, including introductory text, explanation of the test procedure, test result, and recommendation for audiological evaluation. The high number of callers implies that the test is probably fulfilling the need for a functional hearing screening test and has enhanced public awareness about hearing loss.},

In Experiment 3, reducing the resources available for identification by changing from single to multiple talkers reduced word recognition more among older than younger adults.

Older persons showed a significant diminution in tongue thickness during rest. We found no evidence that tongue function was affected.

Our sample consisted of children, adolescents, adults and seniors. Analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling revealed a mixed pattern of results. Controlling for global speed removed the child vs. adult differences in the speed of responding on the executive function tasks but the senior vs. adult differences remained. This mixed pattern of findings was interpreted to suggest that the effects of advancing age on the speed of responding are mediated by a global mechanism during childhood but during senescence the efficiency of executive functioning seems particularly vulnerable to the effects of age},

A second study compared early HD patients with at-risk siblings and spouse controls on comprehension of affective and propositional prosody, discrimination of both types of prosody, rhythm discrimination and tonal memory (Seashore tests). HD patients were impaired in both comprehension and discrimination of all types of prosody. HD patients were less accurate than at-risk patients on the tonal memory task but not on the rhythm discrimination task.

Two spatially integrating fibre optic sensors were investigated, one of which was based on inter-modal interference and the other on mode conversion. The sensing fibre was integrated into a bed and test subjects were monitored in different positions. The sensor outputs were then correlated with subject movement, respiration rate and heart rate. The results indicated that the inter-modal sensor could detect patient movement and respiration rate while the mode conversion sensor could detect patient movement, respiration rate and heart rate.

In Experiment 2, the characteristics of the most discriminable utterance pair were successfully extended to the other utterance pairs. For Experiment 3, an auditory continuum (varying in F0, amplitude, duration) was crossed with a visual continuum (varying in eyebrow raise, head tilt), using synthetic speech and a computer-animated head. Participants judged five levels along each of these two speech continua between a prototypical statement and prototypical question, in an expanded factorial design. Experiments 4 and 5 were unable to appreciably enhance the weak visual effect relative to the strong auditory effect (from Experiment 3). Overall, we found that both auditory and visual cues reliably conveyed statement and question intonation, were successfully synthesized, and generalized to other utterances. However, the weak visual effect relative to the robustly strong auditory effect precluded optimal integration and conclusive examination of information processing through model-fitting},

Setting Community residents of a largely urban region of South East Scotland. Participants Four hundred and seventy-eight survivors of the 1932 Scottish Mental Health Survey (n = 87 498) without dementia. Measurements The Moray House Test (MHT) of intelligence administered at age 11 and age 80 years. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, history of disease and current prescribed medications age 80 years. Results After adjusting for sex, neuroactive drugs had a detrimental effect on life long cognitive change age (F = 12.2, p = 0.001, partial eta-squared = 0.026), statins a beneficial effect (F = 5.78, p = 0.017, partial eta-squared = 0.013) and polypharmacy a detrimental effect (F = 6.46, p = 0.011, partial eta-squared = 0.014). In the optimal model estimated marginal means revealed: a relative improvement for statin users, IQ age 11 = 93.2 (95\% Cl 87.9-98.4) and age 80 = 100.6 (95\% CI 95.3-105.9); compared with non-users, IQ age 11 = 100.9 (95\% CI 99.4-102.3) and age 80 = 100.0 (95\% CI 98.6- 101.5). Conclusions Clinically, the degree to which drugs impair cognition in relatively fit, older people may not be apparent. However, in population terms, medication use, particularly polypharmacy, is important. Statins, used as currently indicated for cardiovascular disease, appear promising in ameliorating cognitive decline in older people. However, firm recommendation of their use should await the outcome of ongoing randomised clinical trials. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd},

   abstract = {Just as the false comma in this sentence, shows punctuation can influence sentence processing considerably. Pauses and other prosodic cues in spoken language serve the same function of structuring the sentence in smaller phrases. However, surprisingly little effort has been spent on the question as to whether both phenomena rest on the same mechanism and whether they are equally efficient in guiding parsing decisions. In a recent study, we showed that auditory speech boundaries evoke a specific positive shift in the listeners' event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that indicates the sentence segmentation and resulting changes in the understanding of the utterance (Steinhauer et al., 1999a). Here, we present three ERP reading experiments demonstrating that the human brain processes commas in a similar manner and that comma perception depends crucially on the reader's individual punctuation habits. Main results of the study are: (1) Commas can determine initial parsing as efficiently as speech boundaries because they trigger the same prosodic phrasing covertly, although phonological representations seem to be activated to a lesser extent. (2) Independent of the input modality, this phrasing is reflected online by the same ERP component, namely the Closure Positive Shift (CPS). (3) Both behavioral and ERP data suggest that comma processing varies with the readers' idiosyncratic punctuation habits. (4) A combined auditory and visual ERP experiment shows that the CPS is also elicited both by delexicalized prosody and while subjects replicate prosodic boundaries during silent reading. (5) A comma-induced reversed garden path turned out to be much more difficult than the classical garden path. Implications for psycholinguistic models and future ERP research are discussed},

The proposed framework allows user interface designers to elicit, accommodate, and articulate user interface guidelines and results of experimental studies into reusable, evolutionary, and "living" design cases. The building blocks of the representational framework are a set of primitive constructs for consolidating the semantics of human factors knowledge into a design representation that characterizes the physical level of interaction. This is achieved through the development of a logical framework based on preference constraints and an initial set of preference and indifference expressions. The preference constraints provide a reasoning engine and a proof strategy for compiling a preference ordering of competing design alternatives and subsequently aggregating them into indifferent classes of design options per interaction element. The article also reports the implications of the proposed technique for user interface designers and the underlying requirements of user interface development platforms. Finally, the representational sufficiency of the proposed approach is discussed in the context of recent case studies aiming to consolidate human factors knowledge into a reusable repository supporting the ergonomic design of user interfaces in two example application domains, namely nonvisual hypermedia accessible to blind people and interpersonal communication aids for speech-motor-imp aired and language-cognitive-imp aired users},

Because older adults have been found to be slower in performing many cognitive tasks, we hypothesized that they may have difficulty in immediate recall for speech of increasing input rate. Two experiments are reported in which both older and younger participants listened to and immediately recalled sentences that were systematically varied in speech rate and number of propositions. Although recall performance of the older adults showed a disproportionate decline when speech rate was increased, older adults, as well as the younger adults, were able to recall sentences of increasing propositional densities. We also found that the tendency to recall a greater proportion of main ideas than details (the levels effect) was enhanced by increased propositional density, and depressed by increased speech rate and increased age. These results are discussed in terms of an age-related change in the rate at which information can be processed in working memory},

Main effects of age indicated that older adults generally showed lower discriminability (D) and greater bias (B) toward reporting signals to be words. Consistent with the environmental support hypothesis, older adults were differentially facilitated in discriminability by feedback, but only when semantic context was provided. Also, for both younger and older adults, feedback and context each had the effect of reducing bias and facilitating the speed of rejecting nonwords. Contrary to one suggestion in the literature that aging brings an insensitivity to environmental contingency, older adults were at least as capable as the young in taking advantage of feedback to normalize the speech signal so as to increase discriminability and decrease bias},

Adult response patterns were most conservative across condition. Difference in discrimination accuracy as measured by P(C) were found, with the largest difference in the 5- to 6-year-old group and the smallest change in the adult group. These findings suggest that children's response strategies, like those of adults, can be manipulated by changing the ratio of same-to-different trials.

In contrast, elderly subjects demonstrated a significantly reduced ability to voluntarily inhibit eye movements toward flashed targets on an antisaccade task.

Telecare has been driven largely by perceived cost savings and improved service delivery to the home, leading to improved quality of life and independent living. Smart homes are also expected to provide better and safer living conditions. The integration of the two should produce more secure and autonomous living. There are different forms of telecare services., as there are different types of smart homes, each ranging from basic systems involving the use of alarms and the ordinary telephone to intelligent monitoring with sensors and interactive communication. The introduction of these systems has policy implications, such as the need for coordination between health, social services and housing policy makers, which will reduce duplication and inefficient allocation of resources. Successful delivery of telecare to the home is as much dependent on the construction and condition of the housing stock as it is on the ability of the care provider to meet users' needs. If the UK National Health Service (NHS) could replace a significant proportion of domiciliary nursing visits by telephone calls, then savings of up to Pounds 200 million per annum would be possible},

Basement membrane (BM) thickness was increased in 65-85\% of strial capillaries in gerbils aged 33 months or older and often exceeded by several-fold that observed in young controls. In an early stage of thickening the BM expanded slightly around the full capillary profile, after which nodular expansions of BM encircling slender cell processes were often observed at or near one or both poles of the elliptical vessel profile. As widening progressed, the BM consisted of 2-3 layers separated by cell processes in the nodules but fewer strata elsewhere. Association of slender processes of both endothelial cells and pericytes with focal thickening outside the process suggested their participation in genesis of the capillary lesion. In later stages of atrophy, pericytes degenerated and disappeared, while endothelial cells remained intact. Eventually, thick multilayered BM devoid of endothelial cells surrounded a narrow lumen occluded by debris. The age-related change in BM in the inner ear was confined to StV capillaries. Degenerative changes in StV epithelial cells occurred apparently as a secondary consequence of the capillary lesion. The pathologic alterations in marginal cells included extrusion of blebs from the luminal surface, separation and loss of basolateral interfoldings, alteration and depletion of mitochondria and nuclear pyknosis. At the end-stage of degeneration, the StV consisted of a simple or multiple layer of squamous cells lining the scala media},

Semantically neutral statements that conveyed a mood through prosody were used as targets in a mood priming task. These targets were preceded by story primes. The events described in the primes were either congruent with the mood conveyed by the intonation of a target phrase, incongruent with target mood, or emotionally neutral. Prime-target pairs were presented in two attention conditions designed to favor either relatively automatic or effortful mental processing. Response time (RT) data were recorded for accurate judgments of target moods. In the automatic condition, there were no qualitative differences between RHD, LHD, or normally aging control subjects. In the effortful condition, RTs for each group were similarly improved by congruent primes (relative to neutral primes), but RHD subjects were disproportionately slower when targets were preceded by incongruent primes. Results indicate that brain-damaged adults retain knowledge of emotional meanings, and use that knowledge to facilitate effective interpretations in some circumstances. Demands for emotional inference revision were not exclusively responsible for RHD adults' poor performance with incongruent primes, as they successfully revised initial predictions in other conditions. Rather, these subjects' difficulties arose when increased processing demands converged with decreased availability of mental resources. These findings are integrated with those from a related study of lexical metaphor, and are interpreted within a cognitive resource framework},

   abstract = {Idiom interpretation tasks are routinely used in the clinical evaluation of adults with brain damage, and idiom processing has received increasing attention in the psycholinguistic literature. Clinical evidence suggests that adults with unilateral right-hemisphere damage (RHD) are insensitive to nonliteral meanings conveyed by idiomatic expressions and other figurative forms. However, this portrayal is derived from their terminal responses to tasks that reflect multiple aspects of mental operations (off-line measures), obscuring the source of poor performance. This study used an on-line word-monitoring task to assess RHD, left-hemisphere-damaged, and normally aging adults' implicit knowledge of familiar idiomatic expressions. Brain-damaged subjects performed similarly to normal controls on this task, even though the clinical subjects fared poorly by comparison on an off-line idiom definition measure. These results suggest that adults with unilateral brain damage can activate and retrieve familiar idiomatic forms, and that their idiom-interpretation deficits most likely reflect impairment at some later stage of information processing. Further, error analysis of idiom-definition performance did not support the customary characterization of RHD adults as excessively literal responders. The paper discusses clinical implications of the nature and use of idiom interpretation tasks},

   abstract = {This research examined perception of moods from the tone-of-voice of semantically neutral phrases following unilateral cerebrovascular accident. It was hypothesized that right hemisphere damage (RHD) would impair even low-level discrimination and recognition of affective prosody, while left hemisphere damage (LHD) would affect performance only as associational-cognitive task demands increased. Thirty-three male subjects, 11 each in RHD, LHD, and normal groups, were given three tasks that varied in presumed amounts of processing undertaken for successful completion. Discrimination of prosodic patterns was expected to require the fewest cognitive operations. An intermediate task involved selecting from two possibilities the label that described moods conveyed prosodically. In the third task, prosodic mood selection was made from four choices, increasing the number of comparisons necessary for accurate judgment. As hypothesized, RHD subjects were inferior to normal subjects in all tasks. LHD subjects were equivalent to normal subjects for the first two tasks, but fell to the level of the RHD group for the third task. These results indicated that the right hemisphere in men was primarily involved in the reception and recognition of emotional prosodic stimuli. Increasing cognitive demands, however, brought about a shift in emphasis from the right hemisphere to both hemispheres. An implication of these findings concerns the need to examine performance levels that invoke changes from expected patterns of hemispheric specialization to advance our knowledge of functional asymmetries},

The proposed protocol, being an application service element (BSE), is fully compatible with the notation and functionality of the emerging "Convergence" protocol targeted to be a European standard for home automation systems The core of the proposed architecture is a new management protocol entity residing at the OSI application layer, We have followed an approach similar to the well-known simple network management protocol (SNMP) of the TCP/IP protocol suite Information is acquired either on request by the management device or on event reporting initiated by a managed device. Furthermore, the acquired information can be diffused to the Internet, through a HAN-to-TCP gateway unit.

In the past decade or so, we already have witnessed the beginning of this trend, with the rapid rise in the number of patients with degenerative dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. On another track, sophisticated and timely medical and surgical interventions have produced a growing number of patients who survive serious head injury. These patients are typically young, and may live for many decades after their brain injury. In both examples, a core feature of the condition is impaired cognition and behavior; that is, defects in higher-level capacities such as memory, intellectual function, language, and decision-making. Neuropsychological assessment cannot be viewed as a luxury in cases such as these but rather, as a vital component of the neurodiagnostic evaluation. The neuropsychologist uses a set of standardized instruments to measure cognition and behavior in a comprehensive and precise manner, yielding rich information that may assist in accurate diagnosis, prudent management, and optimal rehabilitation. The neuropsychological examination may provide the only means with which to detect alterations in brain function, as in cases of mild head injury or low-level toxic exposure, which may not be revealed through other procedures. Finally, neuropsychological assessment will continue to play a key role in the scientific programs that are dedicated to advancing our understanding of the neural substrates of complex behavior},

However, listeners were able to correctly paraphrase the least ambiguous subset of these utterances, showing that prosody can be used to resolve ambiguity (Exp. 2). Nonetheless, in everyday language use, both prosody and context are available to interpret speech. When the least ambiguous sentences were cross-spliced into contexts biasing towards their original interpretations or into contexts biasing towards their alternative interpretations, answers to content questions about the ambiguous sentence, confidence ratings, and ratings of naturalness all indicated that prosody is ignored when context is available (Exp. 3). Although listeners can use prosody to interpret ambiguous sentences, they generally do not, and this makes sense in light of the frequent lack of reliable prosodic cues in everyday speech},

Contemporary society has thus had to endeavour to offer the 'new old' not only social services but also pastimes, leisure, social, cultural and educational activities. Among the range of opportunities being made available is that of acquiring skills in the use of information and communication technology (ICT), an area of ever-increasing prominence. This can be seen not only as an opportunity for individual cultural growth but also the basic condition for conceiving a range of practical network-based services and applications of great social significance for the elderly population. This article refers to one of these initiatives, developed in Liguria (one of the Italian regions with the oldest population), whose purpose was to train about 600 over-60s in the use of ICT. What we will analyse here in particular are the results of e-learning activities offered to a sample of participants and with reference to a segment of the entire training process envisaged by the regional initiative. The specific objectives of the activity were to verify the real possibility of proposing short, online learning modules on the use of Internet for older users; to survey users' attitudes/reactions to e-learning; and to analyse the follow-up of distance training activities},

Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate the age difference between Broca's and Wernicke's aphasics while achieving better control over potentially confounding variables. The subjects (9 Broca's and 14 Wernicke's) were selected from a data base according to the following selection criteria: aphasia type, handedness, localization of lesion and etiology (first CVA). The two groups revealed to be equivalent for sex distribution and schooling; post onset time was superior to three weeks for all subjects but one. Results showed that the distribution of age between Broca's and Wernicke's group were significantly different: there was a small representation of Broca's aphasics in older subjects while Wernicke's aphasia occurred at all ages},

Consistent with the slowing hypothesis, older adults' immediate memory performance was differentially depressed when speech rates were very fast.

Over the last number of years much has been written about the benefits of effective nurse-patient communication. However, research findings indicate that the quality of nurse- older person communication has been and continues to be poor. The purpose of this mini ethnography was to ascertain how student nurses communicate with older people. This is relevant as today's students are tomorrow's registered nurses and the manner in which they currently communicate with older person may indicate how they will interact with this population in the future. Data were collected using both participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using latent thematic analysis. Four major themes were identified from the findings. These were: types of communication, modes of communication, factors that either hinder or enhance effective communication and student nurses' approach to communicating with older people. There are a number of recommendations from this study. These include, promoting a person-centred approach to care of the older person, ensuring appropriate clinical supervision of student nurse-older person communication by preceptors, increasing theoretical input in relation to interpersonal skills and communication theory, facilitating reflective practice whilst students are on clinical placement and regular auditing of clinical placements as suitable learning environments.

This WM capacity factor correlated with a factor composed of fluid abilities measures.

It is applied to sentences included in a widely used test to measure speech-reception thresholds and originally selected to be approximately equally redundant. Results of a first experiment reveal that this method enables one to detect subtle differences between sentences and sentence lists with respect to linguistic entropy. Results of a second experiment show that (1) in young listeners and with the sentences employed, manipulating linguistic entropy can result in an effect on SRT of approximately 4 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio; (2) the range of this effect is approximately the same in elderly listeners},

In this study (n = 1437), an interaction between "immediate memory" and age was found. In persons aged 75 years and over, "immediate memory," as measured by the 15 Words Test, showed to be an independent risk factor for falls. Part of this relationship was explained by the mediating effects of activity, mobility, and grip strength. The association between the other cognitive functions and falls was only statistically significant in univariate analysis.

Performances of young and old subjects were compared in a task involving an attentional sharing between three concurrent estimations of durations (6, 8, or 10 s). Depending upon the experimental condition, the subjects were instructed to simultaneously focus their attention onto one, two, or three target stimuli. The results showed that increased difficulty of the task, that is the increased number of concurrent temporal targets to monitor at a time, led to a greater disruption of timing performance in elderly people than in young adults. Temporal judgments of elderly were less accurate and more variable than those of young adults in the attentional sharing conditions (two or three target durations). The greater sensitivity to interference effects observed in the elderly is discussed in terms of age-related reduction of attentional resources and working-memory deficits},

We discuss the roles and characteristics of artificial companions and issues of trust and emotional interaction between an older person and companion. Based on ethnographic studies, we developed several personas of older people that represent behaviour patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment of the older people. We present various cases when an older person would interact with artificial companion and visualize one such scenario. The paper also discusses the agent architecture we have developed that is necessary if the agent is to have the level of personality-rich features and the mobility that we seek},

These analyses found no age-related deficits specific to selective attention or local task-switching. Age deficits were found for dual-task performance and global task-switching. Unlike selective attention and local task-switching costs, dual-task and global task-switching costs were found to be additive in both young and old subjects, unmodulated by task difficulty. These forms of executive intervention then did not alter computational processes already present in the simple tasks, but rather added one or more additional processing steps or stages to the processing stream.

Evidence for age sensitivity is found for the process of categorization of lists, but not for semantic processing, association strategies, imagery, nor for extracting main points from prose material. The elderly population benefits more than the young from the possibility of reviewing lists or texts. Differences between young adults and old-old adults are larger than between young adults and the young-old for speed of search in short-term memory and prose recall only.

Two of the four tasks yielded large and robust age effects on prospective-memory performance. Correlational analyses suggested that these age effects on prospective-memory performance were mediated, at least in part, by a reduced ability of older adults to maintain prospective intentions in a highly activated state and not by age effects on basic mental speed alone},

Study Design: Randomized clinical trial. Methods: Patients with persistent asthma were randomly assigned to telephone outreach (automated=3389, live caller=192) or usual care (n=3367). Intervention participants received 3 outreach calls over a 10-month period. The intervention provided brief, supportive information and flagged individuals with poor asthma control for follow-up by a provider. A survey was mailed to 792 intervention participants and 236 providers after the intervention. Additional feedback was obtained as part of the final intervention contact. Results: The intent-to-treat analysis found no significant differences between the intervention and usual-care groups for medication use, healthcare utilization, asthma control, or quality of life. Post hoc analyses found that, compared with the control group, individuals who actually participated in the intervention were significantly more likely to use inhaled steroids and to have had a routine medical visit for asthma during the follow-up period and less likely to use short-acting beta-agonists. They also reported higher satisfaction with their asthma care and better asthma-specific quality of life. Of surveyed providers, 59\% stated the program helped them to clinically manage their asthma patients and 70\% thought the program should be continued. Conclusions: This study did not find improved health outcomes in the primary analyses. The intervention was well accepted by providers, however, and the individuals who participated in the calls appeared to have benefited from them. These findings suggest that further studies of automated telephone outreach interventions seem warranted.},

   abstract = {The role of the listener in processes of language planning and production is assessed controversially in the literature. In this paper it is argued that differences observed in the degree of partner adaptivity are related to differences in task complexity. Earlier studies in this field focused on the production of single referential acts. In order to test hearer-orientedness under conditions in which speakers have rather to develop and follow a complex macrostructural plan, an experiment was carried out in which speakers had to instruct a hearer to set up a village like configuration of 13 objects. Three aspects of text structure were analyzed as indicators for the degree of partner adaptivity: anchoring of spatial perspective, given-new structure, level of granularity. The results reflect the fact that texts are structured on the basis of two very elementary components: topic elements (including perspective anchoring, choice of linearization criterion) and focus elements. Global choices made with respect to topic elements are fairly resistant to modification (e.g. perspective reanchoring required by the hearer) whereas changes in the focus domain are unproblematic for the speaker (e.g. hearer intervention asking for a change in the level of specificity). In conclusion, we relate these findings to a global model of language production, arguing for different types of partner-orientedness rat different levels of the planning process.}

Changes in reaction to stress in the elderly was measured using urinary tests. In addition, stress of nursing staff was investigated. Their mental state was evaluated using a ""burnout scale."" The day service center was provided with seal robots for five weeks. As a result, the feelings of elderly people improved by the interaction with the robots. Urinary tests showed that their ability to overcome stress were also improved. Moreover, the stress levels of the nursing staff decreased because the elderly people required less supervision when interacting with the robots. Consequently, the seal robots were judged to be useful at institutions for the elderly, such as the day service center},

   abstract = {When people en-age in conversation, they tailor their utterances to their conversational partners, whether these partners are other humans or computational systems. This tailoring, or adaptation to the partner takes place in all facets of human language use, and is based on a mental model or a user model of the conversational partner. Such adaptation has been shown to improve listeners' comprehension, their satisfaction with an interactive system, the efficiency with which they execute conversational tasks, and the likelihood of achieving higher level goals such as changing the listener's beliefs and attitudes. We focus on one aspect of adaptation, namely the tailoring of the content of dialogue system utterances for the higher level processes of persuasion, argumentation and advice-giving. Our hypothesis is that algorithms that adapt content for these processes, according to a user model, will improve the usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of dialogue systems. We describe a multimodal dialogue system and algorithms for adaptive content selection based on multi-attribute decision theory. We demonstrate experimentally the improved efficacy of system responses through the Use Of user models to both tailor the content of system utterances and to manipulate their conciseness.

There were significant effects of age on all but two of the tasks. All the measures had adequate internal consistency.

The magnitude of the correlations was similar across the age groups and ranged from .52 to .81.

Classification into upper and lower quartiles was more stable than using a cutoff score for group membership or than classification into high-, medium-, and low-span groups. Correlational analyses showed that there was a moderate relationship between performances on many of the span tasks. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that six of the seven tasks reflected a common factor.

However, reports vary as to the nature and extent of an age effect on fundamental frequency (F0) for analyses taken over long segments of connected speech. Analysis of F0 across a smaller time frame may be more informative. Young speakers show an increase in F0 associated with phonetically governed devoicing gestures that is likely mediated by increased vocal fold stiffness. Anatomic and neurophysiologic changes in the aged larynx may limit the role of increased vocal fold stiffness in the devoicing gesture. This study tests the hypothesis that aged speakers show a smaller increase in F0 in association with the devoicing gesture for production of an intervocalic voiceless obstruent than do young speakers. Normal young and aged speakers produced a short sentence containing an intervocalic voiceless obstruent. Measures of F0 were obtained for ten cycles before voice offset and ten cycles after voice onset. Young speakers showed a small increase in F0 during devoicing whereas aged speakers showed a decrease in F0 during devoicing. Aged speakers seem to rely more on vocal fold abduction rather than a combination of abduction and tensing to achieve devoicing},

The nature of the swallowing problems were examined and compared to those reported to occur in the normal ageing population. The utility of the interview schedule was critically evaluated. Results revealed an overall prevalence of 44\% of subjects who experience swallowing problems that interfere with their day to day functioning. Of these, 64\% experienced swallowing difficulties affecting all phases of the swallow while 36\% experienced difficulties affecting the pharyngeal and oesophageal phases. The interview was found to be a useful screening measure in identifying the presence of swallowing problems. The role of the speech pathologist in dysphagia in the normal ageing population is highlighted and justified},

Responses from more than 1,000 participants were entered into a cross-national factor analysis, which revealed four initial factors that underlie perceptions of intergenerational conversations. Elder nonaccommodation was when young participants reported that older people negatively stereotyped the young and did not attend to their communication needs. On the other hand, elder accommodation was when older people were perceived as supportive, attentive and generally encouraging to young people. A third factor was respect/obligation and a fourth factor labeled age-irrelevant positivity described a situation where young people felt conversations with much older people were emotionally positive and satisfying, age did not matter: Examining cross-cultural differences, some East versus West differences were observed, as might be expected, on the basis of simplistic accounts of Eastern collectivism versus Western individualism. However the results challenge commonsense notions of the status of old age in Eastern versus Western cultures. On some dimensions, participants from Korea, Japan, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines appear to have relatively less positive perceptions of their conversations with older people than the Western cultures-the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But there was also evidence of considerable cultural variability, particularly among Eastern cultures-variability that has heretofore all too often been glossed over when global comparisons of East versus West are made. A range of explanations for these cultural differences is explored and implications for older people in these societies are also considered},

Two factors, cognitive slowing and age-related memory constraints, receive special attention. Assessing listeners' ability to report the content of time-compressed speech shows elderly adults to be especially vulnerable to rapid speech input. Such effects, however, are ameliorated by effective use of linguistic knowledge, which, unlike processing speed, remains relatively stable in adult aging. A second technique is described in which intelligibility is tested for words excerpted from fluent speech, first presented in isolation and then with varying amounts of preceding or following context from the original utterances. Memory constraints are shown to have a significant effect on elderly listeners' ability to use linguistic context that follows an acoustically ambiguous region for a retrospective analysis of what had been heard. Thus, cognitive factors can both enhance and limit auditory performance in elderly listeners},

By contrast, context that followed the target words was less effective for the elderly subjects than it was for the young.

Both young and elderly subjects showed better recall for slower speech rates and when prosody was consistent with syntactic structure, but these effects were larger for elderly subjects. When syntax and prosody were placed in conflict, elderly subjects were more likely than the young to reconstruct the lexical content of the presented sentences to produce responses with a syntactic structure consistent with the prosody marking.

Participants repeated a short phrase 15 times at habitual, fast, and slow rates. The resulting lip displacement signals were time- and amplitude-normalized, and successive standard deviations along the movement waveforms were summed to produce a spatiotemporal index (STI) representing individual variability in movement pattern. Participants tended to show greatest variability at slow rate, less variability at fast rate, and least variability at habitual rate. For the older adults, STI at habitual rate was significantly higher (more variable) and speech durations were longer than those of young adults. Perioral strength and tactile acuity were poorer in these older adults than in young adults.

N4 was not influenced by the attention manipulation. Young but not older subjects' N4s were attenuated by repetition. When the sentence-final words were presented a third time in isolation, the N4s elicited were similar in amplitude and latency to those elicited in sentence context, but were not attenuated by repetition. In young and older subjects, the peak amplitude of the sentence-elicited N4 difference wave form was highly correlated with the number of correct recognitions of typical words, but not atypical sentence-final words. In young but not older subjects, sentence-elicited N4 amplitude was correlated with the amplitude of the P3 elicited in the auditory oddball paradigm},

The present study explores the effects of extending the range of memory aids and including games. For 2 months, 12 people who had sustained brain injury were loaned a pocket computer containing three purpose-designed memory aids: diary, notebook and to-do list. A month later they were given another computer with the same memory aids but a different method of text entry (physical keyboard or touch-screen keyboard). Machine order was counterbalanced across participants. Assessment was by interviews during the loan periods, rating scales, performance tests and computer log files. All participants could use the memory aids and ten people (83\%) found them very useful. Correlations among the three memory aids were not significant, suggesting individual variation in how they were used. Games did not increase use of the memory aids, nor did loan of the preferred pocket computer (with physical keyboard). Significantly more diary entries were made by people who had previously used other memory aids, suggesting that a better understanding of how to use a range of memory aids could benefit some people with brain injury.},

Twenty cadavers, 10 men and 10 women, were studied. Stereological methods were used for histologic analysis. In the vocal folds, we observed a reduction of the lamina propria thickness (p < .001) and of epithelial cell density (p < .001) as a function of age. In the skin, there was a reduction of chorion thickness (p = .02) and of epithelial cell density (p = .01). The decrease in the thickness of the lamina propria of the vocal folds with aging may contribute to the vocal pattern present in the elderly. These changes were more evident in men},

The purpose of the study was to establish preliminary normative data for such changes and to obtain acoustic measurements of changes due to aging in the formant frequencies of selected spoken vowels and their long-term average spectra (LTAS) analysis. Thirty-eight young men and women and 38 elderly men and women were involved in the study. The oral and pharyngeal lumina of the participants were measured with AR technology, and their formant frequencies were analyzed using the Kay Elemetrics Computerized Speech Lab. The findings have delineated specific and similar patterns of aging changes in human vocal tract configurations in speakers of both genders. Namely, the oral cavity length and volume of elderly speakers increased significantly compared to their young cohorts. The total vocal tract volume of elderly speakers also showed a significant increment, whereas the total vocal tract length of elderly speakers did not differ significantly from their young cohorts. Elderly speakers of both genders also showed similar patterns of acoustic changes of speech production, that is, consistent lowering of formant frequencies (especially F1) across selected vowel productions. Although new research models are still needed to succinctly account for the speech acoustic changes of the elderly, especially for their specific patterns of human vocal tract dimensional changes, this study has innovatively applied the noninvasive and cost-effective AR technology to monitor age-related human oral and pharyngeal lumina changes that have direct consequences for speech production},

The present experiment uses this approach to compare speech perception in young and old listeners in terms of the traditional word recognition score (\%C), the ability to assess the accuracy of one's own identifications [P(A)], and the decision criterion used in that assessment (B). Monosyllables were presented in a background of broadband noise at two signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), 0 dB and 5 dB. Subjects recorded their identification of each test item and then rated their confidence in that identification on a six-point scale. Results indicated that in this particular task, neither \%C nor B differed between the two age groups, but both quantities varied with S/N. P(A) was the same for the two groups at S/N = 0 dB but differed at S/N = 5 dB. The young group showed significant improvement in P(A) from the 0-dB to the 5-dB S/N condition, while old subjects showed no change. These results suggest that young subjects are more able than older subjects to adapt to and take advantage of an improvement in the acoustic environment},

Factor analysis revealed that YMT consisted of two factors pertaining to short-term/working memory, and two factors pertaining to long-term memory. It is suggested that the former was more affected than the latter, with aging. In the second study, YMT was examined in relation to the revised version of Hasegawa dementia scale (HDS-R), which was the most popular intelligence scale for the elderly in Japan. As a result, memory functions differentially declined with the decreasing score of HDS-R, which suggests that memory functions differentially declined with progressive risk of dementia},

In fact the facilities, which are required for successful use of a GUI, are the very ones that deteriorate most markedly with age. Visual impairment, together with memory loss in particular, reduce the user's ability to build conceptual models of the working of the interface. The ability to navigate successfully and build strategies also deteriorates with age, an aspect which is especially important when moving from page to page on the World Wide Web. Interface design for older adults should acknowledge these factors. This paper reports the results of experiments, which show that there is a significant difference in spoken information retention between older and younger adults and that older visually impaired users retain more information from shorter messages in a speech output Web browser with voice help. The paper also discusses optimum levels of functionality for older adults, an important consideration when designing interfaces for Web access for this user group},

In addition, speech was more disrupted when the auditory input was returned to the right ear (left hemisphere) for all the different conditions: Normal and Delayed Auditory Feedback, normal and increased speaking rate. In particular, the left hemisphere was less resistant to the disruptive effect of the delayed feedback than the right hemisphere. From these results, we suggest that, when speaking more quickly, one uses more central mechanisms of movement programming (cortical-cerebellum-thalamus-cortical, cortical-corpus striatum-thalamus-cortical, and cortical-thalamus-cortical circuits), or attentional control (cortico-reticular-cortical circuits) than peripheral mechanisms (tactile, proprioceptive, and acoustic circuits). This may explain the decreased disruptive influence of delayed auditory feedback on speed, fluency, and quality at increased speaking rates. Hemispheric specialization processes, however, may explain the more pronounced susceptibility of the left hemisphere or the less pronounced susceptibility of the right hemisphere during the delayed feedback condition. In fact, the former processes phonemic, grammatical, and lexical features of words whilst the latter is competent in using metaphors and prosody in controlling the emotional aspects of language. Moreover, the right hemisphere is more active on attentional tasks},

The three elderly, brain-damaged and non-brain-damaged groups were unable to make a simple verbal discrimination, while the younger nonpatient group had a nearly perfect record of discrimination responses. No significant differences were obtained between the three elderly patient groups},

However, introducing new technology into a household raises a number of issues that must be considered prior to, during, and after the technology is implemented. This paper reviews the experiences of the UW-Madison Advanced Technologies for Health@Home Project, summarizing our assessment of household requirements that should be analyzed prior to introducing new technology. The overall goal of the Health@Home project is to improve the functionality and content of information technology innovations for the home. Using Venkatesh and Mazumdar's framework this article will summarize the relevant social, behavioral, technological, and physical dimensions of households that must be carefully assessed and understood to help ensure that the technology fits the needs of home residents},

Subjects read scripts either preceded by a thematic background or no theme. In Experiment 1, memory was tested either immediately or after 24 hr delay. Younger adults (aged 20-36) recalled more and were more accurate in recognition than were older adults (aged 57-87). Both younger and older subjects were affected by thematic information in delayed, but not in immediate recall. In Experiment 2, we presented a shorter narrative and memory was tested only after 24 hr. Younger subjects recalled more than older ones, but their recognition scores did not differ from those of the older adults. As in Experiment 1, there was no interaction of age with thematic information. The results of these studies suggest that older adults are as likely to integrate thematic information in remembering as younger ones},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to achieve the following goals: identifying the initial consonant sounds in Mandarin Chinese that can be selectively lost by aging people and proposing a filtering method to improve the hearing performance of the aging Chinese population. Past literatures reported that high-frequency hearing loss could produce difficulties for the characters like f, s, t and z in English. It was found in this study that the high-frequency initial consonants in Mandarin Chinese including t, f, s, p, q (as ch in chance), ch (no corresponding pronunciation in English), sh (as sh in sheep) and zh (no corresponding pronunciation in English). Furthermore, a filtering method to enhance the hearing performance of aging Chinese people was proposed which filtered the higher spectral components and boosted the lower spectral components for the older male Chinese, and filtered the lower spectral components and boosted the higher spectral components for the older female Chinese. Thirty participants whose native language is Mandarin Chinese voluntarily took part in the experiment. The result indicated that the above-mentioned eight initial consonants were associated with a higher error rate of speech recognition than the other ones in Chinese. At the same time, the proposed method successfully reduced the error rate of speech recognition, which achieved the goal to improve the speech recognition ability of older Chinese. Relevance for Industry The results of this study will benefit information technology companies that wish to develop software or information services for older Chinese. In addition, by applying the filtering method proposed in this study, the performance of hearing aids is also expected to be improved.},
