                 continuously updated knowledge on these interactions is
                 massive and is only available in the form of published
                 articles, an intelligent information extraction (IE)
                 system is needed. To extract these information directly
                 from articles, the system must firstly identify the

                 documents often include proper nouns newly made by the

                 specific dictionaries cannot detect such unknown words

                 development of a computer system to help extracting
                 pertinent information from texts, relying on advanced
                 linguistic tools, completed with object-oriented

                 this challenging objective, a program for the
                 identification of gene symbols and names inside
                 sentences has been devised. The main difficulty is that
                 these names and symbols do not appear to follow
                 construction rules. The program is thus made up of a
                 series of sieves of different natures, lexical,
                 morphological and semantic, to distinguish among the
                 words of a sentence those which can only be potential
                 gene symbols or names. Its performance has been
                 evaluated, in terms of coverage and precision ratios,
                 on a corpus of texts concerning D. melanogaster for
