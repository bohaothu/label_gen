    We perform Noun Phrase Bracketing by using a local, maximum
    entropy-based tagging model, which produces bracketing hypotheses.
    These hypotheses are subsequently fed into a reranking framework based
    on support vector machines.  We solve the problem of hierarchical
    structure in our tagging model by modeling underspecified tags, which
    are fully determined only at decoding time.  The tagging model
    performs comparably to competing approaches and the subsequent
    reranking increases our system's performance from an f-score of $81.7$
    to $86.1$, surpassing the best reported results to date of $83.8$.
