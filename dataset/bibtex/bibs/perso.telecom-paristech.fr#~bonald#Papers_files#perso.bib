abstract={When IEEE 802.11 access points (APs) share the same channel in a multi-cell WLAN, their downlink transmissions can interfere. Typically, an AP whose scheduled transmission to some user is blocked by another cell will apply the CSMA/CA back-off algorithm and continue to make reattempts to the same user. Through analytical models and simulations, we demonstrate that significant capacity gains can be attained by choosing an alternative destination for the reattempt. Results demonstrate that a simple random choice of alternative destination brings almost the same gain as a more sophisticated algorithm that seeks to maximize spatial reuse.},

abstract={We investigate the stability of utility-maximizing allocations in networks with arbitrary rate regions. We consider a dynamic setting where users randomly generate data flows according to some exogenous traffic processes. Network stability is then defined as the ergodicity of the process describing the number of active flows. When the rate region is convex, the stability region is known to coincide with the rate region, independently of the considered utility function. We show that for non-convex rate regions, the choice of the utility function is crucial to ensure maximum stability. The results are illustrated on the simple case of a wireless network consisting of two interacting base stations.},

abstract={We consider a network whose resources are shared by a dynamic number of data flows according to balanced fairness. We give explicit bounds on the mean throughput that results from this stochastic resource sharing when the capacity constraints are linear. We illustrate the results on a few examples of wireline and wireless networks.},
