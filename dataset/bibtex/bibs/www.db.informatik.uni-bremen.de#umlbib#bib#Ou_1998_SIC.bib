  abstract =     "In the course of object-oriented software engineering,
                  the UML class diagrams are used to specify the static
                  structure of the system under study, such as classes,
                  types and various kinds of static relationships among
                  them. Objects of the persistent classes can be stored in
                  object-oriented databases or in relational databases. In
                  the former case, the UML class diagrams are actually used
                  for conceptual object-oriented database designs. However,
                  the standard UML class diagram lacks the ability to
                  specify some inherent integrity constraints, such as keys
                  and uniqueness, for object-oriented databases. This paper
                  proposes an extension to the UML metamodel, i.e., the
                  introduction of two new model elements (key and
                  IConstraint) and some new attributes to the existing
                  metamodel, to accommodate more constraint specification.
                  In the model level, a compartment CONSTRAINT to the class
                  notation and some property strings for displaying the
                  integrity constraints are added. The database design is
                  then mapped to the extended ODMG-ODL schema definition.",
