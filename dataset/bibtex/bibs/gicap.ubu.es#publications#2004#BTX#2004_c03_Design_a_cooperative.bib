  abstract = {The paper presents an agent-based engineering system developed for
	mobile devices. The proposed system has been used for constructing
	a wireless tourist guide application that incorporates cooperative
	agents with the learning capabilities. It is shown how to construct
	cooperative agents with a goal driven design using a case-based reasoning
	methodology. The resulting architecture has been tested by real users
	during six months and the results obtained are here presented.},
