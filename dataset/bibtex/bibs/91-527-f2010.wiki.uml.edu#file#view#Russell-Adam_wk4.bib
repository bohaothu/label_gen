Abstract = {Abstract In communicating information about geometric figures, one drawing may be worth many hundreds of words and, therefore, visualisation aids for complicated three-dimensional (3-D) solid objects are very helpful for both teacher and students. This paper describes the use of the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) to visualise 3-D objects for middle school geometry classes in a networked environment and shows its usefulness for both teacher and students. In class, the teachers use VRML objects retrieved from their server and students are allowed to explore these objects accessing the teachers' server via the world-wide web. A comparison of the test results from VRML-based geometry classes and traditional classes, that solely depend on verbal explanation with paper and pencil, show that the application of VRML-based 3-D objects has a positive affect on students' learning of geometric topics.

GeoThms is a web-based framework for exploring geometrical knowledge that integrates Dynamic Geometry Software (DGS), Automatic Theorem Provers (ATP), and a repository of geometrical constructions, figures and proofs. The GeoThms users can easily use/browse through existing geometrical content and build new contents. In this paper we describe GeoThms functionalities, focusing on the interface solutions required for a system aimed at supporting studying and teaching geometry via Internet. GeoThms is a publicly accessible system with a growing body of geometrical constructions and formally proven geometrical theorems. We believe that, with the help of all its users it will become an important Internet resource for geometry."
