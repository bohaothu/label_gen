	No normalized solutions exist specifically for the supervision of
	home automation systems and the definition of the required behavior
	for a home. In this paper we tackle this problem. We start by presenting
	an abstract model for home automation devices, independent of the
	technology used. Next we address system supervision and propose a
	model to specify the intended behavior for a home. This model is
	easily understood by common users and allows building generic interfaces
	to define and modify the behavior of homes. Finally, we propose a
	decentralized architecture to implement our system supervision approach,
	offering a flexible and scalable solution.},
