We show by math-  ematical modeling that the answer is positive if we assume an  individuals social network evolves in time.

abstract = {The growth in knowledge sharing enabled by the (Se-  mantic) Web has made trust an increasingly critical issue.  Based on explicit inter-agent trust relations, a trust network  emerges on the (Semantic) Web in the knowledge sharing  context. The concept of a trust network and its application  to knowledge sharing have received recent attention but nei-  ther their structural properties (e.g. dynamics, complexity)  nor inference mechanisms (e.g. trust discovery, trust evo-  lution, trust propagation) have been well addressed. This  paper formalizes trust network inference notions, provid-  ing both data and computational models, and suggests an  evaluation model for benchmarking. The data model clari-  fies the data (context, restriction, output) used by trust net-  work inference for knowledge sharing. It also elaborates  trust network representation and articulates different types  of trust. The computational model reviews graph theory  and referral network interpretations of trust network infer-  ence and proposes a new one that treats trust network as  an emergent property. This new model supports both trust  evolution and trust propagation. The evaluation model de-  scribes metrics as well as methods to generate test scenar-  ios and data. We argue that this approach is more customiz-  able, flexible and scalable than traditional approaches such  as public reputation systems and collaborative filtering. },

The self-organization of P2P systems demands for the distribution of  the reputation system to the autonomous entities themselves. They may  cooperate by issuing recommendations of other entities trustworthiness.  The recipient of a recommendation has to assess its truthfulness and  consistency before taking it into account. The current assessment meth-  ods are based on plausibility considerations that have several inherent  limitations. In our previous work, we have suggested the application of  non-repudiable tokens that overcome most of the limitations. However,  there remain limitations that are not overcome or only partly overcome.  Therefore, in this paper, we propose social structure as a complementary  means of overcoming the remaining limitations of plausibility considera-  tions. For this purpose, we examine the properties of social structure and  discuss how distributed reputation systems can make use of them. This  leads us to the formulation of three hypotheses of how social structure  overcomes the limitations of plausibility considerations. The hypotheses  are tested by the means of simulation. The simulation results corroborate  two hypotheses and indicate the validity of the third hypothesis.},

abstract = {We devise a model to study the phenomenon of free-riding and free-identities in peer-to-peer systems. At the heart of our model is a user of a certain type, an intrinsic and private parameter that reflects the user's willingness to contribute resources to the system. A user decides whether to contribute or free-ride based on how the current contribution cost in the system compares to her type. We study the impact of mechanisms that exclude low type users or, more realistically, penalize free-riders with degraded service. We also consider dynamic scenarios with arrivals and departures of users, and with whitewashers -users who leave the system and rejoin with new identities to avoid reputational penalties. We find that imposing penalty on all users that join the system is effective under many scenarios. In particular, system performance degrades significantly only when the turnover rate among users is high. Finally, we show that the optimal exclusion or penalty level differs significantly from the level that optimizes the performance of contributors only for a limited range of societal generosity levels.},

abstract = {In open settings, the participants are autonomous and there is no  central authority to ensure the felicity of their interactions. When  agents interact in such settings, each relies upon being able to model  the trustworthiness of the agents with whom it interacts. Fundamentally, such models must consider the past behavior of the other  parties in order to predict their future behavior. Further, it is sensible for the agents to share information via referrals to trustworthy  agents. Much progress has recently been made on probabilistic trust models including those that support the aggregation of information from multiple sources. However, current models do not  support trust updates, leaving updates to be handled in an ad hoc manner. This paper proposes a trust representation that combines probabilities and certainty (defined as a function of a probability-certainty  density function). Further, it offers a trust update mechanism to  estimate the trustworthiness of referrers. This paper describes a  testbed that goes beyond existing testbeds to enable the evaluation  of a composite probability-certainty model. It then evaluates the  proposed trust model showing that the trust model can (a) estimate  trustworthiness of damping and capricious agents correctly, (b) up-  date trust values of referrers accurately, and (c) resolve the conflicts  in referral networks by certainty discounting.},

abstract = {Economic transactions often rely on trust. For instance,  sellers usually know more than buyers about items or ser-  vices offered and could misrepresent them. Without trust,  mutually beneficial transactions may not take place, result-  ing in economic loss [4]. Fortunately, with repeated trans-  actions, reputations [9] can encourage truthful behavior and  have been applied to e-commerce in the form of ratings, such  as those used by eBay. However, reputation mechanisms can  be manipulated through collusion by groups of friends or the  creation of false identities. One approach to this problem  uses the growing availability of online social networks. These  consist of links among individuals indicating various social  relationships. Services building online social networks, such  as Friendster, LinkedIn, and Spoke  1  , have rapidly acquired  millions of users and assist them in forming new social or  business contacts through those they already have. These  existing contacts are either entered manually or gathered  automatically, e.g., from email, instant messaging, and the  web of trust for decentralized cryptographic keys [6].  We consider two uses of social networks for reputation  mechanisms: as an automated aid to identify reputation  based on position in the network, and as a filtering tool for  users ratings. The thresholds and weights we describe can  be efficiently computed using the network structure. },

abstract = {Current computational trust models are usually built either  on an agents direct experience of an interaction partner (in-  teraction trust) or reports provided by third parties about  their experiences with a partner (witness reputation). How-  ever, both of these approaches have their limitations. Mod-  els using direct experience often result in poor performance  until an agent has had a sufficient number of interactions  to build up a reliable picture of a particular partner and  witness reports rely on self-interested agents being willing  to freely share their experience. To this end, this paper  presents Certified Reputation (CR), a novel model of trust  that can overcome these limitations. Specifically, CR works  by allowing agents to actively provide third-party references  about their previous performance as a means of building up  the trust in them of their potential interaction partners. By  so doing, trust relationships can quickly be established with  very little cost to the involved parties. Here we empirically  evaluate CR and show that it helps agents pick better in-  teraction partners more quickly than models that do not  incorporate this form of trust.  },

abstract = {In this dissertation I develop a theoretical model on the effects of risk on the formation of trust  in the initial stages of a relationship. Risk is proposed to influence trust in two ways: First,  risk exerts a direct influence on trust. Risk may decrease trust, increase trust, or increase trust  under specific conditions. Second, risk may affect the level of trust indirectly by influencing  the effect of social stimuli on the formation of trust. In this second indirect effect of risk, risk  is first proposed to influence the content of trust, or what trust is about as represented in the  importance a trustor attaches to benevolence or ability. Moreover and related to the effect of  risk on the form of trust,  risk is further proposed to affect what people seek to know or the  informational goals people adopt, and the interpretive schemas people use while processing  social stimuli.     In describing the indirect effect of risk on the formation of trust, I differentiate between role-  based and personal trust. Role-based trust emphasizes ability and reliability and is vested in  peoples structural expectations toward social and professional roles. Personal trust  emphasizes benevolence and is vested in a trustors appraisal of the personal traits and  motivations of a trustee. High risk, I argue will activate personal trust, and cause people to  interpret information in light of a person schema whereas low risk is proposed to activate role-  based trust and should cause people to interpret information in light of a role schema. Unlike  conventional models of trust formation and development, which see trust as being based on  declarative knowledge; the present model argue that trust in the initial stages of a relationship  will be based on peoples experience with information processing and their experiences of  fluency in information processing and relevance. Social stimuli that are structurally congruent  with active interpretive schemas as well as relevant to active informational goals will increase  trust whereas incongruent and irrelevant information should reduce trust.   },

abstract = {Trust networks consist of transitive trust relationships  between people, organisations and software agents con-  nected through a medium for communication and inter-  action. By formalising a trust relationships, e.g. as rep-  utation scores or as subjective trust measures, trust be-  tween parties within the community can be derived by  analysing the trust paths linking the parties together. This  article describes a method for trust network analysis using  subjective logic (TNA-SL). It provides a simple notation  for expressing transitive trust relationships, and defines  a method for simplifying complex trust networks so that  they can be expressed in a concise form and be computa-  tionally analysed. Trust measures are expressed as beliefs,  and subjective logic is used to compute trust between ar-  bitrary parties in the network. We show that TNA-SL is  efficient, and illustrate possible applications with exam-  ples.  },

abstract = {Trust and reputation systems represent a significant trend in decision support for Internet  mediated service provision. The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example  after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party  to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or  not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides  an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market  quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their  collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems  are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly  growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not  very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed  systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transac-  tions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research  agenda for trust and reputation systems.  },

abstract = {Agents evolving in a multi-agent system interact with one another to  achieve their individual goals. In trust-based agent models, agents form a local  view of their environment from their direct interactions, and base their interaction  decisions on the trustworthiness of the other agents. Agents can also obtain rec-  ommendations about other agents from third parties, either directly or indirectly.  Reputation complements trust from direct interactions in providing information  for agent selection. While trust and reputation ensure that an agent selects and  interacts with the most appropriate provider, we believe that the agent can learn  about the agent relationships and interconnections at the same time. By build-  ing a network of agents it interacts with, and with information about interaction  details, trustworthiness, recommendation chain and reputation, the agent is in a  better position to extract emergent information, such as potential new customers,  suppliers, its competitors and potentially collusive groups of agents. In this pa-  per we propose a mechanism for agents to build a representation of their local  environment based on direct interactions, trust and reputation.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is an inherent characteristic in most industrial processes, and a variety of approaches including sensitivity analysis, robust optimization and stochastic programming have been proposed to deal with such uncertainty. Uncertainty in a steady state nonlinear real-time optimization (RTO) system and particularly making robust decisions under uncertainty in real-time has received little attention. This paper discusses various sources of uncertainty within such closed loop RTO systems and a method, based on stochastic programming, that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into the RTO problem is presented. The proposed method is limited to situations where uncertain parameters enter the constraints nonlinearly and uncertain economics enter the objective function linearly. Our approach is shown to significantly improve the probability of a feasible solution in comparison to more conventional RTO techniques. A gasoline blending example is used to demonstrate the proposed robust RTO approach.},

Both these approaches are vulnerable to attacks by malicious peers who could abuse the P2P system to spread viruses, incorrect, or damaging information. Here, we propose an approach for trust management in P2P systems. We introduce an optimistic role-based model for trust amongst peers and show that it is scalable, dynamic, revocable, secure and transitive. Our proposed solution permits asymmetric trust relationships that can be verified by any peer in the system through a simple, low-cost algorithm. We introduce a metric known as iComplex that combines a peer's trust value for each of its roles into a single, relative, probabilistic guarantee of trust. Finally, we discuss how our trust model allows peers to revoke relationships with malicious peers, and the nonrepudiation of peer relations. We use simulations to illustrate the trust value distribution amongst peers in the network. Our analysis and experiments demonstrates the low-cost involved to verify and validate trust values. Lastly, we establish the effectiveness of using sum as the aggregation function to combine trust values of a peer.},

But when dealing with real-time systems, special forms of uncertainty provide even greater challenges. Why should this be? The short answer is that real-time systems must add the assurance of temporal correctness to the already difficult task of sensor interface and device control. But the problem is really more complicated than that. In this article, the author examines the nature of uncertainty in real-time systems. While looking briefly at some traditional mathematical models of uncertainty, emphasis on this article is on the identification of uncertainty through telltale behaviors and "code smells." Then, techniques for managing, mitigating, or eliminating the uncertainty will be given.},

abstract = {Given a huge real graph, how can we derive a representa-  tive sample? There are many known algorithms to compute  interesting measures (shortest paths, centrality, between-  ness, etc.), but several of them become impractical for large  graphs. Thus graph sampling is essential.  The natural questions to ask are (a) which sampling method  to use, (b) how small can the sample size be, and (c) how  to scale up the measurements of the sample (e.g., the di-  ameter), to get estimates for the large graph. The deeper,  underlying question is subtle: how do we measure success?  We answer the above questions, and test our answers by  thorough experiments on several, diverse datasets, spanning  thousands nodes and edges. We consider several sampling  methods, propose novel methods to check the goodness of  sampling, and develop a set of scaling laws that describe re-  lations between the properties of the original and the sample.  In addition to the theoretical contributions, the practical  conclusions from our work are: Sampling strategies based on  edge selection do not perform well; simple uniform random  node selection performs surprisingly well. Overall, best per-  forming methods are the ones based on random-walks and  forest fire; they match very accurately both static as well  as evolutionary graph patterns, with sample sizes down to  about 15% of the original graph.},

abstract = {Trust has never been a topic of mainstream sociology. Neither classical authors nor modern sociologists use the term in a theoretical context. For this reason the elaboration of theoretical frameworks, one of the main sources of conceptual clarification, has been relatively neglected. Furthermore, empirical research - for example, research about trust and distrust in politics - has relied on rather general and unspecified ideas, confusing problems of trust with positive or negative attitudes toward political leadership or political institutions, with alienation (itself a multidimensional concept), with hopes and worries, or with confidence. In their monograph on patrons, clients, and friends, Shmuel Eisenstadt and Luis Roniger (1984) use the concept of trust as roughly equivalent to solidarity, meaning, and participation. This makes it possible to show that unconditional trust is generated in families and small-scale societies and cannot be automatically transferred to complex societies based on the division of labour. Trust, then, needs for its reconstruction special social institutions; friendship networks and patron-client relations are examples for this adaptation. But this is merely to reiterate well-known statements about the division of labour and the need to reconstruct solidarity, about Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft. It does not give any new insight into the particularities of trusting relations. To gain such insights we need further conceptual clarification.},

abstract = {Purpose  Mobile ad hoc networks rely on cooperation to perform essential network mechanisms such as routing. Therefore, network performance depends to a great extent on giving participating nodes an incentive for cooperation. The level of trust among nodes is the most frequently used parameter for promoting cooperation in distributed systems. There are different models for representing trust, each of which is suited to a particular context and leads to different procedures for computing and propagating trust. The goal of this study is to analyze the most representative approaches for mobile ad hoc networks. It aims to obtain a qualitative comparison of the modeling approaches, according to the three basic components of a trust model: information gathering, information scoring and ranking, and action execution.\newline{\newline}Design/methodology/approach  The paper identifies the different tasks required by a trust system and compares the way they are implemented when the system model itself is based on information theory, social networks, cluster concept, graph theory and game theory. It also provides a common nomenclature for the models. The study concentrates exclusively on the trust models themselves, without taking into account other aspects of the original articles that are beyond the scope of this analysis.\newline{\newline}Findings  The study identifies the main components that a trust model must provide, and compares the way they are implemented. It finds that the lack of unity in the different proposed approaches makes it difficult to conduct an objective comparison. Finally, it also notices that most of the models do not properly manage node reintegration.\newline{\newline}Originality/value  The best of our knowledge, the study is the first that uses information scoring and ranking as classification key. According to this key, approaches can be classified as based on information theory, clusters and social network theory, and cooperative and non-cooperative game theory. It also provides a common nomenclature for all of them. Finally, the main contribution of the paper is to provide an analysis of the most representative approaches and present a novel qualitative comparison.},

abstract = {Theorists have only recently shown that cooperation through indirect reciprocity can evolve. The rst modelling approach favoured a mechanism called image scoring. Helping someone increases ones image score, whereas refusing to help reduces it. The evolutionary outcome was a discriminator image scoring strategy that helps everybody who has, for example, a positive image score. Two experimental studies with humans found results that were compatible with discriminator image scoring. However, a new analysis of other theorists, based on another population structure, has cast doubts on the evolutionary stability of strategies using the recipients score as a sole basis for decision. The new theoretical study conrmed that a strategy aiming at `good standing has superior properties and easily beats image scoring. An individual loses good standing by failing to help a recipient in good standing, whereas failing to help recipients who lack good standing does not damage the standing of a potential donor (but would reduce his image score). The present empirical study with 23 groups of seven human subjects each was designed for distinguishing between the two proposed mechanisms experimentally. The results diered strongly from standing strategies, which might demand too much working memory capacity, but were compatible with image scoring or a similar strategy to a large extent. Furthermore, donors of constant `NO players compensated for their refusing to help these players by being more generous to others.},

abstract = {Trust is a crucial basis for interactions among parties in large, open distributed  systems. Yet, the scale and dynamism of such systems make it infeasible for each party  to have a direct basis for trusting another party. For this reason, the participants in an  open system must share information about trust. Traditional models of trust employ simple  heuristics and ad hoc formulas, without adequate mathematical justification. These models  fail to properly address the challenges of combining trust from conflicting sources, dealing  with malicious agents, and updating trust.  This dissertation understands an agent Alices trust in an agent Bob in terms of  Alices certainty in her belief that Bob is trustworthy. Unlike previous approaches, this  dissertation formulates certainty in terms of a statistical measure defined over a probability  distribution of the probability of positive outcomes.  Specifically this dissertation makes the following contributions. It   Develops a mathematically well-formulated approach for an evidence-based account  of trust; proves desirable properties of certainty; and establishes a bijection between  evidence and trust.   Defines a concatenation, an aggregation, and a selection operator to propagate trust,  and proves desirable properties of these operators.   Develops trust update mechanisms and formally analyzes their properties.   Extends the definition of certainty from binary events to multivalued events. Es-  tablishes a bijection between Dempster-Shafer belief space and evidence space, and  defines a novel combination operator, which is commutative and associative. In con-  trast with traditional combination operators, which ignore conflict and sometimes  yield counterintuitive results, the proposed operator treats conflict naturally.},

abstract = {Social networks have the surprising property of being searchable: ordinary people are capable  of directing messages through their network of acquaintances to reach a specific but distant  target person in only a few steps. We present a model that offers an explanation of social  network searchability in terms of recognizable personal identities defined along a number of  social dimensions. Our model defines a class of searchable networks and a method for searching  them that may be applicable to many network search problems including the location of data  files in peer-to-peer networks, pages on the World Wide Web, and information in distributed  databases.  },

@article{Zhang2002,
abstract = {Uncertainty is an inherent characteristic in most industrial processes, and a variety of approaches including sensitivity analysis, robust optimization and stochastic programming have been proposed to deal with such uncertainty. Uncertainty in a steady state nonlinear real-time optimization (RTO) system and particularly making robust decisions under uncertainty in real-time has received little attention. This paper discusses various sources of uncertainty within such closed loop RTO systems and a method, based on stochastic programming, that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into the RTO problem is presented. The proposed method is limited to situations where uncertain parameters enter the constraints nonlinearly and uncertain economics enter the objective function linearly. Our approach is shown to significantly improve the probability of a feasible solution in comparison to more conventional RTO techniques. A gasoline blending example is used to demonstrate the proposed robust RTO approach.},
