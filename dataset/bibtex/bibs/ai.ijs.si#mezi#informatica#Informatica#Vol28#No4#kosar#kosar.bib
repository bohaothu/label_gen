  abstract =     "The language design process should be supported by modularity and abstraction in a manner that allows
                 incremental changes as easily as possible. To at least partially fulfill this ambitious goal a new
                 object-oriented attribute grammar specification language which support multiple attribute grammar
                 inheritance is introduced. Multiple attribute grammar inheritance is a structural organization of
                 attribute grammars where the attribute grammar inherits the specifications from ancestor attribute
                 grammars, may add new specifications or may override some specifications from ancestors specifications.
                 With the proposed approach a language designer has the chance to design incrementally a language or
                 reuse some fragments from other programming language specifications. The multiple attribute grammar
                 inheritance is first introduced using an example, and thereafter by a formal model. The proposed
                 approach is successfully implemented in the compiler/interpreter generator tool LISA ver. 2.0.",
