  abstract =     "This procedure computes the Fresnel sine and cosine
                 integrals $C(w) = \int_0^\infty \cos [(\pi/2)t^2]\,dt$
                 and $S(w) = \int_0^w \sin [(\pi/2)t^2]\,dt$. It is a
                 modification of Algorithm 213 (Comm. ACM, 6 (Oct.
                 1963), 617) such that the accuracy, expressed by
                 \textit{eps}, is improved. eps can arbitrarily be
                 chosen up to $\textit{eps} = 10^{-6}$ for a computer
                 with sufficient word length as, for example, the
                 Burroughs B5000 which has 11--12 significant digits.
                 Referring to the formulas of Algorithm 213: if $|w| <
                 \sqrt{(26.20/\pi)}$ the series expansions $C(w)$ and
                 $S(w)$ are terminated when the absolute value of the
                 relative change in two successive terms is $\leq
                 \textit{eps}$. If $|w| \geq \sqrt{(26.20/\pi)}$ the
                 series $Q(x)$ and $P(x)$ are terminated when the
                 absolute value of the terms is $\leq \textit{eps}/2$.
                 However, this truncation point is not necessarily valid
                 for the range $\sqrt{(26.20/\pi)} \leq |w| <
                 \sqrt{(28.50/\pi)}$ when $\textit{eps} = 10^{-6}$,
                 since the asymptotic series must be terminated before
                 arriving at the minimum. In this range the ignored
                 terms of the series expansions are $< 3 \times 10^{6}$,
                 and for larger arguments $< 10^{-6}$. This accuracy may
                 be improved if desired: the switch-over point from the
                 regular to the asymptotic series expansions has to be
                 displaced to larger arguments.",

                 methods of determining the coefficients of the

                 the differential equation which defines the function.

                 adds, high-speed table lookups, and bit counting. The

                 pair $(x, y)$ such that the $F(x, y) = f(x_0)$ is
                 invariant; when $x$ is driven towards a known value
                 $x_w$, $y$ is driven towards the result. For an $N$-bit
                 fraction about $N / 4$ iterations are required, each
                 involving two or three adds; then a termination

                 algorithms for some elementary functions which use fast
                 parallel $m$-bit multipliers where $\mathrm{radix} =
                 2^m$. These algorithms are extensions of those
                 iterative schemes which are based on multiplications by
                 $(1 + 2^{-i})$ and the use of prestored values of $\ln
                 (1 + 2^{-i})$ and $\tan^{-1}(2^{-i})$. The particular
                 functions under consideration are $y/x$, $y/x^{1/2}$,
                 $y exp (x)$, $y + \ln (x)$, $\sin (x)$ and $\cos (x)$
                 [and hence $\tan (x)$]. The extended algorithms rely on
                 multiplication by $(1 + \mathrm{dir}^{-k})$ where
                 $\mathrm{dir}$, $0 \leq \mathrm{dir}$, is an $m$-bit
                 integer. Using a simple selection procedure for
                 $\mathrm{dir}$, simulations show that $p$ (radix $r$)
                 digits of a function may be generated, on the average,

                 evaluated numerically by successive applications of the
                 duplication theorem. When the convergence is improved
                 by including a fixed number of terms of Taylor's
                 series, the error ultimately decreases by a factor of
                 4096 in each cycle of iteration. Except for Cauchy
                 principal values there is no separation of cases
                 according to the values of the variables, and no
                 serious cancellations occur if the variables are real
                 and nonnegative. Only rational operations and square
                 roots are required. An appendix contains a recurrence

                 Suppose such a relation has been proved in the simplest
                 case when $X_1, \ldots{}, X_n$ are independent variates
                 having an arbitrary absolutely continuous distribution.
                 It is pointed out that the same relation continues to
                 hold when the $X$'s are exchangeable, whether
                 continuous or not. As has recently become well known,
                 further generalizations are possible when the $X$'s
                 have any joint distribution. Attention is also drawn to
                 a useful nonlinear recurrence relation due to Boncelet

                 to compare the rounding-error behavior of numerical
                 programs. The models follow the approach, popularized
                 by Wilkinson, of assuming independent rounding errors
                 in each arithmetic operation. Models constructed on
                 this assumption are more tractable than would be the
                 case under more realistic assumptions. There are
                 identified two easily tested conditions on programs
                 which guarantee that error analyses are relatively
                 insensitive to the particular graph model employed. The
                 development has the additional benefit of sometimes
                 providing an elementary proof that one program is
                 comparable in stability to another. Examples of such

                 COTAN, LOG, LOG10, EXP, POWER, SQRT, ATAN, ASIN, ACOS,
                 ATAN2, and CABS, in scalar (28 functions) and vector

                 of the new VS FORTRAN library recently announced along
                 with the IBM 3090 Vector Facility. These algorithms are
                 essentially table-based algorithms. An important
                 feature of these algorithms is that they produce
                 bitwise-identical results on scalar and vector
                 System\slash 370 machines. Of these, for five functions
                 the computed value result is always the correctly
                 rounded value of the infinite-precision result. For the

                 two floating-point neighbors bordering the
                 infinite-precision result, which implies exact results
                 if they are machine-representable. For the five
                 correctly rounded elementary functions, scalar and

                 percentage of time that operations are carried out
                 relative to the time that the operating theater is
                 available. The numerator of the percentage is a
                 weighted sum of the times required to carry out
                 different kinds of operations, where the weights are
                 the numbers of operations of each kind to be performed.
                 Since different kinds of operations have different mean
                 times, this sum has a skewed distribution.\par

                 Based on the Central Limit Theorem, the normal
                 distribution is the most widely used approximation to
                 the distribution of a weighted sum of random variables.
                 However, this approximation is not very good if the sum
                 has a skewed distribution.\par

                 In a separate paper [1], the author derived an
                 alternative approximation based on the first four
                 moments of the sum. In the present paper, he applies
                 this approximation to the operating theater problem by
                 estimating the moments of the times of the different
                 kinds of operations. The paper also contains a Monte
                 Carlo comparison of the normal approximation with the
                 proposed approximation for four underlying
                 distributions of the sum.",

                 rounding errors are considered. The desired accuracy of
                 the function as well as the base of the number system

                 implementation it is only assumed that the four

                 certain number of correct digits of the function value.

                 routines considering the monotonicity behaviour of the

                 integers and real numbers is developed. The procedure
                 consists of two parts: one to obtain a close estimate
                 of the square root and the other to modify the initial
                 value, iteratively, until a precise root is evaluated.
                 The major effort in this development has been
                 concentrated on two objectives: high speed and no
                 division operation other than division by 2. The first
                 objective is achieved through a simple two-step
                 procedure for getting the first estimate, and then
                 modifying it by employing a fast converging iteration
                 technique. The second objective is also fulfilled
                 through applying bit-shift operation rather than
                 division operation. The algorithm is simulated for both
                 integer and real numbers, and the results are compared
                 to two methods being widely used. The results
                 (tabulated) show considerable improvement in speed
                 compared to these other two methods.",

                 Center for the elementary mathematical library using
                 the IEEE standard for binary floating point arithmetic
                 are described. The algorithms are based on the
                 ``accurate tables method.'' This methodology achieves
                 high performance and produces very accurate results. It
                 overcomes one of the main problems encountered in
                 elementary mathematical functions computations:
                 achieving last bit accuracy. The results obtained are
                 correctly rounded for almost all argument values.
                 \par

                 Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use
                 ``nonstandard tables,'' which are different from the
                 natural tables of equally spaced points in which the
                 rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In
                 order to achieve a small error we use the following
                 idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in
                 such a way that the table value (or tables values in
                 case we need several tables) will be very close to
                 numbers which can be exactly represented by the
                 computer (much closer than the usual double precision
                 representation). Thus we were able to control the error
                 introduced by the computer representation of real
                 numbers and extended the accuracy without actually
                 using extended precision arithmetic.",

                 intervals can be extended in a fuzzy-set approach,
                 distinguishing between more or less plausible values.
                 The simultaneous use of relatively wide intervals
                 containing all possible values, and generally much
                 narrower intervals covering only the most likely ones,
                 can give sufficiently informative results. Some
                 precautions advisable in arithmetic operations on
                 imprecisely known quantities are outlined. Examples of
                 application include provisional budgeting, resource

                 PERT to projects involving precedence among elementary

  abstract =     "The author describes two Fortran utilities for
                 multiprecision computation. The first is a package of
                 Fortran subroutines that perform a variety of
                 arithmetic operations and transcendental functions on
                 floating point numbers of arbitrarily high precision.
                 This package is in some cases over 200 times faster
                 than that of certain other packages that have been
                 developed for this purpose. The second utility is a
                 translator program, which facilitates the conversion of
                 ordinary Fortran programs to use this package. By means
                 of source directives (special comments) in the original
                 Fortran program, the user declares the precision level
                 and specifies which variables in each subprogram are to
                 be treated as multiprecision. The translator program
                 reads this source program and outputs a program with
                 the appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls. This
                 translator supports multiprecision integer, real, and
                 complex datatypes. The required array space for
                 multiprecision data types is automatically allocated.
                 In the evaluation of computational expressions, all of
                 the usual conventions for operator precedence and mixed
                 mode operations are upheld. Furthermore, most of the
                 Fortran-77 intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP
                 are supported and produce true multiprecision values.",

                 arithmetic for floating point numbers. An accurate
                 definition of the four elementary floating-point
                 operations +, -, *, / is given in the IEEE standards
                 for floating-point arithmetic and was well established
                 long before. An increasing number of computers
                 (especially PC's and workstations) feature IEEE
                 arithmetic. In many numerical algorithms, however,
                 compound operations such as the summation of a sequence
                 of numbers or the dot product of two vectors are highly
                 common. A simulation of these compound operations by
                 means of elementary floating-point operations leads to
                 accumulation of rounding errors and may suffer from
                 catastrophic cancellation of leading digits. Existing
                 standards for floating-point arithmetic do not improve
                 this situation. The goal of the proposal is to define
                 vector operations in a manner consistent with the
                 elementary scalar arithmetic operations. The rounding
                 modes and accuracy requirements as well as the data
                 formats of the operands and results of the vector
                 operations described in the proposal are chosen to be

                 rounded results for the functions of reciprocal, square
                 root, 2/sup x/, and log 2/sup x/. Hardware designs
                 based on this algorithm are presented for floating
                 point numbers with 16- and 24-b significands. These
                 designs use a polynomial approximation in which
                 coefficients are originally selected based on the
                 Chebyshev series approximation and are then adjusted to
                 ensure exactly rounded results for all inputs. To
                 reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the
                 input interval is divided into subintervals of equal
                 size and different coefficients are used for each
                 subinterval. For floating point numbers with 16-b
                 significands, the exactly rounded value of the function
                 can be computed in 51 ns on a 20-mm/sup 2/ chip. For
                 floating point numbers with 24-b significands, the
                 functions can be computed in 80 ns on a 98-mm/sup 2/

                 operations require an initial approximation. The
                 Newton--Raphson algorithm starts with an approximation
                 and then quadratically converges on the solution. The
                 initial approximation determines the number of
                 iterations of the algorithm and is typically
                 implemented as a look-up table in the form of a ROM or
                 PLA. A novel method is suggested which describes
                 high-order arithmetic operations with a partial product
                 array. This method applies to the operations of
                 division, reciprocal, square root, natural logarithm,
                 exponential, and trigonometric functions. The partial
                 product array of Boolean elements which describes the
                 operation can be summed on an existing floating-point
                 multiplier. The hardware needed is only the logic gates
                 to create the Boolean elements in the array and a
                 multiplexor, and the latency is that of the multiplier.
                 Thus, by reusing a floating-point multiplier, a
                 high-precision approximation to a high-order arithmetic
                 operation can be implemented with a low marginal
                 cost.\par

                 This dissertation describes the implementation and
                 shows a method for deriving partial product arrays to
                 approximate arithmetic operations. Then the proposed
                 method is applied and evaluated for several operations.
                 The proposed method yields a minimum approximation of
                 twelve bits correct for the reciprocal operation and
                 sixteen bits for the square root operation. The
                 proposed method is shown to be as small as 0.05\% the
                 size (in gates) of an equivalent precision look-up
                 table and has up to four times the accuracy (in bits)
                 as an equivalent latency polynomial approximation.
                 Also, three new iterative algorithms to increase the
                 precision of the approximations and a theoretical
                 analysis of the partial product array representation
                 are detailed. Thus, high-radix algorithms of many
                 arithmetic operations are possible at low cost.",

                 approximations to functions of one real variable are
                 described in the present paper; the computational
                 results that characterize the comparative accuracy of
                 these methods are presented; an effect of error
                 autocorrection is considered. This effect occurs in
                 efficient methods of rational approximation (e.g.,
                 Pad{\'e} approximations, linear and nonlinear Pad{\'e}
                 Chebyshev approximations) where very significant errors
                 in the coefficients do not affect the accuracy of the
                 approximation. The matter of import is that the errors
                 in the numerator and the denominator of a fractional
                 rational approximant compensate each other. This effect
                 is related to the fact that the errors in the
                 coefficients of a rational approximant are not
                 distributed in an arbitrary way but form the
                 coefficients of a new approximant to the approximated
                 function. Understanding of the error autocorrection
                 mechanism allows to decrease this error by varying the
                 approximation procedure depending on the form of the
                 approximant. Some applications are described in the
                 paper. In particular, a method of implementation of
                 basic calculations on decimal computers that uses the
                 technique of rational approximations is described in
                 the Appendix.\par

                 1570-1579, 1993) introduced fast methods for numerical
                 evaluation of elementary functions based on table
                 lookup. They are called ATA (add/table-lookup/add) and
                 ATA-M (add/table-lookup/add and multiply) methods for
                 single- and double-precision calculations respectively.
                 In this paper, an improvement to these methods that
                 shrinks the size of the table by a factor of about 3/16
                 is presented. Another method called the `split parallel
                 multiplication method', which is characterized by
                 simpler table lookup than ATA-M and by split and
                 parallel use of double-precision floating point
                 circuitry, is also introduced, These new methods fit on
                 to integrated circuits of a size comparable with
                 commercially available floating-point accelerators.

  abstract =     "This paper presents hardware designs that produce
                 exactly rounded results for the functions of
                 reciprocal, square-root, 2/sup x/, and log/sub 2/(x).
                 These designs use polynomial approximation in which the
                 terms in the approximation are generated in parallel,
                 and then summed by using a multi-operand adder. To
                 reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the
                 input interval is partitioned into subintervals of
                 equal size, and different coefficients are used for
                 each subinterval. The coefficients used in the
                 approximation are initially determined based on the
                 Chebyshev series approximation. They are then adjusted
                 to obtain exactly rounded results for all inputs.
                 Hardware designs are presented, and delay and area
                 comparisons are made based on the degree of the
                 approximating polynomial and the accuracy of the final
                 result. For single-precision floating point numbers, a
                 design that produces exactly rounded results for all
                 four functions has an estimated delay of 80 ns and a
                 total chip area of 98 mm/sup 2/ in a 1.0-micron CMOS
                 technology. Allowing the results to have a maximum
                 error of one unit in the last place reduces the
                 computational delay by 5\% to 30\% and the area
                 requirements by 33\% to 77\%.",

  abstract =     "One of the most spectacular development in computer
                 technology is the growth in memory density and speed.
                 It is with this development in mind that we intend to
                 tackle the old problem of computing the elementary
                 functions. Since the dawn of computing, the fast and
                 accurate computation of the elementary functions has
                 been a constant concern of numerical computing. It now
                 seems possible to use tables of sizes in the range of
                 megabits to aid in such computation. To this end, in
                 this paper, we propose a method called ATA-M (Add-Table
                 Lookup-Add with Multiplication) for evaluating
                 polynomials with the aid of tables. When applied to the
                 elementary functions, we obtained a set of algorithms
                 which computes the reciprocal, square root,
                 exponential, sine, cosine, logarithm, are tangent and
                 the hyperbolic functions in about 3 to 4 double
                 precision floating point multiplication time and
                 utilizing about 2 Mbyte of tables.",

  abstract =     "As the name suggests, elementary functions play a
                 vital role in scientific computations. Yet due to their
                 inherent nature, they are a considerable computing task
                 by themselves. Not surprisingly, since the dawn of
                 computing, the goal of speeding up elementary function
                 computation has been pursued. This paper describes new
                 hardware based algorithms for the computation of the
                 common elementary functions, namely division,
                 logarithm, reciprocal square root, arc tangent, sine
                 and cosine. These algorithms exploit microscopic
                 parallelism using specialized hardware with heavy use
                 of truncation based on detailed accuracy analysis. The
                 contribution of this work lies in the fact that these
                 algorithms are very fast and yet are accurate. If we
                 let the time to perform an IEEE Standard 754 double
                 precision floating point multiplication be
                 $\tau_\times$, our algorithms to achieve roughly $3.68
                 \tau_\times$, $4.56 \tau_\times$, $5.25 \tau_\times$,
                 $3.69 \tau_\times$, $7.06 \tau_\times$, and $6.5
                 \tau_\times$, for division, logarithm, square root,
                 exponential, are tangent and complex exponential (sine
                 and cosine) respectively. The trade-off is the need for
                 tables and some specialized hardware. The total amount
                 of tables required, however, is less than 128 Kbytes.
                 We discuss the hardware, algorithmic and accuracy
                 aspects of these algorithms.",

                 for computing $\alpha$ to a predetermined level of

                 we introduce the S-3000 and, using six benchmarks we
                 designed, evaluate a member of this series of
                 supercomputer, the top of the range S-3800, against its
                 predecessor, the Hitachi HITAC S-820. Our purpose is to
                 determine in what areas the S-3800 is an improvement
                 over its predecessor. The suite of benchmarks include
                 kernels for random number generation, elementary
                 function computation, FFT, dense matrix operations,
                 SOR, and list vector (scatter\slash gather) operations.
                 The use of small-to medium-sized kernels, as opposed to
                 large application benchmarks, help to better understand
                 the behavior of the machine. Our findings support the
                 claim that the S-3000 series is at least twice as fast

  abstract =     "Today's floating point implementations of elementary
                 transcendental functions are usually very accurate.
                 However, with few exceptions, the actual accuracy is
                 not known. In the present paper we describe a rigorous,
                 accurate, fast and portable implementation of the
                 elementary standard functions based on some existing
                 approximate standard functions. The scheme is outlined
                 for IEEE 754, but not difficult to adapt to other
                 floating point formats. A Matlab implementation is
                 available on the net. Accuracy of the proposed
                 algorithms can be rigorously estimated. As an example
                 we prove that the relative accuracy of the exponential
                 function is better than 2.07 eps in a slightly reduced
                 argument range (eps denoting the relative rounding
                 error unit). Otherwise, extensive computational tests
                 suggest for all elementary functions and all suitable
                 arguments an accuracy better than about 3 eps.",

                 described, from the point of view of a computer
                 architect. Many conflicting requirements vie for
                 consideration during the design of a new computer
                 architecture. These include instruction word size,
                 number of registers, the set of operations, arithmetic
                 precisions supported, and memory access. Some of the
                 trade-offs during the design phase will be
                 discussed.\par

                 One of the objectives of the original Itanium design
                 was to accelerate quad precision arithmetic. The talk
                 will describe how the Itanium elementary function
                 library was constructed, with attention to performance
                 and accuracy. Because a pair of double-extended
                 floating point words are used for internal operations
                 involving quad precision numbers, intermediate results,
                 holding 128 bits, provide 15 guard bits during
                 intermediate calculations, resulting in a very low

                 from several drawbacks, such as unattainable points and
                 randomly located poles for a small number of nodes, as
                 well as an erratic behavior of the error as this number
                 grows larger. In a former article, we have suggested to
                 obtain rational interpolants by a procedure that
                 attaches optimally placed poles to the interpolating
                 polynomial, using the barycentric representation of the
                 interpolants. In order to improve upon the condition of
                 the derivatives in the solution of differential
                 equations, we have then experimented with a conformal
                 point shift suggested by Kosloff and Tal-Ezer. As it
                 turned out, such shifts can achieve a spectacular
                 improvement in the quality of the approximation itself
                 for functions with a large gradient in the center of
                 the interval. This leads us to the present work which
                 combines the pole attachment method with shifts
                 optimally adjusted to the interpolated function. Such
                 shifts are also constructed for functions with several
                 shocks away from the extremities of the interval.",

  abstract =     "For decades mathematicians, physicists, and engineers
                 have relied on various orthogonal expansions such as
                 Fourier, Legendre, and Chebyschev to solve a variety of
                 problems. In this paper we exploit the orthogonal
                 properties of prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF)
                 in the form of a new orthogonal expansion which we have
                 named the Slepian series. We empirically show that the
                 Slepian series is potentially optimal over more
                 conventional orthogonal expansions for discontinuous
                 functions such as the square wave among others. With
                 regards to interpolation, we explore the connections
                 the Slepian series has to the Shannon sampling theorem.
                 By utilizing Euler's equation, a relationship between
                 the even and odd ordered PSWFs is investigated. We also
                 establish several other key advantages the Slepian
                 series has such as the presence of a free tunable
                 bandwidth parameter.",

  abstract =     "The reciprocal and square-root reciprocal operations
                 are important in several applications. For the
                 operations, we present algorithms that combine a
                 digit-by-digit module and one iteration of a
                 quadratic-convergence approximation. The latter is
                 implemented by a digit-recurrence, which uses the
                 digits produced by the digit-by-digit part. In this
                 way, both parts execute in an overlapped manner, so
                 that the total number of cycles is about half the
                 number that would be required by the digit-by-digit
                 part alone. Because of the approximation, correct
                 rounding of the result cannot be obtained directly in
                 all cases; we propose a variable-time implementation
                 that produces the correctly rounded result with a small
                 average overhead. Radix-4 implementations are described
                 and have been synthesized. They achieve the same cycle
                 time as the standard digit-by-digit implementation,
                 resulting in a speed-up of about 2 and, because of the
                 approximation part, the area factor is also about 2. We
                 also show a combined implementation for both operations
                 that has essentially the same complexity as that for
                 square-root reciprocal alone.",

                 developed by Ziv at IBM. This library showed that the
                 average performance and memory overhead of correct
                 rounding could be made negligible. However, the
                 worst-case overhead was still a factor 1000 or more. It
                 is shown here that, with current processor technology,
                 this worst-case overhead can be kept within a factor of
                 2 to 10 of current best libms. This low overhead has

                 functions, powering (with a fixed exponent $p$), or

                 second-degree polynomial (using a specialized squaring

                 The execution times and area costs of an architecture

                 hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For
                 such a function $f$ and a given rectangular complex

                 estimating the ranges of these compositions. In many

                 inverse hyperbolic, power ($x^y$ with two variables),
                 and logarithm to an arbitrary base into a single
                 four-way arithmetic platform. A number system called
                 the fixed-point hybrid number system (FXP-HNS), which
                 combines the fixed-point number system (FXP) and the
                 logarithmic number system (LNS), is proposed for the

                 area-efficient logarithmic and antilogarithmic

                 percent maximum conversion errors, respectively. The
                 unified arithmetic unit based on the proposed schemes
                 is presented with less than 6.3 percent operation
                 error. Its fully pipelined architecture achieves
                 single-cycle throughput with maximum four-cycle latency
                 for all of the supported operations. Comparison results
                 show that the proposed arithmetic unit achieves 30
                 percent power and 10.9 percent area reductions and runs
                 two times faster than the previous approach.",

  abstract =     "This paper sketches a technique for improving the rate
                 of convergence of a general oscillatory sequence, and
                 then applies this series acceleration algorithm to the
                 polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta function. As such,
                 it may be taken as an extension of the techniques given
                 by Borwein's ``An efficient algorithm for computing the
                 Riemann zeta function'' by Borwein for computing the
                 Riemann zeta function, to more general series. The
                 algorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating
                 $\operatorname{Li}_s(z)$ for general values of complex
                 $s$ and a kidney-shaped region of complex $z$ values
                 given by $|z^2/(z 1)| < 4$. By using the duplication
                 formula and the inversion formula, the range of
                 convergence for the polylogarithm may be extended to
                 the entire complex $z$-plane, and so the algorithms
                 described here allow for the evaluation of the
                 polylogarithm for all complex $s$ and $z$ values.
                 Alternatively, the Hurwitz zeta can be very rapidly
                 evaluated by means of an Euler Maclaurin series. The
                 polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta are related, in that
                 two evaluations of the one can be used to obtain a
                 value of the other; thus, either algorithm can be used
                 to evaluate either function. The Euler Maclaurin series
                 is a clear performance winner for the Hurwitz zeta,
                 while the Borwein algorithm is superior for evaluating
                 the polylogarithm in the kidney-shaped region. Both
                 algorithms are superior to the simple Taylor's series
                 or direct summation. The primary, concrete result of
                 this paper is an algorithm allows the exploration of
                 the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast
                 algorithms are otherwise unavailable. A discussion of
                 the monodromy group of the polylogarithm is included.",

  abstract =     "Coconut, a tool for developing high-assurance,
                 high-performance kernels for scientific computing,
                 contains an extensible domain-specific language (DSL)
                 embedded in Haskell. The DSL supports interactive
                 prototyping and unit testing, simplifying the process
                 of designing efficient implementations of common
                 patterns. Unscheduled C and scheduled assembly language
                 output are supported. Using the patterns, even
                 nonexpert users can write efficient function
                 implementations, leveraging special hardware features.
                 A production-quality library of elementary functions
                 for the cell BE SPU compute engines has been developed.
                 Coconut-generated and -scheduled vector functions were
                 more than four times faster than commercially
                 distributed functions written in C with intrinsics (a
                 nicer syntax for in-line assembly), wrapped in loops
                 and scheduled by {\tt spuxlc}. All Coconut functions
                 were faster, but the difference was larger for
                 hard-to-approximate functions for which register-level
                 SIMD lookups made a bigger difference. Other helpful
                 features in the language include facilities for
                 translating interval and polynomial descriptions
                 between GHCi, a Haskell interpreter used to prototype
                 in the DSL, and Maple, used for exploration and minimax
                 polynomial generation. This makes it easier to match
                 mathematical properties of the functions with efficient
                 calculational patterns in the SPU ISA. By using single,
                 literate source files, the resulting functions are
                 remarkably readable.",

                 In the actual implementation, the function is replaced

                 error (absolute or relative) $\epsilon = p - f$ or
                 $\epsilon = p/f - 1$. The tight yet certain bounding of
                 this error is an important step towards safe
                 implementations. The problem is difficult mainly
                 because that approximation error is very small and the

                 But our approach has been not to employ direct

                 functions as much as possible, both for greater

                 termination, cases when $x^y$ falls on a
                 rounding-boundary must be filtered out. Such
                 rounding-boundaries are floating-point numbers and
                 midpoints between two consecutive floating-point
                 numbers. Detecting rounding-boundaries for pow is a

                 trigonometric, logarithmic, square root, and reciprocal
                 functions. These real functions are converted into

                 representation. This paper presents the numbers of
                 nodes in decision diagrams representing the
                 integer-valued functions. First, complexities of
                 decision diagrams for polynomial functions are
                 analyzed, since elementary functions can be
                 approximated by polynomial functions. A theoretical
                 analysis shows that binary moment diagrams (BMDs) have
                 low complexity for polynomial functions. Second, this
                 paper analyzes complexity of edge-valued binary
                 decision diagrams (EVBDDs) for monotone functions,
                 since many common elementary functions are monotone. It

                 x)$, and a single table for $e^x$ and $e^x - 1$. This
                 approach eliminates special cases normally required to
                 evaluate $\log(1 + x)$ and $e^x - 1$ accurately near
                 zero, which will significantly improve performance on
                 architectures which use SIMD parallelism, or on which
                 data-dependent branching is expensive.\par

                 We have implemented it on the Cell/B.E. SPU (SIMD
                 compute engine) and found the resulting functions to be
                 up to twice as fast as the conventional implementations

                 is often presented as a collection of disparate
                 results, which are rarely organised in a coherent way.
                 This book answers the need for a different approach to
                 the subject. The authors' main goals are to emphasise
                 general unifying principles coherently and to provide
                 clear motivation, efficient proofs, and original
                 references for all of the principal results. The book
                 covers standard material, but also much more, including
                 chapters on discrete orthogonal polynomials and
                 elliptic functions. The authors show how a very large
                 part of the subject traces back to two equations ---
                 the hypergeometric equation and the confluent
                 hypergeometric equation --- and describe the various
                 ways in which these equations are canonical and
                 special. Providing ready access to theory and formulas,
                 this book serves as an ideal graduate-level textbook as
                 well as a convenient reference.",

                 proving numerical properties of final and intermediate
                 values. One may need to guarantee that a value stays
                 within some range, or that the error relative to some
                 ideal value is well bounded. This certification may
                 require a time-consuming proof for each line of code,
                 and it is usually broken by the smallest change to the
                 code, e.g., for maintenance or optimization
                 purpose. Certifying floating-point programs by hand is,
                 therefore, very tedious and error-prone. The Gappa
                 proof assistant is designed to make this task both
                 easier and more secure, due to the following novel
                 features: It automates the evaluation and propagation
                 of rounding errors using interval arithmetic. Its input
                 format is very close to the actual code to validate. It
                 can be used incrementally to prove complex mathematical
                 properties pertaining to the code. It generates a
                 formal proof of the results, which can be checked
                 independently by a lower level proof assistant like
                 Coq. Yet it does not require any specific knowledge
                 about automatic theorem proving, and thus, is
                 accessible to a wide community. This paper demonstrates
                 the practical use of this tool for a widely used class

                 interpolators for hardware implementation of elementary
                 functions is investigated in this paper. In the
                 proposed approach, the interval where the function is
                 approximated is subdivided in equal length segments and
                 two adjacent segments are grouped in a segment pair.
                 Suitable constraints are then imposed between the
                 coefficients of the two interpolating polynomials in
                 each segment pair. This allows reducing the total
                 number of stored coefficients. It is found that the
                 increase in the approximation error due to constraints
                 between polynomial coefficients can easily be overcome
                 by increasing the fractional bits of the coefficients.
                 Overall, compared with standard unconstrained
                 piecewise-polynomial approximation having the same
                 accuracy, the proposed method results in a considerable
                 advantage in terms of the size of the lookup table
                 needed to store polynomial coefficients. The calculus
                 of the coefficients of constrained polynomials and the
                 optimization of coefficients bit width is also
                 investigated in this paper. Results for several
                 elementary functions and target precision ranging from
                 12 to 42 bits are presented. The paper also presents
                 VLSI implementation results, targeting a 90 nm CMOS
                 technology, and using both direct and Horner
                 architectures for constrained degree-1, degree-2, and
                 degree-3 approximations.",
