Marshall on the other hand believes hypertext is exactly what makes the {Web} matter. She expresses the need for better link management techniques, gathering, organizing and annotating information, etc. Don Retallack feels hypertext was, but no longer is, an important part of the {WWW}. The {WWW} has moved to database, search engines, applets, etc. A. Vercroustre believes the web is doing just fine and doing more than it was designed for. New tools, like {XML}, {Java} and {DOM} will enable flexible and user-centered linking, hence the survival of the hypertext part of the {WWW}}
