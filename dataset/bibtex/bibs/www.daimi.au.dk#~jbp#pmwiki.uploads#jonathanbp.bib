This separation of concerns permits the formulation of general structural rules for change at the configuration level without the need to consider application state, and the specification of application component actions without prior knowledge of the actual structural changes which may be introduced. In addition, the changes can be applied in such a way so as to leave the modified system in a consistent state, and cause no disturbance to the unaffected part of the operational system. The model is applied to an example problem, `evolving philosophers'. The principles of this model have been implemented and tested in the Conic environment for distributed systems},

But the Web is more than a new technology for leveraging existing work. It is, in fact, an enabling technology with the potential to change software development as dramatically as the transistor and microprocessor changed computer architecture. An enabling technology changes the fundamental assumptions ingrained in a discipline. The microprocessor, for example, changed the reliability, cost, circuit density, and performance assumptions underlying hardware design. As a result, new applications and design approaches for hardware systems became feasible. Just as the microprocessor changed the fundamental assumptions of hardware design, the Web changes some of the assumptions underlying software development. Thus it has the potential to change our notion of the software artifact and the collaborative processes used to construct it},

We present a novel architectural style directed at supporting larger grain reuse and flexible system composition. Moreover, the style supports design of distributed, concurrent applications. Asynchronous notification messages and asynchronous request messages are the sole basis for intercomponent communication. A key aspect of the style is that components are not built with any dependencies on what typically would be considered lower-level components, such as user interface toolkits. Indeed, all components are oblivious to the existence of any components to which notification messages are sent. While our focus has been on applications involving graphical user interfaces, the style has the potential for broader applicability. Several trial applications using the style are described},

The Conawa calculus presented in this paper provides mechanisms for modeling complex and interwoven sets of context-information by extending ambient calculus with new constructs and capabilities. In connection with the calculus we present four scenarios which are used to evaluate Conawa. The calculus is a step in the direction of making formal methods applicable in the area of pervasive computing.},

Elite Care based the setting's layout on an apartment complex rather than a hospital with its hallways and rooms. By using a social care model that has the staff making house calls rather than doctors making rounds, the residents continue to live as normally as they can. In this scheme, pervasive sensors and staff assist residents in maintaining their independence, offering assistance as necessary and using the pervasive sensors to monitor vital signs and health indicators. Elite Care has harnessed the technology in direct and important ways to construct a more humane and human world for its residents and staff.},

@proceedings{citeulike:612288,
	abstract = {The Pervasive Computing Laboratory at the University of Florida is dedicated to creating smart environments and assistants to enable elderly persons to live a longer and a more independent life at home. By achieving this goal, technology will increase the chances of successful aging despite an ailing health care system (e.g. Medicaid). One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house.},

concurrency

support and monitor multiple applications and resources on mobile clients

agility

express resource expectations
be notified if these are not met
respond to changing fidelity

experiences led to dev.. of INCA:

components: capture, storage, transduce (convert), access

---

capturing and tagging (CaptureModule)

tags describe metadata - taggers attach information to output streams

data is raw bytes + tags

---

storing (StorageModule)

persistence for captured data
subscribes to captured data, publishes the data from storage (backend is repository)

---

accessing

done via queries (subscribing) to storage modules or directly from capture modules

context-based queries

---

transducer

convert from one format to another (data passed on to storage, access or more transducers)

examples: video stream -> frames, ink -> text, speech -> text

@article{citeulike:570486,
	abstract = {This paper presents a framework to address new data management challenges introduced by data-intensive, pervasive computing environments. These challenges include a spatio-temporal variation of data and data source availability, lack of a global catalog and schema, and no guarantee of reconnection among peers due to the serendipitous nature of the environment. An important aspect of our solution is to treat devices as semiautonomous peers guided in their interactions by profiles and context. The profiles are grounded in a semantically rich language and represent information about users, devices, and data described in terms of "beliefs," "desires," and "intentions." We present a prototype implementation of this framework over combined Bluetooth and Ad Hoc 802.11 networks and present experimental and simulation results that validate our approach and measure system performance.},

@book{citeulike:528032,
	abstract = {{Designing application and middleware software to run in concurrent and  networked environments is a significant challenge to software developers.  The patterns catalogued in this second volume of Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures (POSA) form the basis of a pattern language that addresses  issues associated with concurrency and networking. The book presents 17  interrelated patterns ranging from idioms through architectural designs.  They cover core elements of building concurrent and network systems:  service access and configuration, event handling, synchronization, and  concurrency. All patterns present extensive examples and known uses in  multiple programming languages, including C++, C, and Java. The book can  be used to tackle specific software development problems or read from  cover to cover to provide a fundamental understanding of the best  practices for constructing concurrent and networked applications and  middleware. About the Authors This book has been written by the award  winning team responsible for the first POSA volume "A System of Patterns", joined in this volume by Douglas C. Schmidt from University of California, Irvine (UCI), USA. Visit our Web Page  }},

The Web's infrastructure can serve as an interface to all interactive applications and, over time, will become the graphical user interface model for new applications. Ubiquitous hypermedia support should become the jewel of the Web environment. Through Web integration, hypermedia could become an integral part of every interactive application. With the proper tools to support hypermedia in Web application development, it will become second nature for developers and individual authors to provide supplemental links and hypermedia navigation. However, as organizations adopt the Web as their primary application infrastructure, designers may use Java and other tools to recreate current application functionality, and not take advantage of the Web's hypermedia-augmented infrastructure.

@book{citeulike:371058,
	abstract = {{There's a reason that a large slice of the open-source movement has defected from running Linux on its laptops to running Mac OS X. The reason is the Unix core that underlies Mac OS X, and the development tools that run on that core. Cocoa makes it easy to create very slick Mac OS X interfaces for software (as well as to create applications in a hurry), and this new edition of <I>Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</I> does an excellent job of teaching its readers how to put a Cocoa face on top of code (Objective-C code almost exclusively). If you know something about C and/or C++ programming and want to apply your skills to the Mac, this is precisely the book you want.<p>  Author Aaron Hillegass teaches a Cocoa class, and his book reads like a demonstration-driven lecture in a computer lab. That is, the book takes a heavily example-centric approach to its subject, beginning with simple announcement windows and proceeding to cover the more advanced controls and object-oriented features of Cocoa and Objective-C. Throughout, he hops back and forth between descriptions of the goal to be accomplished, listings of the code that does the job, and instructions on how to use the Mac OS X development tools to speed the development process. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to write software for Mac OS X in Objective-C and, especially, with Cocoa. The new edition shows how to use NSUndoManager, add AppleScript capability to an application, do graphics work with OpenGL, and use Cocoa under Linux using GNUstep. As well, all the basic controls and design patterns are covered.}},
