	Three speakers are described who prompted disagreement about the

	Another's -in guise is seen as compassionate by some and as condescending

	and less masculine, while others describe him as a masculine ``jock.{''}
	These findings show that listeners shift their interpretations of
	a linguistic resource, highlighting the ambiguous role intention
	plays in social meaning and calling into question long-held assumptions

	1993), this study describes a wide range of reflexive elements in

	use by trial lawyers, it enquires about the general underlying function
	as part of the sociocultural practice (Bourdieu 1990). The corpus
	of was collected at twenty-two criminal trials observed and recorded
	by the researcher. Five kinds of metapragmatic indexes - from the
	maximally explicit to the implicit - are identified and analyzed
	in their interactional, situational and societal context: (1) performatives,
	which Count as official acts by the trial lawyer, (2) formulations
	and other evaluations of speech, (3) descriptions of aspects of the
	sociocultural practice and allusions to the principles governing
	the event, (4) strategic descriptions of contextual conditions, which
	are exploited with group identity and relational effects, and (5)
	style. The analysis reveals that these metapragmatic features contextualize
	the communication as expressing a specific social capital, and at
	the same time. they contribute to define what does not Count as legitimate
	practice. Apart From the specific effects of individual types of
	indexes, in closing arguments metapragmatic indexes basically function
	signaling that the social actor and the practice they are engaged
	in rightfully belong to the social Field of the law.},

	between dialect and the standard language in entertainment programmes
	and chat-shows in Austrian television. Alongside the functions of
	code-switching in natural unstaged situations, such as the marking
	off of asides, of narrative elements and ``non-first firsts{''},
	which have already been adequately researched, we find television
	conversations have additional functions which have not been subject
	to such thorough investigation. For example, code-switching phenomena
	in television reflect the conflict between the roles that presenters
	play within a show. The presenter often switches between the role
	of neutral host and that of committed participant in the discussion
	or that of the ``colleague{''} or ``friend{''} of the guest or interviewee.
	The change of language variety is usually not only accompanied by
	a change in content or in the structure of the discussion, but also
	by an alteration in the type of interaction. In these television
	programmes, dialect plays a part in changes of perspective and in
	changes in the forms of portrayal employed, and as such it provides
	a degree of variety for the viewer which is especially welcome in
	programmes suffering from a surfeit of verbosity.},

  abstract = {Sociolinguistic research has traditionally examined stylistic variation
	as a way of understanding how speakers may use language indexically.
	Quantitatively, research has sought to correlate observed patterns
	of variation across such external parameters as context or topic
	with the ways in which speakers linguistically orient themselves
	to their immediate surroundings or to some other socially-salient
	reference group. Recently, this approach has been criticized for
	being too mechanistic. In this paper, I present a new method for
	examining stylistic variation that addresses this critique, and demonstrate
	how an attention to speakers' motivations and interactional goals
	can be reconciled with a quantitative analysis of variation. I illustrate
	the proposed method with a quantitative examination of systematic
	patterns of prosodic variation in the speech of a group of Israeli
	men who are all members of various lesbian and gay political-activist
	groups.},

  volume = {18},
  pages = {87-113},

  abstract = {Although corporate press releases are `preformulated' to fit sonic
	of tire conventions of journalistic reports, their style at times
	seems quite different from the one favoured by journalists. That
	is, there appear to exist stylistic conflicts between the press release
	genre and the press report genre. This study investigates the nature
	of these conflicts by means of a corpus analysis of the reworking
	strategies employed by journalists that actually use press releases
	to compose press reports. Roughly, two orientations can be discerned
	behind the journalistic transformations of release copy: Readability
	and neutrality. In order to improve readability, journalists create
	shorter and less complex sentences, use everyday words, replace numbers
	and symbols by words, and insert short bits of background information.
	In order to preserve neutrality, they remove company and product
	names, tone down or remove positive statements, and introduce the
	company as source for statements they do not want to be responsible
	for. Sonic trans formations are more complex in that they are carried
	out in both directions: For instance, the company name may be removed
	as the subject in a press report sentence, but in other cases it
	may be introduced in the press report. These, two-way operations
	are shown to be sensitive to different orientations at the same time.
	For instance, removing company names from the subject position may
	help preserve neutrality, while introducing it may personalize the
	text and hence improve readability. In the discussion, the genre
	conflict between press releases and press reports is analyzed in
	terms of the incompatibility of tire stylistic constraints both genres
	need to satisfy. Some of the incompatibilities derive from differences
	in the communicative purposes characteristic of the two genres, while
	others probably have to do with the specific organizational context
	that co-determines the style of press releases.},

	constructionist viewpoints into sociolinguistics by demonstrating
	how two interlocutors use linguistic resources to project and shape
	ethnic (and other facets of) identity in unfolding talk. The interaction
	is a sociolinguistic interview from a large-scale sociolinguistic
	study of a rural tri-ethnic community in the southeastern U.S. I
	examine a range of features and types of features and in addition
	use both quantitative and qualitative methods. Further, I examine
	the linguistic usages of both the researcher (the interviewer) and
	the research subject. The analysis confirms that identity is dynamic
	and multifaceted and is very much a product of ongoing talk, although
	pre-existing linguistic and social structures also come into play.
	In addition, the analysis demonstrates that identity is dialogic
	as well as dynamic and that researchers play a large role in shaping
	the linguistic usages of those they study.},

	etc.) vis-a-vis this variety, and the channels of its reproduction

	which role this variety plays in the development of a Cameroonian
	identity for adolescents and young adults in Cameroon. The hopeless
	venture of the educators to ban Camfranglais from schools and homes
	is shown to be losing ground to the current trend among the youths
	to present themselves as part of a modern and up-to-date community.
	Additionally, some aspects of a targeted influence on the behaviour
	of the adolescents effected by song lyrics, HIV-educational-campaigns
	or advertisements through the use of this variety will be addressed
	and discussed as a way how media could use Camfranglais positively
	instead of lamenting the loss of Moliere's standards.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative analysis of style shifting in a
	corpus of Flemish radio and television commercials. Previous research
	draws attention to styling processes in advertising language, as
	discursive actions indexing social meanings. It will be shown that
	the exploitation of different stylistic varieties in our corpus can
	be analyzed along the same lines. The analysis presented here focuses
	on the use of `tussentaal' (literally: `in-between language') in
	the corpus, which is an informal variety of spoken Belgian Dutch,
	situated between the regional dialects and standard Belgian Dutch.
	In order to give a detailed account of the stylization processes,
	the style shifts between standard Dutch and tussentaal within a single
	spot are investigated. Furthermore, it will be argued that complementing
	the quantification of stylistic features with a statistical analysis
	considerably improves the analysis. More specifically, using a linear
	regression, the effect of a number of sociovariational factors on
	the style shifts in the commercials is investigated. The significant
	factors are then interpreted sociolinguistically, drawing on the
	concepts of stylization and audience design. Finally, it will be
	shown that the analysis can be extended to incorporate multilingualism
	in the commercials. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	tu, and vous with generic-indefinite reference in synchronous computer-mediated
	communication (CMC). The primary objective is to compare the use
	of these pronouns in CMC, a written/typed form of discourse, and
	in conversational spoken French as it has been analyzed over the
	past few decades. A VARBRUL analysis produced results comparable
	to those reported in previous studies in which such an approach was
	used., Overall, the results suggest that the use of on versus tu/vous
	with indefinite reference is influenced by affirmation/negation,
	syntactic frame (generalizations versus implicatives), discursive-pragmatic
	effect (situational insertions versus morals/truisms), and type of
	event (specific versus lion-specific). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

  abstract = {It is widely recognized that prosody serves as a cue for information
	content and for mutual agreement (or lack thereof) among dialogue
	participants. It is also true that different social situations require
	dissimilar prosodic strategies. The present paper will address the
	problem of prosodic prominence and contours on negatives in various
	interactive and noninteractive registers of Continental French, and
	will compare the results with those from American English negatives
	in similar situational contexts. Negatives were studied because they
	provide vital information-which should be emphasized prosodically
	to maximize comprehension yet their presentation can be critical
	to amicable interaction, and under certain social conditions should
	be de-emphasized to minimize possible sources of discord. Consequently,
	analysis of prosody on negatives permits us to juxtapose theories
	of how language is produced and how it is interpreted. The study
	will provide evidence of three different loci of prosodic variation:
	language, culture, and social situation, concluding that each of
	the three variables influences prosodic realization. (C) 2002 Elsevier
