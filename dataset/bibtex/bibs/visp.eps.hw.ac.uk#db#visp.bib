  abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging of the retina presents a unique opportunity
	for direct and quantitative mapping of retinal biochemistry - particularly
	of the vasculature where blood oximetry is enabled by the strong
	variation of absorption spectra with oxygenation. This is particularly
	pertinent both to research and to clinical investigation and diagnosis
	of retinal diseases such as diabetes, glaucoma and age-related macular
	degeneration. The optimal exploitation of hyperspectral imaging however,
	presents a set of challenging problems, including; the poorly characterised
	and controlled optical environment of structures within the retina
	to be imaged; the erratic motion of the eye ball; and the compounding
	effects of the optical sensitivity of the retina and the low numerical
	aperture of the eye. We have developed two spectral imaging techniques
	to address these issues. We describe first a system in which a liquid
	crystal tuneable filter is integrated into the illumination system
	of a conventional fundus camera to enable time-sequential, random
	access recording of narrow-band spectral images. Image processing
	techniques are described to eradicate the artefacts that may be introduced
	by time-sequential imaging. In addition we describe a unique snapshot
	spectral imaging technique dubbed IRIS that employs polarising interferometry
	and Wollaston prism beam splitters to simultaneously replicate and
	spectrally filter images of the retina into multiple spectral bands
	onto a single detector array. Results of early clinical trials acquired
	with these two techniques together with a physical model which enables
	oximetry map are reported.}},

	A practical alternative to the optimal Bayes multitarget filter is
	the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates

	equations (PDEs), however, have not much been explored in this context

	that makes use of the interpolation qualities of edge-enhancing diffusion.
	Although this anisotropic diffusion equation with a diffusion tensor
	was originally proposed for image denoising, we show that it outperforms
	many other PDEs when sparse scattered data must be interpolated.
	To exploit this property for image compression, we consider an adaptive
	triangulation method for removing less significant pixels from the
	image. The remaining points serve as scattered interpolation data
	for the diffusion process. They can be coded in a compact way that
	reflects the B-tree structure of the triangulation. We supplement
	the coding step with a number of amendments such as error threshold
	adaptation, diffusion-based point selection, and specific quantisation
	strategies. Our experiments illustrate the usefulness of each of
	these modifications. They demonstrate that for high compression rates,

	A brief introduction to recent techniques to increase the depth of

	This technique, commonly named wavefront coding, employs an aspherical

	offers the potential to implement diffraction-limited imaging systems

	can be applied to mitigate this effect if the channel-state information

	performance of an OFDM-based communication system whose transmitter
	has only one bit of CSI per subcarrier, obtained through a low-rate
	feedback. Three adaptive approaches are considered to exploit such
	a CSI feedback: adaptive subcarrier selection; adaptive power allocation
	(APA); and adaptive modulation selection (AMS). Under the conditions
	of a constant raw data rate and perfect feedback channel, the performance
	of these approaches are analyzed and compared in terms of raw bit-error
	rate. It is shown that one-bit CSI feedback can greatly enhance the
	system performance. Moreover, imperfections of the feedback channel
	are considered, and their impact on the performance of these techniques
	is studied. It is shown that by exploiting the knowledge that the
	feedback channel is imperfect, the performance of the APA and AMS
	techniques can be substantially improved.}},

	we address the problem of robustness of multiuser MIMO receivers

	the robustness against CST errors with a certain selected probability.
	The proposed receivers are formulated as probabilistically constrained
	stochastic optimization problems. Provided that the CSI mismatch
	is Gaussian, each of these problems is shown to be convex and to
	have a unique solution. The fact that the CSI mismatch is Gaussian
	also enables to convert the original stochastic problems to a more

	images obtained from a sandy seabed. The seabed is divided into a
	discrete number of ID height profiles. For each height profile the
	backscattered pressure is computed by an integral equation method
	for interface scattering between two homogeneous media as formulated
	by Chan {[}IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag. 46, 142-149 (1998)]. However,
	the seabed is inhomogeneous, and volume scattering is a major contributor
	to backscattering. The SAX99 experiments revealed that the density
	in the unconsolidated sediment within the first 5 mm exhibits a high
	spatial variation. For that reason, additional roughness is introduced:
	For each surface point a stochastic realization of the density along
	the vertical is generated, and the sediment depth at which the density
	has its maximum value will constitute the new height field value.
	The matrix of the full integral equation is reduced to a band matrix
	as the interaction between the point sources on the seabed is neglected
	from a certain range; this allows computations on long height profiles
	with lengths up to approximately 25 m (at 300 kHz). The equivalent

	Next the skeletal mesh is modified by free-form deformations. Then
	a desired global shape deformation is obtained by reconstructing
	the shape corresponding to the deformed skeletal mesh. The reconstruction
	is based on using discrete differential coordinates. Our method preserves
	fine geometric details and original shape thickness because of using
	discrete differential coordinates and skeleton-based deformations.
	We also develop a new mesh evolution technique which allow us to
	eliminate possible global and local self intersections of the deformed
	mesh while preserving fine geometric details. Finally, we present
	a multi-resolution version of our approach in order to simplify and
	accelerate the deformation process. In addition, interesting links
