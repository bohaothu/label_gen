*******************************************************************
FAO phycology teachers:
A publisher has asked me to ascertain the need for a short text on algae.
I should like to ask colleagues what texts are recommended for courses on
algae at various levels.
The publisher has in mind a book of c200 pp., covering basic biology and
perhaps some IDs and descriptions of cosmoplotan forms.
Any information will be appreciated.

Greetings all from the now balmy north central US,
 
There is a rather small text (~250 pp., paperback) currently available for
basic introductory courses, which may be of interest, in deference to the
more elaborate and detailed texts suitable for advanced students:
 
Sze, P. 1986.  A biology of the algae.  Wm. C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque,
Iowa.  251 pp. [ISBN 0-697-00741-3].
 
The postal address for the publisher is:
 
Wm. C. Brown Publishers
2460 Kerper Blvd.
Dubuque, Iowa 52001 U.S.A.
tel. (319) 588-1451

Phycology Textbooks...
The conscription of basic biology, some ID's and cosmopolitan forms in 
200 pages is a nightmare.  There are several texts available which have 
attempted to do this and all have met with less that enthusiastic 
response from our colleagues.  In a traditional (old fashioned) sense the 
algae comprise the majority of the Phyla.  Their physiology is diverse.  
Their forms are legion.  How this could be digested into 200 pages is a 
task of deliberate omission sure to offend the specialist who is 
convinced his/her area of research is critical to the understanding of 
the algae.  In a modern sense how does one cover the "basic biology" 
without being superficial and making broad generalizations which will 
bring caustic reviews from the "enlightened"?  The taxonomic listing of 
just the cosmopolitan forms will comprise a heafty portion of the 200 
pages. 
Since I have always considered Phycology to have three definite divisions, 
freshwater, marine, and fossil, it will be dificult to give a general 
overview of these groupings within an introductory text.  [Yes, there is 
some cross over between the groups (I have done so myself).]  Look at 
Bold and Wynne (a hefty tome) and see what they have done to present an 
introduction to the algae.  Round, Trainor, and Lee have texts which are 
considered introductions.  Prescott's contribution suffered from 
production problems in addition to other things.  There may be others out 
there which I have overlooked.  Aside from Bold and Wynne most of the 
volumes came in for hard criticism.
Should Bill Farnham decide to go ahead, and he probably should, because 
he just may "get it right" I would like to ask the potential reviewers to 
consider what the constraints were and evaluate the merit of the work in 
that light rather than being caustic because it is a "review".

Dear Farnham and/or Friends.
 
When I was introduced to the biology of Seaweeds (sorry only these), as a
student in biology/biochemistry, I got: Biology of the seaweeds, levels and
organization, by A.R:O: Chapman, Univ PArk Press, Baltimore. 134 pages.
It won=B4t cover everything, but for a start....
 
This was a nice start before heavy ones for systematics like Algen:
Eifuhrung in die Phycologie, by C. van den Hoek (An excellent book, by the
way) and Similar by Dixon for only Rhodophyta etc.
 
I also still find: The Biology of seaweeds by Lobban/Wynne (eds) Blackwell
Scientific Publ. Oxford, quite useful.
 
Best regards

Stephen (and everyone else):
 
There is at least one laboratory manual on algae (still in print I hope):
 
Experimental Phycology: a Laboratory Manual
C.S. Lobban, D.J. Chapman & B.P. Kremer (eds.) - 1988
Cambridge University Press,  295 pp.
 
It is a small footprint book with a cerlox binding. Each exercise lists
equipment required, questions to ask and useful notes. Hope you have fun :)

Recently someone mentioned the teaching text, Experimental Phycology: a
Laboratory Manual, edited by C.S. Lobban et al, Cambridge University Press,
1988.  He wondered whether it was still in print.  I phoned CUP and they
report that there are only 20 copies left in the UK and 150 in the US.  So
you should buy while stocks last.

Hi Steve, I don't have a first choice for the algae - basically a new book need
s to be written.  If you include phagotrophic protists in the class, Patterson
&  Hedley COLOR GUIDE TO THE FRESHWATER PROTOZOA is excellent for intro ID work
.  I've used it with success in teaching limnology labs.  Let me know what you
find text wise for our green friends if you have time.  Best wishes, Mark
