  ,abstract	= {The fusion calculus is presented as
a significant step towards a canonical calculus of concurrency.  It
simplifies and extends the pi-calculus of Milner, Parrow and Walker.

The fusion calculus contains the polyadic pi-calculus as a proper
subcalculus and thus inherits all its expressive power.  In addition
fusion contains actions akin to updating a shared state, and a scoping
construct for bounding their effects.  Therefore it is easier to
represent computational models with shared state, including concurrent
constraint formalisms.  It is also easy to represent the so called
strong reduction strategies in the lambda-calculus, involving
reduction under abstraction. In the pi-calculus these tasks require
elaborate encodings.

The fusion calculus simplifies the pi-calculus by reducing the number of
binding operators and the number of bisimulation equivalences, and by
making input and output symmetric like in pure CCS.  We attain a
calculus where concepts from other models of computation are more
easily expressed than in the pi-calculus, thereby taking a step towards a
unified yet simple model of computation.

In this thesis we present a broad foundational theory of the
fusion calculus.  We define its labelled and unlabelled operational
semantics, and treat strong and weak bisimulation equivalences for
both semantics in some detail, including complete axiom systems for
finite terms.
The equivalences are given symbolic characterizations, leading to 
algorithms and an automatic tool for equivalence checking.  We demonstrate the
expressive power of the fusion calculus to give simple encodings of
foundational calculi for functional and concurrent constraint
programming.
