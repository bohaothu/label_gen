	 between cooperating objects. The paper also presents examples of
	 context-aware communication services and evaluates the platform on the

  abstract = {Generative communication is the
	 basis of a new distributed programming langauge that is intended
	 for systems programming in distributed settings generally and on
	 integrated network computers in particular. It differs from previous
	 interprocess communication models in specifying that messages be added in
	 tuple-structured form to the computation environment, where they exist as named,
	 independent entities until some process chooses to receive them. Generative
	 communication results in a number of distinguishing properties in
	 the new language, Linda, that is built around it. Linda is fully
	 distributed in space and distributed in time; it allows distributed
	 sharing, continuation passing, and structured naming. We discuss these
	 properties and their implications, then give a series of examples. Linda
	 presents novel implementation problems that we discuss in Part II.
	 We are particularly concerned with implementation of the dynamic
	 global name space that the generative communication model requires. },

	 and the ubiquity of local-area wireless networking technologies.
	 Interactive workspaces are technologically augmented team-project
	 rooms that represent a specific sub-domain of ubiquitous computing.
	 We argue both from related work and from our own experience with a
	 prototype that the tuplespace model of communication forms the best
	 basis for a coordination infrastructure for such workspaces. This
	 paper presents the usage and characteristics expected of interactive
	 workspaces, from which we derive a set of key system properties for any
	 coordination infrastructure in an interactive workspace. We show that the
	 design aspects of tuplespaces, augmented with some new extensions,
	 yield a system model, which we call the Event Heap, that satisfies
	 all of the desired properties. We also briefly discuss why other
	 coordination models fall short of the desired properties, and describe
	 our experience using our implementation of the Event Heap model.
	 The paper focuses on a justification of the use of tuplespaces in
	 interactive workspaces, and does not provide a detailed discussion of
	 the Event Heap implementation or our more general experience with
	 interactive workspaces, each of which is treated in detail elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Mobile computing differs from desktop computing because of the dynamic nature of system
	 state: as users move, the sets of stationary and mobile objects they
	 control and the types of information they wish to access change.
	 Navigating a mobile environment can be aided by active maps that
	 describe the location and characteristics of objects within some region
	 as they change over time. We describe an active map service that
	 keeps clients informed of changes in their environment. The primary
	 issue driving our design is the question of scale: an active map
	 service must be able to handle updates and queries over suffciently
	 large regions of space to satisfy clients' interests and must be
	 able to handle peak loads that can occur when everyone in a region
	 is moving around, for example, to attend a meeting. Our solution
	 detects sets of clients that wish to receive the same active map
	 information and then dynamically assigns multicast groups to them. To
	 guarantee clients that they and their communication links will not be
	 overloaded the active map provides guaranteed limits on bandwidth use.},

	 applications that are aware of the context of their use. Examples of
	 these goals are: continuing in your office a program started at home;
	 using a PDA to control someone else's windowing UI; automatically
	 cancelling phone forwarding upon return to your office; having an airport

	 In this work we propose a layered real-time architecture for this
	 kind of context-aware adaptation based on redundant collections of
	 low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are distinguished: physical and
	 logical sensors, which give cues from environment parameters and host
	 information. A prototype board that consists of eight sensors was built for
	 experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using real-time
	 recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with
	 Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and its variants. A personal digital
	 assistant (PDA) and a mobile phone were used with the prototype to
	 demonstrate situational awareness. On the PDA font size and backlight
	 were changed depending on the demonstrated contexts while in mobile
	 phone the active user profile was changed. The experiments have shown
	 that it is feasible to recognize contexts using sensors and that
	 context information can be used to create new interaction metaphors.},
