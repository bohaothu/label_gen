  be much more difficult than itmight first appear. We present a number of
  strategies drawn from experiences for avoiding or overcoming some of the
  pitfalls. In particular, we discuss dealing with errors and inaccuracies; the
  importance of associating meta-data with measurements; the technique of
  calibrating measurements by examining outliers and testing for consistencies;
  difficulties that arise with large-scale measurements; the utility of
  developing a discipline for reliably reproducing analysis results; and issues
  with making datasets publicly available. We conclude with thoughts on the
  sorts of tools and community practices that can assist researchers with
  conducting sound measurement studies.},
