                  The paper proposes basic concepts which are used to explain
                  hardware and software architecture for fault-tolerant
                  distributed systems. For example, the concepts of server, 
                  depends on relation, failure, failure semantics. 
                  The general issues in hardware and software architectures are
                  presented. For software fault-tolerance, the issues related 
                  to synchronisation (close ou loose) are discussed.
                  The paper was revised in 1993, but the references are before
                  '90. Some examples of industrial faul-tolerant architectures
                  are given.
