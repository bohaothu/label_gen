abstract = {Adapting the method introduced in Graph Minors X, we propose a new
    proof of the duality between the bramble-number of a graph and its
    tree-width. Our approach is based on a new definition of
    submodularity on partition functions which naturally extends the
    usual one on set functions. The proof does not rely on Menger's
    theorem, and thus greatly generalises the original one. It thus
    provides a dual for matroid tree-width. One can also derive all
    known dual notions of other classical width-parameters from it.}
