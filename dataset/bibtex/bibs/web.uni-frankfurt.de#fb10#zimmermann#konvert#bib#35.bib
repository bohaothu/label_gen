		that is based on Bayesian probability theory. In attempting to solve a
		plan recognition problem we first retrieve candidate explanations. These
		explanations (sometimes only the most promising ones) are assembled into
		a plan recognition Bayesian network, which is a representation of a probability
		distribution over the set of possible explanations. We perform Bayesian
		updating to choose the most likely interpretation for the set of observed
		actions. This approach has been implemented in the Wimp3 system for natural
		language story understanding. }

	contentnote={Abstract: Cost-based abduction attempts to find the best explanation for
		a set of facts by finding a minimal cost proof for the facts. The costs
		are computed by summing the costs of the assumptions necessary for the
		proof plus the cost of the rules. We examine existing methods for constructing
		explanations (proofs), as a minimization problem on a DAG (directed acyclic
		graph). We then define a probabilistic semantics for the costs, and prove
		the equivalence of the cost minimization problem to the Bayesian network
		MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) solution of the system. A simple
		best-first algorithm for finding least-cost proofs is presented, and possible
		improvements are suggested. The semantics of cost-based abduction for complete
		models are then generalized to handle negation. This, in turn, allows us
		to apply the best-first search algorithm as a novel way of computing MAP
		assignments to belief networks that can enumerate assignments in order
		of decreasing probability. An important point is that improvement results
		for the best-first search algorithm carry over to the computation of MAPs.

		and the distance ratio from any two points on the fractal surface to the

		the distance ratio into the surface-vanishing line formula in the geometric
		model, a method for inferring planar surface shape is derived. The novelty

		tree T. The way to resolve a conflict is selected by a look-ahead method
		which enables us to obtain good enough solutions by using a very rough
		estimate function. One specific feature of the algorithm is that the look-ahead
		tree T¥ is not a subtree of T; the other is the culs-de-sac on trees T
		and T¥. When it reaches a cul-de-sac, the algorithm augments the tree with
		additional nodes. }
