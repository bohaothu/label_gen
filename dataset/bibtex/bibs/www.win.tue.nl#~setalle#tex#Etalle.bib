PSLTL allows the specification of several security properties including data freshness and different notions of authentication and secrecy. We give semantics and further propose a procedure to decide validity of properties for finite (albeit symbolic) execution traces, for a relevant subset (which includes the mentioned properties) of PS-LTL . Our procedure is easily integrated with constraint-based protocol analysis approaches. We also provide a Prolog implementation.}}

Architectures based on Parlay/OSA APIs allow third party service providers to develop new services that can access, in a controlled and secure way, to those network capabilities offered by the network operator. Role of the TSM protocol, run by network gateways, is to authenticate the client applications trying to access and use the network capabilities features offered. For this reason potential security flaws in its authentication strategy can bring to unauthorized use of network with evident damages to the operator and to the quality of the services. This paper shows how a rigorous formal analysis of TSM underlines serious weaknesses in the model describing its authentication procedure. This usually means that also the original system (i.e., the TSM protocol itself) hides the same flaws. The paper relates about the design activity of the formal model, the tool-aided verification performed and the security flaws discovered. This will allow us to discuss about how the security of the TSM protocol can be generally improved.}}

The confidentiality and integrity of the license or parts thereof can be assured with our protection scheme.

We work with the applied pi-calculus of Abadi and Fournet, in which the (new) adversary abilities are modelled as equations between terms. As case studies, we analyse the Encrypted Password Transmission (EPT) protocol of Halevi and Krawczyk, and the wellknown Encrypted Key (EKE) of Bellovin and Merritt. In the latter, we find an attack that arises when considering the ability of distinguishing ciphertexts from random noise. We propose a modification to EKE that prevents this attack.}}

In each case the model captures both the system of interest and its security policy. The model is then formally checked against a property that represents a principle from the problem domain. The model checking activity shows many examples of policies that are too weak to cope with mobility.}}

The mission of this paper is twofold: (1) to put a spotlight on these advantages, (2) at the same time justifying some of our design rationales in LicenseScript. We accomplish this by giving examples of licensing models that are greatly facilitated by the use of Prolog as a component of LicenseScript.

The contract rights granted by a copyright owner typically restrict the users' statutory rights that are endorsed by copyright laws. In particular, Fair Use allows these `unauthorized but not illegal' rights. Two technological reasons why fair use cannot be upheld: (1) the current XML-based rights expression language (REL) cannot capture user's statutory rights; and (2) the underlying architectures cannot support copyright enforcement. This paper focuses on the first problem and introduces a two-pronged approach: (1) rights assertion, to allow a user assert new rights to the license, i.e. freely express her rights under fair use; and (2) audit logging, to record the asserted rights and keep track of the copies rendered and distributed under fair use. We apply this approach in LicenseScript (a logic-based REL) to demonstrate how LicenseScript can approximate fair use easily.}}

	annote = {abstract We present a mechanism for securing group communications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). First, we derive an extension of Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH). Then we merge the extension with Directed Diffusion (DD). The resulting protocol, LKHW, combines the advantages of both LKH and DD. In particular, LKHW enforces both backward and forward secrecy, while incurring only limited overhead in terms of the number of messages required. This is the first security protocol that leverages DD, and it shows that such a paradigm is also viable for other applications than routing. Finally, a few new research directions that originate from this paper are discussed.}}

Tests are carried out with this prototype to analyse efficiency and timing aspects. As expected encryption and search times are linear in the size of the database. More interestingly they also depend on the parameters used in the protocol.}}

	annote = {abstract Current DRM systems do not provide flexible payment methods, requiring the user to handle the payment by hand. For instance, when the user needs to pay for watching a movie, she needs to decide which available payment method is the most optimal and suitable. This is a rather cumbersome process for the user that can be avoided by the specification of payment policies. A payment policy automates the payment process of each content usage, choosing the best alternative among the possible payment methods. We show how LicenseScript is able to model payment policies, allowing the user to precisely specify how a payment of content usage should be performed.}}

Our system features (1) a significantly more efficient implementation, (2) a monotonic behavior, which also allows to detect aws associated to partial runs and (3) a more expressive syntax, in which a principal may also perform explicit checks. We also show why these improvements yield a more effective and practical system.}}

We first briefly survey the state-of-the art of key deployment strategies that are amenable to ad-hoc network. Then we proposed two possible methods and we shortly investigate their space and computational complexity.}}

In our sequents we distinguish between the current knowledge of principals and the current global state of the session. Hereby, we can describe the operational semantics of principals and of an intruder in a simple and modular way. Furthermore, using proof theoretic tools like the analysis of permutability of rules, we are able to find efficient proof strategies that we prove complete for special classes of security protocols including Needham-Schroeder. Based on the results of this preliminary analysis, we have implemented a Prolog meta-interpreter which allows for rapid prototyping and for checking safety properties of security protocols, and we have applied it for finding error traces and proving correctness of practical examples.}}
