  ABSTRACT = {
    This report describes a scheduler synthesis for the memory interface card offered by Terma as a case study for the AMETIST consortium.
    A model of the system in the SMV modeling language is introduced. This model can be used to produce valid schedules for systems with
    small number of buffers. A method to synthesize an optimal (in terms of buffer sizes) scheduler for the full system is also given. The
    schedule is verified by the SMV model checker using the above- mentioned model. Some extensions to cards with other parameters are discussed.

  ABSTRACT = {
    LSCs is a formal graphical language originally proposed for software specifications. We show that LSCs provide natural modeling language for
    systems such as the smart-card personalization machine. LSCs is taken as an example of a scenario based specification language which enables
    better modeling procedure using the Play-In/Play-Out approach. We also demonstrate that it is possible to synthesize a scheduler with Smart
    Play-Out.
