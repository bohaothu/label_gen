  abstract =     "Size fair and homologous crossover genetic operators
                 for tree based genetic programming are described and
                 tested. Both produce considerably reduced increases in
                 program size and no detrimental effect on GP
                 performance. GP search spaces are partitioned by the
                 ridge in the number of program versus their size and
                 depth. A ramped uniform random initialisation is
                 described which straddles the ridge. With subtree
                 crossover trees increase about one level per generation
                 leading to sub-quadratic bloat in length.",
