the purest water available with photothermal deflection spectroscopy. 
Our spectrum exhibits an absorption minimum in the blue region of the
specturm that is deeper than in most previously documented pure-water
absorption studies.  We attribute this to exceptional sample purity and
our techniques's inherent freedom from scattering effects.  Because
the absorption minimum is significantly lower, our spectrum displays
high-order molecular resonance structure not observed in any previous
absorption studies to our knowledge.  We find the minimum in the
absorption specturm of pure water is 0.0062$\pm$0.0006\,m$^{-1}$ at
420\,nm and 25$^\circ$C.

                 from 25 to 450\,cm$^{-1}$ by classical absorption
                 techniques with an FTIR interferometer. From these
                 experimental spectr, the optical constants $n$ and $k$
                 were calculated by iteration using the Kramers-Kronig
                 transformation which has been especially adapted to the

                 sample in contact with highly refractive silicon
                 substrates. As the principal result, we show that this

                 constants $n$ and $k$ of liquid H$_2$O and D$_2$O in

                 comparison with earlier data for H$_2$O at 19$^\circ$C,
                 measured by dispersive FT spectrometry, shows very good
                 agreement. Further results are given concerning the
                 parameters of the FIR bands, namely the evolution of
                 band positions and band widths with temperature.
                 Analysis of the shape of the librational band led us to
                 suppose the existence of a second IR active component
                 of this band which has hitherto only been reported in
                 Raman and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra.
                 Finally, we confirm the different relaxation behavior
                 of H$_2$O and D$_2$O in the high temperature range
