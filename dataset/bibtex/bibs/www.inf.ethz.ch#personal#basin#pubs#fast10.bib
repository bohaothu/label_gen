  abstract	= {We consider two standard notions in formal security
		  protocol analysis: message deducibility and static
		  equivalence under equational theories. We present new
		  polynomial-time algorithms for deciding both notions under
		  subterm convergent equational theories and under a theory
		  representing symmetric encryption with the prefix property.
		  For these equational theories, polynomial-time algorithms
		  for the decision problems associated to both notions are
		  well-known (although this has not been proven for static
		  equivalence under the prefix theory). However, our
		  algorithms have a significantly better asymptotic
		  complexity than existing approaches.As an application, we
		  use our algorithm for static equivalence to discover
		  off-line guessing attacks on the Kerberos protocol when
		  implemented using a symmetric encryption scheme for which
		  the prefix property holds.},
