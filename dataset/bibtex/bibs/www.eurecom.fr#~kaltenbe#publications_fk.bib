	promises to increase the rate and reliability of data transmission.
	These gains were mostly demonstrated for ideal scenarios, where all
	nodes are perfectly synchronized. Considering a cooperative uplink
	scenario with asynchronous nodes, the system suffers from two effects:
	timing errors and individual carrier frequency offsets. In effect,
	timing errors can completely cancel the advantages introduced by
	space-time codes, while individual carrier frequency offsets provide
	a great challenge to receivers. Indeed, frequency offsets are perceived
	as a time-variant channel (even if the individual links are static)
	in distributed cooperative communications. We show that using OFDM,
	space-time codes (STCs) become tolerant to timing errors. Channel
	estimation and tracking takes care of frequency offsets. Our simulations
	demonstrate that the bit error rate performance improves by an order
	of magnitude, when using a cooperative system design, which takes
	these two effects into account.},
