      This paper presents an integrity maintenance system that has been
      developed for maintaining static constraints in databases, using
      the active database paradigm.  This system has been added to the
      O2 object oriented database system, and is fully functional.
      Constraints are specified by the user in a first order logic
      language, and transformed in production rules, which are stored in
      the database.  The rules are then used to maintain the
      corresponding set of constraints, for all applications that use
      the database, and which no longer need to worry about integrity
      control.  We extend previous work on constraint maintenance in two
      ways: our system can be used as a constraint maintenance layer on
      top of object-oriented, relational and nested relational
      databases; in the case of object-oriented systems, we provide
      constraint support not only in the case of object composition, but
      also consider inheritance and methods.
