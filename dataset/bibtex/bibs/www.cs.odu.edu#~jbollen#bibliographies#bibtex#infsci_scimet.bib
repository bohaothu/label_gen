@article{ipleve:davis2003,
title = {An {IP}-level Analysis of Usage Statistics for Electronic Journals in Chemistry Making Inferences about User Behavior},
author ={Philip M. Davis and Leah R. Solla},
year = 2003,
journal = {Journal of the {A}merican {S}ociety for {I}nformation {S}cience and {T}echnology},
volume = 54,
number = 11,
pages = {1062--1069},
abstract = {Davis and Solla study downloads of 29 ACS electronic journals at Cornell University during a three month period by individual IP addresses rather than unidentifiable individual users. Chemistry and Chemical Engineering accounted for 42% of downloads, followed by other Engineering departments at 12.5%, Medical College at 6.5%, Food Science at 4.9%, and Molecular Biology at 2.6%. Libraries accounted for 3.4% and the remote modem pool only 1.5%. Three percent of users downloaded more than 100 articles, 14% more than 20, and 38% downloaded 1 or 2 articles during the sample period. With the exception of two outliers, JACS and Biochemistry, the relationship between number of downloads and number of IP addresses is linear. A thousand downloads will lead to an expectation of 114 using addresses. The relationship between number of journals consulted and number of articles downloaded is quadratic and outliers are heavy users of one or two journals. Journals consulted per IP address seems to fit a Lotka distribution. The system appears to be used heavily for print on demand copies. }

@INPROCEEDINGS{mappin:wagner2004,

title = {Mapping global science using international co-authorships: a comparison of 1990 and 2000},
booktitle = {Ninth International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics},
year = 2003,
month = {August},
publisher = {ISSI},
abstract = {Using the Science Citation Index (CD-Rom version) for 1990 and 2000, this paper analyses international co-authorships. The paper presents the methodology for identifying these co-authorships. Analysis is presented on observed linkages at the global level and on regional bases. The architecture of the network is further explored using statistical methods and factor analysis to reveal intense relationships as well as the core members of a global network. Findings show that, in the 10 years between 1990 and 2000, the global network has expanded to include more nations and it has become more interconnected. Regional networks show emerging hubs. Within the global network, a core set of countries has expanded from six in 1990 to eight in 2000. Factor analysis suggests that large countries compete with each other for partners in the global network. We discuss implications for bpublic policy of the rise of a global network of scientists operating somewhat independently of national interests.},

journal = {Europhys. Lett.},
volume = 61,
number = 4,
pages = {567--572},
abstract = { A key ingredient of many current models proposed to capture the topological evolution of complex networks is the hypothesis that highly connected nodes increase their connectivity faster than their less connected peers, a phenomenon called preferential attachment. Measurements on four networks, namely the science citation network, Internet, actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree, offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment. We find that for the first two systems the attachment rate depends linearly on the node degree, while for the last two the dependence follows a sublinear power law.},
