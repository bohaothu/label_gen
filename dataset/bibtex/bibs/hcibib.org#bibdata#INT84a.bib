%X From the earliest days of computer systems it was realized that computers
were essentially tools to be used by people and that good human factors were an
essential part of system design.  In the early years the struggle to generate
reliable, low-cost hardware and software dominated the industry and human
factors played a minor role in computer science and technology.  In the past
decade, however, advances in vlsi and software engineering have made advanced
computer systems increasingly widely available and manufacturers have turned to
human factors for product differentiation.  In particular, human-computer
interface requirements have a dominant role in fifth generation computer
specifications.  This paper surveys the development of human-computer
interaction research from the 1940's through to the present day.  The goals and
expectations of the research, trends in the literature, the status of the
results, and the directions of future development, are discussed.

%X Some characteristics of the Information Age and the importance of human
factors issues are outlined.  Immediate questions for the next 7 years or so
are discussed, including 9 substantive areas needing research (from a recent
survey) and the development and better implementation of design procedures. 
Longer term questions discussed are -- the passing of paper, the reduction of
writing, the victory of voice, the wired society and the expert in the system.
Finally, some of the important broader issues are mentioned and the need for
synergy by human and information engineers is emphasised.

%X Based on the premise that people demonstrate a considerable degree of
competence at formulating and achieving goals in the world, this paper seeks to
identify and examine the relationship between the crucial characteristics of
the real world and inherent or acquired human skills that support this
competence, in order to improve the human computer interface.  Aspects examined
include a "naive physics" of computing and the reconstruction of
propositionally held information.

%X A method for classifying computer users on a large number of variables was
developed and tested.  The method was based on cluster analysis and yielded
seven groups of users and non-users.  Volunteers from each group used a
computer program which allowed them to choose among three modes of interaction:
prompts, commands and form-filling.
   Overall, people preferred the prompts and the form, but used the prompts the
most.  People with the most use and knowledge of computers used the commands
more than the other groups.  Discussion focuses on the hypothesis that naive
users prefer a system-driven mode of interaction, while experienced users
prefer a user-driven mode.

%X Human conversations are complex interactions motivated by both task-related
and social goals.  It is proposed that the optimal form of conversational
interaction with a computer is a computer conversation which closely emulates
the nature of a human conversation in similar circumstances.  The cultural
differences between computer conversations and human conversations are
identified, and it is suggested how the crucial social factors in human
conversation could be integrated into a conversational model of computer
interaction, structured by the need to achieve mutual goals.

%X Recent studies in computer human factors indicate that novice learners of
office systems are "active", preferring self-initiated problem solving to rote
drill and practice as a learning strategy.  But in high-function systems users
may need help in exploring basic functions without being distracted by advanced
material.  Two experimental approaches to this problem are outlined: The
MINIMAL MANUAL attempts to support active learning by providing concise
instruction focussed on easy-to-understand goals.  The TRAINING WHEELS WORD
PROCESSOR encourages exploration of basic functions by disabling the more
advanced functions that can distract and confuse novices.

%X An important question for designers of text-editing systems is the use to
which the systems are put by experienced users.  Most systems provide a range
of function from basic to very advanced, yet their designers typically do not
know whether users ultimately make use of the full range of function, or indeed
whether they develop effective use of even the most basic function.  In the
present work, survey and automatic monitoring methodologies were combined to
study experienced editor users.  The two methods provided converging evidence
that not all users learn to exploit a system's facilities simply through
continued experience with the system.  Many time-saving strategies (e.g.,
assignment and use of program function keys) were associated with job type and
with prior experience on other editing systems.  The implications of the
results for the design of editors are discussed.

%X The use of text-editors for writing original text has been little studied
despite the importance of the task.  A study conducted by Gould found that the
composition rate of writers using a text editor was more than 50% slower than
the same writers writing by hand.  We show that the source of the slowness is
the design of the text editor and that using a display-oriented editor writers
can write as fast and good typists faster than by hand.  Like Gould, there was
no quality difference based on the source of the letters and users of the text
editor made many more modifications.  Fewer than half of the modifications
users made actually improved the text.

performance both at VDT and paper-pencil system.  The result confirmed the
performance is still considerably low compared to the paper-pencil system.  The
difference is larger for the task of the higher work load.  The measure of
performance defined in this paper may be used as the objective of improving
devices.

%X This paper reports the results of a field survey of visual discomfort
amongst 192 subjects divided into 4 occupational groups.  Each subject was
studied over the 5 consecutive days of a working week.  Pre-work and post-work
recordings of subjective symptoms were made on each day and of objective
measures of visual function on 2 days.  It was intended that the four groups
comprise two matched pairs of 'VDU-users' and 'non-VDU users'.  Post hoc
analysis showed that one of the two pair of groups could be considered thus. 
No significant differences were found between the 'VDU user' group and the
'non-VDU user' group in terms of subjectively reported visual discomfort or
objective measures of visual function.

illusions, tired eyes, headaches and seizures.  The stimulation responsible for
these effects is quite specific and includes that from televisions and text.

%X At the present time many organisations are changing from centralised
time-sharing computing to distributed office information workstations.  There
are technological advantages, but there is also felt to be a very significant
advantage in placing computers under local and personal control.  Experience
with three such situations unfortunately shows that in organisations with
shared information there is a need for central data control which can make such
local autonomy infeasible.  The difficulties, and a possible future resolution,
are discussed.

visual attention required for the operation of computers by the
electrophysiological methods of brain waves, and the auditory evoked response
of the electroencephalogram.
   The VDT work-load as an example of computer-work will be made clear by an

%X A music editor is described which requires no typing and which has been used
successfully by children as young as three years of age.  No syntax errors are
possible, and all input methods are intuitive -- stroking, pointing, dragging
and circling, for example.  Commands (such as move, delete or copy) are not
specified by words, but are conveyed by gesture; (for instance, in order to
delete an item, the user merely circles it and pushes it off the screen)
   Throughout the programs, the auditory, visual and kinesthetic modalities are
employed either simultaneously or in immediate proximity, thereby reinforcing
the intuitive nature of the interface.  Alternative user-models of interaction
are supported.  The techniques presented form the basis of a computerised
Learning Environment for music and a User-Interface Management System.

for computer entry or direct output.  The Pitman shorthand notation is compared
to a machinography or machine compatible script and the recognition problems
associated with handwritten shorthand are discussed.  The requirements of a

are described and the preprocessing techniques which have been usefully applied
to the raw data are outlined.

from a shorthand machine, and converts it into a Draft Transcript.  This draft
transcript needs to be edited to perfection using word processing techniques. 
A suite of programmes has been written which takes advantage of the particular
characteristics of Palantype transcripts to provide a very efficient editing
environment.  The editor adapts to the user in a way which improves his
efficiency without an overhead of the necessity to learn complex control
structures.  Some of these facilities are also appropriate to a standard word

%X Conventional CRT displays give only a two dimensional representation of
three dimensional objects which means that depth information can be presented
only indirectly, using such techniques as hidden line removal, shading and
object rotation. Improved perception of 3D images is possible by presenting to
the viewer a stereoscopic pair of two-dimensional images.  To be truly
effective, the image presented by a stereoscopic display should change as the
viewing point moves.  Such a system requires a knowledge of the user's head
position and orientation in order to compute the view to be presented to each
eye.  The paper describes an approach to a system of this type.

that performance differences were minimal across a variety of devices for
different types of users (novice and experienced).  There were, however, some
distinct preference differences exhibited by the two user groups.  Novices
strongly favoured a simple minimal-function keypad, whereas subjects trained to
a high level of Telidon proficiency preferred the perceived functionality of a
full-sized keyboard, even though it did not lead to improved performance.

compatibility between input operation and system's response.  The task was the
correction of typing errors in a letter already prepared on a word processor. 
After positioning the cursor on the erroneous character with one of the six
locators light pen, graphic tablet, mouse, tracking ball, cursor keys, and
speech recognizer, it had to be replaced by the right character with one of the
two correctors a-keyboard and speech recognizer.  Concerning the locators the
results corresponded roughly to the degree of compatibility with voice input as
the slowest and light pen as the fastest device.  There were no essential
differences between correctors.

%X We discuss an activity of typists' brains during touch typing, based on
knowledge of experimental psychology and cerebral physiology, especially in
connection with the functional lateralization of cerebral hemispheres.  Our
hypothesis is that a skilled copy typist depends heavily on the cortical reflex
in response to direct visual information from a manuscript, but depends less on
the linguistic facility of the left hemisphere.  As an indication of the
validity of the hypothesis, we report our results of the measurements of
typists' electroencephalograms (EEG) during Japanese touch typing.  Our
findings are preliminary but they are compatible with the hypothesis.

%X The allocation of tasks between human and computer, and the merits of a
dynamic approach to this allocation are discussed.  Dynamic task allocation
requires efficient human-computer communication.  This communication may be
accomplished in an implicit or explicit manner.  A conceptual framework for the
study of explicit human-computer communication is introduced and a study
exemplifying the use of the framework is presented.  This study investigated
the effects of two input media and four task allocation strategies on the
performance of a human-computer system.  The task environment represented a
simplified version of an air traffic control scenario wherein computer aid
could be evoked by the human to accomplish task sharing between the human and
the computer.

automatic speech recognition in television subtitle preparation.  Analysis of
the subtitling task indicated that the principal benefits were likely to be
obtained in spoken entry of subtitle 'style' commands.  However, off-line
subtitling trials showed that use of speech recognition increased preparation
time by 9%.  Speech input significantly reduced the time spent transferring
between text and style entry but increased the time spent in other activities.
The error rate for style entry by keypad was consistent and averaged 5% whereas
speech recognition errors ranged from 5% to 15%.  A valid comparison of the two
modes of entry can, however, only be made with subjects having as much
experience of voice entry of data as they have of keying.

may be encountered when using simple speech recognition systems in industrial
applications.  An experiment compared a voice recogniser with a keyboard, as
the destination input device in a parcel sorting task.  The task was
represented first by a simple laboratory simulation of the coding sub-task, and
then by an authentic simulation using real parcels on a sorting rig.  Results
showed that voice input may be quite unsuitable for tasks having little or no
manual content.  Also, for tasks requiring precise sequencing of operations,
voice may offer inadequate intrinsic timing feedback.  Finally, a practical
means of empirical vocabulary optimisation is described.

%X Voice is becoming a more common mode of communication between man and
machine.  We have previously shown that computer-naive users naturally adapt
the way that they ask questions in an information retrieval task when they
think that they are addressing a computer system, as opposed to a human (3). 
The present study investigates how the content of the messages with which the
computer system initially addresses the user can further encourage behaviour
that would be potentially useful for enabling automatic speech recognition and
analysis.  Elements of 'politeness' and 'explicitness' in the system's initial
message were varied, and the regularity and conciseness with which users
responded was studied.  Several aspects of users' behaviour were found to be
affected, and age and learning effects were also observed.

%X Recent advances in linguistics, speech science, psychology, and especially
in computers have made unlimited text-to-speech conversion systems a practical
reality.  However, the use of audio output from a computer poses special
problems in ergonomics, most of which have not been dealt with in the
literature.  In this paper, we review relevant findings in the literature and
recent work in our own laboratory.  We then provide some guidelines for good
human factors in applications that use speech synthesis.  These guidelines
address both the process of development and suggestions for the end-product. 
The latter must be considered highly tentative due to the nascent nature of
this research area.

%X Access to conventional data services typically involves the use of a
standard keyboard terminal over a data network.  This paper discusses our
experiments at BNR in using speech as an alternative.  We used a text messaging
service as the vehicle for our experiments to investigate the interaction
between humans and computers over the telephone, voice network using the
telephone as a terminal.  In our experiments, presentation to the user is
accomplished using speech synthesis and user input is effected with DTMF (Dual
Tone Multi-Frequency) signaling.

%X In recent years the use of speech as a man-machine interface has received
considerable prominence.  A number of systems have been developed which use
speech output from machines, and speech input has been introduced in a small
number of cases with rather less effectiveness.  In those cases where it is
impracticable to look at a display, or the hands are fully occupied, speech has
obvious advantages, but often a major justification for the use of speech has
been that is the 'natural' method of communication for man, and therefore must
be the optimum solution.  This contention, however, is a simplification of the
situation, and, in general, much greater thought must be given to the choice of
modality of input-output means than is implicit in justifications of this
nature.

%X In recent years a number of systems have used windows as the basis for
advanced user interfaces.  Yet how exactly users benefit from windows or what
features of windows are important for design is neither understood nor has it
been studied.  Current window designs are given a simple classification.  Seven
functional uses that have been identified for windows are described.  The
Window Working Set concept based on operating system theory is introduced for
the analysis of space constraints on window use.

%X A generic command is one which is recognized in all contexts of a computer
system; examples from the Xerox 8010 Star system are move, copy, and delete. 
They may be viewed as extremely general actions which make minimal assumptions
about their objects, the particular interpretation of the commands depending on
the contexts in which they are issued and the nature of the objects to which
they are applied.  Of the several tradeoffs involved in using generic commands,
the primary one concerns having to design the objects in the system so as to
efficiently use them.

%X The suitability of videotex (VT) for supporting transactional services
(including shopping) was assessed, firstly by relating VT technology to a model
of transaction processing.  Expectations regarding suitability were generally
confirmed by an observational study in which naive subjects ordered goods via
two different systems.  Further assessment involved analysis of user
difficulties and errors.  These were used to identify variables affecting
performance and were modelled in terms of a mismatch between a naive user's
incomplete representation of the system and inappropriate representations which
interfere with task performance.

%X Recent research using statistical data and models has suggested that
information systems with many different and not necessarily unique names for
each system object will dramatically increase the likelihood of finding a
target object over more standard retrieval systems in which each object has
only one or a few names.  In the current experiment this conclusion was
supported by observations of people using actual information systems to
retrieve target objects.  In addition, those people using systems with richly
indexed vocabularies needed slightly fewer, rather than more, key-word entries
to find a given target object.

%X The total time required for retrieving information from large data bases has
two components: (1) the time spent entering the retrieval request and (2) the
time spent evaluating all of the output that matches the request.  There is an
inverse relationship between these two components.  This study assessed the
particulars of this data-entry/output-evaluation trade off in the context of
Directory Assistance.  Results argue strongly that total retrieval time is
reduced when output evaluation time is reduced even at the expense of increased
data entry time.

%X In this paper we describe a promising technique for studying human-machine
interaction (HMI) called Constructive Interaction.  We describe two pilot
studies from a set which explore its application to HMI.  Constructive
Interaction was developed by Naomi Miyake (Miyake, 1982).  It consists
essentially of recording sessions with two participants who are discussing some
topic which they do not fully understand, in the hope of sharing their
knowledge and arriving at a fuller understanding.  Miyake was interested in
what was revealed about the underlying schemas of the participants and how new
schemas can originate in an interaction between two people.  We are interested
in what this basic situation can offer for the study of HMI.

%X A logic modelling system for modelling descriptions of any kind of thing is
described.  The system employs a symbolic representational structure that
permits integration of graphical and textual parts of descriptions, offering
these as alternative means for depicting the same information.  The goal is to
represent knowledge about drawings and words in computers in a way that will
enable a computer to interpret intended meaning from human interactions, to
understand what people want it to know and do.

%X Social planning is part of a process of arbitration.  Empiricism is sought
as a means of reaching a decision even if not consensus.  This paper argues
that the prevailing rule-based approach to the production of statistical
evidence can confuse as much as clarify social issues.  A graphical information
system, based on Advanced Information Technology, can expedite concept
refinement in complex problems, wherein the underlying assumptions remain
implicit and vague rather than explicitly articulated.  However, this calls for
changes in both the framework for and form of human-computer interaction in
computer cartography.

%X An experiment is reported in which users learned how to operate a
"laboratory" system for handling electronic mail.  Two variables were
manipulated.  Users were asked to learn one of two task structures involving
eight operations.  In one form the task was structured into a sequence of four
pairs of semantically related operations (4x2).  In the other, operations were
structured into two groups of four on the basis of their abstract class.  Two
sets of command names were employed one being less discriminable than the
other.  Both variables were found to influence the ways in which users learned
the system.  The results suggested that users of the 4x2 structure were
constructing mental representations in which individual operations were more
semantically integrated than users of the 2x4 grouped structure.

%X An experiment is reported in which subjects previously naive to text editing
are asked to generate abbreviations for a set of editing commands.  We
manipulated the degree of the subjects' experience with the editing task prior
to the point at which they were asked to produce the abbreviations.  We found
effects of experience on both the length and the form of the abbreviations
produced, with more experienced subjects inclined toward shorter abbreviations
and, independently, toward truncation as an abbreviation scheme.  We conclude
that experimental paradigms previously used to investigate naming and
abbreviation may have encouraged subjects to construe their task falsely as one
in which they would be using abbreviations to reconstruct referent names,
whereas the actual task involved recalling the abbreviation given recall of the
referent object or its name.

%X Effective office automation must support integration between different areas
of application, enhance the users' understanding of the system and its
potential, and encourage them to develop their own applications on the basis of
that understanding.  Thus the design of the interface cannot assume a fixed
prior classification of users and of applications with certain users being
adequately served by hiding most of the facilities behind a restricted menu.
   The degree and kind of protection to be afforded to users requires careful
attention, if the motivation for user growth is be sustained.  Human beings
have security needs, implying requirements for protection, but also needs to
explore and to realise their potential, implying requirements for freedom.  At
different times, users will require a greater or lesser degree of protection.
   The Unix concept of a command language as a set of software tools, provides
the elements from which can be developed an interface that allows for user
growth albeit that Unix as it stands is perceived as user-friendly only by
professional programmers.  This paper outlines the development of a set of Unix
commands for office applications, designed to allow the user to gain confidence
in the use of the system.  Illustrative examples are given of problems in the
original Unix commands and of the solutions implemented.

%X Recall measures are often used in the area of human computer communication
as a quick means of obtaining an index of the 'goodness' of alternative command
sets.  However there is a rich assortment of additional information available
to mediate use of an on-line system, which is absent in conditions under which
recall is typically elicited.  The present paper reviews a number of
experiments in which both on-line performance and recall measures are
available, with a view to determining the extent to which recall can be used to
explore the user's representation of the computer system in interactive
performance.  In addition, it relates the phenomena observed to established
findings from the psychological study of memory.
